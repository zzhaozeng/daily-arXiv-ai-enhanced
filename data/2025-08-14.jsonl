These agents address the limitations of their parametric memory by\ndynamically gathering relevant facts to address complex reasoning tasks.\nHowever, existing approaches suffer from a fundamental architectural\nlimitation: they process search queries strictly sequentially, even when\nhandling inherently parallelizable and logically independent comparisons. This\nsequential bottleneck significantly constrains computational efficiency,\nparticularly for queries that require multiple entity comparisons. To address\nthis critical limitation, we propose ParallelSearch, a novel reinforcement\nlearning framework that empowers large language models (LLMs) to recognize\nparallelizable query structures and execute multiple search operations\nconcurrently.

To address this, we propose a novel\nself-evolve framework, EvoCurr, in which a dedicated curriculum-generation LLM\nconstructs a sequence of problem instances with gradually increasing\ndifficulty, tailored to the solver LLM's learning progress. The curriculum\ndynamically adapts easing challenges when the solver struggles and escalating\nthem when success is consistent, thus maintaining an optimal learning\ntrajectory. This approach enables the solver LLM, implemented as a\ncode-generation model producing Python decision-tree scripts, to progressively\nacquire the skills needed for complex decision-making tasks. Experimental\nresults on challenging decision-making benchmarks show that our method\nsignificantly improves task success rates and solution efficiency compared to\ndirect-solving baselines. These findings suggest that LLM-driven curriculum\nlearning holds strong potential for enhancing automated reasoning in\nreal-world, high-complexity domains."}

We categorize these datasets by mental\ndisorders (e.g., depression, schizophrenia), data modalities (e.g., text,\nspeech, physiological signals), task types (e.g., diagnosis prediction, symptom\nseverity estimation, intervention generation), accessibility (public,\nrestricted or private), and sociocultural context (e.g., language and cultural\nbackground). Along with these, we also investigate synthetic clinical mental\nhealth datasets. Our survey identifies critical gaps such as a lack of\nlongitudinal data, limited cultural and linguistic representation, inconsistent\ncollection and annotation standards, and a lack of modalities in synthetic\ndata. We conclude by outlining key challenges in curating and standardizing\nfuture datasets and provide actionable recommendations to facilitate the\ndevelopment of more robust, generalizable, and equitable mental health AI\nsystems."}

However, security issues in visual\ngrounding tasks for VLMs remain underexplored, especially in the context of\nbackdoor attacks. In this paper, we introduce a novel input-aware backdoor\nattack method, IAG, designed to manipulate the grounding behavior of VLMs. This\nattack forces the model to ground a specific target object in the input image,\nregardless of the user's query. We propose an adaptive trigger generator that\nembeds the semantic information of the attack target's description into the\noriginal image using a text-conditional U-Net, thereby overcoming the\nopen-vocabulary attack challenge. To ensure the attack's stealthiness, we\nutilize a reconstruction loss to minimize visual discrepancies between poisoned\nand clean images. Additionally, we introduce a unified method for generating\nattack data. IAG is evaluated theoretically and empirically, demonstrating its\nfeasibility and effectiveness.

Although recent\ndeep learning-based docking surpasses traditional methods in speed and\naccuracy, many approaches rely on graph representations and language\nmodel-inspired encoders while neglecting critical geometric information,\nresulting in inaccurate pocket localization and unrealistic binding\nconformations. In this study, we introduce CWFBind, a weighted, fast, and\naccurate docking method based on local curvature features.

For each subregion, we compute Betti0, Betti1, and their\nratio using a recent algorithm for homology groups in 2D digital images.

In this work,\nwe propose FaME, a training-free and inference-efficient method for improving\nperceptual quality. FaME uses an image quality assessment model to identify\nlow-quality generations and stores their sampling trajectories. These failure\nmodes are then used as negative guidance to steer future sampling away from\npoor-quality regions.

This issue is particularly\nprevalent in complex real-world scenes, where the true number of planes is\nunknown and multiple planes coexist. In this paper, we aim to address this\nlimitation by proposing a generalised framework for plane detection based on\nmodel information optimization. Building on previous works, we treat the\nobserved depth readings as discrete random variables, with their probability\ndistributions constrained by the ground truth planes. Various models containing\ndifferent candidate plane constraints are then generated through repeated\nrandom sub-sampling to explain our observations. By incorporating the physics\nand noise model of the depth sensor, we can calculate the information for each\nmodel, and the model with the least information is accepted as the most likely\nground truth. This information optimization process serves as an objective\nmechanism for determining the true number of planes and preventing false\npositive detections. Additionally, the quality of each detected plane can be\nranked by summing the information reduction of inlier points for each plane. We\nvalidate these properties through experiments with synthetic data and find that\nour algorithm estimates plane parameters more accurately compared to the\ndefault Open3D RANSAC plane segmentation.

However, transposed convolution (a.k.a. deconvolution) does\nnot serve as a true inverse of convolution due to inherent differences in their\nmathematical formulations. To date, no reverse convolution operator has been\nestablished as a standard component in neural architectures. In this paper, we\npropose a novel depthwise reverse convolution operator as an initial attempt to\neffectively reverse depthwise convolution by formulating and solving a\nregularized least-squares optimization problem. We thoroughly investigate its\nkernel initialization, padding strategies, and other critical aspects to ensure\nits effective implementation. Building upon this operator, we further construct\na reverse convolution block by combining it with layer normalization,\n1$\\times$1 convolution, and GELU activation, forming a Transformer-like\nstructure. The proposed operator and block can directly replace conventional\nconvolution and transposed convolution layers in existing architectures,\nleading to the development of ConverseNet. Corresponding to typical image\nrestoration models such as DnCNN, SRResNet and USRNet, we train three variants\nof ConverseNet for Gaussian denoising, super-resolution and deblurring,\nrespectively.

PERSONA leverages a diffusion-based approach to generate\npose-rich videos from the input image and optimizes a 3D avatar based on them.\nTo ensure high authenticity and sharp renderings across diverse poses, we\nintroduce balanced sampling and geometry-weighted optimization. Balanced\nsampling oversamples the input image to mitigate identity shifts in\ndiffusion-generated training videos. Geometry-weighted optimization prioritizes\ngeometry constraints over image loss, preserving rendering quality in diverse\nposes."}

To address\nthese issues, recent works have proposed training-free compression methods.\nHowever, existing efforts often suffer from three major limitations: (1)\nCurrent approaches do not decompose techniques into comparable modules,\nhindering fair evaluation across spatial and temporal redundancy. (2)\nEvaluation confined to simple single-turn tasks, failing to reflect performance\nin realistic scenarios.

LLMC+ supports over 20 algorithms across five\nrepresentative VLM families and enables systematic study of token-level and\nmodel-level compression. Our benchmark reveals that: (1) Spatial and temporal\nredundancies demand distinct technical strategies. (2) Token reduction methods\ndegrade significantly in multi-turn dialogue and detail-sensitive tasks. (3)\nCombining token and model compression achieves extreme compression with minimal\nperformance loss. We believe LLMC+ will facilitate fair evaluation and inspire\nfuture research in efficient VLM.

Existing methods narrowly focus on subject\nidentity, overlooking key aspects of visual storytelling such as spatial\ncomposition, background evolution, and narrative pacing. To address this, we\nintroduce a lightweight consistency framework composed of two components:\nLatent Panel Anchoring, which preserves a shared character reference across\npanels, and Reciprocal Attention Value Mixing, which softly blends visual\nfeatures between token pairs with strong reciprocal attention. Together, these\nmechanisms enhance coherence without architectural changes or fine-tuning,\nenabling state-of-the-art diffusion models to generate visually diverse yet\nconsistent storyboards. To structure generation, we use an off-the-shelf\nlanguage model to convert free-form stories into grounded panel-level prompts.\nTo evaluate, we propose the Rich Storyboard Benchmark, a suite of open-domain\nnarratives designed to assess layout diversity and background-grounded\nstorytelling, in addition to consistency. We also introduce a new Scene\nDiversity metric that quantifies spatial and pose variation across storyboards.\nOur qualitative and quantitative results, as well as a user study, show that\nStory2Board produces more dynamic, coherent, and narratively engaging\nstoryboards than existing baselines."}

However, a key question\nremains: given that real-world image datasets already constitute a natural\nsource of high-quality data, why should we use GPT-4o-generated synthetic data?\nIn this work, we identify two key advantages of synthetic images. First, they\ncan complement rare scenarios in real-world datasets, such as surreal fantasy\nor multi-reference image generation, which frequently occur in user queries.\nSecond, they provide clean and controllable supervision. Real-world data often\ncontains complex background noise and inherent misalignment between text\ndescriptions and image content, whereas synthetic images offer pure backgrounds\nand long-tailed supervision signals, facilitating more accurate text-to-image\nalignment. Building on these insights, we introduce Echo-4o-Image, a 180K-scale\nsynthetic dataset generated by GPT-4o, harnessing the power of synthetic image\ndata to address blind spots in real-world coverage. Using this dataset, we\nfine-tune the unified multimodal generation baseline Bagel to obtain Echo-4o.\nIn addition, we propose two new evaluation benchmarks for a more accurate and\nchallenging assessment of image generation capabilities: GenEval++, which\nincreases instruction complexity to mitigate score saturation, and\nImagine-Bench, which focuses on evaluating both the understanding and\ngeneration of imaginative content. Echo-4o demonstrates strong performance\nacross standard benchmarks. Moreover, applying Echo-4o-Image to other\nfoundation models (e.g., OmniGen2, BLIP3-o) yields consistent performance gains\nacross multiple metrics, highlighting the datasets strong transferability."}
