Recent advances in image-to-3D models enable the\ncreation of animations directly from user-hand drawings. Distinguished from\nconventional 3D animation, drawing-based 3D animation is crucial to preserve\nartist's unique style properties, such as rough contours and distinct stroke\npatterns. However, recent methods still exhibit quality deterioration in style\nproperties, especially under occlusions caused by overlapping body parts,\nleading to contour flickering and stroke blurring. This occurs due to a\n`stylization pose gap' between training and inference in stylization networks\ndesigned to preserve drawing styles in drawing-based 3D animation systems. The\nstylization pose gap denotes that input target poses used to train the\nstylization network are always in occlusion-free poses, while target poses\nencountered in an inference include diverse occlusions under dynamic motions.\nTo this end, we propose Occlusion-robust Stylization Framework (OSF) for\ndrawing-based 3D animation. We found that while employing object's edge can be\neffective input prior for guiding stylization, it becomes notably inaccurate\nwhen occlusions occur at inference. Thus, our proposed OSF provides\nocclusion-robust edge guidance for stylization network using optical flow,\nensuring a consistent stylization even under occlusions. Furthermore, OSF\noperates in a single run instead of the previous two-stage method, achieving\n2.4x faster inference and 2.1x less memory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aOSF\u7684\u906e\u6321\u9c81\u68d2\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed8\u56fe\u76843D\u52a8\u753b\u4e2d\u56e0\u906e\u6321\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed8\u56fe\u76843D\u52a8\u753b\u65f6\uff0c\u56e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\uff08\u906e\u6321\u95ee\u9898\uff09\u5bfc\u81f4\u98ce\u683c\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u5982\u7c97\u7cd9\u8f6e\u5ed3\u548c\u72ec\u7279\u7b14\u89e6\uff09\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u52a8\u753b\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faOSF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5149\u6d41\u63d0\u4f9b\u906e\u6321\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u98ce\u683c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u91c7\u7528\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "OSF\u5728\u906e\u6321\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u98ce\u683c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53472.4\u500d\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u51cf\u5c112.1\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "OSF\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed8\u56fe\u76843D\u52a8\u753b\u4e2d\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

In contrast, we humans can not only naturally identify the\nsemantic categories of sounding sources but also determine their deeply encoded\nspatial attributes, including locations and movement directions. This useful\ninformation can be elucidated by considering specific spatial indicators\nderived from the inherent physical properties of sound, such as loudness or\nfrequency. As prior methods largely ignore this factor, we present SpA2V, the\nfirst framework explicitly exploits these spatial auditory cues from audios to\ngenerate videos with high semantic and spatial correspondence.

We demonstrate, via both\nsimulations and real captures, that PPC-based 3D inference methods outperform\nseveral baselines using LiDAR as well as camera-LiDAR fusion models, across\nchallenging indoor and outdoor scenarios involving small, distant, and\nlow-albedo objects, as well as strong ambient light.\n  Our project webpage is at https://bhavyagoyal.github.io/ppc .", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u6982\u7387\u70b9\u4e91\uff08PPC\uff09\u7684\u65b03D\u573a\u666f\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u70b9\u6dfb\u52a0\u6982\u7387\u5c5e\u6027\u6765\u5c01\u88c5\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u53473D\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3LiDAR\u5728\u8fdc\u8ddd\u79bb\u6216\u4f4e\u53cd\u5c04\u7387\u7269\u4f53\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u7a00\u758f\u6216\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u70b9\u4e91\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bef\u5dee\u4f1a\u4f20\u64ad\u5230\u4e0b\u6e38\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u4f20\u7edf3D\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\u672a\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u59cb\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPPC\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u70b9\u6dfb\u52a0\u6982\u7387\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8ePPC\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u5757\u96c6\u6210\u52303D\u63a8\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6355\u83b7\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cPPC\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5ba4\u5185\u5916\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8eLiDAR\u548c\u76f8\u673a-LiDAR\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5c0f\u3001\u8fdc\u3001\u4f4e\u53cd\u5c04\u7387\u7269\u4f53\u53ca\u5f3a\u73af\u5883\u5149\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "PPC\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u6311\u6218\u6027\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

They are often biased,\nunreliable, and unfit to define \"ground truth.\" Yet, given the surging need to\nproduce large amounts of training data in educational applications using AI,\ntraditional inter-rater reliability (IRR) metrics like Cohen's kappa remain\ncentral to validating labeled data. IRR remains a cornerstone of many machine\nlearning pipelines for educational data. Take, for example, the classification\nof tutors' moves in dialogues or labeling open responses in machine-graded\nassessments. This position paper argues that overreliance on human IRR as a\ngatekeeper for annotation quality hampers progress in classifying data in ways\nthat are valid and predictive in relation to improving learning. To address\nthis issue, we highlight five examples of complementary evaluation methods,\nsuch as multi-label annotation schemes, expert-based approaches, and\nclose-the-loop validity. We argue that these approaches are in a better\nposition to produce training data and subsequent models that produce improved\nstudent learning and more actionable insights than IRR approaches alone.

Licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0", "summary": "In recent years, written language, particularly in science and education, has\nundergone remarkable shifts in word usage. These changes are widely attributed\nto the growing influence of Large Language Models (LLMs), which frequently rely\non a distinct lexical style. Divergences between model output and target\naudience norms can be viewed as a form of misalignment. While these shifts are\noften linked to using Artificial Intelligence (AI) directly as a tool to\ngenerate text, it remains unclear whether the changes reflect broader changes\nin the human language system itself. To explore this question, we constructed a\ndataset of 22.1 million words from unscripted spoken language drawn from\nconversational science and technology podcasts. We analyzed lexical trends\nbefore and after ChatGPT's release in 2022, focusing on commonly LLM-associated\nwords. Our results show a moderate yet significant increase in the usage of\nthese words post-2022, suggesting a convergence between human word choices and\nLLM-associated patterns. In contrast, baseline synonym words exhibit no\nsignificant directional shift. Given the short time frame and the number of\nwords affected, this may indicate the onset of a remarkable shift in language\nuse. Whether this represents natural language change or a novel shift driven by\nAI exposure remains an open question. Similarly, although the shifts may stem\nfrom broader adoption patterns, it may also be that upstream training\nmisalignments ultimately contribute to changes in human language use. These\nfindings parallel ethical concerns that misaligned models may shape social and\nmoral beliefs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bed\u8a00\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b02022\u5e74\u540e\u4eba\u7c7b\u53e3\u8bed\u4e2d\u4e0eLLM\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u4f7f\u7528\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u63a2\u7a76LLMs\u662f\u5426\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5de5\u5177\u5f71\u54cd\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u53d1\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bed\u8a00\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u67902022\u5e74\u524d\u540e\u76842200\u4e07\u5355\u8bcd\u53e3\u8bed\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83LLM\u76f8\u5173\u8bcd\u6c47\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c2022\u5e74\u540eLLM\u76f8\u5173\u8bcd\u6c47\u4f7f\u7528\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u7ebf\u540c\u4e49\u8bcd\u65e0\u660e\u663e\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u6807\u5fd7\u7740\u8bed\u8a00\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u53d8\u5316\u662f\u5426\u7531AI\u9a71\u52a8\u6216\u81ea\u7136\u6f14\u53d8\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002"}}

Despite their potential, existing work faces challenges\nwhen deploying LLMs in agent-based environments. The widely adopted agent\nparadigm ReAct centers on integrating single-step reasoning with immediate\naction execution, which limits its effectiveness in complex tasks requiring\nlong-term strategic planning. Furthermore, the coordination between the planner\nand executor during problem-solving is also a critical factor to consider in\nagent design. Additionally, current approaches predominantly rely on supervised\nfine-tuning, which often leads models to memorize established task completion\ntrajectories, thereby restricting their generalization ability when confronted\nwith novel problem contexts. To address these challenges, we introduce an\nadaptive global plan-based agent paradigm AdaPlan, aiming to synergize\nhigh-level explicit guidance with execution to support effective long-horizon\ndecision-making. Based on the proposed paradigm, we further put forward\nPilotRL, a global planning-guided training framework for LLM agents driven by\nprogressive reinforcement learning.

Traditional convolutional neural network has limitations in\ndealing with long-range dependencies and are unable to fully model the global\ncontextual information in depth maps. Although transformer can model global\ndependencies, its computational complexity and memory consumption are\nquadratic, which significantly limits its ability to process high-resolution\ndepth maps. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale fusion U-shaped Mamba\n(MSF-UM) model, a novel guided depth map super-resolution framework. The core\ninnovation of this model is to integrate Mamba's efficient state-space modeling\ncapabilities into a multi-scale U-shaped fusion structure guided by a color\nimage. The structure combining the residual dense channel attention block and\nthe Mamba state space module is designed, which combines the local feature\nextraction capability of the convolutional layer with the modeling advantage of\nthe state space model for long-distance dependencies. At the same time, the\nmodel adopts a multi-scale cross-modal fusion strategy to make full use of the\nhigh-frequency texture information from the color image to guide the\nsuper-resolution process of the depth map. Compared with existing mainstream\nmethods, the proposed MSF-UM significantly reduces the number of model\nparameters while achieving better reconstruction accuracy.

Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements over\nprevious state-of-the-art methods, achieving performance gains of 1.89 to\n31.78% in multi-view mIoU, while maintaining superior computational efficiency.\nTo address the limitations of current benchmarks (single-object focus,\ninconsistent 3D evaluation, small scale, and partial coverage), we present\nDesktopObjects-360, a novel comprehensive dataset for 3D segmentation in\nradiance fields, featuring: (1) complex multi-object scenes, (2) globally\nconsistent 2D annotations, (3) large-scale training data (over 27 thousand 2D\nmasks), (4) full 360{\\deg} coverage, and (5) 3D evaluation masks.", "AI": {"tldr": "PointGauss\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u70b9\u4e91\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\u8868\u793a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u65483D\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\u548c\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0cPointGauss\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u70b9\u4e91\u5206\u5272\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u539f\u8bed\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u548cGPU\u52a0\u901f\u76842D\u63a9\u7801\u6e32\u67d3\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u70b9\u4e91\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u539f\u8bed\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u548cGPU\u52a0\u901f\u76842D\u63a9\u7801\u6e32\u67d3\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f3D\u5206\u5272\u548c\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u53471.89%\u81f331.78%\uff08\u591a\u89c6\u56femIoU\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "conclusion": "PointGauss\u57283D\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6DesktopObjects-360\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Furthermore, we demonstrate that\nin multi-layer models, the disparity in effectiveness among demonstrations is\namplified with layer increasing, causing the model to focus more on effective\nones. Considering that current demonstration selection methods primarily focus\non the relevance to the user query while overlooking the information that the\nmodel has already assimilated, we propose a novel method called GradS, which\nleverages gradient flow for demonstration selection. We use the magnitude of\nthe gradient flow of the demonstration with respect to a given user query as\nthe criterion, thereby ensuring the effectiveness of the chosen ones. We\nvalidate our derivation and GradS on four prominent LLMs across five mainstream\ndatasets. The experimental results confirm that the disparity in effectiveness\namong demonstrations is magnified as the model layer increases, substantiating\nour derivations. Moreover, GradS achieves a relative improvement of $6.8\\%$ on\naverage over the strongest baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ICL\uff09\u4e2d\u6f14\u793a\u65e0\u6548\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u7684\u6f14\u793a\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5GradS\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5047\u8bbeICL\u4e2d\u7684\u6f14\u793a\u603b\u662f\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u5e76\u975e\u5982\u6b64\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7a76\u6f14\u793a\u65e0\u6548\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u6f14\u793a\u65e0\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51faGradS\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u5e45\u5ea6\u9009\u62e9\u6f14\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6f14\u793a\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u968f\u6a21\u578b\u5c42\u6570\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u653e\u5927\uff0cGradS\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53476.8%\u3002", "conclusion": "GradS\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u9009\u62e9\u6f14\u793a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86ICL\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

However, the robustness\nof semantic correspondence in challenging scenarios is much less investigated.\nIn this work, we establish a novel benchmark for evaluating semantic\ncorrespondence in adverse conditions. The benchmark dataset comprises 14\ndistinct challenging scenarios that reflect commonly encountered imaging\nissues, including geometric distortion, image blurring, digital artifacts, and\nenvironmental occlusion. Through extensive evaluations, we provide several key\ninsights into the robustness of semantic correspondence approaches: (1) All\nexisting methods suffer from noticeable performance drops under adverse\nconditions; (2) Using large-scale vision models can enhance overall robustness,\nbut fine-tuning on these models leads to a decline in relative robustness; (3)\nThe DINO model outperforms the Stable Diffusion in relative robustness, and\ntheir fusion achieves better absolute robustness; Moreover, We evaluate common\nrobustness enhancement strategies for semantic correspondence and find that\ngeneral data augmentations are ineffective, highlighting the need for\ntask-specific designs.

Existing rule-based enforcement systems, such as\nAgentSpec, focus on developing reactive safety rules, which typically respond\nonly when unsafe behavior is imminent or has already occurred. These systems\nlack foresight and struggle with long-horizon dependencies and distribution\nshifts. To address these limitations, we propose Pro2Guard, a proactive runtime\nenforcement framework grounded in probabilistic reachability analysis.\nPro2Guard abstracts agent behaviors into symbolic states and learns a\nDiscrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) from execution traces. At runtime, it\nanticipates future risks by estimating the probability of reaching unsafe\nstates, triggering interventions before violations occur when the predicted\nrisk exceeds a user-defined threshold. By incorporating semantic validity\nchecks and leveraging PAC bounds, Pro2Guard ensures statistical reliability\nwhile approximating the underlying ground-truth model.

Moreover, accurate estimation of animal pose and\nshape across diverse species is essential for quantitative analysis in\nbiological research. However, this topic remains underexplored due to the\nlimited network capacity of previous methods and the scarcity of comprehensive\nmulti-species datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce AniMer+, an\nextended version of our scalable AniMer framework. In this paper, we focus on a\nunified approach for reconstructing mammals (mammalia) and birds (aves). A key\ninnovation of AniMer+ is its high-capacity, family-aware Vision Transformer\n(ViT) incorporating a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design. Its architecture\npartitions network layers into taxa-specific components (for mammalia and aves)\nand taxa-shared components, enabling efficient learning of both distinct and\ncommon anatomical features within a single model. To overcome the critical\nshortage of 3D training data, especially for birds, we introduce a\ndiffusion-based conditional image generation pipeline. This pipeline produces\ntwo large-scale synthetic datasets: CtrlAni3D for quadrupeds and CtrlAVES3D for\nbirds. To note, CtrlAVES3D is the first large-scale, 3D-annotated dataset for\nbirds, which is crucial for resolving single-view depth ambiguities. Trained on\nan aggregated collection of 41.3k mammalian and 12.4k avian images (combining\nreal and synthetic data), our method demonstrates superior performance over\nexisting approaches across a wide range of benchmarks, including the\nchallenging out-of-domain Animal Kingdom dataset.

To tackle these issues, we built a new metric and a\nmulti-agent system.\n  We propose AVR-Eval, a relative metric for multimedia content quality using\nAudio-Visual Recordings (AVRs). An omni-modal model (processing text, video,\nand audio) compares the AVRs of two contents, with a text model reviewing\nevaluations to determine superiority. We show that AVR-Eval properly identifies\ngood from broken or mismatched content.\n  We built AVR-Agent, a multi-agent system generating JavaScript code from a\nbank of multimedia assets (audio, images, 3D models).

The latest methods are either generalization-based\nor overfitting-based. However, the generalization-based methods do not\ngeneralize well on views that were unseen during training, while the\nreconstruction quality of overfitting-based methods is still limited by the\nlimited geometry clues. To address this issue, we propose SparseRecon, a novel\nneural implicit reconstruction method for sparse views with volume\nrendering-based feature consistency and uncertainty-guided depth constraint.\nFirstly, we introduce a feature consistency loss across views to constrain the\nneural implicit field. This design alleviates the ambiguity caused by\ninsufficient consistency information of views and ensures completeness and\nsmoothness in the reconstruction results. Secondly, we employ an\nuncertainty-guided depth constraint to back up the feature consistency loss in\nareas with occlusion and insignificant features, which recovers geometry\ndetails for better reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, which can produce\nhigh-quality geometry with sparse-view input, especially in the scenarios with\nsmall overlapping views.

At PAN 2025, the shared task challenges\nparticipants to detect style switches at the most fine-grained level:\nindividual sentences. The task spans three datasets, each designed with\ncontrolled and increasing thematic variety within documents. We propose to\naddress this problem by modeling the content of each problem instance - that\nis, a series of sentences - as a whole, using a Sequential Sentence Pair\nClassifier (SSPC). The architecture leverages a pre-trained language model\n(PLM) to obtain representations of individual sentences, which are then fed\ninto a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) to contextualize them within the document.\nThe BiLSTM-produced vectors of adjacent sentences are concatenated and passed\nto a multi-layer perceptron for prediction per adjacency.

Recent\nKGQA methods primarily follow either retrieve-then-reason paradigm, relying on\nGNNs or heuristic rules for static paths extraction, or dynamic path generation\nstrategies that use large language models (LLMs) with prompting to jointly\nperform retrieval and reasoning. However, the former suffers from limited\nadaptability due to static path extraction and lack of contextual refinement,\nwhile the latter incurs high computational costs and struggles with accurate\npath evaluation due to reliance on fixed scoring functions and extensive LLM\ncalls.

Increasing the autoencoder's latent channel\nnumber is a highly effective approach for improving its reconstruction quality.\nHowever, it results in slow convergence for diffusion models, leading to poorer\ngeneration quality despite better reconstruction quality. This issue limits the\nquality upper bound of latent diffusion models and hinders the employment of\nautoencoders with higher spatial compression ratios.

To address these challenges, we propose\nTopology-enhanced Test-Time Adaptation (TopoTTA), the first test-time\nadaptation framework designed specifically for TSS. TopoTTA consists of two\nstages: Stage 1 adapts models to cross-domain topological discrepancies using\nthe proposed Topological Meta Difference Convolutions (TopoMDCs), which enhance\ntopological representation without altering pre-trained parameters; Stage 2\nimproves topological continuity by a novel Topology Hard sample Generation\n(TopoHG) strategy and prediction alignment on hard samples with pseudo-labels\nin the generated pseudo-break regions. Extensive experiments across four\nscenarios and ten datasets demonstrate TopoTTA's effectiveness in handling\ntopological distribution shifts, achieving an average improvement of 31.81% in\nclDice. TopoTTA also serves as a plug-and-play TTA solution for CNN-based TSS\nmodels.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aTopoTTA\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u7ba1\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u62d3\u6251\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ba1\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u5272\uff08TSS\uff09\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5206\u5272\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002", "method": "TopoTTA\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528TopoMDCs\u9002\u5e94\u8de8\u57df\u62d3\u6251\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7TopoHG\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u62d3\u6251\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\u548c\u5341\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTopoTTA\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u4e8631.81%\u7684clDice\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "TopoTTA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u3001\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8eCNN\u7684TSS\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Furthermore, we incorporate a\nlightweight linear prediction mechanism to reduce accumulated errors in skipped\nblocks.Extensive experiments across various tasks and DiT architectures\ndemonstrate that Sortblock achieves over 2$\\times$ inference speedup with\nminimal degradation in output quality, offering an effective and generalizable\nsolution for accelerating diffusion-based generative models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Sortblock\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u7f13\u5b58\u5757\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8df3\u8fc7\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347Diffusion Transformers\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "Diffusion Transformers\uff08DiTs\uff09\u5728\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u987a\u5e8f\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u53bb\u566a\u9636\u6bb5\u548cTransformer\u5757\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSortblock\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u7f13\u5b58\u76f8\u90bb\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7684\u5757\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u6f14\u5316\u6392\u5e8f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u786e\u5b9a\u91cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7ebf\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSortblock\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u548cDiT\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc72\u500d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4e14\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u6781\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "Sortblock\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Code: https://github.com/sang-w00/IN2OUT", "summary": "Video outpainting presents a unique challenge of extending the borders while\nmaintaining consistency with the given content. In this paper, we suggest the\nuse of video inpainting models that excel in object flow learning and\nreconstruction in outpainting rather than solely generating the background as\nin existing methods. However, directly applying or fine-tuning inpainting\nmodels to outpainting has shown to be ineffective, often leading to blurry\nresults. Our extensive experiments on discriminator designs reveal that a\ncritical component missing in the outpainting fine-tuning process is a\ndiscriminator capable of effectively assessing the perceptual quality of the\nextended areas. To tackle this limitation, we differentiate the objectives of\nadversarial training into global and local goals and introduce a hierarchical\ndiscriminator that meets both objectives. Additionally, we develop a\nspecialized outpainting loss function that leverages both local and global\nfeatures of the discriminator.

However, the\npractical application of DLLMs is hindered by a critical architectural\nconstraint: the need for a statically predefined generation length. This static\nlength allocation leads to a problematic trade-off: insufficient lengths\ncripple performance on complex tasks, while excessive lengths incur significant\ncomputational overhead and sometimes result in performance degradation. While\nthe inference framework is rigid, we observe that the model itself possesses\ninternal signals that correlate with the optimal response length for a given\ntask. To bridge this gap, we leverage these latent signals and introduce\nDAEDAL, a novel training-free denoising strategy that enables Dynamic Adaptive\nLength Expansion for Diffusion Large Language Models. DAEDAL operates in two\nphases: 1) Before the denoising process, DAEDAL starts from a short initial\nlength and iteratively expands it to a coarse task-appropriate length, guided\nby a sequence completion metric. 2) During the denoising process, DAEDAL\ndynamically intervenes by pinpointing and expanding insufficient generation\nregions through mask token insertion, ensuring the final output is fully\ndeveloped. Extensive experiments on DLLMs demonstrate that DAEDAL achieves\nperformance comparable, and in some cases superior, to meticulously tuned\nfixed-length baselines, while simultaneously enhancing computational efficiency\nby achieving a higher effective token ratio.

Mamba, as an emerging state space model with\ninherently linear complexity and global receptive fields, is highly suitable\nfor processing image segmentation tasks with long sequence features. However,\ndue to the particularity of underwater scenes, there are many challenges in\napplying Mamba to UIS. The existing fixed-patch scanning mechanism cannot\nmaintain the internal continuity of scanned instances in the presence of\nseverely underwater color distortion and blurred instance boundaries, and the\nhidden state of the complex underwater background can also inhibit the\nunderstanding of instance objects. In this work, we propose the first\nMamba-based underwater instance segmentation model UIS-Mamba, and design two\ninnovative modules, Dynamic Tree Scan (DTS) and Hidden State Weaken (HSW), to\nmigrate Mamba to the underwater task. DTS module maintains the continuity of\nthe internal features of the instance objects by allowing the patches to\ndynamically offset and scale, thereby guiding the minimum spanning tree and\nproviding dynamic local receptive fields. HSW module suppresses the\ninterference of complex backgrounds and effectively focuses the information\nflow of state propagation to the instances themselves through the Ncut-based\nhidden state weakening mechanism.

In this paper, we explore\nthe challenge of biometric verification in such avatar-mediated scenarios. Our\nmain question is whether an individual's facial motion patterns can serve as\nreliable behavioral biometrics to verify their identity when the avatar's\nvisual appearance is a facsimile of its owner.

We present LAMIC, a Layout-Aware Multi-Image Composition framework\nthat, for the first time, extends single-reference diffusion models to\nmulti-reference scenarios in a training-free manner. Built upon the MMDiT\nmodel, LAMIC introduces two plug-and-play attention mechanisms: 1) Group\nIsolation Attention (GIA) to enhance entity disentanglement; and 2)\nRegion-Modulated Attention (RMA) to enable layout-aware generation. To\ncomprehensively evaluate model capabilities, we further introduce three\nmetrics: 1) Inclusion Ratio (IN-R) and Fill Ratio (FI-R) for assessing layout\ncontrol; and 2) Background Similarity (BG-S) for measuring background\nconsistency. Extensive experiments show that LAMIC achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across most major metrics: it consistently outperforms existing\nmulti-reference baselines in ID-S, BG-S, IN-R and AVG scores across all\nsettings, and achieves the best DPG in complex composition tasks. These results\ndemonstrate LAMIC's superior abilities in identity keeping, background\npreservation, layout control, and prompt-following, all achieved without any\ntraining or fine-tuning, showcasing strong zero-shot generalization ability. By\ninheriting the strengths of advanced single-reference models and enabling\nseamless extension to multi-image scenarios, LAMIC establishes a new\ntraining-free paradigm for controllable multi-image composition.

However, in complex real-world scenes, characterized by\nextreme viewpoint and scale changes as well as pronounced depth\ndiscontinuities, the motion field often exhibits diverse and heterogeneous\nmotion patterns. Most existing methods lack targeted modeling strategies and\nfail to explicitly account for this variability, resulting in estimated motion\nfields that diverge from their true underlying structure and distribution. We\nobserve that Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) can assign dedicated experts to motion\nsub-fields, enabling a divide-and-conquer strategy for heterogeneous motion\npatterns. Building on this insight, we re-architect motion field modeling in\ntwo-view geometry with GeoMoE, a streamlined framework. Specifically, we first\ndevise a Probabilistic Prior-Guided Decomposition strategy that exploits inlier\nprobability signals to perform a structure-aware decomposition of the motion\nfield into heterogeneous sub-fields, sharply curbing outlier-induced bias.\nNext, we introduce an MoE-Enhanced Bi-Path Rectifier that enhances each\nsub-field along spatial-context and channel-semantic paths and routes it to a\ncustomized expert for targeted modeling, thereby decoupling heterogeneous\nmotion regimes, suppressing cross-sub-field interference and representational\nentanglement, and yielding fine-grained motion-field rectification. With this\nminimalist design, GeoMoE outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in\nrelative pose and homography estimation and shows strong generalization.

However, we identify that existing defense\nevaluations lack a unified and comprehensive framework, resulting in\ninconsistent and incomplete assessments of current methods. To address this\nissue, we revisit 11 representative defenses and present the first patch\ndefense benchmark, involving 2 attack goals, 13 patch attacks, 11 object\ndetectors, and 4 diverse metrics. This leads to the large-scale adversarial\npatch dataset with 94 types of patches and 94,000 images. Our comprehensive\nanalyses reveal new insights: (1) The difficulty in defending against\nnaturalistic patches lies in the data distribution, rather than the commonly\nbelieved high frequencies. Our new dataset with diverse patch distributions can\nbe used to improve existing defenses by 15.09% AP@0.5.

Project page:\n  https://gwxuan.github.io/IGL-Nav/", "summary": "Visual navigation with an image as goal is a fundamental and challenging\nproblem. Conventional methods either rely on end-to-end RL learning or\nmodular-based policy with topological graph or BEV map as memory, which cannot\nfully model the geometric relationship between the explored 3D environment and\nthe goal image. In order to efficiently and accurately localize the goal image\nin 3D space, we build our navigation system upon the renderable 3D gaussian\n(3DGS) representation. However, due to the computational intensity of 3DGS\noptimization and the large search space of 6-DoF camera pose, directly\nleveraging 3DGS for image localization during agent exploration process is\nprohibitively inefficient. To this end, we propose IGL-Nav, an Incremental 3D\nGaussian Localization framework for efficient and 3D-aware image-goal\nnavigation. Specifically, we incrementally update the scene representation as\nnew images arrive with feed-forward monocular prediction. Then we coarsely\nlocalize the goal by leveraging the geometric information for discrete space\nmatching, which can be equivalent to efficient 3D convolution. When the agent\nis close to the goal, we finally solve the fine target pose with optimization\nvia differentiable rendering. The proposed IGL-Nav outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art methods by a large margin across diverse experimental\nconfigurations. It can also handle the more challenging free-view image-goal\nsetting and be deployed on real-world robotic platform using a cellphone to\ncapture goal image at arbitrary pose.
