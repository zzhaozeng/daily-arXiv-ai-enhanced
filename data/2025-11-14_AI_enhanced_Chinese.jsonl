Previous studies introduced an exact mixed-integer programming (MIP) solver, along with datasets and a Gurobi implementation, showing that while the exact approach guarantees optimality, it becomes computationally inefficient for large-scale instances. To overcome this limitation, heuristic methods based on merging algorithms and shaking procedures were proposed, achieving solutions within approximately 1% deviation from the optimum. This work presents a novel and more efficient approach that attains high-accuracy, near-optimal solutions for large-scale JRA problems. The proposed method introduces a Partial Path Reconstructon (PPR) solver that first identifies key item-placeholder pairs to form a reduced subproblem, which is solved efficiently to refine the global solution. Using this PJAR framework, the initial heuristic merging solutions can be further improved, reducing the deviation by half. Moreover, the solution can be iteratively polished with PPR based solver along the optimization path to yield highly accurate tours. Additionally, a global Large-\u03b1 constraint is incorporated into the JRA model to further enhance solution optimality. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets with n = 300, 500, and 1000 demonstrate that the proposed method consistently delivers almost optimal solutions, achieving an average deviation of 0.00% from the ground truth while maintaining high computational efficiency. Beyond the JRA problem, the proposed framework and methodologies exhibit strong potential for broader applications. The Framework can be applied to TSP and related optimization problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8054\u5408\u8def\u7531\u5206\u914d\uff08JRA\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7cbe\u786e\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u800c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u53c8\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u89e3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u90e8\u5206\u8def\u5f84\u91cd\u6784\uff08PPR\uff09\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u9879\u76ee-\u5360\u4f4d\u7b26\u5bf9\u5f62\u6210\u7b80\u5316\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u5168\u5c40\u89e3\u3002\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u5c40Large-\u03b1\u7ea6\u675f\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u89e3\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728n = 300, 500, \u548c 1000\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u59cb\u7ec8\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u51e0\u4e4e\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u504f\u5dee\u4e3a0.00%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21JRA\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5176\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u76f8\u5173\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Expanding ASR coverage has been costly and limited by architectures that restrict language support, making extension inaccessible to most--all while entangled with ethical concerns when pursued without community collaboration. To transcend these limitations, we introduce Omnilingual ASR, the first large-scale ASR system designed for extensibility. Omnilingual ASR enables communities to introduce unserved languages with only a handful of data samples. It scales self-supervised pre-training to 7B parameters to learn robust speech representations and introduces an encoder-decoder architecture designed for zero-shot generalization, leveraging a LLM-inspired decoder. This capability is grounded in a massive and diverse training corpus; by combining breadth of coverage with linguistic variety, the model learns representations robust enough to adapt to unseen languages. Incorporating public resources with community-sourced recordings gathered through compensated local partnerships, Omnilingual ASR expands coverage to over 1,600 languages, the largest such effort to date--including over 500 never before served by ASR. Automatic evaluations show substantial gains over prior systems, especially in low-resource conditions, and strong generalization. We release Omnilingual ASR as a family of models, from 300M variants for low-power devices to 7B for maximum accuracy. We reflect on the ethical considerations shaping this design and conclude by discussing its societal impact. In particular, we highlight how open-sourcing models and tools can lower barriers for researchers and communities, inviting new forms of participation.

Traditionally, AI has addressed reasoning in the context of logic-based representations of knowledge.

Still, despite ongoing discussions about what reasoning is in language models, it is still not easy to articulate to what extent these models are actually capable of reasoning.\n  The goal of this workshop is to create a platform for researchers from different disciplines and/or AI perspectives to explore approaches and techniques with the aim to reconcile reasoning between language models using transformers and logic-based representations. The specific objectives include analysing the reasoning abilities of language models measured alongside KR methods, injecting KR-style reasoning abilities into language models (including by neuro-symbolic means), and formalising the kind of reasoning language models carry out.

Most prior work reasonably and intuitively assumes that which examples are chosen has a far greater effect on performance than how those examples are ordered, leading to a focus on example selection. We revisit this assumption and conduct a systematic comparison between the effect of selection and ordering. Through controlled experiments on both classification and generation tasks, using multiple open-source model families (0.5B to 27B parameters) and GPT-5, we find that the variance in performance due to different example orderings is comparable to that from using entirely different example sets. Furthermore, we show that strong orderings can be identified using only a development set, achieving performance close to an oracle that selects the best ordering based on test labels. Our findings highlight the equal and intertwined importance of example selection and ordering in prompt design, calling for a reexamination of the assumptions held in ICL.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ICL\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0e\u9009\u62e9\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\u96c6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u793a\u4f8b\u987a\u5e8f\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8ba4\u4e3a\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u8fdc\u5927\u4e8e\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u91cd\u70b9\u4e00\u76f4\u653e\u5728\u793a\u4f8b\u9009\u62e9\u4e0a\u3002\u672c\u6587\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u793a\u4f8b\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u987a\u5e8f\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\uff080.5B\u523027B\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u548cGPT-5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u793a\u4f8b\u987a\u5e8f\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u793a\u4f8b\u987a\u5e8f\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u4e0e\u4e0d\u540c\u793a\u4f8b\u96c6\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u76f8\u5f53\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5f00\u53d1\u96c6\u5373\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6807\u7b7e\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u987a\u5e8f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u793a\u4f8b\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u987a\u5e8f\u5728\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u540c\u7b49\u4e14\u76f8\u4e92\u4ea4\u7ec7\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6ICL\u4e2d\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002"}}

In fact, they have been shown to be suboptimal for morphologically rich languages, where tokenization quality directly impacts downstream performance. In this work, we investigate morphologically-aware tokenization for Latin, a morphologically rich language that is medium-resource in terms of pretraining data, but high-resource in terms of curated lexical resources -- a distinction that is often overlooked but critical in discussions of low-resource language modeling. We find that morphologically-guided tokenization improves overall performance on four downstream tasks. Performance gains are most pronounced for out of domain texts, highlighting our models' improved generalization ability. Our findings demonstrate the utility of linguistic resources to improve language modeling for morphologically complex languages.

Thus Audio Reasoning Models (ARMs), i.e., audio LMs that can reason, are becoming increasingly popular. However, no work has studied the safety of ARMs against jailbreak attacks that aim to elicit harmful responses from target models. To this end, first, we show that standard RT with appropriate safety reasoning data can protect ARMs from vanilla audio jailbreaks, but cannot protect them against our proposed simple yet effective jailbreaks. We show that this is because of the significant representation drift between vanilla and advanced jailbreaks which forces the target ARMs to emit harmful responses. Based on this observation, we propose Rebellion, a robust RT that trains ARMs to be robust to the worst-case representation drift. All our results are on Qwen2-Audio; they demonstrate that Rebellion: 1) can protect against advanced audio jailbreaks without compromising performance on benign tasks, and 2) significantly improves accuracy-safety trade-off over standard RT method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aRebellion\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u63a8\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u97f3\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08ARMs\uff09\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u65f6\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u97f3\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08ARMs\uff09\u7684\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u5176\u9762\u5bf9\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3ARMs\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7ea7\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u65f6\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u5148\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u63a8\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08RT\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u5b89\u5168\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u4ee5\u9632\u5fa1\u666e\u901a\u97f3\u9891\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u800c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u65e0\u6548\u3002\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u666e\u901a\u4e0e\u9ad8\u7ea7\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u8868\u793a\u6f02\u79fb\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Rebellion\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7fARMs\u80fd\u591f\u62b5\u6297\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u793a\u6f02\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u5728Qwen2-Audio\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRebellion\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u9632\u5fa1\u9ad8\u7ea7\u97f3\u9891\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u5728\u826f\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6807\u51c6RT\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "Rebellion\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347ARMs\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7ea7\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u65f6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We ask: how small can you get while still detecting meaning-altering translation errors? Focusing on English->German Critical Error Detection (CED), we benchmark sub-2B models (LFM2-350M, Qwen-3-0.6B/1.7B, Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, Gemma-3-1B) across WMT21, WMT22, and SynCED-EnDe-2025. Our framework standardizes prompts, applies lightweight logit-bias calibration and majority voting, and reports both semantic quality (MCC, F1-ERR/F1-NOT) and compute metrics (VRAM, latency, throughput). Results reveal a clear sweet spot around one billion parameters: Gemma-3-1B provides the best quality-efficiency trade-off, reaching MCC=0.77 with F1-ERR=0.98 on SynCED-EnDe-2025 after merged-weights fine-tuning, while maintaining 400 ms single-sample latency on a MacBook Pro M4 Pro (24 GB). At larger scale, Qwen-3-1.7B attains the highest absolute MCC (+0.11 over Gemma) but with higher compute cost. In contrast, ultra-small models (0.6B) remain usable with few-shot calibration yet under-detect entity and number errors. Overall, compact, instruction-tuned LLMs augmented with lightweight calibration and small-sample supervision can deliver trustworthy, on-device CED for MT, enabling private, low-cost error screening in real-world translation pipelines.

This field leverages techniques like annotation projection and model transfer for language adaptation, supported by multilingual pre-trained language models. However, linguistic divergences hinder language transfer, especially among typologically distant languages. In this paper, we present an analysis of predicate-argument structures in parallel Chinese and English sentences. We explore the alignment and misalignment of predicate annotations, inspecting similarities and differences and proposing a categorization of structural divergences. The analysis and the categorization are supported by a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the results of an annotation projection experiment, in which, in turn, one of the two languages has been used as source language to project annotations into the corresponding parallel sentences. The results of this analysis show clearly that language transfer is asymmetric.

Using transcripts from 30 one-to-one math sessions, we compare three production LLMs (GPT, Claude, Gemini) under three conditions: unverified annotation, self-verification, and cross-verification across all orchestration configurations. Outputs are benchmarked against a blinded, disagreement-focused human adjudication using Cohen's kappa. Overall, orchestration yields a 58 percent improvement in kappa. Self-verification nearly doubles agreement relative to unverified baselines, with the largest gains for challenging tutor moves. Cross-verification achieves a 37 percent improvement on average, with pair- and construct-dependent effects: some verifier-annotator pairs exceed self-verification, while others reduce alignment, reflecting differences in verifier strictness. We contribute: (1) a flexible orchestration framework instantiating control, self-, and cross-verification; (2) an empirical comparison across frontier LLMs on authentic tutoring data with blinded human \"gold\" labels; and (3) a concise notation, verifier(annotator) (e.g., Gemini(GPT) or Claude(Claude)), to standardize reporting and make directional effects explicit for replication.

We propose Training-free Adaptive Retrieval Gating (TARG), a single-shot policy that decides when to retrieve using only a short, no-context draft from the base model. From the draft's prefix logits, TARG computes lightweight uncertainty scores: mean token entropy, a margin signal derived from the top-1/top-2 logit gap via a monotone link, or small-N variance across a handful of stochastic prefixes, and triggers retrieval only when the score exceeds a threshold. The gate is model agnostic, adds only tens to hundreds of draft tokens, and requires no additional training or auxiliary heads. On NQ-Open, TriviaQA, and PopQA, TARG consistently shifts the accuracy-efficiency frontier: compared with Always-RAG, TARG matches or improves EM/F1 while reducing retrieval by 70-90% and cutting end-to-end latency, and it remains close to Never-RAG in overhead. A central empirical finding is that under modern instruction-tuned LLMs the margin signal is a robust default (entropy compresses as backbones sharpen), with small-N variance offering a conservative, budget-first alternative. We provide ablations over gate type and prefix length and use a delta-latency view to make budget trade-offs explicit.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u68c0\u7d22\u95e8\u63a7(TARG)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u51b3\u5b9a\u4f55\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861RAG\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "RAG\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u6bcf\u6b21\u67e5\u8be2\u90fd\u68c0\u7d22\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u589e\u52a0\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548ctokens\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "TARG\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65e0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u77ed\u8349\u7a3f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6570\uff1a\u5e73\u5747token\u71b5\u3001\u57fa\u4e8etop-1/top-2 logit\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001\u5c11\u91cf\u968f\u673a\u524d\u7f00\u7684\u5c0fN\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u5206\u6570\u8d85\u8fc7\u9608\u503c\u65f6\u89e6\u53d1\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728NQ-Open\u3001TriviaQA\u548cPopQA\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4Always-RAG\uff0cTARG\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u9ad8EM/F1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c1170-90%\u68c0\u7d22\u91cf\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u4e14\u5f00\u9500\u63a5\u8fd1Never-RAG\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18LLM\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fb9\u7f18\u4fe1\u53f7\u662f\u7a33\u5065\u9ed8\u8ba4\u9009\u62e9(\u71b5\u968f\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u800c\u538b\u7f29)\uff0c\u5c0fN\u65b9\u5dee\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fdd\u5b88\u9884\u7b97\u4f18\u5148\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u95e8\u63a7\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u524d\u7f00\u957f\u5ea6\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53cadelta\u5ef6\u8fdf\u89c6\u56fe\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Deployable locally, these models offer artists vital control over infrastructure and code, unlike dominant large, closed-source corporate systems. Such centralized platforms function as opaque black boxes, imposing severe limitations on interactive artworks, including restrictive content filters, preservation issues, and technical challenges such as increased latency and limited interfaces. In contrast, small AI models empower creators with more autonomy, control, and sustainability for these artistic processes. They enable the ability to use a model as long as they want, create their own custom model, either by making code changes to integrate new interfaces, or via new datasets by re-training or fine-tuning the model. This fosters technological self-determination, offering greater ownership and reducing reliance on corporate AI ill-suited for interactive art's demands. Critically, this approach empowers the artist and supports long-term preservation and exhibition of artworks with AI components.

First, there are misalignments between words in the lexicon and the word segmentation model. Second, a Khmer word can be written in different forms. Third, Khmer compound words are often loosely and easily formed, and these compound words are not always found in the lexicon. Fourth, some proper nouns may be flagged as misspellings due to the absence of a Khmer named-entity recognition (NER) model. Unfortunately, existing solutions do not adequately address these challenges. This paper proposes a holistic approach to the Khmer spellchecking problem by integrating Khmer subword segmentation, Khmer NER, Khmer grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion, and a Khmer language model to tackle these challenges, identify potential correction candidates, and rank the most suitable candidate. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a state-of-the-art Khmer spellchecking accuracy of up to 94.4%, compared to existing solutions.

It provides a platform for students to post their questions related to the content and admin issues related to the course. However, there are several challenges due to the increase in the number of students enrolled in the course. The primary challenge is that students' queries cannot be responded immediately and the instructors have to face lots of repetitive questions. To mitigate these issues, we propose a question answering system based on large language model with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) method. This work focuses on designing a question answering system with open source Large Language Model (LLM) and fine-tuning it on the relevant course dataset. To further improve the performance, we use a local knowledge base and applied RAG method to retrieve relevant documents relevant to students' queries, where the local knowledge base contains all the course content. To mitigate the hallucination of LLMs, We also integrate it with multi chain-of-thought reasoning to overcome the challenge of hallucination in LLMs. In this work, we experiment fine-tuned LLM with RAG method on the HotpotQA dataset.

However, their conspicuous appearance makes them difficult to deploy in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a thermally activated adversarial wearable designed to ensure adaptability and effectiveness in complex real-world environments. The system integrates thermochromic dyes with flexible heating units to induce visually dynamic adversarial patterns on clothing surfaces. In its default state, the clothing appears as an ordinary black T-shirt. Upon heating via an embedded thermal unit, hidden adversarial patterns on the fabric are activated, allowing the wearer to effectively evade detection across both visible and infrared modalities. Physical experiments demonstrate that the adversarial wearable achieves rapid texture activation within 50 seconds and maintains an adversarial success rate above 80\\% across diverse real-world surveillance environments.

This weakness in terminology-level representation can severely hinder downstream tasks such as legal judgment prediction or financial risk analysis, where subtle semantic distinctions are critical. To address this problem, we propose TermGPT, a multi-level contrastive fine-tuning framework designed for terminology adaptation. We first construct a sentence graph to capture semantic and structural relations, and generate semantically consistent yet discriminative positive and negative samples based on contextual and topological cues. We then devise a multi-level contrastive learning approach at both the sentence and token levels, enhancing global contextual understanding and fine-grained terminology discrimination.

To tackle these limitations, we introduce InTRO (In-Token Rationality Optimization), a new framework that enables both token-level exploration and self-feedback for accurate and concise reasoning. Instead of directly optimizing an intractable objective over all valid reasoning paths, InTRO leverages correction factors-token-wise importance weights estimated by the information discrepancy between the generative policy and its answer-conditioned counterpart, for informative next token selection. This approach allows the model to perform token-level exploration and receive self-generated feedback within a single forward pass, ultimately encouraging accurate and concise rationales. Across six math-reasoning benchmarks, InTRO consistently outperforms other baselines, raising solution accuracy by up to 20% relative to the base model.

However, this fine-tuning process often introduces a critical vulnerability: the systematic degradation of safety alignment, undermining ethical guidelines and increasing the risk of harmful outputs. Addressing this challenge, we introduce EnchTable, a novel framework designed to transfer and maintain safety alignment in downstream LLMs without requiring extensive retraining. EnchTable leverages a Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)-based safety vector distillation method to decouple safety constraints from task-specific reasoning, ensuring compatibility across diverse model architectures and sizes. Additionally, our interference-aware merging technique effectively balances safety and utility, minimizing performance compromises across various task domains. We implemented a fully functional prototype of EnchTable on three different task domains and three distinct LLM architectures, and evaluated its performance through extensive experiments on eleven diverse datasets, assessing both utility and model safety. Our evaluations include LLMs from different vendors, demonstrating EnchTable's generalization capability. Furthermore, EnchTable exhibits robust resistance to static and dynamic jailbreaking attacks, outperforming vendor-released safety models in mitigating adversarial prompts. Comparative analyses with six parameter modification methods and two inference-time alignment baselines reveal that EnchTable achieves a significantly lower unsafe rate, higher utility score, and universal applicability across different task domains.

These quality scores guide a curriculum learning strategy that first trains on clean, high-confidence samples and progressively incorporates harder cases to strengthen model robustness.

However, existing approaches face several challenges: (i) indiscriminate generation that ignores the solver's ability and yields low-value problems, or reliance on complex data pipelines to balance problem difficulty; and (ii) a lack of reasoning in problem generation, leading to shallow problem variants. In this paper, we develop a problem generator that reasons explicitly to plan problem directions before synthesis and adapts difficulty to the solver's ability. Specifically, we construct related problem pairs and augment them with intermediate problem-design CoT produced by a reasoning model. These data bootstrap problem-design strategies from the generator. Then, we treat the solver's feedback on synthetic problems as a reward signal, enabling the generator to calibrate difficulty and produce complementary problems near the edge of the solver's competence.

Analyzing how these interconnected systems simultaneously failed to protect public health requires innovative analytic approaches for exploring the vast amounts of data and documents disclosed in the UCSF-JHU Opioid Industry Documents Archive (OIDA). The complexity, multimodal nature, and specialized characteristics of these healthcare-related legal and corporate documents necessitate more advanced methods and models tailored to specific data types and detailed annotations, ensuring the precision and professionalism in the analysis. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by organizing the original dataset according to document attributes and constructing a benchmark with 400k training documents and 10k for testing. From each document, we extract rich multimodal information-including textual content, visual elements, and layout structures-to capture a comprehensive range of features. Using multiple AI models, we then generate a large-scale dataset comprising 360k training QA pairs and 10k testing QA pairs. Building on this foundation, we develop domain-specific multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) and explore the impact of multimodal inputs on task performance. To further enhance response accuracy, we incorporate historical QA pairs as contextual grounding for answering current queries. Additionally, we incorporate page references within the answers and introduce an importance-based page classifier, further improving the precision and relevance of the information provided.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for automating this process, prior research has been limited to small datasets and has been shown to produce superfluous, redundant KC labels. This study addresses these limitations by first scaling a \"simulated textbook\" LLM prompting strategy (using GPT-4o-mini) to a larger dataset of 646 multiple-choice questions. We found that this initial automated approach performed significantly worse than an expert-designed KC model (RMSE 0.4285 vs. 0.4206) and generated an excessive number of KCs (569 vs. 101). To address the issue of redundancy, we proposed and evaluated a novel method for merging semantically similar KC labels based on their cosine similarity. This merging strategy significantly improved the model's performance; a model using a cosine similarity threshold of 0.8 achieved the best result, reducing the KC count to 428 and improving the RMSE to 0.4259. This demonstrates that while scaled LLM generation alone is insufficient, combining it with a semantic merging technique offers a viable path toward automating and refining KC identification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5927\u6a21\u62df\u6559\u6750\u7684LLM\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7684\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff08KCs\uff09\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u624b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff08KCs\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u867d\u7136LLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u591a\u5197\u4f59KC\u6807\u7b7e\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86LLM\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u4f7f\u7528GPT-4o-mini\uff09\u5230\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7684\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5408\u5e76\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684KC\u6807\u7b7e\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u59cb\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u5982\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684KC\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u5e76\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f7f\u75280.8\u7684\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\uff0cKCs\u6570\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u5230428\uff0cRMSE\u6539\u5584\u81f30.4259\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u5c55\u7684LLM\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u5408\u5e76\u6280\u672f\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u548c\u4f18\u5316KC\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Hyperbolic space, characterized by its negative curvature, has demonstrated strong potential in such tasks due to its capacity to embed hierarchical structures with minimal distortion. Previous evidence indicates that the hyperbolic representation capacity can be further enhanced through kernel methods. However, existing hyperbolic kernels still suffer from mild geometric distortion or lack adaptability. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a curvature-aware de Branges-Rovnyak space, a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) that is isometric to a Poincare ball. We design an adjustable multiplier to select the appropriate RKHS corresponding to the hyperbolic space with any curvature adaptively. Building on this foundation, we further construct a family of adaptive hyperbolic kernels, including the novel adaptive hyperbolic radial kernel, whose learnable parameters modulate hyperbolic features in a task-aware manner.

However, existing methods for multi-hop reasoning tasks often lack global planning, increasing the risk of falling into local reasoning impasses. Insufficient exploitation of retrieved content and the neglect of latent clues fail to ensure the accuracy of reasoning outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose Recursive Evaluation and Adaptive Planning (REAP), whose core idea is to explicitly maintain structured sub-tasks and facts related to the current task through the Sub-task Planner (SP) and Fact Extractor (FE) modules. SP maintains a global perspective, guiding the overall reasoning direction and evaluating the task state based on the outcomes of FE, enabling dynamic optimization of the task-solving trajectory. FE performs fine-grained analysis over retrieved content to extract reliable answers and clues. These two modules incrementally enrich a logically coherent representation of global knowledge, enhancing the reliability and the traceability of the reasoning process. Furthermore, we propose a unified task paradigm design that enables effective multi-task fine-tuning, significantly enhancing SP's performance on complex, data-scarce tasks.

Version with Appendix", "summary": "We introduce SPAN, a cross-calendar temporal reasoning benchmark, which requires LLMs to perform intra-calendar temporal reasoning and inter-calendar temporal conversion. SPAN features ten cross-calendar temporal reasoning directions, two reasoning types, and two question formats across six calendars. To enable time-variant and contamination-free evaluation, we propose a template-driven protocol for dynamic instance generation that enables assessment on a user-specified Gregorian date. We conduct extensive experiments on both open- and closed-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs over a range of dates spanning 100 years from 1960 to 2060. Our evaluations show that these LLMs achieve an average accuracy of only 34.5%, with none exceeding 80%, indicating that this task remains challenging. Through in-depth analysis of reasoning types, question formats, and temporal reasoning directions, we identify two key obstacles for LLMs: Future-Date Degradation and Calendar Asymmetry Bias. To strengthen LLMs' cross-calendar temporal reasoning capability, we further develop an LLM-powered Time Agent that leverages tool-augmented code generation. Empirical results show that Time Agent achieves an average accuracy of 95.31%, outperforming several competitive baselines, highlighting the potential of tool-augmented code generation to advance cross-calendar temporal reasoning.

We introduce Entropy-Trend Constraint (ETC), a training-free method that determines optimal retrieval timing by modeling the dynamics of token-level uncertainty.

Experiments on six QA benchmarks with three LLM backbones demonstrate that ETC consistently outperforms strong baselines while reducing retrieval frequency. ETC is particularly effective in domain-specific scenarios, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities.

However, when the retrieved evidence differs in language from the user query and in-context exemplars, the model often exhibits language drift by generating responses in an unintended language. This phenomenon is especially pronounced during reasoning-intensive decoding, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation, where intermediate steps introduce further language instability. In this paper, we systematically study output language drift in multilingual RAG across multiple datasets, languages, and LLM backbones. Our controlled experiments reveal that the drift results not from comprehension failure but from decoder-level collapse, where dominant token distributions and high-frequency English patterns dominate the intended generation language. We further observe that English serves as a semantic attractor under cross-lingual conditions, emerging as both the strongest interference source and the most frequent fallback language.\n  To mitigate this, we propose Soft Constrained Decoding (SCD), a lightweight, training-free decoding strategy that gently steers generation toward the target language by penalizing non-target-language tokens. SCD is model-agnostic and can be applied to any generation algorithm without modifying the architecture or requiring additional data.

Through analyzing decoding trajectories, we observe that most next-token predictions align well with the golden output, except for a few critical tokens that lead to deviations. Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose a novel Hint-Practice Reasoning (HPR) framework that operationalizes this insight through two synergistic components: 1) a hinter (powerful LLM) that provides probabilistic guidance at critical decision points, and 2) a practitioner (efficient smaller model) that executes major reasoning steps. The framework's core innovation lies in Distributional Inconsistency Reduction (DIR), a theoretically-grounded metric that dynamically identifies intervention points by quantifying the divergence between practitioner's reasoning trajectory and hinter's expected distribution in a tree-structured probabilistic space. Through iterative tree updates guided by DIR, HPR reweights promising reasoning paths while deprioritizing low-probability branches. Experiments across arithmetic and commonsense reasoning benchmarks demonstrate HPR's state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs: it achieves comparable performance to self-consistency and MCTS baselines while decoding only 1/5 tokens, and outperforms existing methods by at most 5.1% absolute accuracy while maintaining similar or lower FLOPs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684Hint-Practice Reasoning (HPR)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u534f\u540c\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff08\u63d0\u793a\u8005\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\uff09\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u51cf\u5c11\uff08DIR\uff09\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u5168\u9762\u91c7\u6837\u800c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bcd\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u6b63\u786e\u8f93\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4f46\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u9884\u6d4b\u504f\u5dee\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63d0\u51faHPR\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "HPR\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u62ec\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8005\uff08hinter\uff09\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\uff08practitioner\uff09\u3002\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u521b\u65b0\u662f\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u51cf\u5c11\uff08DIR\uff09\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u8c03\u6574\u5728\u6811\u72b6\u6982\u7387\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u5e72\u9884\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7b97\u672f\u548c\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cHPR\u5728\u89e3\u7801\u4ec51/5\u8bcd\u91cf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0eself-consistency\u548cMCTS\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u4f3c\u6216\u66f4\u4f4eFLOPs\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u53475.1%\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "HPR\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u8005\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u534f\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5229\u7528DIR\u6307\u6807\u52a8\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u4fee\u6b63\u5173\u952e\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6548\u7387-\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

However, most existing medical report generation (MRG) systems treat reports as flat sequences, overlooking this hierarchical organization and leading to inconsistencies between descriptive and diagnostic content. To align model behavior with real-world reporting practices, we propose RadFlow, a hierarchical workflow-guided reinforcement optimization framework that explicitly models the structured nature of clinical reporting. RadFlow introduces a clinically grounded reward hierarchy that mirrors the organization of radiological reports. At the global level, the reward integrates linguistic fluency, medical-domain correctness, and cross-sectional consistency between Finding and Impression, promoting coherent and clinically faithful narratives. At the local level, a section-specific reward emphasizes Impression quality, reflecting its central role in diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, a critical-aware policy optimization mechanism adaptively regularizes learning for high-risk or clinically sensitive cases, emulating the cautious refinement behavior of radiologists when documenting critical findings. Together, these components translate the structured reporting paradigm into the reinforcement fine-tuning process, enabling the model to generate reports that are both linguistically consistent and clinically aligned.

However, they continue to underperform in real-world medical scenarios, which often demand stronger context-awareness, i.e., the ability to recognize missing or critical details (e.g., user identity, medical history, risk factors) and provide safe, helpful, and contextually appropriate responses. To address this issue, we propose Multifaceted Self-Refinement (MuSeR), a data-driven approach that enhances LLMs' context-awareness along three key facets (decision-making, communication, and safety) through self-evaluation and refinement. Specifically, we first design a attribute-conditioned query generator that simulates diverse real-world user contexts by varying attributes such as role, geographic region, intent, and degree of information ambiguity. An LLM then responds to these queries, self-evaluates its answers along three key facets, and refines its responses to better align with the requirements of each facet. Finally, the queries and refined responses are used for supervised fine-tuning to reinforce the model's context-awareness ability. Evaluation results on the latest HealthBench dataset demonstrate that our method significantly improves LLM performance across multiple aspects, with particularly notable gains in the context-awareness axis. Furthermore, by incorporating knowledge distillation with the proposed method, the performance of a smaller backbone LLM (e.g., Qwen3-32B) surpasses its teacher model, achieving a new SOTA across all open-source LLMs on HealthBench (63.8%) and its hard subset (43.1%).

To circumvent this, we propose ScaleFormer(Span Representation Cumulation for Long-Context Transformer) - a simple and effective plug-and-play framework that adapts off-the-shelf pre-trained encoder-decoder models to process long sequences without requiring architectural modifications. Our approach segments long inputs into overlapping chunks and generates a compressed, context-aware representation for the decoder. The core of our method is a novel, parameter-free fusion mechanism that endows each chunk's representation with structural awareness of its position within the document. It achieves this by enriching each chunk's boundary representations with cumulative context vectors from all preceding and succeeding chunks. This strategy provides the model with a strong signal of the document's narrative flow, achieves linear complexity, and enables pre-trained models to reason effectively over long-form text.

Such attacks exploit both intra-class and inter-class paths, progressively extracting fine-grained knowledge within topics and diffusing it across semantically related ones, thereby enabling comprehensive extraction of the original knowledge base. However, existing defenses target only one path, leaving the other unprotected.

Denoising has therefore become a critical preprocessing step, typically categorized into instance removal and instance correction techniques. However, existing correction approaches often degrade performance or oversimplify the problem by altering the original data distribution. This leads to unrealistic scenarios and biased models, which is particularly problematic in contexts where interpretable AI models are employed, as their interpretability depends on the fidelity of the underlying data patterns. In this paper, we argue that defining noise independently of the solution may be ineffective, as its nature can vary significantly across tasks and datasets. Using a task-specific high quality solution as a reference can provide a more precise and adaptable noise definition. To this end, we propose DenoGrad, a novel Gradient-based instance Denoiser framework that leverages gradients from an accurate Deep Learning (DL) model trained on the target data -- regardless of the specific task -- to detect and adjust noisy samples. Unlike conventional approaches, DenoGrad dynamically corrects noisy instances, preserving problem's data distribution, and improving AI models robustness. DenoGrad is validated on both tabular and time series datasets under various noise settings against the state-of-the-art. DenoGrad outperforms existing denoising strategies, enhancing the performance of interpretable IA models while standing out as the only high quality approach that preserves the original data distribution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u6846\u67b6DenoGrad\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4fee\u6b63\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u53bb\u566a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u5e38\u4f1a\u6539\u53d8\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDenoGrad\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6765\u52a8\u6001\u4fee\u6b63\u566a\u58f0\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8868\u683c\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cDenoGrad\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u53bb\u566a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u662f\u552f\u4e00\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DenoGrad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u4fee\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002"}}

Experimental results are a core component of scientific work, often presented in varying formats such as tables or charts. Understanding how robust current multimodal large language models (multimodal LLMs) are at verifying scientific claims across different evidence formats remains an important and underexplored challenge. In this paper, we design and conduct a series of experiments to assess the ability of multimodal LLMs to verify scientific claims using both tables and charts as evidence. To enable this evaluation, we adapt two existing datasets of scientific papers by incorporating annotations and structures necessary for a multimodal claim verification task. Using this adapted dataset, we evaluate 12 multimodal LLMs and find that current models perform better with table-based evidence while struggling with chart-based evidence. We further conduct human evaluations and observe that humans maintain strong performance across both formats, unlike the models. Our analysis also reveals that smaller multimodal LLMs (under 8B) show weak correlation in performance between table-based and chart-based tasks, indicating limited cross-modal generalization. These findings highlight a critical gap in current models' multimodal reasoning capabilities. We suggest that future multimodal LLMs should place greater emphasis on improving chart understanding to better support scientific claim verification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u79d1\u5b66\u4e3b\u5f20\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8868\u683c\u8bc1\u636e\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u56fe\u8868\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u683c\u5f0f\u4e0b\u5747\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u5f3a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u79d1\u5b66\u8bba\u6587\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u534f\u52a9\u5ba1\u7a3f\u4eba\u8bc4\u4f30\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u5f20\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5e38\u4ee5\u8868\u683c\u6216\u56fe\u8868\u5f62\u5f0f\u5448\u73b0\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bc1\u636e\u683c\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u4e3b\u5f20\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u4e24\u4e2a\u73b0\u6709\u79d1\u5b66\u8bba\u6587\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u52a0\u5165\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e3b\u5f20\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4efb\u52a1\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8612\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8868\u683c\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u56fe\u8868\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u683c\u5f0f\u4e0b\u5747\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u5f3a\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5c0f\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u4f4e\u4e8e8B\uff09\u5728\u8868\u683c\u548c\u56fe\u8868\u4efb\u52a1\u4e4b\u95f4\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8f83\u5f31\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u66f4\u91cd\u89c6\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u56fe\u8868\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u652f\u6301\u79d1\u5b66\u4e3b\u5f20\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

A prominent approach to tackle such problems is to compile their constraints away, leading to a problem that is supported by state-of-the-art planners. Unfortunately, existing compilers do not scale on problems with a large number of objects and high-arity actions, as they necessitate grounding the problem before compilation. To address this issue, we propose two methods for compiling away constraints without grounding, making them suitable for large-scale planning problems.

Most existing methods for traffic signal modeling often rely on the original data modality, i.e., numerical direct readings from the sensors in cities. However, this unimodal approach overlooks the semantic information existing in multimodal heterogeneous urban data in different perspectives, which hinders a comprehensive understanding of traffic signals and limits the accurate prediction of complex traffic dynamics. To address this problem, we propose a novel \\textit{M}ultimodal framework, \\textit{MTP}, for urban \\textit{T}raffic \\textit{P}rofiling, which learns multimodal features through numeric, visual, and textual perspectives. The three branches drive for a multimodal perspective of urban traffic signal learning in the frequency domain, while the frequency learning strategies delicately refine the information for extraction. Specifically, we first conduct the visual augmentation for the traffic signals, which transforms the original modality into frequency images and periodicity images for visual learning. Also, we augment descriptive texts for the traffic signals based on the specific topic, background information and item description for textual learning. To complement the numeric information, we utilize frequency multilayer perceptrons for learning on the original modality. We design a hierarchical contrastive learning on the three branches to fuse the spectrum of three modalities.

However, extracting valuable insights requires real-time processing of vast amounts of data. A major challenge in existing systems is their exposure to event-related biases, which negatively affects their ability to generalize to emerging events. While recent advancements in debiasing and causal learning offer promising solutions, they remain underexplored in the disaster event domain. In this work, we approach bias mitigation through a causal lens and propose a method to reduce event- and domain-related biases, enhancing generalization to future events.

Nonetheless, existing neural solvers typically struggle to generalize effectively from synthetic, uniformly-distributed training data to real-world VRP scenarios, including widely recognized benchmark instances from TSPLib and CVRPLib. To bridge this generalization gap, we present Evolutionary Realistic Instance Synthesis (EvoReal), which leverages an evolutionary module guided by large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic instances characterized by diverse and realistic structural patterns. Specifically, the evolutionary module produces synthetic instances whose structural attributes statistically mimics those observed in authentic real-world instances. Subsequently, pre-trained NCO models are progressively refined, firstly aligning them with these structurally enriched synthetic distributions and then further adapting them through direct fine-tuning on actual benchmark instances.

Furthermore, many of these approaches rely on LLMs to directly retrieve evidence from KGs, and to self-assess the sufficiency of this evidence, which often results in premature or incorrect reasoning. To address the retrieval and reasoning failures, we propose ProgRAG, a multi-hop knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) framework that decomposes complex questions into sub-questions, and progressively extends partial reasoning paths by answering each sub-question. At each step, external retrievers gather candidate evidence, which is then refined through uncertainty-aware pruning by the LLM.

To address this, we propose Text2SQL-Flow, a SQL-aware data augmentation framework that generates large-scale, semantically valid, and structurally diverse Text-to-SQL pairs from minimal seed data. It operates across six augmentation dimensions and integrates an end-to-end pipeline featuring SQL execution verification, natural language question generation, chain-of-thought reasoning traces, and data classification. A modular Database Manager ensures cross-database compatibility and scalability. Using this framework, we build SQLFlow, a high-quality dataset of 89,544 annotated examples. We evaluate SQLFlow in two settings: (1) For open-source LLMs, fine-tuning on SQLFlow consistently improves performance across benchmarks under the same data budget. (2) For closed-source LLMs, we introduce a masked alignment retrieval method that treats SQLFlow as both knowledge base and training data for the retriever.

These methods typically rely on single-step Bellman updates, where the heuristic of a state is updated based on its best neighbor and the corresponding edge cost.

Existing selection methods, often based on features like text quality, diversity, or task relevance, typically overlook the intrinsic linguistic structure of multilingual data. In this paper, we propose LangGPS, a lightweight two-stage pre-selection framework guided by language separability which quantifies how well samples in different languages can be distinguished in the model's representation space. LangGPS first filters training data based on separability scores and then refines the subset using existing selection methods. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks and 22 languages demonstrate that applying LangGPS on top of existing selection methods improves their effectiveness and generalizability in multilingual training, especially for understanding tasks and low-resource languages. Further analysis reveals that highly separable samples facilitate the formation of clearer language boundaries and support faster adaptation, while low-separability samples tend to function as bridges for cross-lingual alignment. Besides, we also find that language separability can serve as an effective signal for multilingual curriculum learning, where interleaving samples with diverse separability levels yields stable and generalizable gains.

This delay primarily arises from the autoregressive generation of speech tokens and the reliance on complex flow-matching models for speech synthesis.

Our model directly generates multi-codebook speech tokens, thus eliminating the need for a latency-inducing flow-matching model. Furthermore, our MTP strategy enhances generation efficiency and improves overall performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VocalNet-M2 achieves a substantial reduction in first chunk latency (from approximately 725ms to 350ms) while maintaining competitive performance across mainstream SLMs. This work also provides a comprehensive comparison of single-codebook and multi-codebook strategies, offering valuable insights for developing efficient and high-performance SLMs for real-time interactive applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "VocalNet-M2\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u53e3\u8bed\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u7801\u672c\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u548c\u591a\u6807\u8bb0\u9884\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u53e3\u8bed\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u8f83\u5927\u54cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "VocalNet-M2\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u591a\u7801\u672c\u6807\u8bb0\u5668\u548c\u591a\u6807\u8bb0\u9884\u6d4b\uff08MTP\uff09\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u751f\u6210\u591a\u7801\u672c\u8bed\u97f3\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cVocalNet-M2\u5c06\u9996\u6bb5\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4ece725ms\u964d\u4f4e\u5230350ms\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u4e3b\u6d41\u53e3\u8bed\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u4ec5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u7801\u672c\u4e0e\u591a\u7801\u672c\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9ad8\u6027\u80fdSLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating single-round interactions and conversational features, neglecting the complexities of multi-round communication and critical capabilities such as instruction following and safety. Evaluating FD-SLMs in multi-round settings poses significant challenges, including blurred turn boundaries in communication and context inconsistency during model inference.

However, as adversaries increasingly imitate the style of authentic news, the effectiveness of such approaches is gradually diminishing. Recent research has explored incorporating large language models (LLMs) to enhance fake news detection.

In this paper, we propose a novel fake news detection framework, dubbed FactGuard, that leverages LLMs to extract event-centric content, thereby reducing the impact of writing style on detection performance. Furthermore, our approach introduces a dynamic usability mechanism that identifies contradictions and ambiguous cases in factual reasoning, adaptively incorporating LLM advice to improve decision reliability. To ensure efficiency and practical deployment, we employ knowledge distillation to derive FactGuard-D, enabling the framework to operate effectively in cold-start and resource-constrained scenarios.

Motivated by the analysis of the reason, a novel perplexity-aware reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to rectify the evaluation preference, elevating the critiquing capability. Specifically, to probe into LLMs' critiquing characteristics, a One-to-many Problem-Solution (OPS) benchmark is meticulously constructed to quantify the behavior difference of LLMs when evaluating the problem solutions generated by itself and others. Then, to investigate the behavior difference in depth, we conduct a statistical preference analysis oriented on perplexity and find an intriguing phenomenon -- ``LLMs incline to judge solutions with lower perplexity as correct'', which is dubbed as \\textit{imbalanced evaluation preference}. To rectify this preference, we regard perplexity as the baton in the algorithm of Group Relative Policy Optimization, supporting the LLMs to explore trajectories that judge lower perplexity as wrong and higher perplexity as correct.

We propose a formal framework to audit privacy leakage using abductive explanations, which identifies minimal sufficient evidence justifying model decisions and determines whether sensitive information disclosed. Our framework formalizes both individual and system-level leakage, introducing the notion of Potentially Applicable Explanations (PAE) to identify individuals whose outcomes can shield those with sensitive features. This approach provides rigorous privacy guarantees while producing human understandable explanations, a key requirement for auditing tools. Experimental evaluation on the German Credit Dataset illustrates how the importance of sensitive literal in the model decision process affects privacy leakage.

This paper introduces ATR4CH (Adaptive Text-to-RDF for Cultural Heritage), a systematic five-step methodology for Large Language Model-based Knowledge Extraction from Cultural Heritage documents. We validate the methodology through a case study on authenticity assessment debates. Methodology - ATR4CH combines annotation models, ontological frameworks, and LLM-based extraction through iterative development: foundational analysis, annotation schema development, pipeline architecture, integration refinement, and comprehensive evaluation. We demonstrate the approach using Wikipedia articles about disputed items (documents, artifacts...), implementing a sequential pipeline with three LLMs (Claude Sonnet 3.7, Llama 3.3 70B, GPT-4o-mini). Findings - The methodology successfully extracts complex Cultural Heritage knowledge: 0.96-0.99 F1 for metadata extraction, 0.7-0.8 F1 for entity recognition, 0.65-0.75 F1 for hypothesis extraction, 0.95-0.97 for evidence extraction, and 0.62 G-EVAL for discourse representation. Smaller models performed competitively, enabling cost-effective deployment. Originality - This is the first systematic methodology for coordinating LLM-based extraction with Cultural Heritage ontologies. ATR4CH provides a replicable framework adaptable across CH domains and institutional resources. Research Limitations - The produced KG is limited to Wikipedia articles.

With the goal of auto-formalizing mathematical results at the research level, we develop a framework for structure-to-instance theorem autoformalization (SITA), which systematically bridges the gap between abstract mathematical theories and their concrete applications in Lean proof assistant. Formalized abstract structures are treated as modular templates that contain definitions, assumptions, operations, and theorems. These templates serve as reusable guides for the formalization of concrete instances.

As external knowledge repositories continue to expand and the parametric knowledge within models becomes outdated, a critical challenge for RAG systems is resolving conflicts between retrieved external information and LLMs' internal knowledge, which can significantly compromise the accuracy and reliability of generated content. However, existing approaches to conflict resolution typically operate at the token or semantic level, often leading to fragmented and partial understanding of factual discrepancies between LLMs' knowledge and context, particularly in knowledge-intensive tasks. To address this limitation, we propose TruthfulRAG, the first framework that leverages Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to resolve factual-level knowledge conflicts in RAG systems. Specifically, TruthfulRAG constructs KGs by systematically extracting triples from retrieved content, utilizes query-based graph retrieval to identify relevant knowledge, and employs entropy-based filtering mechanisms to precisely locate conflicting elements and mitigate factual inconsistencies, thereby enabling LLMs to generate faithful and accurate responses. Extensive experiments reveal that TruthfulRAG outperforms existing methods, effectively alleviating knowledge conflicts and improving the robustness and trustworthiness of RAG systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTruthfulRAG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u89e3\u51b3RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7ea7\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u4e0d\u65ad\u6269\u5927\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u77e5\u8bc6\u53d8\u5f97\u8fc7\u65f6\uff0cRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u68c0\u7d22\u5230\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0eLLMs\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u8fd9\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "TruthfulRAG\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ece\u68c0\u7d22\u5185\u5bb9\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u6784\u5efa\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u56fe\u8c31\u68c0\u7d22\u8bc6\u522b\u76f8\u5173\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u8fc7\u6ee4\u673a\u5236\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u51b2\u7a81\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTruthfulRAG\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "TruthfulRAG\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5229\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u89e3\u51b3RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7ea7\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

In particular, we show how base LLMs generate logically valid or invalid conclusions as coincidental byproducts of conforming to purely linguistic patterns of statistical plausibility. This fundamental mismatch challenges the assumptions that (a) base LLMs' outputs can be assessed as their bona fide attempts at correct answers or conclusions; and (b) conclusions about base LLMs' reasoning can generalize to post-trained LLMs optimized for successful instruction-following.

Formal frameworks for analogical inference have been developed for Boolean domains, where inference is provably sound for affine functions and approximately correct for functions close to affine. These results have informed the design of analogy-based classifiers. However, they do not extend to regression tasks or continuous domains. In this paper, we revisit analogical inference from a foundational perspective. We first present a counterexample showing that existing generalization bounds fail even in the Boolean setting. We then introduce a unified framework for analogical reasoning in real-valued domains based on parameterized analogies defined via generalized means.

However, computing a step-wise explanation is computationally expensive, limiting the scope of problems for which it can be used. We investigate how we can use proofs generated by a constraint solver as a starting point for computing step-wise explanations, instead of computing them step-by-step.

We then propose several methods for converting a proof to a step-wise explanation sequence, with special attention to trimming and simplification techniques to keep the sequence and its individual steps small.

Each step consists of a set of constraints that derive an assignment to one or more decision variables. However, many candidate explanation steps exist, with different sets of constraints and different decisions they derive. To identify the most comprehensible one, a user-defined objective function is required to quantify the quality of each step. However, defining a good objective function is challenging. Here, interactive preference elicitation methods from the wider machine learning community can offer a way to learn user preferences from pairwise comparisons. We investigate the feasibility of this approach for step-wise explanations and address several limitations that distinguish it from elicitation for standard combinatorial problems. First, because the explanation quality is measured using multiple sub-objectives that can vary a lot in scale, we propose two dynamic normalization techniques to rescale these features and stabilize the learning process. We also observed that many generated comparisons involve similar explanations.

Yet, their ability to handle hyper-local knowledge remains poorly understood. This gap is increasingly consequential as real-world applications, from civic platforms to community journalism, demand AI systems that can reason about neighborhood-specific dynamics, cultural narratives, and local governance. Existing benchmarks fall short in capturing this complexity, often relying on coarse-grained data or isolated references. We present LocalBench, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs on county-level local knowledge across the United States. Grounded in the Localness Conceptual Framework, LocalBench includes 14,782 validated question-answer pairs across 526 U.S. counties in 49 states, integrating diverse sources such as Census statistics, local subreddit discourse, and regional news. It spans physical, cognitive, and relational dimensions of locality. Using LocalBench, we evaluate 13 state-of-the-art LLMs under both closed-book and web-augmented settings. Our findings reveal critical limitations: even the best-performing models reach only 56.8% accuracy on narrative-style questions and perform below 15.5% on numerical reasoning. Moreover, larger model size and web augmentation do not guarantee better performance, for example, search improves Gemini's accuracy by +13.6%, but reduces GPT-series performance by -11.4%. These results underscore the urgent need for language models that can support equitable, place-aware AI systems: capable of engaging with the diverse, fine-grained realities of local communities across geographic and cultural contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86LocalBench\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u53bf\u7ea7\u672c\u5730\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672c\u5730\u77e5\u8bc6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b8f\u89c2\u5730\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5df2\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8d85\u672c\u5730\u77e5\u8bc6\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4ecd\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u8fd9\u5bf9\u9700\u8981AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u89e3\u793e\u533a\u7279\u5b9a\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u6587\u5316\u53d9\u8ff0\u548c\u5730\u65b9\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLocalBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eLocalness\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec14,782\u4e2a\u7ecf\u8fc7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u95ee\u9898-\u7b54\u6848\u5bf9\uff0c\u8986\u76d649\u4e2a\u5dde\u7684526\u4e2a\u53bf\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u4eba\u53e3\u666e\u67e5\u6570\u636e\u3001\u672c\u5730subreddit\u8ba8\u8bba\u548c\u533a\u57df\u65b0\u95fb\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8613\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684LLMs\u3002", "result": "\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u6700\u4f18\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53d9\u8ff0\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e5f\u53ea\u670956.8%\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u503c\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4f4e\u4e8e15.5%\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u7f51\u9875\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0d\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u641c\u7d22\u4f7fGemini\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86+13.6%\uff0c\u4f46\u4f7fGPT\u7cfb\u5217\u6027\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86-11.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5bf9\u80fd\u591f\u652f\u6301\u516c\u5e73\u3001\u5177\u6709\u5730\u65b9\u610f\u8bc6\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u5730\u65b9\u793e\u533a\u5728\u5730\u7406\u548c\u6587\u5316\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u3002"}}

These methods exhibit fundamental limitations when addressing knowledge-intensive tasks, as they operate within fixed parametric boundaries rather than providing the factual knowledge, terminology precision, and reasoning patterns required in specialized domains. To address these limitations, we propose Knowledge-Provision-based Prompt Optimization (KPPO), a framework that reformulates prompt optimization as systematic knowledge integration rather than potential elicitation. KPPO introduces three key innovations: 1) a knowledge gap filling mechanism for knowledge gap identification and targeted remediation; 2) a batch-wise candidate evaluation approach that considers both performance improvement and distributional stability; 3) an adaptive knowledge pruning strategy that balances performance and token efficiency, reducing up to 29% token usage. Extensive evaluation on 15 knowledge-intensive benchmarks from various domains demonstrates KPPO's superiority over elicitation-based methods, with an average performance improvement of ~6% over the strongest baseline while achieving comparable or lower token consumption.

Rigorous evaluation and effective training for such capabilities are hindered by the lack of high-quality, human-annotated benchmarks and reliable, interpretable reward signals. In this work, we introduce AdvancedIF (we will release this benchmark soon), a comprehensive benchmark featuring over 1,600 prompts and expert-curated rubrics that assess LLMs ability to follow complex, multi-turn, and system-level instructions. We further propose RIFL (Rubric-based Instruction-Following Learning), a novel post-training pipeline that leverages rubric generation, a finetuned rubric verifier, and reward shaping to enable effective reinforcement learning for instruction following. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RIFL substantially improves the instruction-following abilities of LLMs, achieving a 6.7% absolute gain on AdvancedIF and strong results on public benchmarks.

The core component is a low-level language that defines the rules by a finite automaton. It is minimal with only a few mechanisms, which makes it easy for automatic processing (by agents, analysis, optimization, etc.). The language is universal for the class of all finite turn-based games with imperfect information. Higher-level languages are introduced for game design (by humans or Procedural Content Generation), which are eventually translated to a low-level language.

In this work, we systematically study how linguistic styles such as fear or curiosity can reframe harmful intent and elicit unsafe responses from aligned models. We construct style-augmented jailbreak benchmark by transforming prompts from 3 standard datasets into 11 distinct linguistic styles using handcrafted templates and LLM-based rewrites, while preserving semantic intent. Evaluating 16 open- and close-source instruction-tuned models, we find that stylistic reframing increases jailbreak success rates by up to +57 percentage points. Styles such as fearful, curious and compassionate are most effective and contextualized rewrites outperform templated variants.\n  To mitigate this, we introduce a style neutralization preprocessing step using a secondary LLM to strip manipulative stylistic cues from user inputs, significantly reducing jailbreak success rates.

While existing benchmarks have advanced the field, our work addresses fundamental challenges in statistical power, data generation consistency, and evaluation flexibility that limit current memory evaluation frameworks. We examine the relationship between conversational memory and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). While these systems share fundamental architectural patterns--temporal reasoning, implicit extraction, knowledge updates, and graph representations--memory systems have a unique characteristic: they start from zero and grow progressively with each conversation. This characteristic enables naive approaches that would be impractical for traditional RAG. Consistent with recent findings on long context effectiveness, we observe that simple full-context approaches achieve 70-82% accuracy even on our most challenging multi-message evidence cases, while sophisticated RAG-based memory systems like Mem0 achieve only 30-45% when operating on conversation histories under 150 interactions. Our analysis reveals practical transition points: long context excels for the first 30 conversations, remains viable with manageable trade-offs up to 150 conversations, and typically requires hybrid or RAG approaches beyond that point as costs and latencies become prohibitive. These patterns indicate that the small-corpus advantage of conversational memory--where exhaustive search and complete reranking are feasible--deserves dedicated research attention rather than simply applying general RAG solutions to conversation histories.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b75,336\u4e2a\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u7528\u6237\u4e8b\u5b9e\u3001\u52a9\u624b\u56de\u5fc6\u3001\u56de\u907f\u3001\u504f\u597d\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u9690\u542b\u8054\u7cfb\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u7c7b\u522b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u529f\u6548\u3001\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u7b80\u5355\u5168\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u590d\u6742RAG\u57fa\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982Mem0\uff09\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5386\u53f2\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u8f6c\u6362\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u7b80\u5355\u5168\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6d88\u606f\u8bc1\u636e\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523070-82%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u800cRAG\u57fa\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5c11\u4e8e150\u6b21\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5386\u53f2\u4e2d\u4ec5\u8fbe\u523030-45%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u5c0f\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4f18\u52bf\u503c\u5f97\u4e13\u95e8\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5e94\u9488\u5bf9\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5386\u53f2\u5f00\u53d1\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u7b80\u5355\u5730\u5c06\u901a\u7528RAG\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5386\u53f2\u3002"}}

While more traditional perspectives on genre have emphasized form, contemporary scholarship has invoked both formal and institutional characteristics in its taxonomy of genre, genre fiction, and literary fiction. This project uses computational methods to explore the soundness of genre as a formal designation as opposed to an institutional one. Pulling from Andrew Piper's CONLIT dataset of Contemporary Literature, we assemble a corpus of literary and genre fiction, with the latter category containing romance, mystery, and science fiction novels. We use Welch's ANOVA to compare the distribution of narrative features according to author gender within each genre and within genre versus literary fiction. Then, we use logistic regression to model the effect that each feature has on literary classification and to measure how author gender moderates these effects. Finally, we analyze stylistic and semantic vector representations of our genre categories to understand the importance of form and content in literary classification. This project finds statistically significant formal markers of each literary category and illustrates how female authorship narrows and blurs the target for achieving literary status.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a2\u8ba8\u4f53\u88c1\uff08genre\uff09\u662f\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0a\u7684\u8fd8\u662f\u5236\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4f53\u88c1\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5df2\u7ecf\u88ab\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u6570\u5343\u5e74\uff0c\u4f46\u4f53\u88c1\u5c0f\u8bf4\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e00\u8ba8\u8bba\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u65b0\u5c42\u6b21\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u70b9\u5f3a\u8c03\u4f53\u88c1\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u800c\u5f53\u4ee3\u5b66\u672f\u5219\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5f62\u5f0f\u548c\u5236\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u4f53\u88c1\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "method": "\u4eceAndrew Piper\u7684CONLIT\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u6536\u96c6\u6587\u5b66\u548c\u4f53\u88c1\u5c0f\u8bf4\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6d6a\u6f2b\u3001\u60ac\u7591\u548c\u79d1\u5e7b\u5c0f\u8bf4\u3002\u4f7f\u7528Welch's ANOVA\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u6027\u522b\u4f5c\u8005\u5728\u5404\u4f53\u88c1\u548c\u6587\u5b66\u5c0f\u8bf4\u4e2d\u7684\u53d9\u4e8b\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u6587\u5b66\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u4f5c\u8005\u6027\u522b\u7684\u8c03\u8282\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4f53\u88c1\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5411\u91cf\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6bcf\u79cd\u6587\u5b66\u7c7b\u522b\u90fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u5973\u6027\u4f5c\u8005\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u7f29\u5c0f\u5e76\u6a21\u7cca\u4e86\u83b7\u5f97\u6587\u5b66\u5730\u4f4d\u7684\u754c\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f53\u88c1\u5206\u7c7b\u65e2\u6709\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0a\u7684\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u4e5f\u53d7\u5230\u4f5c\u8005\u6027\u522b\u7b49\u5236\u5ea6\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Existing approaches primarily fall into two categories: token compression, which sacrifices fine-grained details; and introducing external retrievers, which increase system complexity and prevent end-to-end optimization. To address these issues, we conduct an in-depth analysis and observe that MLLMs exhibit a human-like coarse-to-fine reasoning pattern: early Transformer layers attend broadly across the document, while deeper layers focus on relevant evidence pages. Motivated by this insight, we posit that the inherent evidence localization capabilities of MLLMs can be explicitly leveraged to perform retrieval during the reasoning process, facilitating efficient long document understanding. To this end, we propose URaG, a simple-yet-effective framework that Unifies Retrieval and Generation within a single MLLM. URaG introduces a lightweight cross-modal retrieval module that converts the early Transformer layers into an efficient evidence selector, identifying and preserving the most relevant pages while discarding irrelevant content. This design enables the deeper layers to concentrate computational resources on pertinent information, improving both accuracy and efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that URaG achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing computational overhead by 44-56%.
