Our key insight\nto this ill-posed problem is that by first estimating Bracketed 3D Gaussians\n(i.e., with different exposures) from single-exposure multi-view LDR images, we\nmay then be able to merge these bracketed 3D Gaussians into an HDR scene\nrepresentation. Specifically, SeHDR first learns base 3D Gaussians from\nsingle-exposure LDR inputs, where the spherical harmonics parameterize colors\nin a linear color space. We then estimate multiple 3D Gaussians with identical\ngeometry but varying linear colors conditioned on exposure manipulations.\nFinally, we propose the Differentiable Neural Exposure Fusion (NeEF) to\nintegrate the base and estimated 3D Gaussians into HDR Gaussians for novel view\nrendering.

Thus, reliable AI-text detection is needed for fair assessment\nto safeguard human authenticity and cultivate trust in digital communication.\nIn this study, we investigate how well current machine learning (ML) approaches\ncan distinguish ChatGPT-3.5-generated texts from human-written texts employing\na labeled data set of 250 pairs of abstracts from a wide range of research\ntopics. We test and compare both classical (Logistic Regression armed with\nclassical Bag-of-Words, POS, and TF-IDF features) and transformer-based (BERT\naugmented with N-grams, DistilBERT, BERT with a lightweight custom classifier,\nand LSTM-based N-gram models) ML detection techniques. As we aim to assess each\nmodel's performance in detecting AI-generated research texts, we also aim to\ntest whether an ensemble of these models can outperform any single detector.\nResults show DistilBERT achieves the overall best performance, while Logistic\nRegression and BERT-Custom offer solid, balanced alternatives; LSTM- and\nBERT-N-gram approaches lag. The max voting ensemble of the three best models\nfails to surpass DistilBERT itself, highlighting the primacy of a single\ntransformer-based representation over mere model diversity.

However, traditional approaches face significant\nchallenges when training Artificial Intelligence (AI) scheduling inferences\noffline, particularly due to the complexities involved in constructing a\ncomprehensive Multi-Schedule Graph (MSG) that accounts for all possible\nscenarios. The process of generating an MSG that captures the vast probability\nspace, especially when considering context events like hardware failures, slack\nvariations, or mode changes, is resource-intensive and often infeasible. To\naddress these challenges, we propose an adaptive online learning unit\nintegrated within the metascheduler to enhance performance in real-time. The\nprimary motivation for developing this unit stems from the limitations of\noffline training, where the MSG created is inherently a subset of the complete\nspace, focusing only on the most probable and critical context events.

It has three functions: (1) semantically\nsearching and identifying existing claims and/or visuals that resonate with the\nvoice of consumers; (2) generating and/or optimizing claims based on a product\ndescription and a consumer profile; and (3) ranking generated and/or manually\ncreated claims using simulations via synthetic consumers. Applications in a\nconsumer packaged goods (CPG) company have shown very promising results. We\nbelieve that this capability is broadly useful and applicable across product\ncategories and industries. We share our learning to encourage the research and\napplication of generative AI in different industries."}

Deep learning-based object detectors promise to address these\nchallenges, but they demand a large-scale, diverse dataset that captures the\nreal-world complexities. Moreover, deploying these models in practical\nscenarios often requires the right accuracy/speed/memory trade-off in model\nselection. This study presents a novel comparative benchmark analysis of\nadvanced real-time object detectors, including YOLO (You Only Look Once)\n(v8-v12) and RT-DETR (Real-Time Detection Transformers) (v1-v2) families,\nconsisting of 36 model variants, evaluated on a newly curated dataset for\nblueberry detection. This dataset comprises 661 canopy images collected with\nsmartphones during the 2022-2023 seasons, consisting of 85,879 labelled\ninstances (including 36,256 ripe and 49,623 unripe blueberries) across a wide\nrange of lighting conditions, occlusions, and fruit maturity stages. Among the\nYOLO models, YOLOv12m achieved the best accuracy with a mAP@50 of 93.3%, while\nRT-DETRv2-X obtained a mAP@50 of 93.6%, the highest among all the RT-DETR\nvariants. The inference time varied with the model scale and complexity, and\nthe mid-sized models appeared to offer a good accuracy-speed balance. To\nfurther enhance detection performance, all the models were fine-tuned using\nUnbiased Mean Teacher-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) on a separate set of\n1,035 unlabeled images acquired by a ground-based machine vision platform in\n2024. This resulted in accuracy gains ranging from -1.4% to 2.9%, with\nRT-DETR-v2-X achieving the best mAP@50 of 94.8%. More in-depth research into\nSSL is needed to better leverage cross-domain unlabeled data.

Existing\nmachine learning and large language model (LLM) based approaches often struggle\nto balance these goals. Many models yield accurate but unclear statistical\noutputs, while others generate fluent but statistically unsupported narratives,\noften undermining both the validity of the explanation and the predictive\naccuracy itself. This shortcoming comes from a shallow interaction with the\ndata, preventing the development of a deep, detailed understanding similar to a\nhuman expert's. We argue that high accuracy and high-quality explanations are\nnot separate objectives but are mutually reinforcing outcomes of a model that\ndevelops a deep, direct understanding of the data. To achieve this, we propose\nthe Reflective Cognitive Architecture (RCA), a novel framework that coordinates\nmultiple LLMs to learn from direct experience. RCA features an iterative rule\nrefinement mechanism that improves its logic from prediction errors and a\ndistribution-aware rules check mechanism that bases its reasoning in the\ndataset's global statistics. By using predictive accuracy as a signal to drive\ndeeper comprehension, RCA builds a strong internal model of the data. We\nevaluated RCA on one private and two public datasets against 22 baselines. The\nresults demonstrate that RCA not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and\nrobustness with a relative improvement of up to 40\\% over the baseline but,\nmore importantly, leverages this deep understanding to excel in generating\nexplanations that are clear, logical, evidence-based, and balanced,\nhighlighting its potential for creating genuinely trustworthy clinical decision\nsupport systems.

Clinical\ndecision-making rarely relies on a single answer but instead considers multiple\noptions, reducing the risks of narrow perspectives. Yet current MRMs are\ntypically trained to produce only one answer, even in open-ended settings. We\npropose an alternative format: ranked lists and investigate two approaches:\nprompting and fine-tuning. While prompting is a cost-effective way to steer an\nMRM's response, not all MRMs generalize well across different answer formats:\nchoice, short text, and list answers. Based on our prompting findings, we train\nand evaluate MRMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement\nfine-tuning (RFT). SFT teaches a model to imitate annotated responses, and RFT\nincentivizes exploration through the responses that maximize a reward. We\npropose new reward functions targeted at ranked-list answer formats, and\nconduct ablation studies for RFT. Our results show that while some SFT models\ngeneralize to certain answer formats, models trained with RFT are more robust\nacross multiple formats. We also present a case study on a modified MedQA with\nmultiple valid answers, finding that although MRMs might fail to select the\nbenchmark's preferred ground truth, they can recognize valid answers.

Producing a mask that yields desirable result is\ndifficult, requires background knowledge, might be model dependent, and in some\ncases impossible with the masking-based approach (e.g. trying on a long-sleeve\nshirt with \"sleeves rolled up\" styling on a person wearing long-sleeve shirt\nwith sleeves down, where the mask will necessarily cover the entire sleeve).\nInstructVTON leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) and image segmentation\nmodels for automated binary mask generation. These masks are generated based on\nuser-provided images and free-text style instructions. InstructVTON simplifies\nthe end-user experience by removing the necessity of a precisely drawn mask,\nand by automating execution of multiple rounds of image generation for try-on\nscenarios that cannot be achieved with masking-based virtual try-on models\nalone. We show that InstructVTON is interoperable with existing virtual try-on\nmodels to achieve state-of-the-art results with styling control."}

We investigate why\ncertain vision architectures are inherently more robust to additive Gaussian\nnoise and convert these empirical insights into simple, actionable design\nrules. Specifically, we performed extensive evaluations on 1,174 pretrained\nvision models, empirically identifying four consistent design patterns for\nimproved robustness against Gaussian noise: larger stem kernels, smaller input\nresolutions, average pooling, and supervised vision transformers (ViTs) rather\nthan CLIP ViTs, which yield up to 506 rank improvements and 21.6\\%p accuracy\ngains. We then develop a theoretical analysis that explains these findings,\nconverting observed correlations into causal mechanisms. First, we prove that\nlow-pass stem kernels attenuate noise with a gain that decreases quadratically\nwith kernel size and that anti-aliased downsampling reduces noise energy\nroughly in proportion to the square of the downsampling factor. Second, we\ndemonstrate that average pooling is unbiased and suppresses noise in proportion\nto the pooling window area, whereas max pooling incurs a positive bias that\ngrows slowly with window size and yields a relatively higher mean-squared error\nand greater worst-case sensitivity. Third, we reveal and explain the\nvulnerability of CLIP ViTs via a pixel-space Lipschitz bound: The smaller\nnormalization standard deviations used in CLIP preprocessing amplify worst-case\nsensitivity by up to 1.91 times relative to the Inception-style preprocessing\ncommon in supervised ViTs.

Evasion attacks enable adversaries to manipulate the\ndecision-making processes of AI systems, potentially causing security breaches\nor misclassification of targets.

However, ViTs remain vulnerable to evasion attacks,\nparticularly to adversarial patches, unique patterns designed to manipulate AI\nclassification systems. These vulnerabilities are investigated by designing\nrealistic adversarial patches to cause misclassification in person vs.\nnon-person classification tasks using the Creases Transformation (CT)\ntechnique, which adds subtle geometric distortions similar to those occurring\nnaturally when wearing clothing. This study investigates the transferability of\nadversarial attack techniques used in CNNs when applied to ViT classification\nmodels.
