However, current methods remain unreliable. Without a solid theoretical footing, the refinement process can wander; sometimes it settles, sometimes it loops back, and sometimes it breaks away from any stable trajectory. This work bridges this critical gap by developing an LLM-Verifier Convergence Theorem, providing the first formal framework with provable guarantees for termination and convergence. We model the interaction between the LLM and the verifier as a discrete-time Markov Chain, with state transitions determined by a key parameter: the error-reduction probability ($\u03b4$). The procedure reaching the Verified state almost surely demonstrates that the program terminates for any $\u03b4> 0$, with an expected iteration count bounded by $\\mathbb{E}[n] \\leq 4/\u03b4$. We then stress-tested this prediction in an extensive empirical campaign comprising more than 90,000 trials. The empirical results match the theory with striking consistency. Every single run reached verification, and the convergence factor clustered tightly around $C_f\\approx$ 1.0. Consequently, the bound mirrors the system's actual behavior. The evidence is sufficiently robust to support dividing the workflow into three distinct operating zones: marginal, practical, and high-performance. Consequently, we establish the design thresholds with absolute confidence. Together, the theoretical guarantee and the experimental evidence provide a clearer architectural foundation for LLM-assisted verification. Heuristic tuning no longer has to be carried out by the system. Engineers gain a framework that supports predictable resource planning and performance budgeting, precisely what is needed before deploying these pipelines into safety-critical software environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LLM-Verifier Convergence Theorem\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5de5\u5177\u7ed3\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u7ec8\u6b62\u548c\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06LLM\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\u4e3a\u9519\u8bef\u51cf\u5c11\u6982\u7387\uff08\u03b4\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7ec8\u6b62\u6027\u548c\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc790,000\u591a\u6b21\u8bd5\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u8fd0\u884c\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u56e0\u5b50\u63a5\u8fd11.0\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3aLLM\u8f85\u52a9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u8d44\u6e90\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Yet despite these achievements, modern AI systems remain fun- damentally limited in their ability to self-monitor, self-correct, and regulate their behavior autonomously in dynamic contexts. This paper identifies and analyzes seven core deficiencies that constrain contemporary AI models: the absence of intrinsic self- monitoring, lack of meta-cognitive awareness, fixed and non- adaptive learning mechanisms, inability to restructure goals, lack of representational maintenance, insufficient embodied feedback, and the absence of intrinsic agency. Alongside identifying these limitations, we also outline a forward-looking perspective on how AI may evolve beyond them through architectures that mirror neurocognitive principles. We argue that these structural limitations prevent current architectures, including deep learning and transformer-based systems, from achieving robust general- ization, lifelong adaptability, and real-world autonomy. Drawing on a comparative analysis of artificial systems and biological cognition [7], and integrating insights from AI research, cognitive science, and neuroscience, we outline how these capabilities are absent in current models and why scaling alone cannot resolve them. We conclude by advocating for a paradigmatic shift toward cognitively grounded AI (cognitive autonomy) capable of self-directed adaptation, dynamic representation management, and intentional, goal-oriented behavior, paired with reformative oversight mechanisms [8] that ensure autonomous systems remain interpretable, governable, and aligned with human values.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u73b0\u4ee3AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e03\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5e76\u5021\u5bfc\u5411\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba4\u77e5\u539f\u7406\u7684AI\u67b6\u6784\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1AI\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u53d6\u5f97\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u81ea\u6211\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u8c03\u8282\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u4eba\u5de5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u751f\u7269\u8ba4\u77e5\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408AI\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5f53\u524dAI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u8ba4\u77e5\u539f\u5219\u7684\u65b0\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u5305\u62ec\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5185\u5728\u81ea\u6211\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u610f\u8bc6\u7b49\u5728\u5185\u7684\u4e03\u9879\u5173\u952e\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5e76\u8bba\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7f3a\u9677\u963b\u788d\u4e86AI\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u7ec8\u8eab\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3b\u5f20\u5411\u8ba4\u77e5\u57fa\u7840\u7684AI\uff08\u8ba4\u77e5\u81ea\u4e3b\uff09\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u6211\u5bfc\u5411\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u6539\u9769\u6027\u76d1\u7763\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u7ba1\u7406\u6027\u548c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing inference methods typically rely on local, immediate-step metrics such as confidence or entropy which inherently lack a more reliable perspective. This limitation frequently leads to inconsistent sampling trajectories and suboptimal generation quality. To address this, we propose Coherent Contextual Decoding (CCD), a novel inference framework built upon two core innovations. First, CCD employs a trajectory rectification mechanism that leverages historical context to enhance sequence coherence, enabling the early rejection of suboptimal paths. We demonstrate that this mechanism is theoretically equivalent to modeling the consistency of historical steps via the conditional mutual information between context and token predictions. Building on this theoretical insight, we further address the inefficiency of conventional uniform decoding budgets. Instead of rigid allocations based on diffusion steps, we introduce an adaptive sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts the unmasking budget for each step according to our consistency metric. Consequently, our method significantly improves the quality of generation trajectories while accelerating the sampling process.

Thus, oftentimes, LLMs are fine-tuned to address a specific task, given the pretrained weights of a pre-trained LLM considered a foundation model. In this work, we introduce memory-efficient, reversible architectures for LLMs, inspired by symmetric and symplectic differential equations, and investigate their theoretical properties. Different from standard, baseline architectures that store all intermediate activations, the proposed models use time-reversible dynamics to retrieve hidden states during backpropagation, relieving the need to store activations. This property allows for a drastic reduction in memory consumption, allowing for the processing of larger batch sizes for the same available memory, thereby offering improved throughput. In addition, we propose an efficient method for converting existing, non-reversible LLMs into reversible architectures through fine-tuning, rendering our approach practical for exploiting existing pre-trained models.

DI can help to improve the downstream speech related tasks even when speakers have a strong dialect. However, fine-tuning a speech model for tasks like DI is expensive in terms of computation cost and memory requirement. Recent studies have explored fine-tuning pre-trained speech models for tasks like DI using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, which offer parameter efficiency but limited improvement in memory efficiency and training speed. To address these challenges, we explore Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning (MEFT) methods, originally proposed for language processing, and apply them to the general-purpose pre-trained speech model. We then comprehensively analyze the GPU memory usage and fine-tuning speed based on various MEFT methods. As a case study, we fine-tune the Whisper model to identify six Mandarin subdialects from the KeSpeech dataset, reducing GPU memory usage by up to 73.25% and accelerating training speed by a factor of 2.1, while maintaining accuracy comparable to vanilla fine-tuning and PEFT methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff08MEFT\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u5b8c\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u65b9\u8a00\u8bc6\u522b\uff08DI\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u540c\u4e00\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u8a00\u6765\u6539\u5584\u4e0b\u6e38\u8bed\u97f3\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9DI\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u65b9\u9762\u4ee3\u4ef7\u9ad8\u6602\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff08PEFT\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u6539\u8fdb\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff08MEFT\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u79cdMEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790GPU\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u901f\u5ea6\u3002\u4ee5Whisper\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u5bf9KeSpeech\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u516d\u79cd\u666e\u901a\u8bdd\u6b21\u65b9\u8a00\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728KeSpeech\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6700\u591a\u53ef\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c1173.25%\u7684GPU\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u52a0\u5feb2.1\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u5b8c\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u548cPEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "MEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u52a0\u5feb\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u5b8c\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u548cPEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We address this critical challenge by achieving 95.5% Dice score using just 599 training images for breast cell segmentation, where just 4% of pixels represent breast tissue and 60% of images contain no breast regions. Our framework uses quantum-inspired edge enhancement via multi-scale Gabor filters creating a fourth input channel, enhancing boundary detection where inter-annotator variations reach +/- 3 pixels. We present a stabilized multi-component loss function that integrates adaptive Dice loss with boundary-aware terms and automatic positive weighting to effectively address severe class imbalance, where mammary epithelial cell regions comprise only 0.1%-20% of the total image area. Additionally, a complexity-based weighted sampling strategy is introduced to prioritize the challenging mammary epithelial cell regions. The model employs an EfficientNet-B7/UNet++ architecture with a 4-to-3 channel projection, enabling the use of pretrained weights despite limited medical imaging data. Finally, robust validation is achieved through exponential moving averaging and statistical outlier detection, ensuring reliable performance estimates on a small validation set (129 images).

To address this gap, we propose OmniGuard, the first family of omni-modal guardrails that performs safeguarding across all modalities with deliberate reasoning ability. To support the training of OMNIGUARD, we curate a large, comprehensive omni-modal safety dataset comprising over 210K diverse samples, with inputs that cover all modalities through both unimodal and cross-modal samples. Each sample is annotated with structured safety labels and carefully curated safety critiques from expert models through targeted distillation. Extensive experiments on 15 benchmarks show that OmniGuard achieves strong effectiveness and generalization across a wide range of multimodal safety scenarios.

However, current vision-language models (VLMs) struggle to maintain geometric coherence and cross-view consistency for spatial reasoning in multi-view settings. We attribute this gap to the lack of fine-grained benchmarks that isolate multi-view reasoning from single-view perception and temporal factors. To address this, we present ReMindView-Bench, a cognitively grounded benchmark for evaluating how VLMs construct, align and maintain spatial mental models across complementary viewpoints. ReMindView-Bench systematically varies viewpoint spatial pattern and query type to probe key factors of spatial cognition. Evaluations of 15 current VLMs reveals consistent failures in cross-view alignment and perspective-taking in multi-view spatial reasoning, motivating deeper analysis on the reasoning process. Explicit phase-wise analysis using LLM-as-a-judge and self-consistency prompting shows that VLMs perform well on in-frame perception but degrade sharply when integrating information across views. Implicit analysis, including linear probing and entropy dynamics, further show progressive loss of task-relevant information and uncertainty separation between correct and incorrect trajectories. These results provide a cognitively grounded diagnosis of VLM spatial reasoning and reveal how multi-view spatial mental models are formed, degraded and destabilized across reasoning phases.

The MODOMA is a computational multi-agent laboratory environment for unsupervised language acquisition experiments such that acquisition is based on the interaction between two language models, an adult and a child agent. Although this framework employs statistical as well as rule-based procedures, the result of language acquisition is a knowledge-based language model, which can be used to generate and parse new utterances of the target language. This system is fully parametrized and researchers can control all aspects of the experiments while the results of language acquisition, that is, the acquired grammatical knowledge, are explicitly represented and can be consulted. Thus, this system introduces novel possibilities for conducting computational language acquisition experiments. The experiments presented by this paper demonstrate that functional and content categories can be acquired and represented by the daughter agent based on training and test data containing different amounts of exemplars generated by the adult agent. Interestingly, similar patterns, which are well-established for human-generated data, are also found for these machine-generated data. As the procedures resulted in the successful acquisition of discrete grammatical categories by the child agent, these experiments substantiate the validity of the MODOMA approach to modelling language acquisition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecdMODOMA\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u8bed\u8a00\u4e60\u5f97\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u73af\u5883\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u8bed\u8a00\u4e60\u5f97\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u6210\u4eba\u548c\u513f\u7ae5\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff09\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u6765\u83b7\u53d6\u8bed\u8a00\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6210\u4eba\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u513f\u7ae5\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u8a00\u4e60\u5f97\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u513f\u7ae5\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u4e60\u5f97\u5e76\u8868\u5f81\u529f\u80fd\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u76f8\u4f3c\u3002", "conclusion": "MODOMA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u8bed\u8a00\u4e60\u5f97\u65b9\u9762\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\uff0c\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bed\u8a00\u4e60\u5f97\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

Inspired by techniques from autonomous driving and robotics, we investigate whether supervised learning with synthetic error injection can induce self-correction abilities in language models. Our approach inserts artificial errors into reasoning chains, masks them, and supervises the model to recognize and correct these mistakes. Despite the intuitive appeal of this method, we find that it fails to significantly improve performance even on simple synthetic tasks across multiple models. Moreover, even when the model catches its own error, it often parrots the original mistake. We find that the distribution shift of synthetic errors to on-policy errors significantly degrades the error-correction capabilities of the fine-tuned model, even with good synthetic coverage of on-policy errors. Our results help explain why on-policy reinforcement learning methods have proven uniquely effective for eliciting self-correction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5408\u6210\u9519\u8bef\u6ce8\u5165\u6765\u8bf1\u5bfc\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u6211\u7ea0\u6b63\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7528\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u7ea0\u6b63\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63a2\u7d22\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u9519\u8bef\u6ce8\u5165\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u7ea0\u6b63\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ea0\u6b63\u9519\u8bef\u65f6\u5e38\u5e38\u91cd\u590d\u539f\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5408\u6210\u9519\u8bef\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u7ea0\u6b63\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u4e3a\u4f55\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u6b64\u9886\u57df\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

A model's ability to generate such traces can be optimized with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve their utility in predicting an answer. This optimization comes at a high computational cost, especially for narrative-related tasks that involve retrieving and processing many tokens. To this end, we propose LiteReason, a latent reasoning method that can be interleaved with standard token sampling and easily combined with RL techniques. LiteReason employs a lightweight Reasoning Projector module, trained to produce continuous latent tokens that help the model 'skip' reasoning steps. During RL, the policy model decides when to activate the projector, switching between latent and discrete reasoning as needed. Experimental results on plot hole detection and book chapter generation show that our method outperforms latent reasoning baselines and comes close to matching non-latent RL training, while reducing final reasoning length by 77-92%.

Yet in practice, unguided self-evolving systems often plateau quickly or even degrade as training progresses. These failures arise from issues such as concept drift, diversity collapse, and mis-evolution, as models reinforce their own biases and converge toward low-entropy behaviors. To enable models to self-evolve in a stable and controllable manner while minimizing reliance on human supervision, we introduce R-Few, a guided Self-Play Challenger-Solver framework that incorporates lightweight human oversight through in-context grounding and mixed training. At each iteration, the Challenger samples a small set of human-labeled examples to guide synthetic question generation, while the Solver jointly trains on human and synthetic examples under an online, difficulty-based curriculum. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks, R-Few achieves consistent and iterative improvements. For example, Qwen3-8B-Base improves by +3.0 points over R-Zero on math tasks and achieves performance on par with General-Reasoner, despite the latter being trained on 20 times more human data. Ablation studies confirm the complementary contributions of grounded challenger training and curriculum-based solver training, and further analysis shows that R-Few mitigates drift, yielding more stable and controllable co-evolutionary dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "R-Few\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f0f\u81ea\u6211\u535a\u5f08\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u73b0AI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ef\u63a7\u81ea\u6211\u8fdb\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u5f15\u5bfc\u81ea\u6211\u8fdb\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e27\u5931\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u8fdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u77e5\u8bc6\u83b7\u53d6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faR-Few\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\uff1a1)\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c11\u91cf\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a5\u5730\u95ee\u9898\u751f\u6210(Challenger)\uff1b2)\u91c7\u7528\u5728\u7ebf\u96be\u5ea6\u8bfe\u7a0b\u6df7\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u6c42\u89e3\u5668(Solver)\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cQwen3-8B-Base\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347+3.0\u5206\uff0c\u4ec5\u75281/20\u4eba\u5de5\u6570\u636e\u8fbe\u5230General-Reasoner\u540c\u7b49\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63a5\u5730\u6311\u6218\u8005\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bfe\u7a0b\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\uff0cR-Few\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u8fdb\u5316\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u3002"}}

Clinical notes contain rich contextual information, but their unstructured nature limits their use in traditional predictive models. We developed and evaluated the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Outcome Prediction Engine (COPE), a reasoning-enhanced large language model framework, for predicting 90-day functional outcomes after AIS from unstructured clinical notes. This study included 464 AIS patients with discharge summaries and 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores. COPE uses a two-step CoT framework based on sequential open-source LLaMA-3-8B models: the first generates clinical reasoning, and the second outputs an mRS prediction. We compared COPE with GPT-4.1, ClinicalBERT, a structured variable-based machine learning model (Clinical ML), and a single-step LLM without CoT. Performance was evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE), accuracy within +/-1 mRS point, and exact accuracy. COPE achieved an MAE of 1.01 (95% CI 0.92-1.11), +/-1 accuracy of 74.4% (69.9, 78.8%), and exact accuracy of 32.8% (28.0, 37.6%), comparable to GPT-4.1 and superior to ClinicalBERT [MAE 1.24 (1.13-1.36)], Clinical ML [1.28 (1.18-1.39)], and the single-step LLM [1.20 (1.09-1.33)]. Subgroup analyses showed consistent performance across sex and age, with slightly higher error among older patients, those undergoing thrombectomy, and those with longer summaries.

A Closer Look at LLMs as Solution Verifiers", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) can act as both problem solvers and solution verifiers, with verifiers improving solver performance by selecting high-quality answers from a pool of candidates. However, prior studies of solver-verifier interactions have been limited, focusing mainly on self-verification and rarely examining how verifiers judge outputs from models in their own or in another model family. Modern LLMs also undergo extensive post-training, but its effect on verification remains unclear. We present a systematic study across 37 models spanning multiple families, sizes, and base vs. post-trained variants, evaluated on 9 benchmarks covering logical reasoning, structured puzzles, symbolic computation, mathematics, commonsense, factual recall, and domain knowledge. We compare self-verification with verification within the same family and across different families. To support this, we introduce and empirically validate verifier gain, a metric that predicts the performance improvements from test-time verifier-based rejection sampling. We analyze how metrics like verifier gain and false positive rate scale with model size and post-training, and characterize differences in dataset verifiability. Our findings show that cross-family verification is especially effective; post-training reduces self-improvement but strengthens cross-family improvement; and mathematical and logical tasks exhibit the highest inherent verifiability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u5145\u5f53\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u8005\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8005\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u5019\u9009\u7b54\u6848\u6c60\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7b54\u6848\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u89e3\u51b3\u8005\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u7814\u7a76\u4e8637\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u5bb6\u65cf\u3001\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u4e0e\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e869\u4e2a\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8c1c\u9898\u3001\u7b26\u53f7\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u5e38\u8bc6\u3001\u4e8b\u5b9e\u56de\u5fc6\u548c\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u540c\u4e00\u5bb6\u65cf\u5185\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u8de8\u5bb6\u65cf\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8005\u589e\u76ca\uff08verifier gain\uff09\u8fd9\u4e00\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u4e8e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u95f4\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5f88\u5c11\u63a2\u8ba8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8005\u5982\u4f55\u5224\u65ad\u540c\u4e00\u5bb6\u65cf\u6216\u4e0d\u540c\u5bb6\u65cf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4e14\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u3001\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u6db5\u76d6\u4e8637\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e0d\u540c\u5bb6\u65cf\u3001\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u4e0e\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e869\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u8de8\u5bb6\u65cf\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8005\u589e\u76ca\uff08verifier gain\uff09\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8005\u589e\u76ca\u548c\u5047\u9633\u6027\u7387\u5982\u4f55\u968f\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8de8\u5bb6\u65cf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7279\u522b\u6709\u6548\uff1b\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u51cf\u5c11\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u4f46\u589e\u5f3a\u8de8\u5bb6\u65cf\u6539\u8fdb\uff1b\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u5185\u5728\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u3002\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8005\u589e\u76ca\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8de8\u5bb6\u65cf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u7279\u522b\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u867d\u7136\u51cf\u5c11\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4f46\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u8de8\u5bb6\u65cf\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8005\u589e\u76ca\u662f\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6307\u6807\u3002"}}

Unlike traditional systems that require pre-defined graphs or specialized programming, IACT operates as a general-purpose autonomous system driven purely by user dialogue. Given a high-level objective, the system autonomously grows a dynamic, recursive agent topology incrementally tailored to the problem's structure. This allows it to scale its organizational complexity to match open-ended tasks. To mitigate the error propagation inherent in unidirectional function calls, IACT introduces interactional redundancy by replacing rigid invocations with bidirectional, stateful dialogues. This mechanism enables runtime error correction and ambiguity resolution. We describe the architecture, design principles, and practical lessons behind the production deployment of this model in the kragent.ai system, presenting qualitative evidence from real-world workflows rather than exhaustive benchmark results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578bIACT\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u9012\u5f52\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u8bdd\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u9759\u6001\u3001\u786c\u7f16\u7801\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u56fe\u6216\u4e13\u95e8\u7f16\u7a0b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002IACT\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u8bdd\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u7528\u3001\u81ea\u4e3b\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "IACT\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u9012\u5f52\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u53cc\u5411\u3001\u6709\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u53d6\u4ee3\u521a\u6027\u8c03\u7528\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4ea4\u4e92\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u9519\u8bef\u6821\u6b63\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "result": "\u5728kragent.ai\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86IACT\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "IACT\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u9759\u6001\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u653e\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Data-driven RUL prediction techniques have demonstrated commendable performance. However, their efficacy often relies on the assumption that training and testing data are drawn from the same distribution or domain, which does not hold in real industrial settings. To mitigate this domain discrepancy issue, prior adversarial domain adaptation methods focused on deriving domain-invariant features. Nevertheless, they overlook target-specific information and inconsistency characteristics pertinent to the degradation stages, resulting in suboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel domain adaptation approach for cross-domain RUL prediction named TACDA. Specifically, we propose a target domain reconstruction strategy within the adversarial adaptation process, thereby retaining target-specific information while learning domain-invariant features. Furthermore, we develop a novel clustering and pairing strategy for consistent alignment between similar degradation stages. Through extensive experiments, our results demonstrate the remarkable performance of our proposed TACDA method, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches with regard to two different evaluation metrics.

Using the EVONS and FakeNewsNet datasets, we compare textual embeddings (RoBERTa; with a control using Mistral) against lightweight numeric features (timing, follower counts, verification, likes) and sequence models (GRU, gating architectures, Transformer encoders). We show that textual content alone is a strong discriminator for fake-news detection, while numeric-only pipelines remain viable when language models are unavailable or compute is constrained. Virality prediction is markedly harder than fake-news detection and is highly sensitive to label construction; in our setup, a median-based ''viral'' split (<50 likes) is pragmatic but underestimates real-world virality, and time-censoring for engagement features is desirable yet difficult under current API limits. Dimensionality-reduction analyses suggest non-linear structure is more informative for virality than for fake-news detection (t-SNE > PCA on numeric features). Swapping RoBERTa for Mistral embeddings yields only modest deltas, leaving conclusions unchanged. We discuss implications for evaluation design and report reproducibility constraints that realistically affect the field. We release splits and code where possible and provide guidance for metric selection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5728\u7ebf\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4e24\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\uff1a\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u75c5\u6bd2\u5f0f\u4f20\u64ad\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5feb\u901f\u53cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5bf9\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u548c\u75c5\u6bd2\u5f0f\u4f20\u64ad\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528EVONS\u548cFakeNewsNet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\uff08RoBERTa\u548cMistral\uff09\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6570\u5b57\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u7c89\u4e1d\u6570\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u70b9\u8d5e\uff09\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\uff08GRU\u3001\u95e8\u63a7\u67b6\u6784\u3001Transformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u6587\u672c\u5185\u5bb9\u5bf9\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u662f\u5f3a\u5224\u522b\u5668\uff0c\u800c\u6570\u5b57\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u6216\u8ba1\u7b97\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u53ef\u884c\uff1b\u75c5\u6bd2\u5f0f\u4f20\u64ad\u9884\u6d4b\u66f4\u96be\uff0c\u5bf9\u6807\u7b7e\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff1b\u800c\u75c5\u6bd2\u5f0f\u4f20\u64ad\u9884\u6d4b\u9700\u8981\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u9650\u5236\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

While prior research has extensively studied length generalization (a model's ability to handle longer sequences than seen during training), we investigate a distinct and underexplored limitation: depth generalization. Here, depth refers to the number of nested levels in a hierarchical problem, such as the layers of parentheses in a mathematical expression or the nesting of logical clauses in a Boolean formula. Our work reveals that standard transformer architectures struggle with problems involving deeper recursion than encountered during training, even when they perform well on longer but non-nested sequences. This limitation stems from their inability to maintain stack-like behavior, the capacity to track and resolve multiple levels of nested dependencies. Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate how this architectural constraint leads to rapid performance decay as the depth of the recursion increases. To address this challenge, we develop a novel looped locate-and-replace pipeline that decomposes recursive problems into manageable subcomponents. The approach employs two specialized models: a locator that identifies solvable subexpressions and a replacer that evaluates these components while preserving the overall structure. We evaluated this method in three carefully designed domains: Boolean algebra, recursive arithmetic, and propositional logic, each with a controllable depth of recursion. We show that our method effectively alleviates the performance decay when tested on out-of-distribution recursion depth.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6807\u51c6Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9012\u5f52\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u5b9a\u4f4d-\u66ff\u6362\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u5d4c\u5957\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u957f\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u6df1\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u8fd9\u4e00\u91cd\u8981\u9650\u5236\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5faa\u73af\u5b9a\u4f4d-\u66ff\u6362\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u9012\u5f52\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u53ef\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u5b50\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5668\u8bc6\u522b\u53ef\u89e3\u5b50\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u66ff\u6362\u5668\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6574\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e03\u5c14\u4ee3\u6570\u3001\u9012\u5f52\u7b97\u672f\u548c\u547d\u9898\u903b\u8f91\u4e09\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u5728\u8d85\u51fa\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u9012\u5f52\u6df1\u5ea6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6807\u51c6Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u7531\u4e8e\u65e0\u6cd5\u7ef4\u6301\u7c7b\u4f3c\u6808\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u9012\u5f52\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u5b9a\u4f4d-\u66ff\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u9012\u5f52\u95ee\u9898\u4e3a\u5b50\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Although existing methods have advanced emotion understanding, they often suffer from reasoning drift: models gradually rely on their own generated text instead of multimodal evidence, and their explanations are overly shaped by visually initiated reasoning paths. To address these issues, we introduce Modality Importance (MI), a simple yet effective mechanism for identifying the emotion-dominant modality. Using MI, MIGR reorganizes reasoning sequences so that explanations begin from the modality most critical to the target emotion, preventing early reasoning from being misled by less informative cues. Our two-stage framework-comprising modality-aligned supervised fine-tuning and modality-aware reward optimization-encourages models to generate emotionally grounded, causally relevant, and coherence-preserving explanations. Experimental results on the DFEW benchmark show that MIGR substantially improves reasoning reliability, decreasing instances of correct predictions accompanied by emotionally inconsistent explanations from 18.10% to 7.37%.

While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in mental health applications, their size and computational demands hinder practical deployment. Small language models (SLMs) offer a lightweight alternative, but their use for social media--based mental health prediction remains largely underexplored. In this study, we introduce Menta, the first optimized SLM fine-tuned specifically for multi-task mental health prediction from social media data. Menta is jointly trained across six classification tasks using a LoRA-based framework, a cross-dataset strategy, and a balanced accuracy--oriented loss. Evaluated against nine state-of-the-art SLM baselines, Menta achieves an average improvement of 15.2\\% across tasks covering depression, stress, and suicidality compared with the best-performing non--fine-tuned SLMs. It also achieves higher accuracy on depression and stress classification tasks compared to 13B-parameter LLMs, while being approximately 3.25x smaller. Moreover, we demonstrate real-time, on-device deployment of Menta on an iPhone 15 Pro Max, requiring only approximately 3GB RAM. Supported by a comprehensive benchmark against existing SLMs and LLMs, Menta highlights the potential for scalable, privacy-preserving mental health monitoring.

To address this issue, recent work has explored ``editing'' LLM parameters to mitigate social bias with model merging approaches; however, there is no empirical comparison. In this work, we empirically survey seven algorithms: Linear, Karcher Mean, SLERP, NuSLERP, TIES, DELLA, and Nearswap, applying 13 open weight models in the GPT, LLaMA, and Qwen families. We perform a comprehensive evaluation using three bias datasets (BBQ, BOLD, and HONEST) and measure the impact of these techniques on LLM performance in downstream tasks of the SuperGLUE benchmark. We find a trade-off between bias reduction and downstream performance: methods achieving greater bias mitigation degrade accuracy, particularly on tasks requiring reading comprehension and commonsense and causal reasoning. Among the merging algorithms, Linear, SLERP, and Nearswap consistently reduce bias while maintaining overall performance, with SLERP at moderate interpolation weights emerging as the most balanced choice. These results highlight the potential of model merging algorithms for bias mitigation, while indicating that excessive debiasing or inappropriate merging methods may lead to the degradation of important linguistic abilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8c03\u67e5\u4e86\u4e03\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u51cf\u8f7b\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLMs) \u4f1a\u7ee7\u627f\u5e76\u653e\u5927\u5176\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e2d\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u8fd9\u5a01\u80c1\u5230\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u6765 \u201c\u7f16\u8f91\u201d LLM \u53c2\u6570\u4ee5\u51cf\u8f7b\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6027\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8c03\u67e5\u4e86 Linear, Karcher Mean, SLERP, NuSLERP, TIES, DELLA, \u548c Nearswap \u4e03\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728 GPT, LLaMA, \u548c Qwen \u5bb6\u65cf\u7684 13 \u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u6743\u91cd\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u4f7f\u7528 BBQ, BOLD, \u548c HONEST \u4e09\u4e2a\u504f\u89c1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6280\u672f\u5bf9 SuperGLUE \u57fa\u51c6\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u504f\u89c1\u51cf\u5c11\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5927\u504f\u89c1\u7f13\u89e3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u9605\u8bfb\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u5e38\u8bc6\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u3002\u5728\u5408\u5e76\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0cLinear, SLERP, \u548c Nearswap \u5728\u4e0d\u964d\u4f4e\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u51cf\u5c11\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d SLERP \u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u63d2\u503c\u6743\u91cd\u65f6\u6210\u4e3a\u6700\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u51cf\u8f7b\u504f\u89c1\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u8fc7\u5ea6\u53bb\u504f\u6216\u4e0d\u5f53\u7684\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u4e0b\u964d\u3002"}}

However, existing safety guardrails are predominantly tailored for high-resource languages, leaving a significant portion of the world's population underrepresented who communicate in low-resource languages. To address this, we introduce CREST (CRoss-lingual Efficient Safety Transfer), a parameter-efficient multilingual safety classification model that supports 100 languages with only 0.5B parameters. By training on a strategically chosen subset of only 13 high-resource languages, our model utilizes cluster-based cross-lingual transfer from a few to 100 languages, enabling effective generalization to both unseen high-resource and low-resource languages. This approach addresses the challenge of limited training data in low-resource settings. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across six safety benchmarks to demonstrate that CREST outperforms existing state-of-the-art guardrails of comparable scale and achieves competitive results against models with significantly larger parameter counts (2.5B parameters and above).

Decades of psychophysics research show that humans intuitively process and integrate noisy signals using near-optimal Bayesian strategies in perceptual tasks. We ask whether LLMs exhibit similar behaviour and perform optimal multimodal integration without explicit training or instruction. Adopting the psychophysics paradigm, we infer computational principles of LLMs from systematic behavioural studies. We introduce a behavioural benchmark - BayesBench: four magnitude estimation tasks (length, location, distance, and duration) over text and image, inspired by classic psychophysics, and evaluate a diverse set of nine LLMs alongside human judgments for calibration. Through controlled ablations of noise, context, and instruction prompts, we measure performance, behaviour and efficiency in multimodal cue-combination. Beyond accuracy and efficiency metrics, we introduce a Bayesian Consistency Score that detects Bayes-consistent behavioural shifts even when accuracy saturates. Our results show that while capable models often adapt in Bayes-consistent ways, accuracy does not guarantee robustness. Notably, GPT-5 Mini achieves perfect text accuracy but fails to integrate visual cues efficiently.

Rigorous quality control is also critical but tedious, ensuring that the final report meets clinical standards. Existing automated approaches, including radiology report generation methods and medical vision-language models, focus mainly on the report generation phase and neglect the crucial quality control procedure, limiting their capability to provide comprehensive support to radiologists. We propose Radiologist Copilot, an agentic AI assistant equipped with orchestrated tools designed for automated radiology reporting with quality control. Leveraging large language models as the reasoning backbone, the agentic system autonomously selects tools, plans, and executes actions, emulating the behavior of radiologists throughout the holistic radiology reporting process. The orchestrated tools include region localization, think with image paradigm directed region analysis planning, strategic template selection for report generation, quality assessment and feedback-driven adaptive refinement for quality control.

Such errors undermine trust and hinder their adoption in real-world applications. To address this challenge, two distinct research paradigms have emerged: model-centric Hallucination Detection (HD) and text-centric Fact Verification (FV). Despite sharing the same goal, these paradigms have evolved in isolation, using distinct assumptions, datasets, and evaluation protocols. This separation has created a research schism that hinders their collective progress. In this work, we take a decisive step toward bridging this divide. We introduce UniFact, a unified evaluation framework that enables direct, instance-level comparison between FV and HD by dynamically generating model outputs and corresponding factuality labels. Through large-scale experiments across multiple LLM families and detection methods, we reveal three key findings: (1) No paradigm is universally superior; (2) HD and FV capture complementary facets of factual errors; and (3) hybrid approaches that integrate both methods consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance. Beyond benchmarking, we provide the first in-depth analysis of why FV and HD diverged, as well as empirical evidence supporting the need for their unification. The comprehensive experimental results call for a new, integrated research agenda toward unifying Hallucination Detection and Fact Verification in LLMs.\n  We have open-sourced all the code, data, and baseline implementation at: https://github.com/oneal2000/UniFact/", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6UniFact\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u6bd4\u8f83\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08HD\uff09\u548c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\uff08FV\uff09\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7ecf\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5373\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u6d41\u7545\u4f46\u4e0d\u771f\u5b9e\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08HD\uff09\u548c\u4ee5\u6587\u672c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\uff08FV\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u4e24\u8005\u72ec\u7acb\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5171\u540c\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86UniFact\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u548c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u5bb6\u65cf\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\uff081\uff09\u6ca1\u6709\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6240\u6709\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u90fd\u66f4\u4f18\uff1b\uff082\uff09HD\u548cFV\u6355\u6349\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u9762\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u59cb\u7ec8\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u6574\u5408\u7814\u7a76\u8bae\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u7edf\u4e00LLM\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

This study proposes TriLex, a three-stage retrieval augmented framework that unifies corpus-based extraction, cross lingual mapping, and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) driven lexical refinement to systematically expand sentiment lexicons for low-resource languages. Using the enriched lexicon, the performance of two prominent African pretrained language models (AfroXLMR and AfriBERTa) is evaluated across multiple case studies. Results demonstrate that AfroXLMR delivers superior performance, achieving F1-scores above 80% for isiXhosa and isiZulu and exhibiting strong cross-lingual stability.

In this work, we propose stable rank, an intrinsic, annotation-free quality signal derived from model representations. Stable rank measures the effective dimensionality of hidden states by computing the ratio of total variance to dominant-direction variance, capturing quality through how information distributes across representation dimensions. Empirically, stable rank achieves 84.04% accuracy on RewardBench and improves task accuracy by an average of 11.3 percentage points over greedy decoding via Best-of-N sampling. Leveraging this insight, we introduce Stable Rank Group Relative Policy Optimization (SR-GRPO), which uses stable rank as a reward signal for reinforcement learning. Without external supervision, SR-GRPO improves Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct by 10% on STEM and 19% on mathematical reasoning, outperforming both learned reward models and self-evaluation baselines.

The evaluation framework integrates three mechanisms, namely selected-response evaluation, judge model evaluation, and reward model evaluation.

In enterprise settings, they are frequently augmented with closed-source domain knowledge to deliver more contextually informed responses. However, operational constraints such as limited context windows and inconsistencies between pre-training data and supplied knowledge often lead to hallucinations, some of which appear highly credible and escape routine human review. Current mitigation strategies either depend on costly, large-scale gold-standard Q\\&A curation or rely on secondary model verification, neither of which offers deterministic assurance. This paper introduces a framework that organizes proprietary knowledge and model-generated content into interactive visual knowledge graphs. The objective is to provide end users with a clear, intuitive view of potential hallucination zones by linking model assertions to underlying sources of truth and indicating confidence levels. Through this visual interface, users can diagnose inconsistencies, identify weak reasoning chains, and supply corrective feedback. The resulting human-in-the-loop workflow creates a structured feedback loop that can enhance model reliability and continuously improve response quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u51cf\u5c11\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f01\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6709\u9650\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u65f6\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u96be\u4ee5\u5bdf\u89c9\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u7f3a\u4e4f\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fdd\u969c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u4e13\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6210\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u65ad\u8a00\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6765\u6e90\u94fe\u63a5\uff0c\u5e76\u6807\u6ce8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u8bca\u65ad\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u63d0\u4f9b\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u54cd\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u624b\u6bb5\u589e\u5f3a\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Lecture materials are inherently multimodal, combining spoken audio with visual slides, which requires systems capable of processing multiple input modalities. To provide an accessible and complete learning experience, translations must preserve all modalities: text for reading, slides for visual understanding, and speech for auditory learning. We present \\textbf{BOOM}, a multimodal multilingual lecture companion that jointly translates lecture audio and slides to produce synchronized outputs across three modalities: translated text, localized slides with preserved visual elements, and synthesized speech. This end-to-end approach enables students to access lectures in their native language while aiming to preserve the original content in its entirety. Our experiments demonstrate that slide-aware transcripts also yield cascading benefits for downstream tasks such as summarization and question answering.

While prior work has focused on English-only settings, real-world deployments benefit from having a single prompt to operate reliably across languages. This paper presents a comprehensive study of how different system prompts steer models toward accurate and robust cross-lingual behavior. We propose a unified four-dimensional evaluation framework to assess system prompts in multilingual environments. Through large-scale experiments on five languages, three LLMs, and three benchmarks, we uncover that certain prompt components, such as CoT, emotion, and scenario, correlate with robust multilingual behavior. We develop a prompt optimization framework for multilingual settings and show it can automatically discover prompts that improve all metrics by 5-10%. Finally, we analyze over 10 million reasoning units and find that more performant system prompts induce more structured and consistent reasoning patterns, while reducing unnecessary language-switching.

We present SchED, a training-free, model-agnostic early-exit algorithm that aggregates full-span logit margins and halts decoding once a smooth, progress-dependent confidence threshold is met. We evaluated SchED on two dLLM families (Dream and LLaDA), in base and instruction-tuned variants across ten benchmarks spanning downstream tasks including multiple-choice question answering (MCQ), math, long-form QA/summarization, and translation. SchED delivers large, stable accelerations: on instruction-tuned models, it achieves $3.8$-$4.0\\times$ speedups while retaining $99.8$-$100\\%$ of the baseline score on average. On base models, SchED yields consistent speedup gains with $99.1$-$100\\%$ performance retention, with up to $2.34\\times$ under more aggressive settings. Using a conservative speed metric that heavily penalizes quality loss (QPS, $\u03b3{=}4$), we show that SchED is robust and clearly outperforms prior confidence-based early-exit methods, which break down on long-form generation. An entropy analysis of the model's token predictions reveals that instruction tuning speeds up the decay of predictive entropy. By turning genuine confidence stabilization into computational savings, SchED makes dLLM decoding substantially more efficient.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSchED\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u63d0\u524d\u9000\u51fa\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u5408logit\u8fb9\u9645\uff0c\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\u65f6\u505c\u6b62\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6269\u6563\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff08dLLM\uff09\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u56e0\u8fed\u4ee3\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5bfc\u81f4\u89e3\u7801\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u5176\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "SchED\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u89e3\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u805a\u5408\u5168\u8de8\u5ea6logit\u8fb9\u9645\uff0c\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u5e73\u6ed1\u4e14\u4e0e\u8fdb\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\u5224\u65ad\u662f\u5426\u63d0\u524d\u9000\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2adLLM\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cSchED\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e863.8-4.0\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u755999.8-100%\u3002\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e5f\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u755999.1-100%\u3002", "conclusion": "SchED\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u524d\u9000\u51fa\u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86dLLM\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u662f\u6269\u6563\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u9879\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

This enables automated reasoning and facilitates debugging, finding loop invariants, and adhering to specifications in software systems. However, hallucinations-incorrect outputs generated by LLMs are challenging, particularly for logical translation tasks requiring precision. This work introduces a novel framework that inputs English sentences, converts them into logical expressions, and then translates them into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) for satisfiability solving. It employs classical NLP techniques with self-defined grammar, symbolic computation libraries, and a fine-tuned language model to reduce hallucinations. In the early experiments, we observed that the fine-tuned model, trained on different grammar settings, could intentionally correct the same types of hallucinations made by the original model.

Existing alignment frameworks, structured approaches designed to align model behavior with human ethical and social norms, often rely on static datasets and post-hoc evaluations, offering limited insight into how ethical reasoning may evolve across different contexts or temporal scales. This study presents the Moral Consistency Pipeline (MoCoP), a dataset-free, closed-loop framework for continuously evaluating and interpreting the moral stability of LLMs. MoCoP combines three supporting layers: (i) lexical integrity analysis, (ii) semantic risk estimation, and (iii) reasoning-based judgment modeling within a self-sustaining architecture that autonomously generates, evaluates, and refines ethical scenarios without external supervision. Our empirical results on GPT-4-Turbo and DeepSeek suggest that MoCoP effectively captures longitudinal ethical behavior, revealing a strong inverse relationship between ethical and toxicity dimensions (correlation rET = -0.81, p value less than 0.001) and a near-zero association with response latency (correlation rEL approximately equal to 0). These findings demonstrate that moral coherence and linguistic safety tend to emerge as stable and interpretable characteristics of model behavior rather than short-term fluctuations. Furthermore, by reframing ethical evaluation as a dynamic, model-agnostic form of moral introspection, MoCoP offers a reproducible foundation for scalable, continuous auditing and advances the study of computational morality in autonomous AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMoCoP\u7684\u65e0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u95ed\u73af\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6301\u7eed\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u9053\u5fb7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u540e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u6355\u6349\u4f26\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u5883\u6216\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\u3002", "method": "MoCoP\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u5c42\u652f\u6301\uff1a\u8bcd\u6c47\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u98ce\u9669\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6211\u7ef4\u6301\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u81ea\u4e3b\u751f\u6210\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u4f26\u7406\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u5728GPT-4-Turbo\u548cDeepSeek\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMoCoP\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u7eb5\u5411\u4f26\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4f26\u7406\u4e0e\u6bd2\u6027\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5f3a\u70c8\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\uff08rET = -0.81, p < 0.001\uff09\uff0c\u4e0e\u54cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\u51e0\u4e4e\u65e0\u5173\uff08rEL \u2248 0\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "MoCoP\u4e3a\u53ef\u62d3\u5c55\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5ba1\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u5bf9\u81ea\u4e3bAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u9053\u5fb7\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u9053\u5fb7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u3002"}}
