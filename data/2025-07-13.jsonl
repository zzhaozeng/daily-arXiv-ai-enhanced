In this challenging setting, traditional\nimage stitching pipelines fail, producing outputs with ghosting and other\nartifacts. While recent generative models are capable of outpainting content\nconsistent with multiple reference images, they fail when tasked with\nsynthesizing large, coherent regions of a panorama. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a method that fine-tunes a diffusion-based inpainting\nmodel to preserve a scene's content and layout based on multiple reference\nimages. Once fine-tuned, the model outpaints a full panorama from a single\nreference image, producing a seamless and visually coherent result that\nfaithfully integrates content from all reference images. Our approach\nsignificantly outperforms baselines for this task in terms of image quality and\nthe consistency of image structure and scene layout when evaluated on captured\ndatasets."}

However, without reasoning and comparing over alternatives actions, LLM\nagents finetuned with these methods may over-commit towards seemingly plausible\nbut suboptimal actions due to limited action space exploration. To address\nthis, in this paper we propose Self-taught ActioN Deliberation (SAND)\nframework, enabling LLM agents to explicitly deliberate over candidate actions\nbefore committing to one. To tackle the challenges of when and what to\ndeliberate given large action space and step-level action evaluation, we\nincorporate self-consistency action sampling and execution-guided action\ncritique to help synthesize step-wise action deliberation thoughts using the\nbase model of the LLM agent. In an iterative manner, the deliberation\ntrajectories are then used to finetune the LLM agent itself. Evaluating on two\nrepresentative interactive agent tasks, SAND achieves an average 20%\nimprovement over initial supervised finetuning and also outperforms\nstate-of-the-art agent tuning approaches."}

Our results across a variety of frontier open-source and commercial\nLLMs show that while models may succeed in shallow queries, they often fail to\nsimulate physical constraints, preserve spatial coherence, or generalize under\nlayout perturbation. PlanQA uncovers a clear blind spot in today's LLMs: they\ndo not consistently reason about real-world layouts.

Over the next 200\nyears, they spread across Europe and luthiers of various royal courts, eager to\nexperiment with new techniques, created a highly diverse family of instruments.\nAround 1750, size standards were introduced to unify violin making for\norchestras and conservatories. Instruments that fell between two standards were\nthen reduced to a smaller size by luthiers. These reductions have an impact on\nseveral characteristics of violins, in particular on the contour lines, i.e.\nlines of constant altitude, which look more like a U for non reduced\ninstruments and a V for reduced ones. While such differences are observed by\nexperts, they have not been studied quantitatively.\n  This paper presents a method for classifying violins as reduced or\nnon-reduced based on their contour lines. We study a corpus of 25 instruments\nwhose 3D geometric meshes were acquired via photogrammetry. For each\ninstrument, we extract 10-20 contour lines regularly spaced every millimetre.\nEach line is fitted with a parabola-like curve (with an equation of the type y\n= alpha*abs(x)**beta) depending on two parameters, describing how open (beta)\nand how vertically stretched (alpha) the curve is. We compute additional\nfeatures from those parameters, using regressions and counting how many values\nfall under some threshold. We also deal with outliers and non equal numbers of\nlevels, and eventually obtain a numerical profile for each instrument.\n  We then apply classification methods to assess whether geometry alone can\npredict size reduction. We find that distinguishing between reduced and non\nreduced instruments is feasible to some degree, taking into account that a\nwhole spectrum of more or less transformed violins exists, for which it is more\ndifficult to quantify the reduction. We also find the opening parameter beta to\nbe the most predictive."}

Although many\nfine-tuning techniques have been developed to reduce the time and computational\ncost involved, the challenge persists as LLMs continue to grow in size and\ncomplexity. To address this, a new approach to knowledge expansion in LLMs is\nneeded. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers one such alternative by\nstoring external knowledge in a database and retrieving relevant chunks to\nsupport question answering. However, naive implementations of RAG face\nsignificant limitations in scalability and answer accuracy. This paper\nintroduces KeyKnowledgeRAG (K2RAG), a novel framework designed to overcome\nthese limitations. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer paradigm, K2RAG\nintegrates dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text\nsummarization to improve retrieval quality and system efficiency. The framework\nalso includes a preprocessing step that summarizes the training data,\nsignificantly reducing the training time. K2RAG was evaluated using the\nMultiHopRAG dataset, where the proposed pipeline was trained on the document\ncorpus and tested on a separate evaluation set.

K2RAG achieved the highest\nmean answer similarity score of 0.57, and reached the highest third quartile\n(Q3) similarity of 0.82, indicating better alignment with ground-truth answers.\nIn addition to improved accuracy, the framework proved highly efficient. The\nsummarization step reduced the average training time of individual components\nby 93%, and execution speed was up to 40% faster than traditional knowledge\ngraph-based RAG systems.

Adverse weather significantly degrades\nimage quality, which in turn reduces recognition accuracy. Although recent face\nimage restoration (FIR) models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs)\nand diffusion models have shown progress, their performance remains limited due\nto the lack of dedicated modules that explicitly address weather-induced\ndegradations. This leads to distorted facial textures and structures. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a novel GAN-based blind FIR framework\nthat integrates two key components: local Statistical Facial Feature\nTransformation (SFFT) and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE). The\nlocal SFFT module enhances facial structure and color fidelity by aligning the\nlocal statistical distributions of low-quality (LQ) facial regions with those\nof high-quality (HQ) counterparts.

STL is a\npowerful formalism that allows us to describe properties of signals varying\nover time in an expressive yet concise way. By constructing a small vocabulary\nfrom STL syntax, we demonstrate that our proposed model is able to generate\nvalid formulae after only 1 epoch and to generalize to the semantics of the\nlogic in about 10 epochs. Additionally, the model is able to decode a given\nembedding into formulae that are often simpler in terms of length and nesting\nwhile remaining semantically close (or equivalent) to gold references. We show\nthe effectiveness of our methodology across various levels of training formulae\ncomplexity to assess the impact of training data on the model's ability to\neffectively capture the semantic information contained in the embeddings and\ngeneralize out-of-distribution. Finally, we deploy our model for solving a\nrequirement mining task, i.e. inferring STL specifications that solve a\nclassification task on trajectories, performing the optimization directly in\nthe semantic space."}

PS models were trained using only the target patient's\nplanning data. Both models used 16 DRRs per input and predicted tumor motion\nover a 1-second horizon.

However,\nthe role of concept combinations in the training data on compositional\ngeneralization is largely unclear -- for instance, how does accuracy vary when\na common object appears in an uncommon pairing with another object? In this\npaper, we investigate how word co-occurrence statistics in the pretraining\ndataset (a proxy for co-occurrence of visual concepts) impacts CLIP/LMM\nperformance. To disentangle the effects of word co-occurrence frequencies from\nsingle-word frequencies, we measure co-occurrence with pointwise mutual\ninformation (PMI), which normalizes the joint probability of two words\nco-occurring by the probability of co-occurring independently. Using\nsynthetically generated images with a variety of concept pairs, we show a\nstrong correlation between PMI in the CLIP pretraining data and zero-shot\naccuracy in CLIP models trained on LAION-400M (r=0.97 and 14% accuracy gap\nbetween images in the top and bottom 5% of PMI values), demonstrating that even\naccuracy on common concepts is affected by the combination of concepts in the\nimage. Leveraging this finding, we reproduce this effect in natural images by\nediting them to contain pairs with varying PMI, resulting in a correlation of\nr=0.75. Finally, we demonstrate that this behavior in CLIP transfers to LMMs\nbuilt on top of CLIP (r=0.70 for TextVQA, r=0.62 for VQAv2). Our findings\nhighlight the need for algorithms and architectures that improve compositional\ngeneralization in multimodal models without scaling the training data\ncombinatorially.

To tackle\nthese problems, we propose SD-GS, a compact and efficient dynamic Gaussian\nsplatting framework for complex dynamic scene reconstruction, featuring two key\ncontributions. First, we introduce a deformable anchor grid, a hierarchical and\nmemory-efficient scene representation where each anchor point derives multiple\n3D Gaussians in its local spatiotemporal region and serves as the geometric\nbackbone of the 3D scene. Second, to enhance modeling capability for complex\nmotions, we present a deformation-aware densification strategy that adaptively\ngrows anchors in under-reconstructed high-dynamic regions while reducing\nredundancy in static areas, achieving superior visual quality with fewer\nanchors. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods, SD-GS achieves an average of 60\\% reduction in model size and an\naverage of 100\\% improvement in FPS, significantly enhancing computational\nefficiency while maintaining or even surpassing visual quality."}
