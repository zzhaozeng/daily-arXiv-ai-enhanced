Recent advances in image-to-3D models enable the\ncreation of animations directly from user-hand drawings. Distinguished from\nconventional 3D animation, drawing-based 3D animation is crucial to preserve\nartist's unique style properties, such as rough contours and distinct stroke\npatterns. However, recent methods still exhibit quality deterioration in style\nproperties, especially under occlusions caused by overlapping body parts,\nleading to contour flickering and stroke blurring. This occurs due to a\n`stylization pose gap' between training and inference in stylization networks\ndesigned to preserve drawing styles in drawing-based 3D animation systems. The\nstylization pose gap denotes that input target poses used to train the\nstylization network are always in occlusion-free poses, while target poses\nencountered in an inference include diverse occlusions under dynamic motions.\nTo this end, we propose Occlusion-robust Stylization Framework (OSF) for\ndrawing-based 3D animation. We found that while employing object's edge can be\neffective input prior for guiding stylization, it becomes notably inaccurate\nwhen occlusions occur at inference. Thus, our proposed OSF provides\nocclusion-robust edge guidance for stylization network using optical flow,\nensuring a consistent stylization even under occlusions. Furthermore, OSF\noperates in a single run instead of the previous two-stage method, achieving\n2.4x faster inference and 2.1x less memory."}

Existing sampling guidance methods, such as classifier-free\nguidance (CFG) and autoguidance (AG), fail to effectively guide the output\ntoward well-balanced space: CFG restricts the adaptation to the target\ndistribution, while AG compromises text alignment.

We propose a\ntaxonomy of reasoning enhancement techniques, categorized into training-time\nstrategies (e.g., supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning) and test-time\nmechanisms (e.g., prompt engineering, multi-agent systems). We analyze how\nthese techniques are applied across different data modalities (text, image,\ncode) and in key clinical applications such as diagnosis, education, and\ntreatment planning. Furthermore, we survey the evolution of evaluation\nbenchmarks from simple accuracy metrics to sophisticated assessments of\nreasoning quality and visual interpretability. Based on an analysis of 60\nseminal studies from 2022-2025, we conclude by identifying critical challenges,\nincluding the faithfulness-plausibility gap and the need for native multimodal\nreasoning, and outlining future directions toward building efficient, robust,\nand sociotechnically responsible medical AI."}

To address this issue, we propose SparseRecon, a novel\nneural implicit reconstruction method for sparse views with volume\nrendering-based feature consistency and uncertainty-guided depth constraint.\nFirstly, we introduce a feature consistency loss across views to constrain the\nneural implicit field. This design alleviates the ambiguity caused by\ninsufficient consistency information of views and ensures completeness and\nsmoothness in the reconstruction results. Secondly, we employ an\nuncertainty-guided depth constraint to back up the feature consistency loss in\nareas with occlusion and insignificant features, which recovers geometry\ndetails for better reconstruction quality.

These changes are widely attributed\nto the growing influence of Large Language Models (LLMs), which frequently rely\non a distinct lexical style. Divergences between model output and target\naudience norms can be viewed as a form of misalignment. While these shifts are\noften linked to using Artificial Intelligence (AI) directly as a tool to\ngenerate text, it remains unclear whether the changes reflect broader changes\nin the human language system itself. To explore this question, we constructed a\ndataset of 22.1 million words from unscripted spoken language drawn from\nconversational science and technology podcasts. We analyzed lexical trends\nbefore and after ChatGPT's release in 2022, focusing on commonly LLM-associated\nwords. Our results show a moderate yet significant increase in the usage of\nthese words post-2022, suggesting a convergence between human word choices and\nLLM-associated patterns. In contrast, baseline synonym words exhibit no\nsignificant directional shift. Given the short time frame and the number of\nwords affected, this may indicate the onset of a remarkable shift in language\nuse. Whether this represents natural language change or a novel shift driven by\nAI exposure remains an open question. Similarly, although the shifts may stem\nfrom broader adoption patterns, it may also be that upstream training\nmisalignments ultimately contribute to changes in human language use. These\nfindings parallel ethical concerns that misaligned models may shape social and\nmoral beliefs."}

Meanwhile, fused attention kernels such as FlashAttention have been\ndeveloped to alleviate memory overhead by avoiding attention map construction\nand its associated I/O to HBM.

To improve path evaluation accuracy, we introduce a lightweight\nTransformer-based scorer that performs context-aware plausibility estimation by\njointly encoding the question and relation sequence through cross-attention,\nenabling the model to capture fine-grained semantic shifts during multi-hop\nreasoning. Furthermore, to alleviate the scarcity of high-quality supervision,\nDAMR incorporates a dynamic pseudo-path refinement mechanism that periodically\ngenerates training signals from partial paths explored during search, allowing\nthe scorer to continuously adapt to the evolving distribution of reasoning\ntrajectories. Extensive experiments on multiple KGQA benchmarks show that DAMR\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods."}

This paper delves into a previously\noverlooked information asymmetry issue in PT, where the visual modality mostly\nconveys more context than the object-oriented textual modality.\nCorrespondingly, coarsely aligning these two modalities could result in the\nbiased attention, driving the model to merely focus on the context area. To\naddress this, we propose DAPT, an effective PT framework based on an intuitive\ndecouple-before-align concept. First, we propose to explicitly decouple the\nvisual modality into the foreground and background representation via\nexploiting coarse-and-fine visual segmenting cues, and then both of these\ndecoupled patterns are aligned with the original foreground texts and the\nhand-crafted background classes, thereby symmetrically strengthening the modal\nalignment. To further enhance the visual concentration, we propose a visual\npull-push regularization tailored for the foreground-background patterns,\ndirecting the original visual representation towards unbiased attention on the\nregion-of-interest object.

CoRGI follows a three-stage\npipeline: it first generates a textual reasoning chain, then extracts\nsupporting visual evidence for each reasoning step via a dedicated module\n(VEVM), and finally synthesizes the textual rationale with visual evidence to\ngenerate a grounded, verified answer. The framework can be integrated with\nexisting VLMs without end-to-end retraining. We evaluate CoRGI on the VCR\nbenchmark and find that it improves reasoning performance on two representative\nopen-source VLM backbones, Qwen-2.5VL and LLaVA-1.6. Ablation studies confirm\nthe contribution of each step in the verification module, and human evaluations\nsuggest that CoRGI leads to more factual and helpful explanations. We also\nexamine alternative designs for the visual verification step and discuss\npotential limitations of post-hoc verification frameworks. These findings\nhighlight the importance of grounding intermediate reasoning steps in visual\nevidence to enhance the robustness of multimodal reasoning."}

Recent advances in image-to-3D models enable the\ncreation of animations directly from user-hand drawings. Distinguished from\nconventional 3D animation, drawing-based 3D animation is crucial to preserve\nartist's unique style properties, such as rough contours and distinct stroke\npatterns. However, recent methods still exhibit quality deterioration in style\nproperties, especially under occlusions caused by overlapping body parts,\nleading to contour flickering and stroke blurring. This occurs due to a\n`stylization pose gap' between training and inference in stylization networks\ndesigned to preserve drawing styles in drawing-based 3D animation systems. The\nstylization pose gap denotes that input target poses used to train the\nstylization network are always in occlusion-free poses, while target poses\nencountered in an inference include diverse occlusions under dynamic motions.\nTo this end, we propose Occlusion-robust Stylization Framework (OSF) for\ndrawing-based 3D animation. We found that while employing object's edge can be\neffective input prior for guiding stylization, it becomes notably inaccurate\nwhen occlusions occur at inference. Thus, our proposed OSF provides\nocclusion-robust edge guidance for stylization network using optical flow,\nensuring a consistent stylization even under occlusions. Furthermore, OSF\noperates in a single run instead of the previous two-stage method, achieving\n2.4x faster inference and 2.1x less memory."}

This has catalyzed a shift from single-step answer generation to the\ndevelopment of LLMs explicitly designed for medical reasoning. This paper\nprovides the first systematic review of this emerging field. We propose a\ntaxonomy of reasoning enhancement techniques, categorized into training-time\nstrategies (e.g., supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning) and test-time\nmechanisms (e.g., prompt engineering, multi-agent systems). We analyze how\nthese techniques are applied across different data modalities (text, image,\ncode) and in key clinical applications such as diagnosis, education, and\ntreatment planning. Furthermore, we survey the evolution of evaluation\nbenchmarks from simple accuracy metrics to sophisticated assessments of\nreasoning quality and visual interpretability. Based on an analysis of 60\nseminal studies from 2022-2025, we conclude by identifying critical challenges,\nincluding the faithfulness-plausibility gap and the need for native multimodal\nreasoning, and outlining future directions toward building efficient, robust,\nand sociotechnically responsible medical AI."}

However, existing approaches predominantly focus on exploring\nsemantic information, such as the classes of sounding sources present in the\naudio, limiting their ability to generate videos with accurate content and\nspatial composition. In contrast, we humans can not only naturally identify the\nsemantic categories of sounding sources but also determine their deeply encoded\nspatial attributes, including locations and movement directions. This useful\ninformation can be elucidated by considering specific spatial indicators\nderived from the inherent physical properties of sound, such as loudness or\nfrequency. As prior methods largely ignore this factor, we present SpA2V, the\nfirst framework explicitly exploits these spatial auditory cues from audios to\ngenerate videos with high semantic and spatial correspondence. SpA2V decomposes\nthe generation process into two stages: 1) Audio-guided Video Planning: We\nmeticulously adapt a state-of-the-art MLLM for a novel task of harnessing\nspatial and semantic cues from input audio to construct Video Scene Layouts\n(VSLs). This serves as an intermediate representation to bridge the gap between\nthe audio and video modalities. 2) Layout-grounded Video Generation: We develop\nan efficient and effective approach to seamlessly integrate VSLs as conditional\nguidance into pre-trained diffusion models, enabling VSL-grounded video\ngeneration in a training-free manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nSpA2V excels in generating realistic videos with semantic and spatial alignment\nto the input audios."}
