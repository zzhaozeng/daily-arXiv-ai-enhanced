While\nrecent video generation models have shown strong potential in modeling dynamic\nscenes, generating videos that are both temporally coherent and geometrically\nconsistent across camera views remains a significant challenge. To address\nthis, we propose a 4D video generation model that enforces multi-view 3D\nconsistency of videos by supervising the model with cross-view pointmap\nalignment during training. This geometric supervision enables the model to\nlearn a shared 3D representation of the scene, allowing it to predict future\nvideo sequences from novel viewpoints based solely on the given RGB-D\nobservations, without requiring camera poses as inputs.

This approach leverages a pre-trained diffusion model,\nStable Diffusion XL, to overcome the generalization failures of existing\nmethods that rely on limited HDR panorama datasets. While conceptually simple,\nthe task remains challenging because diffusion models often insert incorrect or\ninconsistent content and cannot readily generate chrome balls in HDR format.\nOur analysis reveals that the inpainting process is highly sensitive to the\ninitial noise in the diffusion process, occasionally resulting in unrealistic\noutputs. To address this, we first introduce DiffusionLight, which uses\niterative inpainting to compute a median chrome ball from multiple outputs to\nserve as a stable, low-frequency lighting prior that guides the generation of a\nhigh-quality final result. To generate high-dynamic-range (HDR) light probes,\nan Exposure LoRA is fine-tuned to create LDR images at multiple exposure\nvalues, which are then merged. While effective, DiffusionLight is\ntime-intensive, requiring approximately 30 minutes per estimation. To reduce\nthis overhead, we introduce DiffusionLight-Turbo, which reduces the runtime to\nabout 30 seconds with minimal quality loss. This 60x speedup is achieved by\ntraining a Turbo LoRA to directly predict the averaged chrome balls from the\niterative process. Inference is further streamlined into a single denoising\npass using a LoRA swapping technique.

Among these, the auto white balance (AWB) module is\nessential for compensating for scene illumination. However, commercial AWB\nsystems often strive to compute aesthetic white-balance preferences rather than\naccurate neutral color correction. While learning-based methods have improved\nAWB accuracy, they typically struggle to generalize across different camera\nsensors -- an issue for smartphones with multiple cameras. Recent work has\nexplored cross-camera AWB, but most methods remain focused on achieving neutral\nwhite balance.

Once trained, our mapping can be applied after any\nneutral AWB module to enable consistent and stylized color rendering across\nunseen cameras.

This joint optimization strategy enables multi-drop\nrouting and accounts for offer acceptance uncertainty, aligning more closely\nwith real-world operations.

This article is a significantly extended version of a paper\n  presented by the authors at IJCAI-2022", "summary": "Non-monotonic logic programming is the basis for a declarative problem\nsolving paradigm known as answer set programming (ASP). Departing from the\nseminal definition by Gelfond and Lifschitz in 1988 for simple normal logic\nprograms, various answer set semantics have been proposed for extensions. We\nconsider two important questions: (1) Should the minimal model property,\nconstraint monotonicity and foundedness as defined in the literature be\nmandatory conditions for an answer set semantics in general? (2) If not, what\nother properties could be considered as general principles for answer set\nsemantics? We address the two questions. First, it seems that the three\naforementioned conditions may sometimes be too strong, and we illustrate with\nexamples that enforcing them may exclude expected answer sets. Second, we\nevolve the Gelfond answer set (GAS) principles for answer set construction by\nrefining the Gelfond's rationality principle to well-supportedness, minimality\nw.r.t. negation by default and minimality w.r.t. epistemic negation. The\nprinciple of well-supportedness guarantees that every answer set is\nconstructible from if-then rules obeying a level mapping and is thus free of\ncircular justification, while the two minimality principles ensure that the\nformalism minimizes knowledge both at the level of answer sets and of world\nviews. Third, to embody the refined GAS principles, we extend the notion of\nwell-supportedness substantially to answer sets and world views, respectively.\nFourth, we define new answer set semantics in terms of the refined GAS\nprinciples. Fifth, we use the refined GAS principles as an alternative baseline\nto intuitively assess the existing answer set semantics.

Camouflage-based physical attack is a more promising\napproach compared to the patch-based attack, offering stronger adversarial\neffectiveness in complex physical environments. However, most prior work relies\non mesh priors of the target object and virtual environments constructed by\nsimulators, which are time-consuming to obtain and inevitably differ from the\nreal world. Moreover, due to the limitations of the backgrounds in training\nimages, previous methods often fail to produce multi-view robust adversarial\ncamouflage and tend to fall into sub-optimal solutions. Due to these reasons,\nprior work lacks adversarial effectiveness and robustness across diverse\nviewpoints and physical environments. We propose a physical attack framework\nbased on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), named PGA, which provides rapid and\nprecise reconstruction with few images, along with photo-realistic rendering\ncapabilities. Our framework further enhances cross-view robustness and\nadversarial effectiveness by preventing mutual and self-occlusion among\nGaussians and employing a min-max optimization approach that adjusts the\nimaging background of each viewpoint, helping the algorithm filter out\nnon-robust adversarial features.

To address this\nchallenge, we propose LogitSpec to effectively expand the retrieval range and\nfind the most relevant reference as drafts. Our LogitSpec is motivated by the\nobservation that the logit of the last token can not only predict the next\ntoken, but also speculate the next next token. Specifically, LogitSpec\ngenerates draft tokens in two steps: (1) utilizing the last logit to speculate\nthe next next token; (2) retrieving relevant reference for both the next token\nand the next next token. LogitSpec is training-free and plug-and-play, which\ncan be easily integrated into existing LLM inference frameworks. Extensive\nexperiments on a wide range of text generation benchmarks demonstrate that\nLogitSpec can achieve up to 2.61 $\\times$ speedup and 3.28 mean accepted tokens\nper decoding step.

In this paper, we develop a case-level\nmultiple instance learning (MIL)-based method, free of standard plane\nlocalization, for classifying fetal abdominal anomalies in prenatal ultrasound.\nOur contribution is three-fold.

In this study, we conduct a systematic\nevaluation on how Wikipedia and web search external information can affect\nstance detection across eight LLMs and in three datasets with 12 targets.\nSurprisingly, we find that such information degrades performance in most cases,\nwith macro F1 scores dropping by up to 27.9\\%.

However, despite the dramatic improvement in generative\nvision-language models, fine-grained control over the properties of generated\ncaptions is not easy due to two reasons: (i) existing models are not given the\nproperties as a condition during training and (ii) existing models cannot\nsmoothly transition its language pattern from one state to the other. Given\nthis challenge, we propose a new approach, CaptionSmiths, to acquire a single\ncaptioning model that can handle diverse language patterns. First, our approach\nquantifies three properties of each caption, length, descriptiveness, and\nuniqueness of a word, as continuous scalar values, without human annotation.\nGiven the values, we represent the conditioning via interpolation between two\nendpoint vectors corresponding to the extreme states, e.g., one for a very\nshort caption and one for a very long caption. Empirical results demonstrate\nthat the resulting model can smoothly change the properties of the output\ncaptions and show higher lexical alignment than baselines.

To handle\nthis, we propose a simple, yet powerful, framework, called: Novel Object Cyclic\nThreshold based Instance Segmentation (NOCTIS). This work stems from and\nimproves upon previous ones like CNOS, SAM-6D and NIDS-Net; thus, it also\nleverages on recent vision foundation models, namely: Grounded-SAM 2 and\nDINOv2. It utilises Grounded-SAM 2 to obtain object proposals with precise\nbounding boxes and their corresponding segmentation masks; while DINOv2's\nzero-shot capabilities are employed to generate the image embeddings. The\nquality of those masks, together with their embeddings, is of vital importance\nto our approach; as the proposal-object matching is realized by determining an\nobject matching score based on the similarity of the class embeddings and the\naverage maximum similarity of the patch embeddings. Differently to SAM-6D,\ncalculating the latter involves a prior patch filtering based on the distance\nbetween each patch and its corresponding cyclic/roundtrip patch in the image\ngrid. Furthermore, the average confidence of the proposals' bounding box and\nmask is used as an additional weighting factor for the object matching score.\nWe empirically show that NOCTIS, without further training/fine tuning,\noutperforms the best RGB and RGB-D methods on the seven core datasets of the\nBOP 2023 challenge for the \"Model-based 2D segmentation of unseen objects\"\ntask.", "AI": {"tldr": "NOCTIS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Grounded-SAM 2\u548cDINOv2\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u5339\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728BOP 2023\u6311\u6218\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u5206\u5272\u65b0\u7269\u4f53\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u6539\u8fdb\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982CNOS\u3001SAM-6D\u548cNIDS-Net\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528Grounded-SAM 2\u751f\u6210\u7269\u4f53\u63d0\u8bae\u548c\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\uff0cDINOv2\u751f\u6210\u5d4c\u5165\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5faa\u73af\u9608\u503c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6539\u8fdb\u5339\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5728BOP 2023\u6311\u6218\u76847\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6RGB\u548cRGB-D\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "NOCTIS\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u65b0\u7269\u4f53\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

While robust watermarking can aid in authenticity\nverification and source tracking, existing methods often lack the sufficient\nrobustness against Deepfake manipulations. Diffusion models have demonstrated\nremarkable performance in image generation, enabling the seamless fusion of\nwatermark with image during generation. In this study, we propose a novel\nrobust watermarking framework based on diffusion model, called DiffMark. By\nmodifying the training and sampling scheme, we take the facial image and\nwatermark as conditions to guide the diffusion model to progressively denoise\nand generate corresponding watermarked image. In the construction of facial\ncondition, we weight the facial image by a timestep-dependent factor that\ngradually reduces the guidance intensity with the decrease of noise, thus\nbetter adapting to the sampling process of diffusion model. To achieve the\nfusion of watermark condition, we introduce a cross information fusion (CIF)\nmodule that leverages a learnable embedding table to adaptively extract\nwatermark features and integrates them with image features via cross-attention.\nTo enhance the robustness of the watermark against Deepfake manipulations, we\nintegrate a frozen autoencoder during training phase to simulate Deepfake\nmanipulations. Additionally, we introduce Deepfake-resistant guidance that\nemploys specific Deepfake model to adversarially guide the diffusion sampling\nprocess to generate more robust watermarked images.

To better understand model behavior, we group the target\nlanguages into three categories: seen (included during pre-training), partially\nseen (not included but linguistically related to seen languages), and unseen\n(absent and unrelated in pre-training data). Our results reveal clear\nperformance disparities across these groups: multilingual models perform best\non seen languages, moderately on partially seen ones, and poorly on unseen\nlanguages.

Existing methods using maximal clique search in\ncompatibility graphs achieve high recall but suffer from exponential time\ncomplexity, limiting their use in time-sensitive applications. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a fast and robust estimator, TurboReg, built upon a novel\nlightweight clique, TurboClique, and a highly parallelizable Pivot-Guided\nSearch (PGS) algorithm. First, we define the TurboClique as a 3-clique within a\nhighly-constrained compatibility graph. The lightweight nature of the 3-clique\nallows for efficient parallel searching, and the highly-constrained\ncompatibility graph ensures robust spatial consistency for stable\ntransformation estimation. Next, PGS selects matching pairs with high SC$^2$\nscores as pivots, effectively guiding the search toward TurboCliques with\nhigher inlier ratios. Moreover, the PGS algorithm has linear time complexity\nand is significantly more efficient than the maximal clique search with\nexponential time complexity.

Existing pixel-wise methods typically assign anomaly\nscores individually and employ a global thresholding strategy to segment\nanomalies. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches encounter significant\nchallenges in real-world applications: (1) neglecting spatial correlations\namong pixels within the same object, resulting in fragmented segmentation; (2)\nvariabil ity in anomaly score distributions across image regions, causing\nglobal thresholds to either generate false positives in background areas or\nmiss segments of anomalous objects. In this work, we introduce OoDDINO, a novel\nmulti-level anomaly segmentation framework designed to address these\nlimitations through a coarse-to-fine anomaly detection strategy. OoDDINO\ncombines an uncertainty-guided anomaly detection model with a pixel-level\nsegmentation model within a two-stage cascade architecture.

Subsequently, we\ndevelop an Adaptive Dual-Threshold Network (ADT-Net), which dynamically\ngenerates region-specific thresholds based on object-level detection outputs\nand pixel-wise anomaly scores. This approach allows for distinct thresholding\nstrategies within foreground and background areas, achieving fine-grained\nanomaly segmentation.

Nevertheless,\ncurrent models are restricted to just one type of image, often leading to too\nmuch segmentation in areas with little interaction, and struggling to maintain\ncategory consistency within specific regions. To tackle this issue, a HOT\nframework, termed \\textbf{P3HOT}, is proposed, which blends \\textbf{P}rompt\nguidance and human \\textbf{P}roximal \\textbf{P}erception. To begin with, we\nutilize a semantic-driven prompt mechanism to direct the network's attention\ntowards the relevant regions based on the correlation between image and text.\nThen a human proximal perception mechanism is employed to dynamically perceive\nkey depth range around the human, using learnable parameters to effectively\neliminate regions where interactions are not expected.

However, traditional methane\nenhancement methods are too computationally demanding for resource-limited\nonboard hardware. This work accelerates methane detection by focusing on\nefficient, low-power algorithms. We test fast target detection methods (ACE,\nCEM) that have not been previously used for methane detection and propose a\nMag1c-SAS - a significantly faster variant of the current state-of-the-art\nalgorithm for methane detection: Mag1c. To explore their true detection\npotential, we integrate them with a machine learning model (U-Net, LinkNet).\nOur results identify two promising candidates (Mag1c-SAS and CEM), both\nacceptably accurate for the detection of strong plumes and computationally\nefficient enough for onboard deployment: one optimized more for accuracy, the\nother more for speed, achieving up to ~100x and ~230x faster computation than\noriginal Mag1c on resource-limited hardware. Additionally, we propose and\nevaluate three band selection strategies.

Based on this mechanism, we present LASADGen, an\nautoregressive image generator that enables selective attention to relevant\nspatial contexts with linear complexity. Experiments on ImageNet show LASADGen\nachieves state-of-the-art image generation performance and computational\nefficiency, bridging the gap between linear attention's efficiency and spatial\nunderstanding needed for high-quality generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLASAD\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u75592D\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u5668LASADGen\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56Transformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u800c\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u56e0\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f9d\u8d56\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u8870\u51cf\uff08LASAD\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e2D\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8870\u51cf\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efaLASADGen\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLASADGen\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "LASADGen\u6210\u529f\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, this task remains a significant\nchallenge due to the substantial variations in polyp shape, size, and color, as\nwell as the high similarity between polyps and surrounding tissues, often\ncompounded by indistinct boundaries. While existing encoder-decoder CNN and\ntransformer-based approaches have shown promising results, they struggle with\nstable segmentation performance on polyps with weak or blurry boundaries. These\nmethods exhibit limited abilities to distinguish between polyps and non-polyps\nand capture essential boundary cues.

In this paper, we propose \\textbf{RobuSTereo}, a novel framework\nthat enhances the zero-shot generalization of stereo matching models under\nadverse weather by addressing both data scarcity and feature extraction\nchallenges. First, we introduce a diffusion-based simulation pipeline with a\nstereo consistency module, which generates high-quality stereo data tailored\nfor adverse conditions. By training stereo matching models on our synthetic\ndatasets, we reduce the domain gap between clean and degraded images,\nsignificantly improving the models' robustness to unseen weather conditions.\nThe stereo consistency module ensures structural alignment across synthesized\nimage pairs, preserving geometric integrity and enhancing depth estimation\naccuracy. Second, we design a robust feature encoder that combines a\nspecialized ConvNet with a denoising transformer to extract stable and reliable\nfeatures from degraded images. The ConvNet captures fine-grained local\nstructures, while the denoising transformer refines global representations,\neffectively mitigating the impact of noise, low visibility, and weather-induced\ndistortions.

While prior studies\nhave predominantly concentrated on improving vision-language interactions and\nachieving fine-grained localization, a systematic analysis of the fundamental\nbottlenecks in existing RIS frameworks remains underexplored. To bridge this\ngap, we propose DeRIS, a novel framework that decomposes RIS into two key\ncomponents: perception and cognition. This modular decomposition facilitates a\nsystematic analysis of the primary bottlenecks impeding RIS performance. Our\nfindings reveal that the predominant limitation lies not in perceptual\ndeficiencies, but in the insufficient multi-modal cognitive capacity of current\nmodels. To mitigate this, we propose a Loopback Synergy mechanism, which\nenhances the synergy between the perception and cognition modules, thereby\nenabling precise segmentation while simultaneously improving robust image-text\ncomprehension.

Each LoRA module is adapted on a few images of a\nspecific subject using a Full Token Tuning strategy, where it is applied across\nall tokens in the prompt to encourage weakly supervised token-content\nalignment. At inference, we adopt Subject-Aware Inference, activating each\nmodule only on its corresponding subject tokens. This enables training-free\nfusion of multiple personalized subjects within a single image, while\nmitigating overfitting and mutual interference between subjects.

However, in real-world scenarios where\nannotation resources are limited, a vast amount of unlabeled data coexists with\nscarce labeled samples, leading to the Semi-Supervised LReID (Semi-LReID)\nproblem where LReID methods suffer severe performance degradation. Existing\nLReID methods, even when combined with semi-supervised strategies, suffer from\nlimited long-term adaptation performance due to struggling with the noisy\nknowledge occurring during unlabeled data utilization. In this paper, we\npioneer the investigation of Semi-LReID, introducing a novel Self-Reinforcing\nPrototype Evolution with Dual-Knowledge Cooperation framework (SPRED). Our key\ninnovation lies in establishing a self-reinforcing cycle between dynamic\nprototype-guided pseudo-label generation and new-old knowledge collaborative\npurification to enhance the utilization of unlabeled data. Specifically,\nlearnable identity prototypes are introduced to dynamically capture the\nidentity distributions and generate high-quality pseudo-labels. Then, the\ndual-knowledge cooperation scheme integrates current model specialization and\nhistorical model generalization, refining noisy pseudo-labels. Through this\ncyclic design, reliable pseudo-labels are progressively mined to improve\ncurrent-stage learning and ensure positive knowledge propagation over long-term\nlearning.

Approach: 21 motion phases simulating digestive GI motion as 4D\nsequences were generated from static 3D patient scans using published\nanalytical GI motion models through a semi-automated pipeline. Eleven datasets,\nincluding six T2w FSE MRI (T2w MRI), two T1w 4D golden-angle stack-of-stars,\nand three contrast-enhanced CT scans.

However,\ncurrent approaches conventionally separate image customization into\nposition-aware and position-free customization paradigms and lack a universal\nframework for diverse customization, limiting their applications across various\nscenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose IC-Custom, a unified\nframework that seamlessly integrates position-aware and position-free image\ncustomization through in-context learning. IC-Custom concatenates reference\nimages with target images to a polyptych, leveraging DiT's multi-modal\nattention mechanism for fine-grained token-level interactions. We introduce the\nIn-context Multi-Modal Attention (ICMA) mechanism with learnable task-oriented\nregister tokens and boundary-aware positional embeddings to enable the model to\ncorrectly handle different task types and distinguish various inputs in\npolyptych configurations. To bridge the data gap, we carefully curated a\nhigh-quality dataset of 12k identity-consistent samples with 8k from real-world\nsources and 4k from high-quality synthetic data, avoiding the overly glossy and\nover-saturated synthetic appearance. IC-Custom supports various industrial\napplications, including try-on, accessory placement, furniture arrangement, and\ncreative IP customization. Extensive evaluations on our proposed ProductBench\nand the publicly available DreamBench demonstrate that IC-Custom significantly\noutperforms community workflows, closed-source models, and state-of-the-art\nopen-source approaches. IC-Custom achieves approximately 73% higher human\npreference across identity consistency, harmonicity, and text alignment\nmetrics, while training only 0.4% of the original model parameters.

Long animation colorization has high labor costs. Therefore,\nautomated long animation colorization based on the video generation model has\nsignificant research value. Existing studies are limited to short-term\ncolorization. These studies adopt a local paradigm, fusing overlapping features\nto achieve smooth transitions between local segments. However, the local\nparadigm neglects global information, failing to maintain long-term color\nconsistency. In this study, we argue that ideal long-term color consistency can\nbe achieved through a dynamic global-local paradigm, i.e., dynamically\nextracting global color-consistent features relevant to the current generation.\nSpecifically, we propose LongAnimation, a novel framework, which mainly\nincludes a SketchDiT, a Dynamic Global-Local Memory (DGLM), and a Color\nConsistency Reward. The SketchDiT captures hybrid reference features to support\nthe DGLM module. The DGLM module employs a long video understanding model to\ndynamically compress global historical features and adaptively fuse them with\nthe current generation features. To refine the color consistency, we introduce\na Color Consistency Reward. During inference, we propose a color consistency\nfusion to smooth the video segment transition.

To bridge this gap, we introduce \\textbf{Kwai Keye-VL}, an\n8-billion-parameter multimodal foundation model engineered for leading-edge\nperformance in short-video understanding while maintaining robust\ngeneral-purpose vision-language abilities. The development of Keye-VL rests on\ntwo core pillars: a massive, high-quality dataset exceeding 600 billion tokens\nwith a strong emphasis on video, and an innovative training recipe. This recipe\nfeatures a four-stage pre-training process for solid vision-language alignment,\nfollowed by a meticulous two-phase post-training process. The first\npost-training stage enhances foundational capabilities like instruction\nfollowing, while the second phase focuses on stimulating advanced reasoning. In\nthis second phase, a key innovation is our five-mode ``cold-start'' data\nmixture, which includes ``thinking'', ``non-thinking'', ``auto-think'', ``think\nwith image'', and high-quality video data. This mixture teaches the model to\ndecide when and how to reason. Subsequent reinforcement learning (RL) and\nalignment steps further enhance these reasoning capabilities and correct\nabnormal model behaviors, such as repetitive outputs. To validate our approach,\nwe conduct extensive evaluations, showing that Keye-VL achieves\nstate-of-the-art results on public video benchmarks and remains highly\ncompetitive on general image-based tasks (Figure 1).

This approach leverages a pre-trained diffusion model,\nStable Diffusion XL, to overcome the generalization failures of existing\nmethods that rely on limited HDR panorama datasets. While conceptually simple,\nthe task remains challenging because diffusion models often insert incorrect or\ninconsistent content and cannot readily generate chrome balls in HDR format.\nOur analysis reveals that the inpainting process is highly sensitive to the\ninitial noise in the diffusion process, occasionally resulting in unrealistic\noutputs. To address this, we first introduce DiffusionLight, which uses\niterative inpainting to compute a median chrome ball from multiple outputs to\nserve as a stable, low-frequency lighting prior that guides the generation of a\nhigh-quality final result. To generate high-dynamic-range (HDR) light probes,\nan Exposure LoRA is fine-tuned to create LDR images at multiple exposure\nvalues, which are then merged. While effective, DiffusionLight is\ntime-intensive, requiring approximately 30 minutes per estimation. To reduce\nthis overhead, we introduce DiffusionLight-Turbo, which reduces the runtime to\nabout 30 seconds with minimal quality loss. This 60x speedup is achieved by\ntraining a Turbo LoRA to directly predict the averaged chrome balls from the\niterative process.

Among these, the auto white balance (AWB) module is\nessential for compensating for scene illumination. However, commercial AWB\nsystems often strive to compute aesthetic white-balance preferences rather than\naccurate neutral color correction. While learning-based methods have improved\nAWB accuracy, they typically struggle to generalize across different camera\nsensors -- an issue for smartphones with multiple cameras. Recent work has\nexplored cross-camera AWB, but most methods remain focused on achieving neutral\nwhite balance.

This article is a significantly extended version of a paper\n  presented by the authors at IJCAI-2022", "summary": "Non-monotonic logic programming is the basis for a declarative problem\nsolving paradigm known as answer set programming (ASP). Departing from the\nseminal definition by Gelfond and Lifschitz in 1988 for simple normal logic\nprograms, various answer set semantics have been proposed for extensions. We\nconsider two important questions: (1) Should the minimal model property,\nconstraint monotonicity and foundedness as defined in the literature be\nmandatory conditions for an answer set semantics in general? (2) If not, what\nother properties could be considered as general principles for answer set\nsemantics? We address the two questions. First, it seems that the three\naforementioned conditions may sometimes be too strong, and we illustrate with\nexamples that enforcing them may exclude expected answer sets. Second, we\nevolve the Gelfond answer set (GAS) principles for answer set construction by\nrefining the Gelfond's rationality principle to well-supportedness, minimality\nw.r.t. negation by default and minimality w.r.t. epistemic negation. The\nprinciple of well-supportedness guarantees that every answer set is\nconstructible from if-then rules obeying a level mapping and is thus free of\ncircular justification, while the two minimality principles ensure that the\nformalism minimizes knowledge both at the level of answer sets and of world\nviews. Third, to embody the refined GAS principles, we extend the notion of\nwell-supportedness substantially to answer sets and world views, respectively.\nFourth, we define new answer set semantics in terms of the refined GAS\nprinciples. Fifth, we use the refined GAS principles as an alternative baseline\nto intuitively assess the existing answer set semantics.

Camouflage-based physical attack is a more promising\napproach compared to the patch-based attack, offering stronger adversarial\neffectiveness in complex physical environments. However, most prior work relies\non mesh priors of the target object and virtual environments constructed by\nsimulators, which are time-consuming to obtain and inevitably differ from the\nreal world. Moreover, due to the limitations of the backgrounds in training\nimages, previous methods often fail to produce multi-view robust adversarial\ncamouflage and tend to fall into sub-optimal solutions. Due to these reasons,\nprior work lacks adversarial effectiveness and robustness across diverse\nviewpoints and physical environments.

Our framework further enhances cross-view robustness and\nadversarial effectiveness by preventing mutual and self-occlusion among\nGaussians and employing a min-max optimization approach that adjusts the\nimaging background of each viewpoint, helping the algorithm filter out\nnon-robust adversarial features. Extensive experiments validate the\neffectiveness and superiority of PGA.

In this study, we conduct a systematic\nevaluation on how Wikipedia and web search external information can affect\nstance detection across eight LLMs and in three datasets with 12 targets.\nSurprisingly, we find that such information degrades performance in most cases,\nwith macro F1 scores dropping by up to 27.9\\%.

Given\nthis challenge, we propose a new approach, CaptionSmiths, to acquire a single\ncaptioning model that can handle diverse language patterns. First, our approach\nquantifies three properties of each caption, length, descriptiveness, and\nuniqueness of a word, as continuous scalar values, without human annotation.\nGiven the values, we represent the conditioning via interpolation between two\nendpoint vectors corresponding to the extreme states, e.g., one for a very\nshort caption and one for a very long caption. Empirical results demonstrate\nthat the resulting model can smoothly change the properties of the output\ncaptions and show higher lexical alignment than baselines. For instance,\nCaptionSmiths reduces the error in controlling caption length by 506\\% despite\nbetter lexical alignment.

While robust watermarking can aid in authenticity\nverification and source tracking, existing methods often lack the sufficient\nrobustness against Deepfake manipulations. Diffusion models have demonstrated\nremarkable performance in image generation, enabling the seamless fusion of\nwatermark with image during generation. In this study, we propose a novel\nrobust watermarking framework based on diffusion model, called DiffMark. By\nmodifying the training and sampling scheme, we take the facial image and\nwatermark as conditions to guide the diffusion model to progressively denoise\nand generate corresponding watermarked image. In the construction of facial\ncondition, we weight the facial image by a timestep-dependent factor that\ngradually reduces the guidance intensity with the decrease of noise, thus\nbetter adapting to the sampling process of diffusion model. To achieve the\nfusion of watermark condition, we introduce a cross information fusion (CIF)\nmodule that leverages a learnable embedding table to adaptively extract\nwatermark features and integrates them with image features via cross-attention.\nTo enhance the robustness of the watermark against Deepfake manipulations, we\nintegrate a frozen autoencoder during training phase to simulate Deepfake\nmanipulations. Additionally, we introduce Deepfake-resistant guidance that\nemploys specific Deepfake model to adversarially guide the diffusion sampling\nprocess to generate more robust watermarked images.

Existing methods using maximal clique search in\ncompatibility graphs achieve high recall but suffer from exponential time\ncomplexity, limiting their use in time-sensitive applications. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a fast and robust estimator, TurboReg, built upon a novel\nlightweight clique, TurboClique, and a highly parallelizable Pivot-Guided\nSearch (PGS) algorithm. First, we define the TurboClique as a 3-clique within a\nhighly-constrained compatibility graph. The lightweight nature of the 3-clique\nallows for efficient parallel searching, and the highly-constrained\ncompatibility graph ensures robust spatial consistency for stable\ntransformation estimation. Next, PGS selects matching pairs with high SC$^2$\nscores as pivots, effectively guiding the search toward TurboCliques with\nhigher inlier ratios. Moreover, the PGS algorithm has linear time complexity\nand is significantly more efficient than the maximal clique search with\nexponential time complexity. Extensive experiments show that TurboReg achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across multiple real-world datasets, with\nsubstantial speed improvements.

However, traditional methane\nenhancement methods are too computationally demanding for resource-limited\nonboard hardware. This work accelerates methane detection by focusing on\nefficient, low-power algorithms. We test fast target detection methods (ACE,\nCEM) that have not been previously used for methane detection and propose a\nMag1c-SAS - a significantly faster variant of the current state-of-the-art\nalgorithm for methane detection: Mag1c. To explore their true detection\npotential, we integrate them with a machine learning model (U-Net, LinkNet).\nOur results identify two promising candidates (Mag1c-SAS and CEM), both\nacceptably accurate for the detection of strong plumes and computationally\nefficient enough for onboard deployment: one optimized more for accuracy, the\nother more for speed, achieving up to ~100x and ~230x faster computation than\noriginal Mag1c on resource-limited hardware. Additionally, we propose and\nevaluate three band selection strategies.

This paper seeks to understand how such\nmodels behave when input streams present conflicting information. Focusing\nspecifically on vision-language models, we provide inconsistent inputs (e.g.,\nan image of a dog paired with the caption \"A photo of a cat\") and ask the model\nto report the information present in one of the specific modalities (e.g.,\n\"What does the caption say / What is in the image?\"). We find that models often\nfavor one modality over the other, e.g., reporting the image regardless of what\nthe caption says, but that different models differ in which modality they\nfavor.

A Case Study in Medical Imaging", "comment": "9 pages", "summary": "Vision transformers (ViTs) have rapidly gained prominence in medical imaging\ntasks such as disease classification, segmentation, and detection due to their\nsuperior accuracy compared to conventional deep learning models. However, due\nto their size and complex interactions via the self-attention mechanism, they\nare not well understood. In particular, it is unclear whether the\nrepresentations produced by such models are semantically meaningful. In this\npaper, using a projected gradient-based algorithm, we show that their\nrepresentations are not semantically meaningful and they are inherently\nvulnerable to small changes.

Consequently,\nsegmentation models must ensure not only the semantic correctness of\nlarge-scale patches (low-frequency information) but also the precise\nlocalization of boundaries between patches (high-frequency information).\nHowever, most existing approaches rely heavily on discriminative learning,\nwhich excels at capturing low-frequency features, while overlooking its\ninherent limitations in learning high-frequency features for semantic\nsegmentation. Recent studies have revealed that diffusion generative models\nexcel at generating high-frequency details.

Finally, for a subset of T2w MRI scans\nfrom patients treated with MR-guided radiation therapy, dose distributions were\nwarped and accumulated to assess dose warping errors, including evaluations of\nDIR performance in both low- and high-dose regions for patient-specific error\nestimation. Main results: Our proposed pipeline synthesized DTs modeling\nrealistic GI motion, achieving mean and maximum motion amplitudes and a mean\nlog Jacobian determinant within 0.8 mm and 0.01, respectively, similar to\npublished real-patient gastric motion data. It also enables the extraction of\ndetailed quantitative DIR performance metrics and rigorous validation of dose\nmapping accuracy. Significance: The pipeline enables rigorously testing DIR\ntools for dynamic, anatomically complex regions enabling granular spatial and\ndosimetric accuracies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u60a3\u8005\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\uff08DT\uff09\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d8\u5f62\u56fe\u50cf\u914d\u51c6\uff08DIR\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u79fb\u52a8\u7684\u80c3\u80a0\u9053\u5668\u5b98\u4e2d\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u80c3\u80a0\u9053\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u8be5\u7ba1\u9053\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u5b9a\u91cfDIR\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u548c\u5242\u91cf\u6620\u5c04\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u65bdDIR\u9700\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f53\u7d20\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5982\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u89e3\u5256\u6807\u5fd7\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u79fb\u52a8\u7684\u80c3\u80a0\u9053\u5668\u5b98\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u56e2\u961f\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86DT\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u80c3\u80a0\u9053\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30DIR\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u56e2\u961f\u901a\u8fc7\u534a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u4ece\u9759\u60013D\u60a3\u8005\u626b\u63cf\u4e2d\u751f\u621021\u4e2a\u6a21\u62df\u80c3\u80a0\u9053\u8fd0\u52a8\u76844D\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5e76\u521b\u5efa\u4e8611\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5305\u62ecMRI\u548cCT\u626b\u63cf\uff09\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9bDT\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u516d\u79cdDIR\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u76ee\u6807\u914d\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\u3001Dice\u76f8\u4f3c\u7cfb\u6570\u548cHausdorff\u8ddd\u79bb\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5bf9\u5242\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u53d8\u5f62\u548c\u7d2f\u79ef\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u7684DT\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u80c3\u80a0\u9053\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5176\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e45\u5ea6\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u4f3c\uff08\u5e73\u5747\u548c\u6700\u5927\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e45\u5ea6\u5206\u522b\u5c0f\u4e8e0.8 mm\u548c0.01\uff09\u3002\u8be5\u7ba1\u9053\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684DIR\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5242\u91cf\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\u80fd\u591f\u4e25\u683c\u6d4b\u8bd5DIR\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u4e14\u89e3\u5256\u590d\u6742\u533a\u57df\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u5242\u91cf\u5b66\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However,\ncurrent approaches conventionally separate image customization into\nposition-aware and position-free customization paradigms and lack a universal\nframework for diverse customization, limiting their applications across various\nscenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose IC-Custom, a unified\nframework that seamlessly integrates position-aware and position-free image\ncustomization through in-context learning. IC-Custom concatenates reference\nimages with target images to a polyptych, leveraging DiT's multi-modal\nattention mechanism for fine-grained token-level interactions. We introduce the\nIn-context Multi-Modal Attention (ICMA) mechanism with learnable task-oriented\nregister tokens and boundary-aware positional embeddings to enable the model to\ncorrectly handle different task types and distinguish various inputs in\npolyptych configurations. To bridge the data gap, we carefully curated a\nhigh-quality dataset of 12k identity-consistent samples with 8k from real-world\nsources and 4k from high-quality synthetic data, avoiding the overly glossy and\nover-saturated synthetic appearance. IC-Custom supports various industrial\napplications, including try-on, accessory placement, furniture arrangement, and\ncreative IP customization. Extensive evaluations on our proposed ProductBench\nand the publicly available DreamBench demonstrate that IC-Custom significantly\noutperforms community workflows, closed-source models, and state-of-the-art\nopen-source approaches. IC-Custom achieves approximately 73% higher human\npreference across identity consistency, harmonicity, and text alignment\nmetrics, while training only 0.4% of the original model parameters.

To further validate the effectiveness of CI-VID, we design a\ncomprehensive, multi-dimensional benchmark incorporating human evaluation,\nVLM-based assessment, and similarity-based metrics. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that models trained on CI-VID exhibit significant improvements in\nboth accuracy and content consistency when generating video sequences. This\nfacilitates the creation of story-driven content with smooth visual transitions\nand strong temporal coherence, underscoring the quality and practical utility\nof the CI-VID dataset We release the CI-VID dataset and the accompanying code\nfor data construction and evaluation at: https://github.com/ymju-BAAI/CI-VID", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86CI-VID\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u652f\u6301\u8fde\u8d2f\u591a\u573a\u666f\u89c6\u9891\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5b64\u7acb\u6587\u672c-\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u5b64\u7acb\u7684\u6587\u672c-\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u8fde\u8d2f\u591a\u573a\u666f\u89c6\u9891\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCI-VID\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b34\u4e07\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u7531\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7247\u6bb5\u5e8f\u5217\u53ca\u5176\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6587\u672c\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eCI-VID\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u5e8f\u5217\u65f6\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "CI-VID\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u652f\u6301\u6545\u4e8b\u9a71\u52a8\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8fc7\u6e21\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u5f3a\u3002"}}

Long animation colorization has high labor costs. Therefore,\nautomated long animation colorization based on the video generation model has\nsignificant research value. Existing studies are limited to short-term\ncolorization. These studies adopt a local paradigm, fusing overlapping features\nto achieve smooth transitions between local segments. However, the local\nparadigm neglects global information, failing to maintain long-term color\nconsistency. In this study, we argue that ideal long-term color consistency can\nbe achieved through a dynamic global-local paradigm, i.e., dynamically\nextracting global color-consistent features relevant to the current generation.\nSpecifically, we propose LongAnimation, a novel framework, which mainly\nincludes a SketchDiT, a Dynamic Global-Local Memory (DGLM), and a Color\nConsistency Reward. The SketchDiT captures hybrid reference features to support\nthe DGLM module. The DGLM module employs a long video understanding model to\ndynamically compress global historical features and adaptively fuse them with\nthe current generation features. To refine the color consistency, we introduce\na Color Consistency Reward. During inference, we propose a color consistency\nfusion to smooth the video segment transition. Extensive experiments on both\nshort-term (14 frames) and long-term (average 500 frames) animations show the\neffectiveness of LongAnimation in maintaining short-term and long-term color\nconsistency for open-domain animation colorization task.
