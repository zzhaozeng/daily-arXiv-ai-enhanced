While\nrecent video generation models have shown strong potential in modeling dynamic\nscenes, generating videos that are both temporally coherent and geometrically\nconsistent across camera views remains a significant challenge. To address\nthis, we propose a 4D video generation model that enforces multi-view 3D\nconsistency of videos by supervising the model with cross-view pointmap\nalignment during training. This geometric supervision enables the model to\nlearn a shared 3D representation of the scene, allowing it to predict future\nvideo sequences from novel viewpoints based solely on the given RGB-D\nobservations, without requiring camera poses as inputs. Compared to existing\nbaselines, our method produces more visually stable and spatially aligned\npredictions across multiple simulated and real-world robotic datasets.

To address\nthis, we propose GuideSep, a diffusion-based MSS model capable of\ninstrument-agnostic separation beyond the four-stem setup. GuideSep is\nconditioned on multiple inputs: a waveform mimicry condition, which can be\neasily provided by humming or playing the target melody, and mel-spectrogram\ndomain masks, which offer additional guidance for separation. Unlike prior\napproaches that relied on fixed class labels or sound queries, our conditioning\nscheme, coupled with the generative approach, provides greater flexibility and\napplicability. Additionally, we design a mask-prediction baseline using the\nsame model architecture to systematically compare predictive and generative\napproaches. Our objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that GuideSep\nachieves high-quality separation while enabling more versatile instrument\nextraction, highlighting the potential of user participation in the\ndiffusion-based generative process for MSS.

Traditional control techniques often rely on\nprecise system models and are sensitive to parameter uncertainties and external\nperturbations. To overcome these limitations, we first develop a SAC-based\nexpert controller that demonstrates improved resilience against actuator\nfailures, sensor noise, and attitude misalignments, outperforming our previous\nresults in several challenging scenarios. We then use GAIL to train a learner\npolicy that imitates the expert's trajectories, thereby reducing training costs\nand improving generalization through expert demonstrations. Preliminary\nexperiments under single and combined perturbations show that the SAC expert\ncan rotate the antenna to a specified direction and keep the antenna\norientation reliably stable in most of the listed perturbations. Additionally,\nthe GAIL learner can imitate most of the features from the trajectories\ngenerated by the SAC expert.

However,\nexplaining the Shapley value of an owner in a data coalition is an unexplored\nand challenging task. To tackle this, we formulate the problem of finding the\ncounterfactual explanation of Shapley value in data coalitions. Essentially,\ngiven two data owners $A$ and $B$ such that $A$ has a higher Shapley value than\n$B$, a counterfactual explanation is a smallest subset of data entries in $A$\nsuch that transferring the subset from $A$ to $B$ makes the Shapley value of\n$A$ less than that of $B$. We show that counterfactual explanations always\nexist, but finding an exact counterfactual explanation is NP-hard. Using Monte\nCarlo estimation to approximate counterfactual explanations directly according\nto the definition is still very costly, since we have to estimate the Shapley\nvalues of owners $A$ and $B$ after each possible subset shift. We develop a\nseries of heuristic techniques to speed up computation by estimating\ndifferential Shapley values, computing the power of singular data entries, and\nshifting subsets greedily, culminating in the SV-Exp algorithm.

However,\nthe flat Open Circuit Voltage (OCV)-SOC curve makes this task particularly\nchallenging. This challenge is complicated by hysteresis effects, and\nreal-world conditions such as current bias, voltage quantization errors, and\ntemperature that must be considered in the battery management system use. In\nthis paper, we proposed an adaptive estimation approach to overcome the\nchallenges of LFPSOC estimation. Specifically, the method uses an adaptive\nfisher information fusion strategy that adaptively combines the SOC estimation\nfrom two different models, which are Coulomb counting and equivalent circuit\nmodel-based parameter identification.

Continuous\nformation control was assumed to be achieved through fuel-free actuation, such\nas satellite magnetic field interaction and differential aerodynamic forces,\nthereby maintaining long-term formation stability without thruster usage. A\nmajor challenge for such actuation systems is the potential loss of control\ncapability due to increasing inter-satellite distances resulting from unstable\norbital dynamics, particularly for autonomous satellite swarms. To mitigate\nthis risk, our decentralized deployment controller minimized drift distance\nduring unexpected communication outages.

This approach leverages a pre-trained diffusion model,\nStable Diffusion XL, to overcome the generalization failures of existing\nmethods that rely on limited HDR panorama datasets. While conceptually simple,\nthe task remains challenging because diffusion models often insert incorrect or\ninconsistent content and cannot readily generate chrome balls in HDR format.\nOur analysis reveals that the inpainting process is highly sensitive to the\ninitial noise in the diffusion process, occasionally resulting in unrealistic\noutputs. To address this, we first introduce DiffusionLight, which uses\niterative inpainting to compute a median chrome ball from multiple outputs to\nserve as a stable, low-frequency lighting prior that guides the generation of a\nhigh-quality final result. To generate high-dynamic-range (HDR) light probes,\nan Exposure LoRA is fine-tuned to create LDR images at multiple exposure\nvalues, which are then merged. While effective, DiffusionLight is\ntime-intensive, requiring approximately 30 minutes per estimation. To reduce\nthis overhead, we introduce DiffusionLight-Turbo, which reduces the runtime to\nabout 30 seconds with minimal quality loss. This 60x speedup is achieved by\ntraining a Turbo LoRA to directly predict the averaged chrome balls from the\niterative process. Inference is further streamlined into a single denoising\npass using a LoRA swapping technique. Experimental results that show our method\nproduces convincing light estimates across diverse settings and demonstrates\nsuperior generalization to in-the-wild scenarios.

We specifically\nfocus on scenarios when the interceptors lack radial acceleration capabilities,\nrelying solely on their lateral acceleration components. This consideration\naligns with their inherent kinematic turn constraints. The proposed strategy\nexplicitly addresses the complexities of coupled 3D engagements, thereby\nmitigating performance degradation that typically arises when the pitch and yaw\nchannels are decoupled into two separate, mutually orthogonal planar\nengagements.

However, the high cost of multi-omics profiling imposes a\nsignificant economic burden, with over reliance on full omics data potentially\nleading to unnecessary resource consumption. To address these issues, we\npropose an uncertainty-aware, multi-view dynamic decision framework for omics\ndata classification that aims to achieve high diagnostic accuracy while\nminimizing testing costs. Methodology: At the single-omics level, we refine the\nactivation functions of neural networks to generate Dirichlet distribution\nparameters, utilizing subjective logic to quantify both the belief masses and\nuncertainty mass of classification results. Belief mass reflects the support of\na specific omics modality for a disease class, while the uncertainty parameter\ncaptures limitations in data quality and model discriminability, providing a\nmore trustworthy basis for decision-making. At the multi omics level, we employ\na fusion strategy based on Dempster-Shafer theory to integrate heterogeneous\nmodalities, leveraging their complementarity to boost diagnostic accuracy and\nrobustness. A dynamic decision mechanism is then applied that omics data are\nincrementally introduced for each patient until either all data sources are\nutilized or the model confidence exceeds a predefined threshold, potentially\nbefore all data sources are utilized. Results and Conclusion: We evaluate our\napproach on four benchmark multi-omics datasets, ROSMAP, LGG, BRCA, and KIPAN.\nIn three datasets, over 50% of cases achieved accurate classification using a\nsingle omics modality, effectively reducing redundant testing.

Modern approaches collect the body dynamics,\nexternal reactive force specifically, via force plates, synchronizing with\nhuman motion capture data, and learn to estimate the dynamics from a black-box\ndeep learning model. Being specialized devices, force plates can only be\ninstalled in laboratory setups, imposing a significant limitation on the\nlearning of human dynamics. To this end, we propose a novel method for\nestimating human ground reaction dynamics directly from the more reliable\nmotion capture data with physics laws and computational simulation as\nconstrains. We introduce a highly accurate and robust method for computing\nground reaction forces from motion capture data using Euler's integration\nscheme and PD algorithm.

However, directly training policies to\nsimultaneously handle dual extreme challenges, i.e., extreme underactuation and\nextreme terrains, as in monopedal hopping tasks, remains highly challenging due\nto unstable early-stage interactions and unreliable reward feedback. To address\nthis, we propose JumpER (jump-start reinforcement learning via self-evolving\npriors), an RL training framework that structures policy learning into multiple\nstages of increasing complexity. By dynamically generating self-evolving priors\nthrough iterative bootstrapping of previously learned policies, JumpER\nprogressively refines and enhances guidance, thereby stabilizing exploration\nand policy optimization without relying on external expert priors or\nhandcrafted reward shaping. Specifically, when integrated with a structured\nthree-stage curriculum that incrementally evolves action modality, observation\nspace, and task objective, JumpER enables quadruped robots to achieve robust\nmonopedal hopping on unpredictable terrains for the first time. Remarkably, the\nresulting policy effectively handles challenging scenarios that traditional\nmethods struggle to conquer, including wide gaps up to 60 cm, irregularly\nspaced stairs, and stepping stones with distances varying from 15 cm to 35 cm.\nJumpER thus provides a principled and scalable approach for addressing\nlocomotion tasks under the dual challenges of extreme underactuation and\nextreme terrains.", "AI": {"tldr": "JumpER\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u5148\u9a8c\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u56db\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u6b20\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u6781\u7aef\u5730\u5f62\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u8db3\u8df3\u8dc3\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u76f4\u63a5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u540c\u65f6\u5e94\u5bf9\u6781\u7aef\u6b20\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u6781\u7aef\u5730\u5f62\uff08\u5982\u5355\u8db3\u8df3\u8dc3\u4efb\u52a1\uff09\u7684\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u6e90\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u53cd\u9988\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "method": "JumpER\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u9010\u6b65\u589e\u52a0\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bfe\u7a0b\uff08\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u89c2\u6d4b\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u9010\u6b65\u6f14\u5316\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u56db\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u5730\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u5355\u8db3\u8df3\u8dc3\uff0c\u80fd\u5e94\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff08\u598260\u5398\u7c73\u5bbd\u95f4\u9699\u3001\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u53f0\u9636\u7b49\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "JumpER\u4e3a\u6781\u7aef\u6b20\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u6781\u7aef\u5730\u5f62\u4e0b\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Among these, the auto white balance (AWB) module is\nessential for compensating for scene illumination. However, commercial AWB\nsystems often strive to compute aesthetic white-balance preferences rather than\naccurate neutral color correction. While learning-based methods have improved\nAWB accuracy, they typically struggle to generalize across different camera\nsensors -- an issue for smartphones with multiple cameras. Recent work has\nexplored cross-camera AWB, but most methods remain focused on achieving neutral\nwhite balance. In contrast, this paper is the first to address aesthetic\nconsistency by learning a post-illuminant-estimation mapping that transforms\nneutral illuminant corrections into aesthetically preferred corrections in a\ncamera-agnostic space. Once trained, our mapping can be applied after any\nneutral AWB module to enable consistent and stylized color rendering across\nunseen cameras. Our proposed model is lightweight -- containing only $\\sim$500\nparameters -- and runs in just 0.024 milliseconds on a typical flagship mobile\nCPU.

In this work, we identify and exploit\na critical observation: within these solvers, a large portion of the solution\nremains stable, i.e., unchanged across search iterations, causing redundant\ncomputations, especially for large-scale VRPs with long subtours. To address\nthis, we pioneer the formal study of the First-Segment-Then-Aggregate (FSTA)\ndecomposition technique to accelerate iterative solvers. Specifically, FSTA\npreserves stable solution segments during the search, aggregates nodes within\neach segment into fixed hypernodes, and focuses the search only on unstable\nportions. Yet, a key challenge lies in identifying which segments should be\naggregated by FSTA. To this end, we then introduce Learning-to-Segment (L2Seg),\na novel neural framework to intelligently differentiate potentially stable and\nunstable portions for FSTA decomposition. We present three L2Seg variants:\nnon-autoregressive (globally comprehensive but locally indiscriminate),\nautoregressive (locally refined but globally deficient), and their synergy,\nwith bespoke training and inference strategies. Empirical results on CVRP and\nVRPTW suggest that L2Seg accelerates state-of-the-art iterative solvers by up\nto 7x.

Camouflage-based physical attack is a more promising\napproach compared to the patch-based attack, offering stronger adversarial\neffectiveness in complex physical environments. However, most prior work relies\non mesh priors of the target object and virtual environments constructed by\nsimulators, which are time-consuming to obtain and inevitably differ from the\nreal world. Moreover, due to the limitations of the backgrounds in training\nimages, previous methods often fail to produce multi-view robust adversarial\ncamouflage and tend to fall into sub-optimal solutions. Due to these reasons,\nprior work lacks adversarial effectiveness and robustness across diverse\nviewpoints and physical environments. We propose a physical attack framework\nbased on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), named PGA, which provides rapid and\nprecise reconstruction with few images, along with photo-realistic rendering\ncapabilities. Our framework further enhances cross-view robustness and\nadversarial effectiveness by preventing mutual and self-occlusion among\nGaussians and employing a min-max optimization approach that adjusts the\nimaging background of each viewpoint, helping the algorithm filter out\nnon-robust adversarial features.

At the end\nof the workshop, participants will co-develop design strategies for integrating\ncare and resilience in academic ecosystems, resources for designing equitable\nsupport systems, and a peer network invested and committed to fostering a\nsupportive academic community.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\u901a\u8fc7HCI\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u5f0f\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u5173\u6000\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u878d\u5165\u5b66\u672f\u540c\u4f34\u652f\u6301\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4ece\u975e\u6b63\u5f0f\u6a21\u5f0f\u8f6c\u5411\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u7684\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b66\u672f\u5e78\u798f\u611f\u53d7\u540c\u4f34\u652f\u6301\u7f51\u7edc\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7f51\u7edc\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u975e\u6b63\u5f0f\u3001\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u4e14\u4e0d\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u673a\u6784\u5bf9\u6559\u804c\u5de5\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u52b3\u52a8\u5173\u6ce8\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528HCI\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u53c2\u4e0e\u5f0f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5173\u6000\u4f26\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f1a\u524d\u4e92\u52a8\u3001\u5171\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u53cd\u601d\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "result": "\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5c06\u5171\u540c\u5f00\u53d1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u81f4\u529b\u4e8e\u652f\u6301\u5b66\u672f\u793e\u533a\u7684\u540c\u4f34\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\u65e8\u5728\u63a8\u52a8\u5b66\u672f\u652f\u6301\u7f51\u7edc\u5411\u66f4\u5177\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u548c\u5173\u6000\u6027\u7684\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002"}}

ML can automate tasks, predict performance\noutcomes, and tailor spaces to user preferences. However, the emotional,\ncultural, and aesthetic dimensions of design remain crucial for creating spaces\nthat truly resonate with users-elements that ML alone cannot address. The key\nchallenge lies in harmonizing data-driven efficiency with the nuanced,\nsubjective aspects of design. This paper proposes a human-machine collaboration\nframework to bridge this gap. An effective framework should recognize that\nwhile ML enhances design efficiency through automation and prediction, it must\nbe paired with human creativity to ensure spaces are emotionally engaging and\nculturally relevant. Human designers contribute intuition, empathy, and\ncultural insight, guiding ML-generated solutions to align with users' emotional\nand cultural needs. Additionally, we explore how various ML models can be\nintegrated with human-centered design principles.

In this study, we present a cardiac sensing\nfoundation model (CSFM) that leverages advanced transformer architectures and a\ngenerative, masked pretraining strategy to learn unified representations from\nvast, heterogeneous health records. Our model is pretrained on an innovative\nmulti-modal integration of data from multiple large-scale datasets (including\nMIMIC-III-WDB, MIMIC-IV-ECG, and CODE), comprising cardiac signals and the\ncorresponding clinical or machine-generated text reports from approximately 1.7\nmillion individuals.

Extensive evaluations across diagnostic\ntasks, demographic information recognition, vital sign measurement, clinical\noutcome prediction, and ECG question answering reveal that CSFM consistently\noutperforms traditional one-modal-one-task approaches.

Although\nAI has demonstrated significant potential in medical diagnosis, its application\nto prenatal abdominal anomalies remains limited. Most existing studies focus on\nimage-level classification and rely on standard plane localization, placing\nless emphasis on case-level diagnosis. In this paper, we develop a case-level\nmultiple instance learning (MIL)-based method, free of standard plane\nlocalization, for classifying fetal abdominal anomalies in prenatal ultrasound.\nOur contribution is three-fold. First, we adopt a mixture-of-attention-experts\nmodule (MoAE) to weight different attention heads for various planes. Secondly,\nwe propose a medical-knowledge-driven feature selection module (MFS) to align\nimage features with medical knowledge, performing self-supervised image token\nselection at the case-level. Finally, we propose a prompt-based prototype\nlearning (PPL) to enhance the MFS. Extensively validated on a large prenatal\nabdominal ultrasound dataset containing 2,419 cases, with a total of 24,748\nimages and 6 categories, our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art\ncompetitors.

Our model is based on constructing a new Riemannian metric on a\ntwo-dimensional projection plane, which is induced by the high-dimensional\nEuclidean metric on two-dimensional smooth submanifold and reflects the\nenvironmental information of the robot. The optimal path planning problem in\nhigh-dimensional space is therefore transformed into a geometric problem on the\ntwo-dimensional plane with new Riemannian metric.

Existing methods using maximal clique search in\ncompatibility graphs achieve high recall but suffer from exponential time\ncomplexity, limiting their use in time-sensitive applications. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a fast and robust estimator, TurboReg, built upon a novel\nlightweight clique, TurboClique, and a highly parallelizable Pivot-Guided\nSearch (PGS) algorithm. First, we define the TurboClique as a 3-clique within a\nhighly-constrained compatibility graph. The lightweight nature of the 3-clique\nallows for efficient parallel searching, and the highly-constrained\ncompatibility graph ensures robust spatial consistency for stable\ntransformation estimation. Next, PGS selects matching pairs with high SC$^2$\nscores as pivots, effectively guiding the search toward TurboCliques with\nhigher inlier ratios. Moreover, the PGS algorithm has linear time complexity\nand is significantly more efficient than the maximal clique search with\nexponential time complexity.

Existing pixel-wise methods typically assign anomaly\nscores individually and employ a global thresholding strategy to segment\nanomalies.

In this work, we introduce OoDDINO, a novel\nmulti-level anomaly segmentation framework designed to address these\nlimitations through a coarse-to-fine anomaly detection strategy. OoDDINO\ncombines an uncertainty-guided anomaly detection model with a pixel-level\nsegmentation model within a two-stage cascade architecture.

Subsequently, we\ndevelop an Adaptive Dual-Threshold Network (ADT-Net), which dynamically\ngenerates region-specific thresholds based on object-level detection outputs\nand pixel-wise anomaly scores. This approach allows for distinct thresholding\nstrategies within foreground and background areas, achieving fine-grained\nanomaly segmentation.

Previous dexterous\nteleoperation mostly relies on hand retargeting to closely mimic human hand\npostures.

To address this limitation, we\npropose TypeTele, a type-guided dexterous teleoperation system, which enables\ndexterous hands to perform actions that are not constrained by human motion\npatterns. This is achieved by introducing dexterous manipulation types into the\nteleoperation system, allowing operators to employ appropriate types to\ncomplete specific tasks. To support this system, we build an extensible\ndexterous manipulation type library to cover comprehensive dexterous postures\nused in manipulation tasks.

However, traditional methane\nenhancement methods are too computationally demanding for resource-limited\nonboard hardware. This work accelerates methane detection by focusing on\nefficient, low-power algorithms. We test fast target detection methods (ACE,\nCEM) that have not been previously used for methane detection and propose a\nMag1c-SAS - a significantly faster variant of the current state-of-the-art\nalgorithm for methane detection: Mag1c. To explore their true detection\npotential, we integrate them with a machine learning model (U-Net, LinkNet).\nOur results identify two promising candidates (Mag1c-SAS and CEM), both\nacceptably accurate for the detection of strong plumes and computationally\nefficient enough for onboard deployment: one optimized more for accuracy, the\nother more for speed, achieving up to ~100x and ~230x faster computation than\noriginal Mag1c on resource-limited hardware.

However, existing\nmethods still face challenges in coordinating mobile base and manipulator,\nprimarily due to two limitations. On the one hand, they fail to explicitly\nmodel the influence of the mobile base on manipulator control, which easily\nleads to error accumulation under high degrees of freedom. On the other hand,\nthey treat the entire mobile manipulation process with the same visual\nobservation modality (e.g., either all 2D or all 3D), overlooking the distinct\nmultimodal perception requirements at different stages during mobile\nmanipulation. To address this, we propose the Adaptive Coordination Diffusion\nTransformer (AC-DiT), which enhances mobile base and manipulator coordination\nfor end-to-end mobile manipulation. First, since the motion of the mobile base\ndirectly influences the manipulator's actions, we introduce a mobility-to-body\nconditioning mechanism that guides the model to first extract base motion\nrepresentations, which are then used as context prior for predicting whole-body\nactions. This enables whole-body control that accounts for the potential impact\nof the mobile base's motion. Second, to meet the perception requirements at\ndifferent stages of mobile manipulation, we design a perception-aware\nmultimodal conditioning strategy that dynamically adjusts the fusion weights\nbetween various 2D visual images and 3D point clouds, yielding visual features\ntailored to the current perceptual needs. This allows the model to, for\nexample, adaptively rely more on 2D inputs when semantic information is crucial\nfor action prediction, while placing greater emphasis on 3D geometric\ninformation when precise spatial understanding is required.

While Camera-LiDAR fusion techniques have shown\npromising results by integrating data from both modalities, existing approaches\nprimarily focus on improving model accuracy and often neglect the robustness of\nperception models, which is a critical aspect for real-world applications. In\nthis paper, we explore strategies to enhance the robustness of multi-modal\nfusion methods for HD map construction while maintaining high accuracy. We\npropose three key components: data augmentation, a novel multi-modal fusion\nmodule, and a modality dropout training strategy. These components are\nevaluated on a challenging dataset containing 10 days of NuScenes data. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate that our proposed methods significantly\nenhance the robustness of baseline methods.

Because most of the global\nminima of the loss function are not Platonic, that SGD only finds the perfectly\nPlatonic solution is rather extraordinary. The proof also suggests at least six\nways the PRH can be broken. We also show that in the EDLN model, the emergence\nof the Platonic representations is due to the same reason as the emergence of\nprogressive sharpening.

Consequently,\nsegmentation models must ensure not only the semantic correctness of\nlarge-scale patches (low-frequency information) but also the precise\nlocalization of boundaries between patches (high-frequency information).\nHowever, most existing approaches rely heavily on discriminative learning,\nwhich excels at capturing low-frequency features, while overlooking its\ninherent limitations in learning high-frequency features for semantic\nsegmentation. Recent studies have revealed that diffusion generative models\nexcel at generating high-frequency details. Our theoretical analysis confirms\nthat the diffusion denoising process significantly enhances the model's ability\nto learn high-frequency features; however, we also observe that these models\nexhibit insufficient semantic inference for low-frequency features when guided\nsolely by the original image. Therefore, we integrate the strengths of both\ndiscriminative and generative learning, proposing the Integration of\nDiscriminative and diffusion-based Generative learning for Boundary Refinement\n(IDGBR) framework. The framework first generates a coarse segmentation map\nusing a discriminative backbone model.

Although prior works point at existing vulnerabilities, DNN backdoor\nattacks against real-life, unconstrained systems dealing with images captured\nin the wild remain a blind spot of the literature. This paper conducts the\nfirst system-level study of backdoors in deep learning-based face recognition\nsystems. This paper yields four contributions by exploring the feasibility of\nDNN backdoors on these pipelines in a holistic fashion. We demonstrate for the\nfirst time two backdoor attacks on the face detection task: face generation and\nface landmark shift attacks.

A multimodal distributional policy iteration framework that\ncan converge to the optimal policy was established by introducing policy\nentropy and value distribution function.

Based on this, a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm with\ndual diffusion of the value network and the policy network was derived.

We pretrain transformer models on sample traces from this\ntoy, specifically symbolically-labeled interleaved state observations from\nrandomly drawn linear deterministic dynamical systems. We study if the\ntransformer models can recall the state of a sequence previously seen in its\ncontext when prompted to do so with the corresponding in-context label. Taking\na closer look at this task, it becomes clear that the model must perform two\nfunctions: (1) identify which system's state should be recalled and apply that\nsystem to its last seen state, and (2) continuing to apply the correct system\nto predict the subsequent states. Training dynamics reveal that the first\ncapability emerges well into a model's training. Surprisingly, the second\ncapability, of continuing the prediction of a resumed sequence, develops much\nearlier.\n  Via out-of-distribution experiments, and a mechanistic analysis on model\nweights via edge pruning, we find that next-token prediction for this toy\nproblem involves at least two separate mechanisms. One mechanism uses the\ndiscrete symbolic labels to do the associative recall required to predict the\nstart of a resumption of a previously seen sequence. The second mechanism,\nwhich is largely agnostic to the discrete symbolic labels, performs a\n\"Bayesian-style\" prediction based on the previous token and the context.

To address this, patient-specific digital twins\n(DT) modeling temporally varying motion were created to assess the accuracy of\nDIR methods. Approach: 21 motion phases simulating digestive GI motion as 4D\nsequences were generated from static 3D patient scans using published\nanalytical GI motion models through a semi-automated pipeline. Eleven datasets,\nincluding six T2w FSE MRI (T2w MRI), two T1w 4D golden-angle stack-of-stars,\nand three contrast-enhanced CT scans. The motion amplitudes of the DTs were\nassessed against real patient stomach motion amplitudes extracted from\nindependent 4D MRI datasets. The generated DTs were then used to assess six\ndifferent DIR methods using target registration error, Dice similarity\ncoefficient, and the 95th percentile Hausdorff distance using summary metrics\nand voxel-level granular visualizations. Finally, for a subset of T2w MRI scans\nfrom patients treated with MR-guided radiation therapy, dose distributions were\nwarped and accumulated to assess dose warping errors, including evaluations of\nDIR performance in both low- and high-dose regions for patient-specific error\nestimation. Main results: Our proposed pipeline synthesized DTs modeling\nrealistic GI motion, achieving mean and maximum motion amplitudes and a mean\nlog Jacobian determinant within 0.8 mm and 0.01, respectively, similar to\npublished real-patient gastric motion data.

However,\ncurrent approaches conventionally separate image customization into\nposition-aware and position-free customization paradigms and lack a universal\nframework for diverse customization, limiting their applications across various\nscenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose IC-Custom, a unified\nframework that seamlessly integrates position-aware and position-free image\ncustomization through in-context learning. IC-Custom concatenates reference\nimages with target images to a polyptych, leveraging DiT's multi-modal\nattention mechanism for fine-grained token-level interactions. We introduce the\nIn-context Multi-Modal Attention (ICMA) mechanism with learnable task-oriented\nregister tokens and boundary-aware positional embeddings to enable the model to\ncorrectly handle different task types and distinguish various inputs in\npolyptych configurations. To bridge the data gap, we carefully curated a\nhigh-quality dataset of 12k identity-consistent samples with 8k from real-world\nsources and 4k from high-quality synthetic data, avoiding the overly glossy and\nover-saturated synthetic appearance. IC-Custom supports various industrial\napplications, including try-on, accessory placement, furniture arrangement, and\ncreative IP customization. Extensive evaluations on our proposed ProductBench\nand the publicly available DreamBench demonstrate that IC-Custom significantly\noutperforms community workflows, closed-source models, and state-of-the-art\nopen-source approaches. IC-Custom achieves approximately 73% higher human\npreference across identity consistency, harmonicity, and text alignment\nmetrics, while training only 0.4% of the original model parameters.

In this\npaper, we critically re-examine this popular family of OOD detection\nprocedures, and we argue that these methods are fundamentally answering the\nwrong questions for OOD detection. There is no simple fix to this misalignment,\nsince a classifier trained only on in-distribution classes cannot be expected\nto identify OOD points; for instance, a cat-dog classifier may confidently\nmisclassify an airplane if it contains features that distinguish cats from\ndogs, despite generally appearing nothing alike.

In contrast to\nprior approaches, such as AdaLoRA, that rely on first-order (linearized)\napproximations of the loss function, SubLoRA utilizes second-order information\nto capture the potentially complex loss landscape by incorporating the Hessian\nmatrix. We show that the linearization becomes inaccurate and ill-conditioned\nwhen the LoRA parameters have been well optimized, motivating the need for a\nmore reliable and nuanced second-order formulation. To this end, we reformulate\nthe rank determination problem as a combinatorial optimization problem with a\nquadratic objective. However, solving this problem exactly is NP-hard in\ngeneral. To overcome the computational challenge, we introduce a submodular\nfunction maximization framework and devise a greedy algorithm with\napproximation guarantees. We derive a sufficient and necessary condition under\nwhich the rank-determination objective becomes submodular, and construct a\nclosed-form projection of the Hessian matrix that satisfies this condition\nwhile maintaining computational efficiency. Our method combines solid\ntheoretical foundations, second-order accuracy, and practical computational\nefficiency. We further extend SubLoRA to a joint optimization setting,\nalternating between LoRA parameter updates and rank determination under a rank\nbudget constraint.

Traditional autoregressive image generation\nrelies on next-patch prediction, a memory-bound process that leads to high\nlatency. Existing works have tried to parallelize next-patch prediction by\nshifting to multi-patch prediction to accelerate the process, but only achieved\nlimited parallelization. To achieve high parallelization while maintaining\ngeneration quality, we introduce two key techniques: (1) Flexible Parallelized\nAutoregressive Modeling, a novel architecture that enables arbitrary generation\nordering and degrees of parallelization. It uses learnable position query\ntokens to guide generation at target positions while ensuring mutual visibility\namong concurrently generated tokens for consistent parallel decoding. (2)\nLocality-aware Generation Ordering, a novel schedule that forms groups to\nminimize intra-group dependencies and maximize contextual support, enhancing\ngeneration quality.
