To address this gap, we\nintroduce EnDive (English Diversity), a benchmark that evaluates five\nwidely-used large language models (LLMs) across tasks in language\nunderstanding, algorithmic reasoning, mathematics, and logic. Our framework\ntranslates Standard American English datasets into five underrepresented\ndialects using few-shot prompting with verified examples from native speakers,\nand compare these translations against rule-based methods via fluency\nassessments, preference tests, and semantic similarity metrics. Human\nevaluations confirm high translation quality, with average scores of at least\n6.02/7 for faithfulness, fluency, and formality. By filtering out\nnear-identical translations, we create a challenging dataset that reveals\nsignificant performance disparities - models consistently underperform on\ndialectal inputs compared to Standard American English. EnDive thus advances\ndialect-aware NLP by uncovering model biases and promoting more equitable\nlanguage technologies."}

However, annotating MAR datasets is particularly challenging due to the\nsubtlety of actions.

We first evaluate\ntraditional Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods to SSMAR and find that these\nmethods tend to overfit on inaccurate pseudo-labels, leading to error\naccumulation and degraded performance. This issue primarily arises from the\ncommon practice of directly using the predictions of classifier as\npseudo-labels to train the model. To solve this issue, we propose a novel\nframework, called Asynchronous Pseudo Labeling and Training (APLT), which\nexplicitly separates the pseudo-labeling process from model training.\nSpecifically, we introduce a semi-supervised clustering method during the\noffline pseudo-labeling phase to generate more accurate pseudo-labels.\nMoreover, a self-adaptive thresholding strategy is proposed to dynamically\nfilter noisy labels of different classes.

RAPID, which generates synthetic data for model fine-tuning, is\ncurrently the only effective method for zero-shot cross-domain code search.\nDespite its effectiveness, RAPID demands substantial computational resources\nfor fine-tuning and needs to maintain specialized models for each domain,\nunderscoring the need for a zero-shot, fine-tuning-free approach for\ncross-domain code search.\n  The key to tackling zero-shot cross-domain code search lies in bridging the\ngaps among domains.

This is further supported by jointly training the MLLM with a\npre-trained VOS memory bank to simultaneously digest short-range and long-range\ntemporal information. To improve the information efficiency within the limited\ncontext window of MLLMs, we introduce object contrastive learning to\ndistinguish hard false-positive objects and a self-refined framework to\nidentify crucial frames and perform propagation.

Automatic Pneumonia\ndetection from CXR images by deep learning model has emerged as a prominent and\ndynamic area of research, since the inception of the new Covid-19 variant in\n2020. However, the standard Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models encounter\nchallenges associated with class imbalance, a prevalent issue found in many\nmedical datasets. The innovations introduced in the proposed model architecture\ninclude: (I) A very lightweight CNN model, `VGG-Lite', is proposed as a base\nmodel, inspired by VGG-16 and MobileNet-V2 architecture. (II) On top of this\nbase model, we leverage an ``Edge Enhanced Module (EEM)\" through a parallel\nbranch, consisting of a ``negative image layer\", and a novel custom pooling\nlayer ``2Max-Min Pooling\". This 2Max-Min Pooling layer is entirely novel in\nthis investigation, providing more attention to edge components within\npneumonia CXR images. Thus, it works as an efficient spatial attention module\n(SAM). We have implemented the proposed framework on two separate CXR datasets.\nThe first dataset is obtained from a readily available source on the internet,\nand the second dataset is a more challenging CXR dataset, assembled by our\nresearch team from three different sources. Experimental results reveal that\nour proposed framework has outperformed pre-trained CNN models, and three\nrecent trend existing models ``Vision Transformer\", ``Pooling-based Vision\nTransformer (PiT)'' and ``PneuNet\", by substantial margins on both datasets.\nThe proposed framework VGG-Lite with EEM, has achieved a macro average of 95%\naccuracy, 97.1% precision, 96.1% recall, and 96.6% F1 score on the ``Pneumonia\nImbalance CXR dataset\", without employing any pre-processing technique."}
