Despite its significance, tokenization in the\ncontext of assembly code remains an underexplored area. This study aims to\naddress this gap by evaluating the intrinsic properties of Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) tokenization models and parameter choices, such as vocabulary\nsize. We explore preprocessing customization options and pre-tokenization rules\ntailored to the unique characteristics of assembly code. Additionally, we\nassess their impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction -- a\ncritical problem in binary code analysis.\n  To this end, we conduct a thorough study on various tokenization models,\nsystematically analyzing their efficiency in encoding assembly instructions and\ncapturing semantic nuances. Through intrinsic evaluations, we compare\ntokenizers based on tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, and\nrepresentational fidelity for assembly code. Using state-of-the-art pre-trained\nmodels such as the decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) Llama 3.2, the\nencoder-only transformer BERT, and the encoder-decoder model BART, we evaluate\nthe effectiveness of these tokenizers across multiple performance metrics.\nPreliminary findings indicate that tokenizer choice significantly influences\ndownstream performance, with intrinsic metrics providing partial but incomplete\npredictability of extrinsic evaluation outcomes. These results reveal complex\ntrade-offs between intrinsic tokenizer properties and their utility in\npractical assembly code tasks. Ultimately, this study provides valuable\ninsights into optimizing tokenization models for low-level code analysis,\ncontributing to the robustness and scalability of Natural Language Model\n(NLM)-based binary analysis workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6c47\u7f16\u4ee3\u7801\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u8bcd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5206\u8bcd\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u5728\u6c47\u7f16\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u6c47\u7f16\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u5728\u8bcd\u6c47\u91cf\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u6b64\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5c1a\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30NLP\u5206\u8bcd\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u5176\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u6c47\u7f16\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u79cdNLP\u5206\u8bcd\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6c47\u7f16\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0a\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u6548\u7387\u3001\u8bcd\u6c47\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u8868\u793a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86Llama 3.2\u3001BERT\u548cBART\u7b49\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u51fd\u6570\u7b7e\u540d\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5185\u5728\u6307\u6807\u90e8\u5206\u4f46\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u9884\u6d4b\u5916\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u5185\u5728\u5206\u8bcd\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u4f4e\u7ea7\u522b\u4ee3\u7801\u5206\u6790\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

At the same\ntime, there are well-documented imbalances in the training data and\noptimisation objectives of this technology, raising doubts as to whether LLMs\ncan represent the cultural diversity of their broad user base. In this study,\nwe look at LLMs and cultural values and examine how prompt language and\ncultural framing influence model responses and their alignment with human\nvalues in different countries. We probe 10 LLMs with 63 items from the Hofstede\nValues Survey Module and World Values Survey, translated into 11 languages, and\nformulated as prompts with and without different explicit cultural\nperspectives. Our study confirms that both prompt language and cultural\nperspective produce variation in LLM outputs, but with an important caveat:\nWhile targeted prompting can, to a certain extent, steer LLM responses in the\ndirection of the predominant values of the corresponding countries, it does not\novercome the models' systematic bias toward the values associated with a\nrestricted set of countries in our dataset: the Netherlands, Germany, the US,\nand Japan. All tested models, regardless of their origin, exhibit remarkably\nsimilar patterns: They produce fairly neutral responses on most topics, with\nselective progressive stances on issues such as social tolerance. Alignment\nwith cultural values of human respondents is improved more with an explicit\ncultural perspective than with a targeted prompt language. Unexpectedly,\ncombining both approaches is no more effective than cultural framing with an\nEnglish prompt. These findings reveal that LLMs occupy an uncomfortable middle\nground: They are responsive enough to changes in prompts to produce variation,\nbut too firmly anchored to specific cultural defaults to adequately represent\ncultural diversity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u6587\u5316\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u6587\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6587\u5316\u591a\u6837\u6027\u8868\u793a\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLMs\u5728\u5168\u7403\u7528\u6237\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b83\u4eec\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u5145\u5206\u4ee3\u8868\u5176\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u6237\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u6587\u5316\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Hofstede Values Survey Module\u548cWorld Values Survey\u768463\u4e2a\u6761\u76ee\uff0c\u7ffb\u8bd1\u621011\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u548c\u6ca1\u6709\u660e\u786e\u6587\u5316\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e8610\u4e2aLLMs\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u793a\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u6587\u5316\u89c6\u89d2\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4LLMs\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u56fd\u5bb6\u6587\u5316\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5982\u8377\u5170\u3001\u5fb7\u56fd\u3001\u7f8e\u56fd\u548c\u65e5\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u53d8\u5316\u6709\u53cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4f46\u53d7\u7279\u5b9a\u6587\u5316\u9ed8\u8ba4\u503c\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u4ee3\u8868\u6587\u5316\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002"}}

Results reveal statistically\nsignificant performance differences with the proposed framework, with the\ntop-performing platform, Evalion, achieving 0.92 evaluation quality measured as\nf1-score versus 0.73 for others, and 0.61 simulation quality using a league\nbased scoring system (including ties) vs 0.43 for other platforms.\n  This framework enables researchers and organizations to empirically validate\nthe testing capabilities of any platform, providing essential measurement\nfoundations for confident voice AI deployment at scale.

We introduce a\nmulti-agent predictive coding framework that formulate coordination as the\nminimization of mutual uncertainty among agents. Instantiated as an information\nbottleneck objective, it prompts agents to learn not only who and what to\ncommunicate but also when. At the foundation of this framework lies a\ngrid-cell-like metric as internal spatial coding for self-localization,\nemerging spontaneously from self-supervised motion prediction. Building upon\nthis internal spatial code, agents gradually develop a bandwidth-efficient\ncommunication mechanism and specialized neural populations that encode\npartners' locations: an artificial analogue of hippocampal social place cells\n(SPCs). These social representations are further enacted by a hierarchical\nreinforcement learning policy that actively explores to reduce joint\nuncertainty. On the Memory-Maze benchmark, our approach shows exceptional\nresilience to bandwidth constraints: success degrades gracefully from 73.5% to\n64.4% as bandwidth shrinks from 128 to 4 bits/step, whereas a full-broadcast\nbaseline collapses from 67.6% to 28.6%.

Later, Angluin gave a precise\ncharacterization of language collections for which this task is possible.\nMotivated by recent positive results for the related problem of language\ngeneration, we revisit the classic language identification problem in the\nsetting where the learner is given the additional power of producing a list of\n$k$ guesses at each time step. The goal is to ensure that beyond some finite\ntime, one of the guesses is correct at each time step.\n  We give an exact characterization of collections of languages that can be\n$k$-list identified in the limit, based on a recursive version of Angluin's\ncharacterization (for language identification with a list of size $1$). This\nfurther leads to a conceptually appealing characterization: A language\ncollection can be $k$-list identified in the limit if and only if the\ncollection can be decomposed into $k$ collections of languages, each of which\ncan be identified in the limit (with a list of size $1$). We also use our\ncharacterization to establish rates for list identification in the statistical\nsetting where the input is drawn as an i.i.d. stream from a distribution\nsupported on some language in the collection. Our results show that if a\ncollection is $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then the collection can be\n$k$-list identified at an exponential rate, and this is best possible. On the\nother hand, if a collection is not $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then it\ncannot be $k$-list identified at any rate that goes to zero.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6781\u9650\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86k-list\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ecf\u5178\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc6\u522b\u5728\u6781\u9650\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u5bf9\u51e0\u4e4e\u6240\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u96c6\u5408\u90fd\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u3002\u53d7\u5230\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u6700\u65b0\u79ef\u6781\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u751f\u6210k\u4e2a\u731c\u6d4b\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9012\u5f52\u7248\u672c\u7684Angluin\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86k-list\u6781\u9650\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0a\u5438\u5f15\u4eba\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bed\u8a00\u96c6\u5408\u53ef\u4ee5k-list\u8bc6\u522b\u5f53\u4e14\u4ec5\u5f53\u8be5\u96c6\u5408\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u5206\u89e3\u4e3ak\u4e2a\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab1-list\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u96c6\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5982\u679c\u4e00\u4e2a\u96c6\u5408\u662fk-list\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u8be5\u96c6\u5408\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ee5\u6307\u6570\u901f\u7387\u8fdb\u884ck-list\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8fd9\u662f\u6700\u4f73\u901f\u7387\u3002\u53cd\u4e4b\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u4e00\u4e2a\u96c6\u5408\u4e0d\u662fk-list\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\uff0c\u5219\u65e0\u6cd5\u4ee5\u8d8b\u8fd1\u4e8e\u96f6\u7684\u901f\u7387\u8fdb\u884ck-list\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86k-list\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86k-list\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u901f\u7387\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Yet, since they\nwere not originally designed for DM, recent studies show that LLMs can struggle\neven in basic online DM problems, failing to achieve low regret or an effective\nexploration-exploitation tradeoff. To address this, we introduce Iterative\nRegret-Minimization Fine-Tuning (Iterative RMFT), a post-training procedure\nthat repeatedly distills low-regret decision trajectories back into the base\nmodel. At each iteration, the model rolls out multiple decision trajectories,\nselects the k-lowest regret ones, and fine-tunes itself on them. Unlike prior\nmethods that (a) distill action sequences from known DM algorithms or (b) rely\non manually crafted chain-of-thought templates, our approach leverages the\nregret metric to elicit the model's own DM ability and reasoning rationales.\nThis reliance on model-generated reasoning avoids rigid output engineering and\nprovides more flexible, natural-language training signals. Empirical results\nshow that Iterative RMFT improves LLMs' DM performance across diverse models -\nfrom Transformers with numerical input/output, to open-weight LLMs, and\nadvanced closed-weight models like GPT-4o mini. Its flexibility in output and\nreasoning formats enables generalization across tasks with varying horizons,\naction spaces, reward processes, and natural-language contexts. Finally, we\nprovide theoretical insight showing that a single-layer Transformer under this\nparadigm can act as a no-regret learner in a simplified setting.

We\nempirically validate CoRPO on a code verification task, where it demonstrates\nmore stable convergence and better out-of-domain generalization.\n  This work represents a critical step in our broader research program to\nenable LLMs to learn genuinely new capabilities through reinforcement learning.\nWe achieve this by enabling LLMs to learn from rich, multi-dimensional feedback\n- progressing from binary to ordinal rewards in this work, and onward to\ndenser, per-step supervision.", "AI": {"tldr": "CoRPO\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u57fa\u7ebf\u89e3\u51b3GRPO\u5728\u4e30\u5bcc\u53cd\u9988\u4e0b\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u9519\u8bef\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u88ab\u79ef\u6781\u5f3a\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8fbe\u5230\u8d28\u91cf\u9608\u503c\u540e\u81ea\u52a8\u8f6c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5bf9\u504f\u597d\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "GRPO\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u6027\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u9002\u5e94\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u5f88\u53d7\u6b22\u8fce\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u3001\u975e\u4e8c\u5143\u53cd\u9988\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4f7f\u7528\u5e8f\u6570\u5956\u52b1\u65f6\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u5931\u8d25\u8f68\u8ff9\u88ab\u9519\u8bef\u5f3a\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165CoRPO\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u57fa\u7ebf\u6765\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u6700\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u9519\u8bef\u89e3\u4e0d\u4f1a\u88ab\u79ef\u6781\u5f3a\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u7a33\u5b9a\u540e\u81ea\u52a8\u8fc7\u6e21\u5230\u76f8\u5bf9\u504f\u597d\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cCoRPO\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548c\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u57df\u5916\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "CoRPO\u662f\u4f7fLLMs\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u771f\u6b63\u83b7\u5f97\u65b0\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5904\u7406\u66f4\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

This study presents\na data-driven sparse sensing (DSS) framework, integrated with EPA-SWMM, to\noptimize sensor placement and reconstruct peak flowrates in a stormwater\nsystem, using the Woodland Avenue catchment in Duluth, Minnesota, as a case\nstudy. We utilized a SWMM model to generate a training dataset of peak flowrate\nprofiles across the stormwater network. Furthermore, we applied DSS -\nleveraging singular value decomposition for dimensionality reduction and QR\nfactorization for sensor allocation - to identify the optimal monitoring nodes\nbased on the simulated training dataset. We then validated the\nrepresentativeness of these identified monitoring nodes by comparing the\nDSS-reconstructed peak flowrate profiles with those obtained from SWMM. Three\noptimally placed sensors among 77 nodes achieved satisfactory reconstruction\nperformance with Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) values of 0.92-0.95 (25th to\n75th percentiles). In addition, the model showed good robustness to uncertainty\nin measurements. Its robustness to sensor failures is location-dependent and\nimproves with the number of sensors deployed. The framework balances\ncomputational efficiency and physical interpretability, enabling high-accuracy\nflow reconstruction with minimal sensors.

Even after calibration, LLM outputs remain clearly distinguishable\nfrom human text, particularly in affective tone and emotional expression.\nInstruction-tuned models underperform their base counterparts, and scaling up\nmodel size does not enhance human-likeness. Crucially, we identify a trade-off:\noptimizing for human-likeness often comes at the cost of semantic fidelity, and\nvice versa. These results provide a much-needed scalable framework for\nvalidation and calibration in LLM simulations -- and offer a cautionary note\nabout their current limitations in capturing human communication.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLMs)\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u591f\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6587\u672c\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u56fe\u7075\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8eBERT\u7684\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6307\u6807\u4ee5\u53ca\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u98ce\u683c\u6807\u8bb0\u548c\u4e3b\u9898\u6a21\u5f0f\uff09\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e5d\u79cd\u5f00\u6e90LLMs\u5728\u4e94\u79cd\u6821\u51c6\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5373\u4f7f\u7ecf\u8fc7\u6821\u51c6\uff0cLLMs\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6587\u672c\u4ecd\u7136\u660e\u663e\u533a\u522b\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u8fbe\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u5982\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u5e76\u672a\u63d0\u9ad8\u7c7b\u4eba\u6027\u3002\u4f18\u5316\u7c7b\u4eba\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u727a\u7272\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u53cd\u4e4b\u4ea6\u7136\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u8b66\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5728\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u6c9f\u901a\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

On Ambiguity in Natural Language Queries for Tabular Data Analysis", "comment": "Accepted to the AI for Tabular Data workshop at EurIPS 2025", "summary": "Natural language interfaces to tabular data must handle ambiguities inherent\nto queries. Instead of treating ambiguity as a deficiency, we reframe it as a\nfeature of cooperative interaction, where the responsibility of query\nspecification is shared among the user and the system. We develop a principled\nframework distinguishing cooperative queries, i.e., queries that yield a\nresolvable interpretation, from uncooperative queries that cannot be resolved.\nApplying the framework to evaluations for tabular question answering and\nanalysis, we analyze the queries in 15 popular datasets, and observe an\nuncontrolled mixing of query types neither adequate for evaluating a system's\nexecution accuracy nor for evaluating interpretation capabilities.

However, some RLVR algorithms, such as GRPO (Group Relative\nPolicy Optimization) and GSPO (Group Sequence Policy Optimization), are\nobserved to suffer from unstable policy updates and low usage of sampling data,\nrespectively. The importance ratio of GRPO is calculated at the token level,\nwhich focuses more on optimizing a single token. This will be easily affected\nby outliers, leading to model training collapse. GSPO proposed the calculation\nof the response level importance ratio, which solves the problem of high\nvariance and training noise accumulation in the calculation of the GRPO\nimportance ratio.

These vary in meaning depending on\nthe context, making rule-based systems insufficient to quantify the level of\nuncertainty for specific findings; (ii) Implicit uncertainty arises when\nradiologists omit parts of their reasoning, recording only key findings or\ndiagnoses. Here, it is often unclear whether omitted findings are truly absent\nor simply unmentioned for brevity. We address these challenges with a two-part\nframework. We quantify explicit uncertainty by creating an expert-validated,\nLLM-based reference ranking of common hedging phrases, and mapping each finding\nto a probability value based on this reference.
