Each\ninverse operation corresponds to either an additive or a subtractive step,\nensuring both manufacturability and structural stability of intermediate shapes\nthroughout the process. We theoretically prove that any model can be fabricated\nexactly using a sequence generated by our approach. To demonstrate the\neffectiveness of this method, we adopt a voxel-based implementation and develop\na scalable algorithm that works on models represented by a large number of\nvoxels. Our approach has been tested across a range of digital models and\nfurther validated through physical fabrication on a hybrid manufacturing system\nwith automatic tool switching."}

Our key insight is to\nbridge the domain gap between real and synthetic data with a novel implicit\ntraining paradigm leveraging a combination of large-scale real video data and\nsmall-scale synthetic 3D data to optimize a shared garment embedding space.\nDuring inference, the shared embedding space further enables dynamic\nvideo-to-360{\\deg} NVS through the construction of a garment \"atlas\"\nrepresentation by finetuning a garment embedding on a specific real-world\nvideo. The atlas captures garment-specific geometry and texture across all\nviewpoints, independent of body pose or motion. Extensive experiments show that\nHoloGarment achieves state-of-the-art performance on NVS of in-the-wild\ngarments from images and videos. Notably, our method robustly handles\nchallenging real-world artifacts -- such as wrinkling, pose variation, and\nocclusion -- while maintaining photorealism, view consistency, fine texture\ndetails, and accurate geometry.

Experimental\nresults show that HaPLa achieves over 95% attack success rate on GPT-series\nmodels and 70% across all targets. Further analysis with diverse symbolic\nencoding rules also reveals a fundamental challenge: it remains difficult to\nsafely tune LLMs without significantly diminishing their helpfulness in\nresponding to benign queries."}

Although this scheme is simple to implement, it\ntends to overly focus on local information, potentially leading to the neglect\nor omission of crucial global information. To mitigate this issue, we propose\nJudge Q, a novel training method which incorporates a soft token list. This\nmethod only tunes the model's embedding layer at a low training cost. By\nconcatenating the soft token list at the end of the input sequence, we train\nthese tokens' attention map to the original input sequence to align with that\nof the actual decoded tokens.

Under the same eviction budget, our\nmethod exhibits less performance degradation compared to existing eviction\napproaches. We validate our approach through experiments conducted on models\nsuch as Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, using benchmarks\nincluding LongBench, RULER, and Needle-in-a-Haystack.

Our approach is built upon the principle of deterministic replicability, a\nproperty inherent to autoregressive models that strictly necessitates a\ncomputationally homogeneous environment where all agents operate on identical\nhardware and software stacks. Within this defined context, our framework\nenables multiple validators to probabilistically audit small, random segments\nof an LLM's output and it distributes the verification workload effectively.\nThe simulations demonstrated that targeted verification can be over 12 times\nfaster than full regeneration, with tunable parameters to adjust the detection\nprobability. By establishing a tractable mechanism for auditable LLM systems,\nour work offers a foundational layer for responsible AI and serves as a\ncornerstone for future research into the more complex, heterogeneous\nmulti-agent systems."}

These frameworks are\ntypically expressed in abstract language, lack standardized taxonomies, and\ndiffer from the proprietary classification systems used by commercial data\nproviders. In this paper, we present a semi-automatic method for constructing\nstructured knowledge representations of environmental, social, and governance\nevents reported in the news. Our approach uses lightweight ontology design,\nformal pattern modeling, and large language models to convert normative\nprinciples into reusable templates expressed in the Resource Description\nFramework.

The recent rise of large\nlanguage model (LLM) based agents demonstrates exceptional capability in coding\nand computer operation, revealing the potential for humans to interact with\noperating systems and software not by direct manipulation, but by instructing\nagents through natural language. This shift highlights the need for an\nabstraction layer, an agent-computer interface, that translates human language\ninto machine-executable commands.

However, currently, NeRF and some improved models such\nas NeRFacto are trained on three - band data and cannot take into account the\nmulti - band information. To address this problem, we propose\nMultispectral-NeRF, an enhanced neural architecture derived from NeRF that can\neffectively integrates multispectral information. Our technical contributions\ncomprise threefold modifications: Expanding hidden layer dimensionality to\naccommodate 6-band spectral inputs; Redesigning residual functions to optimize\nspectral discrepancy calculations between reconstructed and reference images;\nAdapting data compression modules to address the increased bit-depth\nrequirements of multispectral imagery. Experimental results confirm that\nMultispectral-NeRF successfully processes multi-band spectral features while\naccurately preserving the original scenes' spectral characteristics."}

By normalizing performance against inter-expert\ndisagreement, these metrics provide a more stable and realistic measure of the\nquality of predicted diagnosis. In addition to the comprehensive analysis of\ndiagnostic quality measures, our study contains a very important side result.\nOur evaluation methodology allows us to avoid selecting diagnoses from a\nlimited list when evaluating a given case.

This paper conducts an investigation of the impact\n(on performance and bias) on AI classification models of granularity in the FST\nscale. By training multiple AI models to classify benign vs. malignant lesions\nusing FST-specific data of differing granularity, we show that: (i) when\ntraining models using FST-specific data based on three groups (FST 1/2, 3/4 and\n5/6), performance is generally better for models trained on FST-specific data\ncompared to a general model trained on FST-balanced data; (ii) reducing the\ngranularity of FST scale information (from 1/2 and 3/4 to 1/2/3/4) can have a\ndetrimental effect on performance.

In this survey, we have comprehensively\nexamined current efforts and challenges of NLP models for South Asian languages\nby retrieving studies since 2020, with a focus on transformer-based models,\nsuch as BERT, T5, & GPT. We present advances and gaps across 3 essential\naspects: data, models, & tasks, such as available data sources, fine-tuning\nstrategies, & domain applications. Our findings highlight substantial issues,\nincluding missing data in critical domains (e.g., health), code-mixing, and\nlack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. Our survey aims to raise awareness\nwithin the NLP community for more targeted data curation, unify benchmarks\ntailored to cultural and linguistic nuances of South Asia, and encourage an\nequitable representation of South Asian languages.

Recent works have focused on\nachieving this decomposition using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or the 3D\nGaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation but remain hindered by two key\nlimitations: the high computational overhead associated with neural networks of\nNeRF and the use of low-frequency lighting representations, which often result\nin inefficient rendering and suboptimal relighting accuracy. We propose ROSGS,\na two-stage pipeline designed to efficiently reconstruct relightable outdoor\nscenes using the Gaussian Splatting representation. By leveraging monocular\nnormal priors, ROSGS first reconstructs the scene's geometry with the compact\n2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) representation, providing an efficient and\naccurate geometric foundation. Building upon this reconstructed geometry, ROSGS\nthen decomposes the scene's texture and lighting through a hybrid lighting\nmodel. This model effectively represents typical outdoor lighting by employing\na spherical Gaussian function to capture the directional, high-frequency\ncomponents of sunlight, while learning a radiance transfer function via\nSpherical Harmonic coefficients to model the remaining low-frequency skylight\ncomprehensively. Both quantitative metrics and qualitative comparisons\ndemonstrate that ROSGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in relighting\noutdoor scenes and highlight its ability to deliver superior relighting\naccuracy and rendering efficiency."}

Existing hallucination mitigation methods are mainly based on\npreference alignment and require external human annotations or auxiliary models\nfor preference data collection, which increase costs and limit sustainable\nimprovement. To tackle these challenges, we propose Autonomous Preference\nAlignment via Self-Injection (APASI), a novel and generalizable method that\nmitigates hallucinations without external dependencies. APASI leverages the\ntarget LVLM to self-inject hallucinations into a generated response, creating a\npair of responses with varying preference levels. During the self-injection\nprocess, the dis-preferred response is generated based on three key\nobservations of hallucinations, ensuring it simulates real hallucination\npatterns. This fidelity offers an accurate learning signal for hallucination\nmitigation. Moreover, APASI incorporates an iterative alignment training\nstrategy combined with curriculum learning to periodically update the\npreference data with increasing challenge, enabling stable and continuous\nenhancement of the LVLM. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks show that\nAPASI not only effectively mitigates hallucinations for three baseline models\nbut also achieves comparable or even superior performance to alignment-based\nmethods with external dependency, thereby demonstrating its effectiveness and\ngeneralization capability.

Due to\nthe suddenness and instability of news events, the authenticity labels of news\ncan potentially shift as events develop, making it crucial for fake news\ndetection to obtain the latest event updates. Existing methods employ\nretrieval-augmented generation to fill knowledge gaps, but they suffer from\nissues such as insufficient credibility of retrieved content and interference\nfrom noisy information. We propose a dynamic knowledge update-driven model for\nfake news detection (DYNAMO), which leverages knowledge graphs to achieve\ncontinuous updating of new knowledge and integrates with large language models\nto fulfill dual functions: news authenticity detection and verification of new\nknowledge correctness, solving the two key problems of ensuring the\nauthenticity of new knowledge and deeply mining news semantics. Specifically,\nwe first construct a news-domain-specific knowledge graph. Then, we use Monte\nCarlo Tree Search to decompose complex news and verify them step by step.\nFinally, we extract and update new knowledge from verified real news texts and\nreasoning paths.

This study used electroencephalography\n(EEG) to compare how people process humor from AI versus human sources.\nBehavioral analysis revealed that participants rated AI and human humor as\ncomparably funny. However, neurophysiological data showed that AI humor\nelicited a smaller N400 effect, suggesting reduced cognitive effort during the\nprocessing of incongruity. This was accompanied by a larger Late Positive\nPotential (LPP), indicating a greater degree of surprise and emotional\nresponse. This enhanced LPP likely stems from the violation of low initial\nexpectations regarding AI's comedic capabilities. Furthermore, a key temporal\ndynamic emerged: human humor showed habituation effects, marked by an\nincreasing N400 and a decreasing LPP over time. In contrast, AI humor\ndemonstrated increasing processing efficiency and emotional reward, with a\ndecreasing N400 and an increasing LPP. This trajectory reveals how the brain\ncan dynamically update its predictive model of AI capabilities. This process of\ncumulative reinforcement challenges \"algorithm aversion\" in humor, as it\ndemonstrates how cognitive adaptation to AI's language patterns can lead to an\nintensified emotional reward. Additionally, participants' social attitudes\ntoward AI modulated these neural responses, with higher perceived AI\ntrustworthiness correlating with enhanced emotional engagement.

Standard approaches either discard missing samples, require\nimputation or repurpose dropout learning schemes, limiting robustness and\ngeneralizability. To address this, we propose a hypernetwork-based method that\ndynamically generates task-specific classification models conditioned on the\nset of available modalities. Instead of training a fixed model, a hypernetwork\nlearns to predict the parameters of a task model adapted to available\nmodalities, enabling training and inference on all samples, regardless of\ncompleteness. We compare this approach with (1) models trained only on complete\ndata, (2) state of the art channel dropout methods, and (3) an imputation-based\nmethod, using artificially incomplete datasets to systematically analyze\nrobustness to missing modalities. Results demonstrate superior adaptability of\nour method, outperforming state of the art approaches with an absolute increase\nin accuracy of up to 8% when trained on a dataset with 25% completeness (75% of\ntraining data with missing modalities).

A key reason for\nthis fragility is their reliance on local texture cues rather than global\nobject shapes -- a stark contrast to human perception. To address this, we\npropose two complementary regularization strategies designed to encourage\nshape-biased representations and enhance robustness. The first introduces an\nauxiliary loss that enforces feature consistency between original and\nlow-frequency filtered inputs, discouraging dependence on high-frequency\ntextures. The second incorporates supervised contrastive learning to structure\nthe feature space around class-consistent, shape-relevant representations.\nEvaluated on the CIFAR-10-C benchmark, both methods improve corruption\nrobustness without degrading clean accuracy. Our results suggest that\nloss-level regularization can effectively steer CNNs toward more shape-aware,\nresilient representations."}

HyGDL operates on a single encoder and\nanalytically defines style as the component of a representation that is\northogonal to its style-invariant content, derived via vector projection."}

While most\nexisting SAM-based COD models primarily focus on enhancing SAM by extracting\nfavorable features and amplifying its advantageous parameters, a crucial gap is\nidentified: insufficient attention to adverse parameters that impair SAM's\nsemantic understanding in downstream tasks. To tackle this issue, the Reverse\nSAM Parameter Configuration Module is proposed to effectively mitigate the\ninfluence of adverse parameters in a train-free manner by configuring SAM's\nparameters.

Specifically, we introduce a fetal-specific augmentation\nstrategy that simulates the distinct intrauterine environment and fetal\npositioning of early GAs. Our experiments find that cross-population\naugmentation yields reduced variability and significant improvements across\nboth older GA and challenging early GA cases. By enabling more reliable pose\nestimation across gestation, our work potentially facilitates early clinical\ndetection and intervention in challenging 4D fetal imaging settings.

Extensive experiments on complex T2I tasks using black-box models\ndemonstrate that Maestro significantly improves image quality over initial\nprompts and state-of-the-art automated methods, with effectiveness scaling with\nmore advanced MLLM components. This work presents a robust, interpretable, and\neffective pathway towards self-improving T2I generation."}

However, it often struggles under sparse-view settings,\nproducing undesirable artifacts such as floaters, inaccurate geometry, and\noverfitting due to limited observations. We find that a key contributing factor\nis uncontrolled densification, where adding Gaussian primitives rapidly without\nguidance can harm geometry and cause artifacts. We propose AD-GS, a novel\nalternating densification framework that interleaves high and low densification\nphases. During high densification, the model densifies aggressively, followed\nby photometric loss based training to capture fine-grained scene details. Low\ndensification then primarily involves aggressive opacity pruning of Gaussians\nfollowed by regularizing their geometry through pseudo-view consistency and\nedge-aware depth smoothness. This alternating approach helps reduce overfitting\nby carefully controlling model capacity growth while progressively refining the\nscene representation. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate\nthat AD-GS significantly improves rendering quality and geometric consistency\ncompared to existing methods."}

Time-domain backprojection is the most common 3D SAS reconstruction\nalgorithm, but it does not model directionality and can suffer from sampling\nlimitations, aliasing, and occlusion. Prior neural volumetric methods applied\nto synthetic aperture sonar treat each voxel as an isotropic scattering\ndensity, not modeling anisotropic returns. We introduce SH-SAS, an implicit\nneural representation that expresses the complex acoustic scattering field as a\nset of spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients. A multi-resolution hash encoder\nfeeds a lightweight MLP that outputs complex SH coefficients up to a specified\ndegree L. The zeroth-order coefficient acts as an isotropic scattering field,\nwhich also serves as the density term, while higher orders compactly capture\ndirectional scattering with minimal parameter overhead. Because the model\npredicts the complex amplitude for any transmit-receive baseline, training is\nperformed directly from 1-D time-of-flight signals without the need to beamform\nintermediate images for supervision. Across synthetic and real SAS (both in-air\nand underwater) benchmarks, results show that SH-SAS performs better in terms\nof 3D reconstruction quality and geometric metrics than previous methods."}

This work presents an evaluation of five\nrepresentative VLA models -- spanning state-of-the-art baselines and two newly\nproposed architectures -- targeting edge and datacenter GPU platforms. Using\nthe LIBERO benchmark, we measure accuracy alongside system-level metrics,\nincluding latency, throughput, and peak memory usage, under varying edge power\nconstraints and high-performance datacenter GPU configurations. Our results\nidentify distinct scaling trends: (1) architectural choices, such as action\ntokenization and model backbone size, strongly influence throughput and memory\nfootprint; (2) power-constrained edge devices exhibit non-linear performance\ndegradation, with some configurations matching or exceeding older datacenter\nGPUs; and (3) high-throughput variants can be achieved without significant\naccuracy loss.

Although\nrecent advances in multimodal models have improved motion understanding,\ngenerating precise and sport-specific instruction remains challenging due to\nthe highly domain-specific nature of sports and the need for informative\nguidance. We propose CoachMe, a reference-based model that analyzes the\ndifferences between a learner's motion and a reference under temporal and\nphysical aspects. This approach enables both domain-knowledge learning and the\nacquisition of a coach-like thinking process that identifies movement errors\neffectively and provides feedback to explain how to improve. In this paper, we\nillustrate how CoachMe adapts well to specific sports such as skating and\nboxing by learning from general movements and then leveraging limited data.\nExperiments show that CoachMe provides high-quality instructions instead of\ndirections merely in the tone of a coach but without critical information.\nCoachMe outperforms GPT-4o by 31.6% in G-Eval on figure skating and by 58.3% on\nboxing. Analysis further confirms that it elaborates on errors and their\ncorresponding improvement methods in the generated instructions. You can find\nCoachMe here: https://motionxperts.github.io/"}

However, prior AI\nevaluations have focused on final diagnoses without addressing the multifaceted\nreasoning and presentation skills required of expert discussants.\n  METHODS: Using 7102 CPCs (1923-2025) and 1021 Image Challenges (2006-2025),\nwe conducted extensive physician annotation and automated processing to create\nCPC-Bench, a physician-validated benchmark spanning 10 text-based and\nmultimodal tasks, against which we evaluated leading large language models\n(LLMs). Then, we developed \"Dr. CaBot,\" an AI discussant designed to produce\nwritten and slide-based video presentations using only the case presentation,\nmodeling the role of the human expert in these cases.\n  RESULTS: When challenged with 377 contemporary CPCs, o3 (OpenAI) ranked the\nfinal diagnosis first in 60% of cases and within the top ten in 84% of cases,\noutperforming a 20-physician baseline; next-test selection accuracy reached\n98%. Event-level physician annotations quantified AI diagnostic accuracy per\nunit of information. Performance was lower on literature search and image\ntasks; o3 and Gemini 2.5 Pro (Google) achieved 67% accuracy on image\nchallenges. In blinded comparisons of CaBot vs. human expert-generated text,\nphysicians misclassified the source of the differential in 46 of 62 (74%) of\ntrials, and scored CaBot more favorably across quality dimensions. To promote\nresearch, we are releasing CaBot and CPC-Bench.\n  CONCLUSIONS: LLMs exceed physician performance on complex text-based\ndifferential diagnosis and convincingly emulate expert medical presentations,\nbut image interpretation and literature retrieval remain weaker. CPC-Bench and\nCaBot may enable transparent and continued tracking of progress in medical AI."}
