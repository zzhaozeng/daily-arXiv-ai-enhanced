Unlike text-to-motion generation,\nsingle-shot models allow animators to controllably generate variations of\nexisting motion patterns without requiring additional data or extensive\nretraining. However, existing single-shot methods do not explicitly offer a\ncontrollable framework for blending two or more motions within a single\ngenerative pass. In this paper, we present the first single-shot motion\nblending framework that enables seamless blending by temporally conditioning\nthe generation process. Our method introduces a skeleton-aware normalization\nmechanism to guide the transition between motions, allowing smooth, data-driven\ncontrol over when and how motions blend. We perform extensive quantitative and\nqualitative evaluations across various animation styles and different kinematic\nskeletons, demonstrating that our approach produces plausible, smooth, and\ncontrollable motion blends in a unified and efficient manner."}

While deep learning has\nrevolutionized terrestrial 3D detection, its application underwater faces a\ncritical bottleneck: obtaining sufficient annotated sonar data is prohibitively\nexpensive and logistically complex, often requiring specialized vessels, expert\nsurveyors, and favorable weather conditions. This work addresses a fundamental\nquestion: Can we achieve reliable underwater 3D object detection without\nreal-world training data? We tackle this challenge by developing and comparing\ntwo paradigms for training-free detection of artificial structures in multibeam\necho-sounder point clouds. Our dual approach combines a physics-based sonar\nsimulation pipeline that generates synthetic training data for state-of-the-art\nneural networks, with a robust model-based template matching system that\nleverages geometric priors of target objects. Evaluation on real bathymetry\nsurveys from the Baltic Sea reveals surprising insights: while neural networks\ntrained on synthetic data achieve 98% mean Average Precision (mAP) on simulated\nscenes, they drop to 40% mAP on real sonar data due to domain shift.\nConversely, our template matching approach maintains 83% mAP on real data\nwithout requiring any training, demonstrating remarkable robustness to acoustic\nnoise and environmental variations. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom\nabout data-hungry deep learning in underwater domains and establish the first\nlarge-scale benchmark for training-free underwater 3D detection.

Using cyclic operations involving the imaginary unit\n\\emph{i}, we describe a rotational semantic structure capable of modeling\nirony, homonymy, and ambiguity. At the center of this model, however, is a\nsemantic attractor -- a teleological operator that, unlike statistical\ncomputation, acts as an intentional agent (Microvitum), guiding meaning toward\nstability, clarity, and expressive depth. Conceived in terms of gradient flows,\ntensor deformations, and iterative matrix dynamics, the attractor offers a\nmodel of semantic transformation that is not only mathematically suggestive,\nbut also philosophically significant.

GNNs often learn 'spurious' correlations from superficial code\nsimilarities, producing detectors that fail to generalize well to unseen\nreal-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for robust and\ninterpretable vulnerability detection, called VISION, to mitigate spurious\ncorrelations by systematically augmenting a counterfactual training dataset.\nCounterfactuals are samples with minimal semantic modifications but opposite\nlabels. Our framework includes: (i) generating counterfactuals by prompting a\nLarge Language Model (LLM); (ii) targeted GNN training on paired code examples\nwith opposite labels; and (iii) graph-based interpretability to identify the\ncrucial code statements relevant for vulnerability predictions while ignoring\nspurious ones.

This naturally raises an important question: can\ngeneral-purpose standalone VLMs effectively solve HOI detection, and how do\nthey compare with specialized HOI methods? Answering this requires a benchmark\nthat can accommodate both paradigms. However, existing HOI benchmarks such as\nHICO-DET were developed before the emergence of modern VLMs, and their\nevaluation protocols require exact matches to annotated HOI classes. This is\npoorly aligned with the generative nature of VLMs, which often yield multiple\nvalid interpretations in ambiguous cases.

As a result, research methods that enable\nsense-making with larger volumes of qualitative data, while not increasing the\nburden on the researcher, have significant potential within CER.\n  In this discussion paper, we propose such a method for conducting rigorous\nanalysis on large volumes of textual data, namely a variation of LLM-assisted\ncontent analysis (LACA). This method combines content analysis with the use of\nlarge language models, empowering researchers to conduct larger-scale research\nwhich they would otherwise not be able to perform. Using a computing education\ndataset, we illustrate how LACA could be applied in a reproducible and rigorous\nmanner.

To address these limitations, we introduce HDS-QA (Hybrid Deep Search\nQA), a synthetic dataset automatically generated from Natural Questions,\nexplicitly designed to train LRMs to distinguish parallelizable from sequential\nqueries. HDS-QA comprises hybrid-hop questions that combine parallelizable\nindependent subqueries (executable simultaneously) and sequentially dependent\nsubqueries (requiring step-by-step resolution), along with synthetic\nreasoning-querying-retrieval paths involving parallel queries. We fine-tune an\nLRM using HDS-QA, naming the model HybridDeepSearcher, which outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines across multiple benchmarks, notably achieving +15.9\nand +11.5 F1 on FanOutQA and a subset of BrowseComp, respectively, both\nrequiring comprehensive and exhaustive search. Experimental results highlight\ntwo key advantages: HybridDeepSearcher reaches comparable accuracy with fewer\nsearch turns, significantly reducing inference latency, and it effectively\nscales as more turns are permitted. These results demonstrate the efficiency,\nscalability, and effectiveness of explicitly training LRMs to leverage hybrid\nparallel and sequential querying."}

Meanwhile, humans in the\nHOI categories are fixed, while objects and their interactions are variable.\nTherefore, we propose a Dual Query Enhancement Network (DQEN) to enhance object\nand interaction queries. Specifically, object queries are enhanced with\nobject-aware encoder features, enabling the model to focus more effectively on\nhumans interacting with objects in an object-aware way. On the other hand, we\ndesign a novel Interaction Semantic Fusion module to exploit the HOI candidates\nthat are promoted by the CLIP model. Semantic features are extracted to enhance\nthe initialization of interaction queries, thereby improving the model's\nability to understand interactions. Furthermore, we introduce an Auxiliary\nPrediction Unit aimed at improving the representation of interaction features.\nOur proposed method achieves competitive performance on both the HICO-Det and\nthe V-COCO datasets.

While deep learning has\nrevolutionized terrestrial 3D detection, its application underwater faces a\ncritical bottleneck: obtaining sufficient annotated sonar data is prohibitively\nexpensive and logistically complex, often requiring specialized vessels, expert\nsurveyors, and favorable weather conditions. This work addresses a fundamental\nquestion: Can we achieve reliable underwater 3D object detection without\nreal-world training data? We tackle this challenge by developing and comparing\ntwo paradigms for training-free detection of artificial structures in multibeam\necho-sounder point clouds. Our dual approach combines a physics-based sonar\nsimulation pipeline that generates synthetic training data for state-of-the-art\nneural networks, with a robust model-based template matching system that\nleverages geometric priors of target objects. Evaluation on real bathymetry\nsurveys from the Baltic Sea reveals surprising insights: while neural networks\ntrained on synthetic data achieve 98% mean Average Precision (mAP) on simulated\nscenes, they drop to 40% mAP on real sonar data due to domain shift.\nConversely, our template matching approach maintains 83% mAP on real data\nwithout requiring any training, demonstrating remarkable robustness to acoustic\nnoise and environmental variations.

To enable this, we introduce a novel\ncontinuous speech tokenizer that, when compared to the popular Encodec model,\nimproves data compression by 80 times while maintaining comparable performance.\nThe tokenizer effectively preserves audio fidelity while significantly boosting\ncomputational efficiency for processing long sequences. Thus, VibeVoice can\nsynthesize long-form speech for up to 90 minutes (in a 64K context window\nlength) with a maximum of 4 speakers, capturing the authentic conversational\n``vibe'' and surpassing open-source and proprietary dialogue models."}

However, most systems remain constrained by a linear\nrequest-response format that often makes interactions inefficient in\nmulti-turn, information-dense, and exploratory tasks. To address these\nlimitations, we propose Generative Interfaces for Language Models, a paradigm\nin which LLMs respond to user queries by proactively generating user interfaces\n(UIs) that enable more adaptive and interactive engagement. Our framework\nleverages structured interface-specific representations and iterative\nrefinements to translate user queries into task-specific UIs. For systematic\nevaluation, we introduce a multidimensional assessment framework that compares\ngenerative interfaces with traditional chat-based ones across diverse tasks,\ninteraction patterns, and query types, capturing functional, interactive, and\nemotional aspects of user experience. Results show that generative interfaces\nconsistently outperform conversational ones, with humans preferring them in\nover 70% of cases. These findings clarify when and why users favor generative\ninterfaces, paving the way for future advancements in human-AI interaction."}
