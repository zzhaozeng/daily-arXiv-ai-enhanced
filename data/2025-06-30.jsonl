It is widely recognized that achieving\nhuman-like efficiency and robustness manipulation requires the robotic brain to\nintegrate a comprehensive set of functions, such as task planning, policy\ngeneration, anomaly monitoring and handling, and long-term memory, achieving\nhigh-efficiency operation across all functions. Vision-Language Models (VLMs),\npretrained on massive multimodal data, have acquired rich world knowledge,\nexhibiting exceptional scene understanding and multimodal reasoning\ncapabilities. However, existing methods typically focus on realizing only a\nsingle function or a subset of functions within the robotic brain, without\nintegrating them into a unified cognitive architecture. Inspired by a\ndivide-and-conquer strategy and the architecture of the human brain, we propose\nFrankenBot, a VLM-driven, brain-morphic robotic manipulation framework that\nachieves both comprehensive functionality and high operational efficiency. Our\nframework includes a suite of components, decoupling a part of key functions\nfrom frequent VLM calls, striking an optimal balance between functional\ncompleteness and system efficiency. Specifically, we map task planning, policy\ngeneration, memory management, and low-level interfacing to the cortex,\ncerebellum, temporal lobe-hippocampus complex, and brainstem, respectively, and\ndesign efficient coordination mechanisms for the modules.

In this work we\nadopt a strategy of point cloud decoupling and joint optimization to achieve\nthe decoupled reconstruction of backgrounds and human bodies while preserving\nthe interactivity of human motion. We introduce a position texture to subdivide\nthe Skinned Multi-Person Linear (SMPL) body model's surface and grow the human\npoint cloud. To capture fine details of human dynamics and deformations, we\nincorporate a convolutional neural network structure to predict human body\npoint cloud features based on texture. This strategy makes our approach free of\nhyperparameter tuning for densification and efficiently represents human points\nwith half the point cloud of HUGS. This approach ensures high-quality human\nreconstruction and reduces GPU resource consumption during training. As a\nresult, our method surpasses the previous state-of-the-art HUGS in\nreconstruction metrics while maintaining the ability to generalize to novel\nposes and views. Furthermore, our technique achieves real-time rendering at\nover 100 FPS, $\\sim$6$\\times$ the HUGS speed using only Linear Blend Skinning\n(LBS) weights for human transformation.

While Reinforcement\nlearning (RL) can boost reasoning in LLMs, applying it to MLLMs is tricky.\nCommon issues include a drop in performance on general tasks and the generation\nof overly detailed or \"overthinking\" reasoning. Our work investigates how the\nKL penalty and overthinking affect RL training in MLLMs. We propose Asymmetric\nPolicy Optimization (APO) to address these issues, which divides the sampled\nresponses into positive and negative groups. For positive samples,\nDifficulty-Adaptive Divergence Shaping (DADS) is introduced to dynamically\nadjust the KL divergence weight based on their difficulty.

Such\nmultidimensional settings are not merely of theoretical interest but are\ncentral to many real-world applications. For example, cloud computing resources\nare evaluated based on multiple criteria such as CPU cores, memory, and network\nbandwidth. In such cases, traditional one dimensional fairness notions fail to\ncapture fairness across multiple attributes. To address these challenges, we\nstudy two relaxed variants of envy-freeness: weak simultaneously envy-free up\nto c goods (weak sEFc) and strong simultaneously envy-free up to c goods\n(strong sEFc), which accommodate the multidimensionality of agents'\npreferences. Under the weak notion, for every pair of agents and for each\ndimension, any perceived envy can be eliminated by removing, if necessary, a\ndifferent set of goods from the envied agent's allocation. In contrast, the\nstrong version requires selecting a single set of goods whose removal from the\nenvied bundle simultaneously eliminates envy in every dimension. We provide\nupper and lower bounds on the relaxation parameter c that guarantee the\nexistence of weak or strong sEFc allocations, where these bounds are\nindependent of the total number of items.

Ideally, a theorist abstracts protocols as ideal,\nimplementation-independent primitives, letting conclusions in the \"ideal world\"\ncarry over to the \"real world.\" This is crucial, since the game theorist\ncannot--and should not be expected to--handle full cryptographic complexity. In\ntoday's landscape, the rise of distributed ledgers makes a shared language\nbetween cryptography and game theory increasingly necessary.\n  The security of cryptographic protocols hinges on two types of assumptions:\nstate-of-the-world (e.g., \"factoring is hard\") and behavioral (e.g., \"honest\nmajority\").

Recent empirical studies indicate that nearly\n47% of students use LLMs in their coursework - with 39% using them for exam\nquestions and 7% for entire assignments - while detection tools currently\nachieve around 88% accuracy, leaving a 12% error margin. This article\ncritically examines the opportunities offered by generative AI, explores the\nmultifaceted challenges it poses, and outlines robust policy solutions.\nEmphasis is placed on redesigning assessments to be AI-resilient, enhancing\nstaff and student training, implementing multi-layered enforcement mechanisms,\nand defining acceptable use. By synthesizing data from recent research and case\nstudies, the article argues that proactive policy adaptation is imperative to\nharness AI's potential while safeguarding the core values of academic integrity\nand equity."}

This limitation is noteworthy, as the human brain\ninherently processes three-dimensional spatial information regardless of\nwhether observing 2D images or the real world.

To improve the automation of these bidding\nsystems, we adopt generative models, namely the Decision Transformer (DT), to\ntackle the difficulties inherent in automated bidding. Applying the Decision\nTransformer to the auto-bidding task enables a unified approach to sequential\nmodeling, which efficiently overcomes short-sightedness by capturing long-term\ndependencies between past bidding actions and user behavior. Nevertheless,\nconventional DT has certain drawbacks: (1) DT necessitates a preset\nreturn-to-go (RTG) value before generating actions, which is not inherently\nproduced; (2) The policy learned by DT is restricted by its training data,\nwhich is consists of mixed-quality trajectories. To address these challenges,\nwe introduce the R* Decision Transformer (R* DT), developed in a three-step\nprocess: (1) R DT: Similar to traditional DT, R DT stores actions based on\nstate and RTG value, as well as memorizing the RTG for a given state using the\ntraining set; (2) R^ DT: We forecast the highest value (within the training\nset) of RTG for a given state, deriving a suboptimal policy based on the\ncurrent state and the forecasted supreme RTG value; (3) R* DT: Based on R^ DT,\nwe generate trajectories and select those with high rewards (using a simulator)\nto augment our training dataset.

PiPRL adopts a hierarchical and modularized neuro-symbolic\nintegration, where a meta symbolic program receives semantically meaningful\nfeatures from a neural perception module, which form the bases for symbolic\nprogramming that encodes physics priors and guides the RL process of a\nlow-level neural controller. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PiPRL\nconsistently outperforms purely symbolic or neural policies and reduces\ntraining time by over 26% with the help of the program-based inductive biases."}

In this work, we propose to accelerate CFM and introduce an\ninterpretable representation of its dynamics by integrating Koopman operator\ntheory, which models non-linear flows as linear evolution in a learned space of\nobservables. We introduce a decoder-free Koopman-CFM architecture that learns\nan embedding where the generative dynamics become linear, enabling closed-form,\none-step sampling via matrix exponentiation. This results in significant\nspeedups over traditional CFM as demonstrated on controlled 2D datasets and\nreal-world benchmarks, MNIST, Fashion-MNIST (F-MNIST), and the Toronto Face\nDataset (TFD). Unlike previous methods, our approach leads to a well-structured\nKoopman generator, whose spectral properties, eigenvalues, and eigenfunctions\noffer principled tools for analyzing generative behavior such as temporal\nscaling, mode stability, and decomposition in Koopman latent space. By\ncombining sampling efficiency with analytical structure, Koopman-enhanced flow\nmatching offers a potential step toward fast and interpretable generative\nmodeling."}

While some recent advances have explored\nreasoning in machines, these efforts are largely limited to verbal domains such\nas mathematical problem-solving, where explicit rules govern step-by-step\nreasoning. Other critical real-world tasks - including visual perception,\nspatial reasoning, and radiological diagnosis - require non-verbal reasoning,\nwhich remains an open challenge. Here we present a novel learning paradigm that\nenables machine reasoning in vision by allowing performance improvement with\nincreasing thinking time (inference-time compute), even under conditions where\nlabelled data is very limited. Inspired by dual-process theories of human\ncognition in psychology, our approach integrates a fast-thinking System I\nmodule for familiar tasks, with a slow-thinking System II module that\niteratively refines solutions using self-play reinforcement learning. This\nparadigm mimics human reasoning by proposing, competing over, and refining\nsolutions in data-scarce scenarios. We demonstrate superior performance through\nextended thinking time, compared not only to large-scale supervised learning\nbut also foundation models and even human experts, in real-world vision tasks.\nThese tasks include computer-vision benchmarks and cancer localisation on\nmedical images across five organs, showcasing transformative potential for\nnon-verbal machine reasoning."}

This\nerror-bias is not trivial since it is closely connected to the ambiguous\nlandmark labeling task. Inspired by this observation, we seek a way to leverage\nthe error-bias property for better convergence of CNN model. To this end, we\npropose anisotropic direction loss (ADL) and anisotropic attention module (AAM)\nfor coordinate and heatmap regression, respectively.

This paradigm inherently establishes class-specific objectness criteria\nand suffers from unrepresentative novel class samples. To resolve this\nlimitation, we propose a Uniform Orthogonal Feature Space (UOFS) optimization\nframework.

This decoupling enables transferring class-agnostic objectness\nknowledge from base classes to novel classes. Moreover, implementing the\ndisentanglement requires careful attention to two challenges: (1) Base set\nimages contain unlabeled foreground instances, causing confusion between\npotential novel class instances and backgrounds.

To\nsimplify the editing process, we design a novel Dual-Propagation Strategy that\nallows users to perform edits on the 3D mesh of a single frame, and the edits\nare then automatically propagated to the 3D meshes of the other frames. The 3D\nmeshes for different frames are further projected onto the 2D space to produce\nthe edited geometry and texture renderings, which serve as inputs to a\ndecoupled video diffusion model for generating edited results.

Preprint", "summary": "Pointing gestures are a common interaction method used in Human-Robot\nCollaboration for various tasks, ranging from selecting targets to guiding\nindustrial processes. This study introduces a method for localizing pointed\ntargets within a planar workspace. The approach employs pose estimation, and a\nsimple geometric model based on shoulder-wrist extension to extract gesturing\ndata from an RGB-D stream. The study proposes a rigorous methodology and\ncomprehensive analysis for evaluating pointing gestures and target selection in\ntypical robotic tasks. In addition to evaluating tool accuracy, the tool is\nintegrated into a proof-of-concept robotic system, which includes object\ndetection, speech transcription, and speech synthesis to demonstrate the\nintegration of multiple modalities in a collaborative application. Finally, a\ndiscussion over tool limitations and performance is provided to understand its\nrole in multimodal robotic systems.

Grasp and target waypoints for\nfuture DLO states are planned from the current DLO shape. Grasp poses are\ncomputed from indexing the tracked piecewise linear curve representing the DLO\nstate based on the current curve shape and are piecewise continuous. KnotDLO\ncomputes intermediate waypoints from the geometry of the current DLO state and\nthe desired next state. The system decouples visual reasoning from control. In\n16 trials of knot tying, KnotDLO achieves a 50% success rate in tying an\noverhand knot from previously unseen configurations."}

However, sampling from CFM still relies on numerically solving\nnon-linear ODEs which can be computationally expensive and difficult to\ninterpret. Recent alternatives address sampling speed via trajectory\nstraightening, mini-batch coupling or distillation. However, these methods\ntypically do not shed light on the underlying \\textit{structure} of the\ngenerative process. In this work, we propose to accelerate CFM and introduce an\ninterpretable representation of its dynamics by integrating Koopman operator\ntheory, which models non-linear flows as linear evolution in a learned space of\nobservables. We introduce a decoder-free Koopman-CFM architecture that learns\nan embedding where the generative dynamics become linear, enabling closed-form,\none-step sampling via matrix exponentiation. This results in significant\nspeedups over traditional CFM as demonstrated on controlled 2D datasets and\nreal-world benchmarks, MNIST, Fashion-MNIST (F-MNIST), and the Toronto Face\nDataset (TFD). Unlike previous methods, our approach leads to a well-structured\nKoopman generator, whose spectral properties, eigenvalues, and eigenfunctions\noffer principled tools for analyzing generative behavior such as temporal\nscaling, mode stability, and decomposition in Koopman latent space. By\ncombining sampling efficiency with analytical structure, Koopman-enhanced flow\nmatching offers a potential step toward fast and interpretable generative\nmodeling."}
