Each question is accompanied by a large offline corpus of tens of\nthousands of relevant web pages, enabling a way to elicit realistic \"forecasts\"\non past events from LLMs. Results suggest that our pastcasting environment can\nproduce results comparable to those based on forecasts using the internet on\nat-the-time unresolved questions. We show results benchmarking agent and\nchain-of-thought forecasting approaches using several LLMs, including the\nrecently-released Claude 4 models, and demonstrate BTF's ability to track\nsteady forecasting capability progress over time. We intend this to be a living\nbenchmark, with new questions added continually to account for increasing\ntraining data cutoff dates.

CNNs are effective at capturing spatial\nartifacts, and Transformers excel at modeling temporal inconsistencies.\nHowever, many existing CNN-Transformer models process spatial and temporal\nfeatures independently. In particular, attention-based methods often use\nseparate attention mechanisms for spatial and temporal features and combine\nthem using naive approaches like averaging, addition, or concatenation, which\nlimits the depth of spatio-temporal interaction. To address this challenge, we\npropose a unified CAST model that leverages cross-attention to effectively fuse\nspatial and temporal features in a more integrated manner. Our approach allows\ntemporal features to dynamically attend to relevant spatial regions, enhancing\nthe model's ability to detect fine-grained, time-evolving artifacts such as\nflickering eyes or warped lips. This design enables more precise localization\nand deeper contextual understanding, leading to improved performance across\ndiverse and challenging scenarios. We evaluate the performance of our model\nusing the FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF, and DeepfakeDetection datasets in both\nintra- and cross-dataset settings to affirm the superiority of our approach.\nOur model achieves strong performance with an AUC of 99.49 percent and an\naccuracy of 97.57 percent in intra-dataset evaluations.

However, the\ndata ecosystems of these three key areas are increasingly fragmented and\nincompatible. Especially, existing testing methods rely on data stacking, fail\nto cover all edge cases, and lack flexibility. To address this issue, this\npaper introduces the concept of \"Query as Test\" (QaT). This concept shifts the\nfocus from rigid, prescripted test cases to flexible, on-demand logical queries\nagainst a unified data representation. Specifically, we identify the need for a\nfundamental improvement in data storage and representation, leading to our\nproposal of \"Extensible Scenarios Notations\" (ESN). ESN is a novel declarative\ndata framework based on Answer Set Programming (ASP), which uniformly\nrepresents heterogeneous multimodal data from the cockpit, vehicle, and road as\na collection of logical facts and rules. This approach not only achieves deep\nsemantic fusion of data, but also brings three core advantages: (1) supports\ncomplex and flexible semantic querying through logical reasoning; (2) provides\nnatural interpretability for decision-making processes; (3) allows for\non-demand data abstraction through logical rules, enabling fine-grained privacy\nprotection. We further elaborate on the QaT paradigm, transforming the\nfunctional validation and safety compliance checks of autonomous driving\nsystems into logical queries against the ESN database, significantly enhancing\nthe expressiveness and formal rigor of the testing.

These\ndiscrepancies hider the effective understanding of RS scenes, which contain\nrich, multi-level semantic information spanning from coarse-to-fine levels.\nHence, it limits the direct adaptation of existing LVLMs to RS imagery. To\naddress this gap, we propose a novel LVLM framework tailored for RS\nunderstanding, incorporating two core components: Semantic-augmented\nMulti-level Alignment and Semantic-aware Expert Modeling. First, to align\nmulti-level visual features, we introduce the retrieval-based Semantic\nAugmentation Module which enriches the visual features with relevant semantics\nacross fine-to-coarse levels (e.g., object- and scene-level information). It is\ndesigned to retrieve relevant semantic cues from a RS semantic knowledge\ndatabase, followed by aggregation of semantic cues with user query and\nmulti-level visual features, resulting in semantically enriched representation\nacross multiple levels. Second, for Semantic-aware Expert Modeling, we design\nsemantic experts, where each expert is responsible for processing semantic\nrepresentation at different levels separately.

Inspired by the observation\nthat certain CoT patterns -- e.g., ``Wait, did I miss anything?'' --\nconsistently emerge across tasks, we explore whether LRMs exhibit human-like\ncognitive habits. Building on Habits of Mind, a well-established framework of\ncognitive habits associated with successful human problem-solving, we introduce\nCogTest, a principled benchmark designed to evaluate LRMs' cognitive habits.\nCogTest includes 16 cognitive habits, each instantiated with 25 diverse tasks,\nand employs an evidence-first extraction method to ensure reliable habit\nidentification. With CogTest, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 16\nwidely used LLMs (13 LRMs and 3 non-reasoning ones). Our findings reveal that\nLRMs, unlike conventional LLMs, not only exhibit human-like habits but also\nadaptively deploy them according to different tasks. Finer-grained analyses\nfurther uncover patterns of similarity and difference in LRMs' cognitive habit\nprofiles, particularly certain inter-family similarity (e.g., Qwen-3 models and\nDeepSeek-R1). Extending the study to safety-related tasks, we observe that\ncertain habits, such as Taking Responsible Risks, are strongly associated with\nthe generation of harmful responses. These findings suggest that studying\npersistent behavioral patterns in LRMs' CoTs is a valuable step toward deeper\nunderstanding of LLM misbehavior.

However, this problem\nremains under-explored in existing research. Inspired by success in the image\ndomain, we propose to exploit advances in 3D vision-language models (3D VLMs)\nfor OOD detection in point cloud objects. However, a major challenge is that\npoint cloud datasets used to pre-train 3D VLMs are drastically smaller in size\nand object diversity than their image-based counterparts. Critically, they\noften contain exclusively computer-designed synthetic objects. This leads to a\nsubstantial domain shift when the model is transferred to practical tasks\ninvolving real objects scanned from the physical environment. In this paper,\nour empirical experiments show that synthetic-to-real domain shift\nsignificantly degrades the alignment of point cloud with their associated text\nembeddings in the 3D VLM latent space, hindering downstream performance. To\naddress this, we propose a novel methodology called SODA which improves the\ndetection of OOD point clouds through a neighborhood-based score propagation\nscheme.

Specifically, we begin by presenting a\nlarge-scale TLS dataset, comprising over 1,000 news topics and more than 3,000\nannotated TLS instances. Furthermore, we propose a progressive optimization\nstrategy, which gradually enhance summarization performance. It employs\ninstruction tuning to enhance summarization and topic-irrelevant information\nfiltering capabilities. Following this, it exploits a novel dual-alignment\nreward learning method that incorporates both semantic and temporal\nperspectives, thereby improving the understanding of topic evolution\nprinciples. Through this progressive optimization strategy, TIM demonstrates a\nrobust ability to summarize open-domain timelines. Extensive experiments in\nopen-domain demonstrate the effectiveness of our TIM."}

Specifically, our method improves GPT-4o visual search accuracy by\n25.00%, increases counting accuracy by 26.83%, reduces edit distance error in\nscene description by 0.32, and enhances performance on spatial relationship\ntasks by 9.50% on a a 2D synthetic dataset. Furthermore, we find that the\nvisual modification is essential for these gains; purely textual strategies,\nincluding Chain-of-Thought prompting, are insufficient and can even degrade\nperformance. Our method enhances binding only with a single-query inference,\nunderscoring the importance of visual input design over purely\nlinguistically-based approaches. These findings suggest that low-level visual\nstructuring is a powerful and underexplored direction for improving\ncompositional visual reasoning and could serve as a general strategy for\nenhancing VLM performance on spatially grounded tasks."}

While common quantum augmentation\nmethods rely on applying quantum models or trainable quanvolutional layers to\nclassical datasets, we focus on the direct application of small-angle Bloch\nrotations and their effect on classical data. Using the large-scale ImageNet\ndataset, we demonstrate that our quantum-inspired augmentation method improves\nimage classification performance, increasing Top-1 accuracy by 3%, Top-5\naccuracy by 2.5%, and the F$_1$ score from 8% to 12% compared to standard\nclassical augmentation methods. Finally, we examine the use of stronger unitary\naugmentations. Although these transformations preserve information in\nprinciple, they result in visually unrecognizable images with potential\napplications for privacy computations. However, we show that our augmentation\napproach and simple SU(2) transformations do not enhance differential privacy\nand discuss the implications of this limitation."}

However, apart from changes in\nfrequency, the exact structure of these linguistic shifts has remained unclear.\nThe present study addresses this and investigates whether these changes involve\nthe replacement of synonyms by suddenly 'spiking words,' for example, \"crucial\"\nreplacing \"essential\" and \"key,\" or whether they reflect broader semantic and\npragmatic qualifications. To further investigate structural changes, we include\npart of speech tagging in our analysis to quantify linguistic shifts over\ngrammatical categories and differentiate between word forms, like \"potential\"\nas a noun vs. as an adjective. We systematically analyze synonym groups for\nwidely discussed 'spiking words' based on frequency trends in scientific\nabstracts from PubMed. We find that entire semantic clusters often shift\ntogether, with most or all words in a group increasing in usage. This pattern\nsuggests that changes induced by Large Language Models are primarily semantic\nand pragmatic rather than purely lexical.

To address these limitations, we propose a Frequency-Semantic\nEnhanced Variational Autoencoder (FS-VAE) to explore the skeleton semantic\nrepresentation learning with frequency decomposition. FS-VAE consists of three\nkey components: 1) a frequency-based enhancement module with high- and\nlow-frequency adjustments to enrich the skeletal semantics learning and improve\nthe robustness of zero-shot action recognition; 2) a semantic-based action\ndescription with multilevel alignment to capture both local details and global\ncorrespondence, effectively bridging the semantic gap and compensating for the\ninherent loss of information in skeleton sequences; 3) a calibrated\ncross-alignment loss that enables valid skeleton-text pairs to counterbalance\nambiguous ones, mitigating discrepancies and ambiguities in skeleton and text\nfeatures, thereby ensuring robust alignment.

In real-world applications, however, users\noften seek tools to faithfully realize their creative editing intentions with\nprecise and consistent control. Despite the progress achieved by existing\nmethods, ensuring fine-grained alignment with user intentions remains an open\nand challenging problem. In this work, we present Shape-for-Motion, a novel\nframework that incorporates a 3D proxy for precise and consistent video\nediting. Shape-for-Motion achieves this by converting the target object in the\ninput video to a time-consistent mesh, i.e., a 3D proxy, allowing edits to be\nperformed directly on the proxy and then inferred back to the video frames. To\nsimplify the editing process, we design a novel Dual-Propagation Strategy that\nallows users to perform edits on the 3D mesh of a single frame, and the edits\nare then automatically propagated to the 3D meshes of the other frames. The 3D\nmeshes for different frames are further projected onto the 2D space to produce\nthe edited geometry and texture renderings, which serve as inputs to a\ndecoupled video diffusion model for generating edited results. Our framework\nsupports various precise and physically-consistent manipulations across the\nvideo frames, including pose editing, rotation, scaling, translation, texture\nmodification, and object composition.

To address the complementary limitations of these methods, we\npropose two hybrid approaches that integrate token- and prompt-level techniques\nto enhance jailbreak effectiveness across diverse PTLMs. GCG + PAIR and the\nnewly explored GCG + WordGame hybrids were evaluated across multiple Vicuna and\nLlama models.

By\nutilizing an encoder-decoder of BART architecture, the model independently\nencodes the x and y coordinates, while Cross-Attention ensures their\ninterrelation is maintained. With only 749,888 parameters, the model achieves\n96.04% accuracy on the LSA-64 dataset, significantly outperforming previous\nmodels with over one million parameters. The model also demonstrates excellent\nperformance and generalization across WLASL and ASL-Citizen datasets. Ablation\nstudies underscore the importance of coordinate projection, normalization, and\nusing multiple skeleton components for boosting model efficacy. This study\noffers a reliable and effective approach for sign language recognition, with\nstrong potential for enhancing accessibility tools for the deaf and hard of\nhearing."}

In addition, a\nvision-augmented variant matches or exceeds GPT-4.1 on the KCSAT STEM\nbenchmark, all of which are achieved with substantially lower training compute\nthan existing models of similar sizes. We also present a pruning and\ndistillation technique that will soon be applied to HyperCLOVA X THINK for an\nopen-source and business-friendly foundation model. Altogether, these\ncapabilities position HyperCLOVA X THINK as a robust foundation for Korean AI\ninnovation and a valuable resource for the global research community."}

However, most evaluations of language models\nrely on static vignettes and multiple-choice questions that fail to reflect the\ncomplexity and nuance of evidence-based medicine in real-world settings. In\nclinical practice, physicians iteratively formulate and revise diagnostic\nhypotheses, adapting each subsequent question and test to what they've just\nlearned, and weigh the evolving evidence before committing to a final\ndiagnosis. To emulate this iterative process, we introduce the Sequential\nDiagnosis Benchmark, which transforms 304 diagnostically challenging New\nEngland Journal of Medicine clinicopathological conference (NEJM-CPC) cases\ninto stepwise diagnostic encounters. A physician or AI begins with a short case\nabstract and must iteratively request additional details from a gatekeeper\nmodel that reveals findings only when explicitly queried. Performance is\nassessed not just by diagnostic accuracy but also by the cost of physician\nvisits and tests performed. We also present the MAI Diagnostic Orchestrator\n(MAI-DxO), a model-agnostic orchestrator that simulates a panel of physicians,\nproposes likely differential diagnoses and strategically selects high-value,\ncost-effective tests. When paired with OpenAI's o3 model, MAI-DxO achieves 80%\ndiagnostic accuracy--four times higher than the 20% average of generalist\nphysicians. MAI-DxO also reduces diagnostic costs by 20% compared to\nphysicians, and 70% compared to off-the-shelf o3. When configured for maximum\naccuracy, MAI-DxO achieves 85.5% accuracy. These performance gains with MAI-DxO\ngeneralize across models from the OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, Grok, DeepSeek, and\nLlama families. We highlight how AI systems, when guided to think iteratively\nand act judiciously, can advance diagnostic precision and cost-effectiveness in\nclinical care."}

Do Vision-Language Models (VLMs) learn to rely on\nscene contexts in a similar way, when generating references to objects? To\naddress this question, we introduce the \\textit{Common Objects Out-of-Context\n(COOCO)} dataset and test to what extent VLMs rely on scene context to refer to\nobjects under different degrees of scene-object congruency, and different\nperturbations. Our findings show that models leverage scene context adaptively,\ndepending on both the semantic relatedness between object and scene and the\nlevel of noise. In particular, models rely more on context under high\ntarget-scene congruence or when objects are degraded. Attention analysis\nreveals that successful object categorisation involves increased focus on the\ntarget in mid-level layers, especially under moderate noise, suggesting that\nVLMs dynamically balance local and contextual information for reference\ngeneration.

To address this, we introduce\nDefeasible Video Entailment (DVidE), a new task that challenges models to think\nlike doubters, constantly updating their reasoning based on evolving evidence.\nIn DVidE, given a video premise and a textual hypothesis, models must determine\nwhether a new update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis (classification\nversion) or generate a coherent update that modifies the entailment\nrelationship (generation version). For solving the classification task, we\npropose the Chain of Counterfactual Thought framework, utilizing counterfactual\nreasoning, ASR-enhanced video content, and rationale refinement to reduce\ninference bias.
