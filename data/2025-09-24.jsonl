The whole framework operates in the coefficient space\nof spherical harmonics, enabling both diffuse and specular materials.

To address these\nlimitations, this paper introduces the Synthesizing Attitudes, Predicting\nActions (SAPA) framework, a hierarchical approach that uses Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to synthesize theory-grounded latent attitudes to predict\nridesourcing choices. SAPA first uses an LLM to generate qualitative traveler\npersonas from raw travel survey data and then trains a propensity-score model\non demographic and behavioral features, enriched by those personas, to produce\nan individual-level score. Next, the LLM assigns quantitative scores to\ntheory-driven latent variables (e.g., time and cost sensitivity), and a final\nclassifier integrates the propensity score, latent-variable scores (with their\ninteraction terms), and observable trip attributes to predict ridesourcing mode\nchoice. Experiments on a large-scale, multi-year travel survey show that SAPA\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, improving ridesourcing\nchoice predictions by up to 75.9% in terms of PR-AUC on a held-out test set.\nThis study provides a powerful tool for accurately predicting ridesourcing mode\nchoices, and provides a methodology that is readily transferable to various\napplications."}

This limitation arises from\ninsufficient alignment with the target model, preventing higher token\nacceptance lengths. To address these challenges and achieve greater speedups,\nwe propose SubSpec, a plug-and-play method to accelerate parameter offloading\nthat is lossless and training-free. SubSpec constructs a highly aligned draft\nmodel by generating low-bit quantized substitute layers from offloaded target\nLLM portions. Additionally, our method shares the remaining GPU-resident layers\nand the KV-Cache, further reducing memory overhead and enhance alignment.\nSubSpec achieves a high average acceptance length, delivering 9.1x speedup for\nQwen2.5 7B on MT-Bench (8GB VRAM limit) and an average of 12.5x speedup for\nQwen2.5 32B on popular generation benchmarks (24GB VRAM limit)."}

We introduce a\nneural representation framework that considers respiratory motion as a smooth,\ncontinuous deformation steered by a 1D surrogate signal, completely replacing\nthe conventional discrete sorting approach. The new method fuses motion\nmodeling with image reconstruction through two synergistic networks: the\nSpatial Anatomy Network (SAN) encodes a continuous 3D anatomical\nrepresentation, while a Temporal Motion Network (TMN), guided by\nTransformer-derived respiratory signals, produces temporally consistent\ndeformation fields. Evaluation using a free-breathing dataset of 19 volunteers\ndemonstrates that our template- and phase-free method accurately captures both\nregular and irregular respiratory patterns, while preserving vessel and\nbronchial continuity with high anatomical fidelity. The proposed method\nsignificantly improves efficiency, reducing the total processing time from\napproximately five hours required by conventional discrete sorting methods to\njust 15 minutes of training.

However, research on how\nto achieve domain adaptation in practical scenarios where source domain data is\ninaccessible namely, source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) remains limited.\nSelf-training has been widely used in SFDA, which requires obtaining as many\nhigh-quality pseudo-labels as possible to train models on target domain data.\nMost existing methods optimize the entire pseudo-label set to obtain more\nsupervisory information. However, as pseudo-label sets often contain\nsubstantial noise, simultaneously optimizing all labels is challenging. This\nlimitation undermines the effectiveness of optimization approaches and thus\nrestricts the performance of self-training. To address this, we propose a novel\npseudo-label optimization framework called Diffusion-Guided Label Enrichment\n(DGLE), which starts from a few easily obtained high-quality pseudo-labels and\npropagates them to a complete set of pseudo-labels while ensuring the quality\nof newly generated labels. Firstly, a pseudo-label fusion method based on\nconfidence filtering and super-resolution enhancement is proposed, which\nutilizes cross-validation of details and contextual information to obtain a\nsmall number of high-quality pseudo-labels as initial seeds. Then, we leverage\nthe diffusion model to propagate incomplete seed pseudo-labels with irregular\ndistributions due to its strong denoising capability for randomly distributed\nnoise and powerful modeling capacity for complex distributions, thereby\ngenerating complete and high-quality pseudo-labels. This method effectively\navoids the difficulty of directly optimizing the complete set of pseudo-labels,\nsignificantly improves the quality of pseudo-labels, and thus enhances the\nmodel's performance in the target domain."}

To address these problems, we propose\nMLF-4DRCNet, a novel two-stage framework for 3D object detection via\nmulti-level fusion of 4D radar and camera images.

HSFP dynamically integrates multi-scale voxel features with 2D\nimage features using deformable attention to capture scene context and adopts\npooling to the fused features.

Food image classification plays a vital role in enabling\nautomated quality control on production lines, supporting food safety\nsupervision, and promoting intelligent agricultural production. However, this\ntask faces challenges due to the large number of parameters and high\ncomputational complexity of Vision Transformer models. To address these issues,\nwe propose a lightweight food image classification algorithm that integrates a\nWindow Multi-Head Attention Mechanism (WMHAM) and a Spatial Attention Mechanism\n(SAM). The WMHAM reduces computational cost by capturing local and global\ncontextual features through efficient window partitioning, while the SAM\nadaptively emphasizes key spatial regions to improve discriminative feature\nrepresentation. Experiments conducted on the Food-101 and Vireo Food-172\ndatasets demonstrate that our model achieves accuracies of 95.24% and 94.33%,\nrespectively, while significantly reducing parameters and FLOPs compared with\nbaseline methods.

To address\nthis challenge, we introduce Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training data\n(RLPT), a new training-time scaling paradigm for optimizing LLMs. In contrast\nto prior approaches that scale training primarily through supervised learning,\nRLPT enables the policy to autonomously explore meaningful trajectories to\nlearn from pre-training data and improve its capability through reinforcement\nlearning (RL). While existing RL strategies such as reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback (RLHF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR)\nrely on human annotation for reward construction, RLPT eliminates this\ndependency by deriving reward signals directly from pre-training data.\nSpecifically, it adopts a next-segment reasoning objective, rewarding the\npolicy for accurately predicting subsequent text segments conditioned on the\npreceding context. This formulation allows RL to be scaled on pre-training\ndata, encouraging the exploration of richer trajectories across broader\ncontexts and thereby fostering more generalizable reasoning skills. Extensive\nexperiments on both general-domain and mathematical reasoning benchmarks across\nmultiple models validate the effectiveness of RLPT. For example, when applied\nto Qwen3-4B-Base, RLPT yields absolute improvements of $3.0$, $5.1$, $8.1$,\n$6.0$, $6.6$, and $5.3$ on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, KOR-Bench, AIME24, and\nAIME25, respectively.

We explore an\nalternative paradigm: treating the LLM as a reward model of KG reasoning paths,\nwhere the model learns to judge whether a candidate path leads to correct\ndiagnosis for a given patient input. This approach is inspired by recent work\nthat leverages reward training to enhance model reasoning abilities, and\ngrounded in computational theory, which suggests that verifying a solution is\noften easier than generating one from scratch. It also parallels physicians'\ndiagnostic assessment, where they judge which sequences of findings and\nintermediate conditions most plausibly support a diagnosis. We first\nsystematically evaluate five task formulation for knowledge path judging and\neight training paradigm. Second, we test whether the path judging abilities\ngeneralize to downstream diagnostic tasks, including diagnosis summarization\nand medical question answering. Experiments with three open source\ninstruct-tuned LLMs reveal both promise and brittleness: while specific reward\noptimization and distillation lead to strong path-judging performance, the\ntransferability to downstream tasks remain weak. Our finding provides the first\nsystematic assessment of \"reward model style\" reasoning over clinical KGs,\noffering insights into how structured, reward-based supervision influences\ndiagnostic reasoning in GenAI systems for healthcare."}

While recent advances have achieved remarkable\nprogress, most existing models are constrained to either single-domain or\ncross-domain scenarios, limiting their real-world applicability. Single-domain\nmodels tend to overfit to domain-specific features, whereas cross-domain models\noften rely on diverse normalization strategies that may inadvertently suppress\nidentity-specific discriminative cues. To address these limitations, we propose\nan Attribute Prompt Composition (APC) framework, which exploits textual\nsemantics to jointly enhance discrimination and generalization. Specifically,\nwe design an Attribute Prompt Generator (APG) consisting of a Semantic\nAttribute Dictionary (SAD) and a Prompt Composition Module (PCM). SAD is an\nover-complete attribute dictionary to provide rich semantic descriptions, while\nPCM adaptively composes relevant attributes from SAD to generate discriminative\nattribute-aware features. In addition, motivated by the strong generalization\nability of Vision-Language Models (VLM), we propose a Fast-Slow Training\nStrategy (FSTS) to balance ReID-specific discrimination and generalizable\nrepresentation learning. Specifically, FSTS adopts a Fast Update Stream (FUS)\nto rapidly acquire ReID-specific discriminative knowledge and a Slow Update\nStream (SUS) to retain the generalizable knowledge inherited from the\npre-trained VLM. Through a mutual interaction, the framework effectively\nfocuses on ReID-relevant features while mitigating overfitting.

We address this zero-shot setting by\nproposing a single-image anomaly localization method that leverages the\ninductive bias of convolutional neural networks, inspired by Deep Image Prior\n(DIP). Our method is named Single Shot Decomposition Network (SSDnet). Our key\nassumption is that natural images often exhibit unified textures and patterns,\nand that anomalies manifest as localized deviations from these repetitive or\nstochastic patterns. To learn the deep image prior, we design a patch-based\ntraining framework where the input image is fed directly into the network for\nself-reconstruction, rather than mapping random noise to the image as done in\nDIP. To avoid the model simply learning an identity mapping, we apply masking,\npatch shuffling, and small Gaussian noise.

Our approach needs no external training data, labels, or references,\nand remains robust in the presence of noise or missing pixels.

Current self-reflection practices rely on heuristic prompts\nor one-way reasoning: the model is urged to 'think more' instead of learning\nerror diagnosis and repair. This is fragile in multi-turn interactions; after a\nfailure the model often repeats the same mistake. We propose structured\nreflection, which turns the path from error to repair into an explicit,\ncontrollable, and trainable action. The agent produces a short yet precise\nreflection: it diagnoses the failure using evidence from the previous step and\nthen proposes a correct, executable follow-up call. For training we combine\nDAPO and GSPO objectives with a reward scheme tailored to tool use, optimizing\nthe stepwise strategy Reflect, then Call, then Final. To evaluate, we introduce\nTool-Reflection-Bench, a lightweight benchmark that programmatically checks\nstructural validity, executability, parameter correctness, and result\nconsistency. Tasks are built as mini trajectories of erroneous call,\nreflection, and corrected call, with disjoint train and test splits.\nExperiments on BFCL v3 and Tool-Reflection-Bench show large gains in multi-turn\ntool-call success and error recovery, and a reduction of redundant calls.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel\nframework that combines optical flow-based segmentation label interpolation\nwith multi-task learning. optical flow estimated from annotated key frames is\nused to propagate labels to adjacent unlabeled frames, thereby enriching sparse\nspatial supervision and balancing temporal and spatial information for\ntraining. This integration improves both the accuracy and efficiency of\nsurgical scene understanding and, in turn, enhances the utility of RAS."}

This is fragile in multi-turn interactions; after a\nfailure the model often repeats the same mistake. We propose structured\nreflection, which turns the path from error to repair into an explicit,\ncontrollable, and trainable action.

For training we combine\nDAPO and GSPO objectives with a reward scheme tailored to tool use, optimizing\nthe stepwise strategy Reflect, then Call, then Final. To evaluate, we introduce\nTool-Reflection-Bench, a lightweight benchmark that programmatically checks\nstructural validity, executability, parameter correctness, and result\nconsistency.

These images are widely adopted because their additional\nspectral bands correlate strongly with physical materials on the ground, such\nas ice, water, and vegetation. This allows for more accurate identification,\nand their public availability from missions, such as Sentinel-2 and Landsat,\nonly adds to their value. Currently, the automatic analysis of such data is\npredominantly managed through machine learning models specifically trained for\nmulti-spectral input, which are costly to train and support. Furthermore,\nalthough providing a lot of utility for Remote Sensing, such additional inputs\ncannot be used with powerful generalist large multimodal models, which are\ncapable of solving many visual problems, but are not able to understand\nspecialized multi-spectral signals.\n  To address this, we propose a training-free approach which introduces new\nmulti-spectral data in a Zero-Shot-only mode, as inputs to generalist\nmultimodal models, trained on RGB-only inputs. Our approach leverages the\nmultimodal models' understanding of the visual space, and proposes to adapt to\ninputs to that space, and to inject domain-specific information as instructions\ninto the model.

We identify two primary weaknesses\ncontributing to this performance degradation. First, adverse weather introduces\nnoise and reduces visibility, making CNN-based feature extractors struggle with\ndegraded regions like reflective and textureless areas. Second, these degraded\nregions can disrupt accurate pixel correspondences, leading to ineffective\nsupervision based on the photometric consistency assumption. To address these\nchallenges, we propose injecting robust priors derived from the visual\nfoundation model into the CNN-based feature extractor to improve feature\nrepresentation under adverse weather conditions. We then introduce scene\ncorrespondence priors to construct robust supervisory signals rather than\nrelying solely on the photometric consistency assumption. Specifically, we\ncreate synthetic stereo datasets with realistic weather degradations. These\ndatasets feature clear and adverse image pairs that maintain the same semantic\ncontext and disparity, preserving the scene correspondence property. With this\nknowledge, we propose a robust self-supervised training paradigm, consisting of\ntwo key steps: robust self-supervised scene correspondence learning and adverse\nweather distillation. Both steps aim to align underlying scene results from\nclean and adverse image pairs, thus improving model disparity estimation under\nadverse weather effects.

Specifically, we employ a Developmental\nMixture of Experts (MoE) architecture that uses LoRA models as its individual\nexperts. These experts are organized into two groups: a Real-LoRA to learn and\nrefine knowledge of real faces, and multiple Fake-LoRAs to capture incremental\ninformation from different forgery types. To prevent catastrophic forgetting,\nwe ensure that the learning direction of Fake-LoRAs is orthogonal to the\nestablished subspace. Moreover, we integrate orthogonal gradients into the\northogonal loss of Fake-LoRAs, preventing gradient interference throughout the\ntraining process of each task. Experimental results under both the datasets and\nmanipulation types incremental protocols demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nmethod."}

We argue that the\ngeneration of human-like avatar behavior requires human-like perception.\nConsequently, in this work we present CLOPS, the first human avatar that solely\nuses egocentric vision to perceive its surroundings and navigate. Using vision\nas the primary driver of motion however, gives rise to a significant challenge\nfor training avatars: existing datasets have either isolated human motion,\nwithout the context of a scene, or lack scale. We overcome this challenge by\ndecoupling the learning of low-level motion skills from learning of high-level\ncontrol that maps visual input to motion. First, we train a motion prior model\non a large motion capture dataset. Then, a policy is trained using Q-learning\nto map egocentric visual inputs to high-level control commands for the motion\nprior. Our experiments empirically demonstrate that egocentric vision can give\nrise to human-like motion characteristics in our avatars.
