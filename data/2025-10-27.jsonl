Building Rational Agents that Explore and Act Like People", "comment": null, "summary": "Many high-stakes applications of AI require forming data-driven hypotheses\nand making targeted guesses; e.g., in scientific and diagnostic settings. Given\nlimited resources, to what extent do agents based on language models (LMs) act\nrationally? We develop methods to benchmark and enhance agentic\ninformation-seeking, drawing on insights from human behavior. First, we\nintroduce a strategic decision-oriented dialogue task called Collaborative\nBattleship, in which a partially-informed Captain must balance exploration\n(asking questions) and action (taking shots), while a fully-informed Spotter\nmust provide accurate answers under an information bottleneck. Compared to\nhuman players (N=42), we find that LM agents struggle to ground answers in\ncontext, generate informative questions, and select high-value actions. Next,\nto address these gaps, we develop novel Monte Carlo inference strategies for\nLMs based on principles from Bayesian Experimental Design (BED). For Spotter\nagents, our approach boosts accuracy by up to 14.7% absolute over LM-only\nbaselines; for Captain agents, it raises expected information gain (EIG) by up\nto 0.227 bits (94.2% of the achievable noise ceiling). Combined, these\ncomponents yield sharper targeting (+0.303-0.374 F1), and enable weaker LMs,\nsuch as Llama-4-Scout, to outperform both humans (8% -> 82% win rate) and\nfrontier models (0% -> 67% win rate vs. GPT-5) at ~1% of GPT-5's cost. We\nreplicate these findings on Guess Who? where our methods significantly boost\naccuracy (+28.3-42.4 p.p.), demonstrating their general applicability for\nbuilding rational information-seeking agents."}

However, SFT,\nbeing an off-policy approach similar to behavior cloning, often struggles with\noverfitting and poor out-of-domain generalization, especially in limited-data\nscenarios. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Rewarding PPO, a novel\nfine-tuning method that leverages on-policy techniques to enhance\ngeneralization performance. Our approach combines the strengths of SFT and\nproximal policy optimization (PPO) to achieve more effective alignment from\ndemonstration data. At its core is a reward function designed as the log policy\nratio between the SFT model and the pretrained base model. This function serves\nas an implicit reward signal, using the pretrained policy as a baseline and the\nSFT policy as a target. By doing so, it enables on-policy fine-tuning without\nrelying on human preference annotations. The integration of this self-rewarding\nmechanism with PPO addresses key limitations of SFT, improving generalization,\ndata efficiency, and robustness. Our empirical evaluation across a range of\nnatural language processing tasks demonstrates that Self-Rewarding PPO\nconsistently outperforms traditional SFT methods.

The integration of this self-rewarding\nmechanism with PPO addresses key limitations of SFT, improving generalization,\ndata efficiency, and robustness. Our empirical evaluation across a range of\nnatural language processing tasks demonstrates that Self-Rewarding PPO\nconsistently outperforms traditional SFT methods.

While prior\nresearch has explored LLM faithfulness, existing benchmarks suffer from\nannotation ambiguity, primarily due to the ill-defined boundary of permissible\nexternal knowledge in generated outputs. For instance, common sense is often\nincorporated into responses and labeled as \"faithful\", yet the acceptable\nextent of such knowledge remains unspecified, leading to inconsistent\nannotations. To address this issue, we propose a novel faithfulness annotation\nframework, which introduces an intermediate category, Out-Dependent, to\nclassify cases where external knowledge is required for verification. Using\nthis framework, we construct VeriGray (Verification with the Gray Zone) -- a\nnew unfaithfulness detection benchmark in summarization. Statistics reveal that\neven SOTA LLMs, such as GPT-5, exhibit hallucinations ($\\sim 6\\%$ of sentences)\nin summarization tasks. Moreover, a substantial proportion ($\\sim 8\\%$ on\naverage of models) of generated sentences fall into the Out-Dependent category,\nunderscoring the importance of resolving annotation ambiguity in unfaithfulness\ndetection benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that our benchmark poses\nsignificant challenges to multiple baseline methods, indicating considerable\nroom for future improvement."}

Block-sparse attention\nhas emerged as a promising solution that partitions sequences into blocks and\nskips computation for a subset of these blocks.
