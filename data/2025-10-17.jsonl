Drawing from classic\nlocal-global approaches in mesh processing, we introduce PoissonNet, a novel\nneural architecture that overcomes all of these deficiencies by formulating a\nlocal-global learning scheme, which uses Poisson's equation as the primary\nmechanism for feature propagation. Our core network block is simple; we apply\nlearned local feature transformations in the gradient domain of the mesh, then\nsolve a Poisson system to propagate scalar feature updates across the surface\nglobally. Our local-global learning framework preserves the features's full\nfrequency spectrum and provides a truly global receptive field, while remaining\nagnostic to mesh triangulation. Our construction is efficient, requiring far\nless compute overhead than comparable methods, which enables scalability --\nboth in the size of our datasets, and the size of individual training samples.\nThese qualities are validated on various experiments where, compared to\nprevious intrinsic architectures, we attain state-of-the-art performance on\nsemantic segmentation and parameterizing highly-detailed animated surfaces.\nFinally, as a central application of PoissonNet, we show its ability to learn\ndeformations, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art architectures that\nlearn on surfaces."}

While recent advances in\ndynamic token-level computation allocation attempt to improve efficiency by\nselectively activating model components per token, existing methods rely on\ngreedy routing--a myopic execute-or-skip mechanism that often leads to\nirreversible information loss and suboptimal token selection. This paper\nintroduces informed routing, a new paradigm that proactively addresses these\nissues. The key insight is to assess not only a token's immediate importance\nbut also its recoverability, i.e., how well its transformation can be\napproximated. To this end, we propose the Lightweight Feature Forecaster (LFF),\na small predictive module that estimates a unit's output before routing\ndecisions are made. This enables a flexible execute-or-approximate policy that\npreserves model fidelity while drastically reducing computation.

Through controlled\nexperiments in a search-agent setting, we identify two key determinants of\nscalable agent training: the source of reward signals and the scale of agent\ntask data. We find that rewards from a Generative Reward Model (GRM) outperform\nrigid rule-based signals for open-domain learning, and that co-evolving the GRM\nwith the policy further boosts performance. Increasing the volume of agent task\ndata-even when synthetically generated-substantially enhances agentic\ncapabilities. Building on these insights, we propose \\textbf{Agentic\nSelf-Learning} (ASL), a fully closed-loop, multi-role reinforcement learning\nframework that unifies task generation, policy execution, and evaluation within\na shared tool environment and LLM backbone. ASL coordinates a Prompt Generator,\na Policy Model, and a Generative Reward Model to form a virtuous cycle of\nharder task setting, sharper verification, and stronger solving. Empirically,\nASL delivers steady, round-over-round gains, surpasses strong RLVR baselines\n(e.g., Search-R1) that plateau or degrade, and continues improving under\nzero-labeled-data conditions, indicating superior sample efficiency and\nrobustness. We further show that GRM verification capacity is the main\nbottleneck: if frozen, it induces reward hacking and stalls progress; continual\nGRM training on the evolving data distribution mitigates this, and a small\nlate-stage injection of real verification data raises the performance ceiling.\nThis work establishes reward source and data scale as critical levers for\nopen-domain agent learning and demonstrates the efficacy of multi-role\nco-evolution for scalable, self-improving agents.

Since the MLLM\ntypically consists of an LLM and a vision block, we wonder: Can MLLMs directly\nabsorb math reasoning abilities from off-the-shelf math LLMs without tuning?\nRecent model-merging approaches may offer insights into this question. However,\nthey overlook the alignment between the MLLM and LLM, where we find that there\nis a large gap between their parameter spaces, resulting in lower performance.\nOur empirical evidence reveals two key factors behind this issue: the\nidentification of crucial reasoning-associated layers in the model and the\nmitigation of the gaps in parameter space.

The core idea behind NeSy AI is to combine neural\nand symbolic steps: neural networks are typically responsible for mapping\nlow-level inputs into high-level symbolic concepts, while symbolic reasoning\ninfers predictions compatible with the extracted concepts and the prior\nknowledge. Despite their promise, it was recently shown that - whenever the\nconcepts are not supervised directly - NeSy models can be affected by Reasoning\nShortcuts (RSs). That is, they can achieve high label accuracy by grounding the\nconcepts incorrectly. RSs can compromise the interpretability of the model's\nexplanations, performance in out-of-distribution scenarios, and therefore\nreliability. At the same time, RSs are difficult to detect and prevent unless\nconcept supervision is available, which is typically not the case. However, the\nliterature on RSs is scattered, making it difficult for researchers and\npractitioners to understand and tackle this challenging problem. This overview\naddresses this issue by providing a gentle introduction to RSs, discussing\ntheir causes and consequences in intuitive terms. It also reviews and\nelucidates existing theoretical characterizations of this phenomenon. Finally,\nit details methods for dealing with RSs, including mitigation and awareness\nstrategies, and maps their benefits and limitations. By reformulating advanced\nmaterial in a digestible form, this overview aims to provide a unifying\nperspective on RSs to lower the bar to entry for tackling them. Ultimately, we\nhope this overview contributes to the development of reliable NeSy and\ntrustworthy AI models."}

To address this, we introduce the Rose-Frame, a\nthree-dimensional framework for diagnosing cognitive and epistemic drift in\nhuman-AI interaction. The three axes are: (i) Map vs. Territory, which\ndistinguishes representations of reality (epistemology) from reality itself\n(ontology); (ii) Intuition vs. Reason, drawing on dual-process theory to\nseparate fast, emotional judgments from slow, reflective thinking; and (iii)\nConflict vs. Confirmation, which examines whether ideas are critically tested\nthrough disagreement or simply reinforced through mutual validation. Each\ndimension captures a distinct failure mode, and their combination amplifies\nmisalignment.

Existing methods alleviate this issue either by altering the\ndenoising dynamics or by drawing multiple noises and conducting post-selection.\nIn this paper, we attribute the misalignment to a training-inference mismatch:\nduring training, prompt-conditioned noises lie in a prompt-specific subset of\nthe latent space, whereas at inference the noise is drawn from a\nprompt-agnostic Gaussian prior. To close this gap, we propose a noise projector\nthat applies text-conditioned refinement to the initial noise before denoising.\nConditioned on the prompt embedding, it maps the noise to a prompt-aware\ncounterpart that better matches the distribution observed during SD training,\nwithout modifying the SD model. Our framework consists of these steps: we first\nsample some noises and obtain token-level feedback for their corresponding\nimages from a vision-language model (VLM), then distill these signals into a\nreward model, and finally optimize the noise projector via a quasi-direct\npreference optimization.

The importance of these roles raise questions about how and what\nresponses LLMs make in difficult political and moral domains, especially\nquestions about possible biases. To quantify the nature of potential biases in\nLLMs, various works have applied Moral Foundations Theory (MFT), a framework\nthat categorizes human moral reasoning into five dimensions: Harm, Fairness,\nIngroup Loyalty, Authority, and Purity. Previous research has used the MFT to\nmeasure differences in human participants along political, national, and\ncultural lines. While there has been some analysis of the responses of LLM with\nrespect to political stance in role-playing scenarios, no work so far has\ndirectly assessed the moral leanings in the LLM responses, nor have they\nconnected LLM outputs with robust human data. In this paper we analyze the\ndistinctions between LLM MFT responses and existing human research directly,\ninvestigating whether commonly available LLM responses demonstrate ideological\nleanings: either through their inherent responses, straightforward\nrepresentations of political ideologies, or when responding from the\nperspectives of constructed human personas. We assess whether LLMs inherently\ngenerate responses that align more closely with one political ideology over\nanother, and additionally examine how accurately LLMs can represent ideological\nperspectives through both explicit prompting and demographic-based\nrole-playing. By systematically analyzing LLM behavior across these conditions\nand experiments, our study provides insight into the extent of political and\ndemographic dependency in AI-generated responses."}

This overlooks a subjective dimension: lying also requires the\nbelief that the claim defended is false. In this work, we apply debate to\nsubjective questions and explicitly measure large language models' prior\nbeliefs before experiments. Debaters were asked to select their preferred\nposition, then presented with a judge persona deliberately designed to conflict\nwith their identified priors. This setup tested whether models would adopt\nsycophantic strategies, aligning with the judge's presumed perspective to\nmaximize persuasiveness, or remain faithful to their prior beliefs. We\nimplemented and compared two debate protocols, sequential and simultaneous, to\nevaluate potential systematic biases. Finally, we assessed whether models were\nmore persuasive and produced higher-quality arguments when defending positions\nconsistent with their prior beliefs versus when arguing against them.

An AI agent guided by a large language\nmodel performs reasoning over the indexed traffic artifacts, assembling\nevidence to produce accurate and human-readable interpretations. Experimental\nevaluation on multiple IoT captures and six open models shows that hybrid\nretrieval, which combines lexical and semantic search with reranking,\nsubstantially improves BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, and BERTScore results compared with\ndense-only retrieval.

In this\npaper, we investigate the extent to which LLMs engage in deception within\ndialogue, and propose the belief misalignment metric to quantify deception. We\nevaluate deception across four distinct dialogue scenarios, using five\nestablished deception detection metrics and our proposed metric. Our findings\nreveal this novel deception measure correlates more closely with human\njudgments than any existing metrics we test. Additionally, our benchmarking of\neight state-of-the-art models indicates that LLMs naturally exhibit deceptive\nbehavior in approximately 26% of dialogue turns, even when prompted with\nseemingly benign objectives.

(-)\nHow to make research in native VLMs more accessible and democratized, thereby\naccelerating progress in the field. In this paper, we clarify these challenges\nand outline guiding principles for constructing native VLMs. Specifically, one\nnative VLM primitive should: (i) effectively align pixel and word\nrepresentations within a shared semantic space; (ii) seamlessly integrate the\nstrengths of formerly separate vision and language modules; (iii) inherently\nembody various cross-modal properties that support unified vision-language\nencoding, aligning, and reasoning. Hence, we launch NEO, a novel family of\nnative VLMs built from first principles, capable of rivaling top-tier modular\ncounterparts across diverse real-world scenarios. With only 390M image-text\nexamples, NEO efficiently develops visual perception from scratch while\nmitigating vision-language conflicts inside a dense and monolithic model\ncrafted from our elaborate primitives.

Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted\nmisinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content\nproduced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although\nboth share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP\nresearch focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community\ntargets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often\nspecialized for only one type of fake content. In real-world scenarios,\nhowever, the type of a multimodal post is usually unknown, limiting the\neffectiveness of such specialized systems. To bridge this gap, we construct the\nOmnibus Dataset for Multimodal News Deception (OmniFake), a comprehensive\nbenchmark of 127K samples that integrates human-curated misinformation from\nexisting resources with newly synthesized AI-generated examples. Based on this\ndataset, we propose Unified Multimodal Fake Content Detection (UMFDet), a\nframework designed to handle both forms of deception.

In this\npaper, we investigate the extent to which LLMs engage in deception within\ndialogue, and propose the belief misalignment metric to quantify deception. We\nevaluate deception across four distinct dialogue scenarios, using five\nestablished deception detection metrics and our proposed metric. Our findings\nreveal this novel deception measure correlates more closely with human\njudgments than any existing metrics we test. Additionally, our benchmarking of\neight state-of-the-art models indicates that LLMs naturally exhibit deceptive\nbehavior in approximately 26% of dialogue turns, even when prompted with\nseemingly benign objectives. When prompted to deceive, LLMs are capable of\nincreasing deceptiveness by as much as 31% relative to baselines. Unexpectedly,\nmodels trained with RLHF, the predominant approach for ensuring the safety of\nwidely-deployed LLMs, still exhibit deception at a rate of 43% on average.\nGiven that deception in dialogue is a behavior that develops over an\ninteraction history, its effective evaluation and mitigation necessitates\nmoving beyond single-utterance analyses.

In this paper, we propose Information Gain-based Policy\nOptimization (IGPO), a simple yet effective RL framework that provides dense\nand intrinsic supervision for multi-turn agent training.

Specifically, we propose a novel\npoint-to-Gaussian variational autoencoder (P2G-VAE) that encodes 3D inputs into\na latent point representation, which is subsequently decoded as 3D Gaussian\nprimitives to jointly model geometry and appearance. We then introduce a sparse\npoint flow matching network (SPFlow) for generating the latent point\nrepresentation, which simultaneously denoises the positions and features of the\npoint latents. Our Terra enables exact multi-view consistency with native 3D\nrepresentation and architecture, and supports flexible rendering from any\nviewpoint with only a single generation process. Furthermore, Terra achieves\nexplorable world modeling through progressive generation in the point latent\nspace. We conduct extensive experiments on the challenging indoor scenes from\nScanNet v2. Terra achieves state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction\nand generation with high 3D consistency."}

We formalize this intuition via a composite instability\nindex (H-Risk) combining spectral margin, conditioning, temporal sensitivity,\nand innovation amplification. In linear-Gaussian simulations, higher H-Risk\npredicts overconfident errors even under formal stability, revealing a gap\nbetween nominal and epistemic stability. Extending to large language models\n(LLMs), we find that fragile internal dynamics correlate with miscalibration\nand hallucination, while critique-style prompts show mixed effects on\ncalibration and hallucination. These results suggest a structural bridge\nbetween Kantian self-limitation and feedback control, offering a principled\nlens for diagnosing -- and selectively reducing -- overconfidence in reasoning\nsystems.

Yet, two lingering clouds cast shadows over its widespread\nexploration and promotion: (-) What fundamental constraints set native VLMs\napart from modular ones, and to what extent can these barriers be overcome? (-)\nHow to make research in native VLMs more accessible and democratized, thereby\naccelerating progress in the field. In this paper, we clarify these challenges\nand outline guiding principles for constructing native VLMs. Specifically, one\nnative VLM primitive should: (i) effectively align pixel and word\nrepresentations within a shared semantic space; (ii) seamlessly integrate the\nstrengths of formerly separate vision and language modules; (iii) inherently\nembody various cross-modal properties that support unified vision-language\nencoding, aligning, and reasoning. Hence, we launch NEO, a novel family of\nnative VLMs built from first principles, capable of rivaling top-tier modular\ncounterparts across diverse real-world scenarios. With only 390M image-text\nexamples, NEO efficiently develops visual perception from scratch while\nmitigating vision-language conflicts inside a dense and monolithic model\ncrafted from our elaborate primitives. We position NEO as a cornerstone for\nscalable and powerful native VLMs, paired with a rich set of reusable\ncomponents that foster a cost-effective and extensible ecosystem.

Existing approaches to Visual Chain-of-Thought (VCoT) are often\nlimited by rigid external tools or fail to generate the high-fidelity,\nstrategically-timed diagrams necessary for complex problem-solving. To bridge\nthis gap, we introduce MathCanvas, a comprehensive framework designed to endow\nunified Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with intrinsic VCoT capabilities for\nmathematics. Our approach consists of two phases. First, a Visual Manipulation\nstage pre-trains the model on a novel 15.2M-pair corpus, comprising 10M\ncaption-to-diagram pairs (MathCanvas-Imagen) and 5.2M step-by-step editing\ntrajectories (MathCanvas-Edit), to master diagram generation and editing.\nSecond, a Strategic Visual-Aided Reasoning stage fine-tunes the model on\nMathCanvas-Instruct, a new 219K-example dataset of interleaved visual-textual\nreasoning paths, teaching it when and how to leverage visual aids. To\nfacilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce MathCanvas-Bench, a challenging\nbenchmark with 3K problems that require models to produce interleaved\nvisual-textual solutions. Our model, BAGEL-Canvas, trained under this\nframework, achieves an 86% relative improvement over strong LMM baselines on\nMathCanvas-Bench, demonstrating excellent generalization to other public math\nbenchmarks.

These\nmodels can independently produce high-quality edits for each image in a set of\nmulti-view images of a 3D scene or object, but they do not maintain consistency\nacross views. Existing approaches typically address this by optimizing over\nexplicit 3D representations, but they suffer from a lengthy optimization\nprocess and instability under sparse view settings. We propose an implicit 3D\nregularization approach by constraining the generated 2D image sequences to\nadhere to a pre-trained multi-view image distribution. This is achieved through\ncoupled diffusion sampling, a simple diffusion sampling technique that\nconcurrently samples two trajectories from both a multi-view image distribution\nand a 2D edited image distribution, using a coupling term to enforce the\nmulti-view consistency among the generated images. We validate the\neffectiveness and generality of this framework on three distinct multi-view\nimage editing tasks, demonstrating its applicability across various model\narchitectures and highlighting its potential as a general solution for\nmulti-view consistent editing."}

To\nsupport this investigation, we introduce BesiegeField, a testbed built on the\nmachine-building game Besiege, which enables part-based construction, physical\nsimulation and reward-driven evaluation.
