TL;DR: 海底三维物体检测面临训练数据稀缺挑战，本文提出两种无需真实数据训练的检测方法：基于合成数据的神经网络和模板匹配方法。模板匹配在真实数据上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海底三维检测面临真实声纳数据获取困难、成本高、标注复杂的挑战，传统深度学习方法需要大量训练数据。研究者想探索是否能够在不依赖真实训练数据的情况下实现可靠的海底物体检测。

Method: 采用双重方法：1）基于物理模型的声纳模拟管道，生成合成训练数据用于最新神经网络训练；2）基于几何先验知识的模型基于模板匹配系统，不需要训练。在波罗的海海实际测深数据上进行评估。

Result: 神经网络在合成数据上达到98% mAP，但在真实声纳数据上下降到40% mAP（域偏移问题）。模板匹配方法在真实数据上保持83% mAP，显示出对声学噪声和环境变化的稳健性。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了海洋领域深度学习需要大量数据的传统观念，证明了无需训练的模板匹配方法在数据稀缺环境中的优势。为自主潜艇导航、海洋考古和海上基础设施监测开启了新可能性。

Abstract: Underwater 3D object detection remains one of the most challenging frontiers
in computer vision, where traditional approaches struggle with the harsh
acoustic environment and scarcity of training data. While deep learning has
revolutionized terrestrial 3D detection, its application underwater faces a
critical bottleneck: obtaining sufficient annotated sonar data is prohibitively
expensive and logistically complex, often requiring specialized vessels, expert
surveyors, and favorable weather conditions. This work addresses a fundamental
question: Can we achieve reliable underwater 3D object detection without
real-world training data? We tackle this challenge by developing and comparing
two paradigms for training-free detection of artificial structures in multibeam
echo-sounder point clouds. Our dual approach combines a physics-based sonar
simulation pipeline that generates synthetic training data for state-of-the-art
neural networks, with a robust model-based template matching system that
leverages geometric priors of target objects. Evaluation on real bathymetry
surveys from the Baltic Sea reveals surprising insights: while neural networks
trained on synthetic data achieve 98% mean Average Precision (mAP) on simulated
scenes, they drop to 40% mAP on real sonar data due to domain shift.
Conversely, our template matching approach maintains 83% mAP on real data
without requiring any training, demonstrating remarkable robustness to acoustic
noise and environmental variations. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom
about data-hungry deep learning in underwater domains and establish the first
large-scale benchmark for training-free underwater 3D detection. This work
opens new possibilities for autonomous underwater vehicle navigation, marine
archaeology, and offshore infrastructure monitoring in data-scarce environments
where traditional machine learning approaches fail.

*Shudipta Banik,Muna Das,Trapa Banik,Md. Ehsanul Haque*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MobileDenseAttn融合模型，结合MobileNetV2和DenseNet201双流水线，通过特征融合和GradCAM可解释性，在脑部软界识别任务中实现了98.35%测试准确度，超过基准模型准确度提升3.67%且训练时间减少39.3%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有脑部软检测方法存在几大问题：异质性软的泛化能力有限、计算效率低、可解释性差、缺乏透明性影响信任度，所以需要开发一种高效、高性能、可解释的新模型

Method: 设计MobileDenseAttn融合模型，结合MobileNetV2和DenseNet201双流水线进行特征层面融合。使用扩充的MRI扫描数据集（6,020张图像，包括粒细胞瘤、脑膜瘤、脯体瘤和正常样本）进行训练，采用5折交叉验证协议，并通过GradCAM提供可解释的视觉化分析

Result: 模型在严格的5折交叉验证下达到了99.75%的训练准确度和98.35%的测试准确度，F1分数为0.9835（95% CI: 0.9743-0.9920）。与基准模型（VGG19、DenseNet201、MobileNetV2）相比，准确度提升了3.67%，训练时间减少39.3%。GradCAM热力图清晰显示了软受影响区域，提供了临床意义上的定位信息

Conclusion: MobileDenseAttn是一种高效、高性能、可解释的模型，在脑部软检测任务中表现突出。其稳定的性能、显著的准确度提升和训练效率改善，加上可解释的软定位能力，使得该模型有高概率成为临床实践中的实用工具

Abstract: The detection of brain tumor in MRI is an important aspect of ensuring timely
diagnostics and treatment; however, manual analysis is commonly long and
error-prone. Current approaches are not universal because they have limited
generalization to heterogeneous tumors, are computationally inefficient, are
not interpretable, and lack transparency, thus limiting trustworthiness. To
overcome these issues, we introduce MobileDenseAttn, a fusion model of dual
streams of MobileNetV2 and DenseNet201 that can help gradually improve the
feature representation scale, computing efficiency, and visual explanations via
GradCAM. Our model uses feature level fusion and is trained on an augmented
dataset of 6,020 MRI scans representing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors,
and normal samples. Measured under strict 5-fold cross-validation protocols,
MobileDenseAttn provides a training accuracy of 99.75%, a testing accuracy of
98.35%, and a stable F1 score of 0.9835 (95% CI: 0.9743 to 0.9920). The
extensive validation shows the stability of the model, and the comparative
analysis proves that it is a great advancement over the baseline models (VGG19,
DenseNet201, MobileNetV2) with a +3.67% accuracy increase and a 39.3% decrease
in training time compared to VGG19. The GradCAM heatmaps clearly show
tumor-affected areas, offering clinically significant localization and
improving interpretability. These findings position MobileDenseAttn as an
efficient, high performance, interpretable model with a high probability of
becoming a clinically practical tool in identifying brain tumors in the real
world.

*Julian Ost,Andrea Ramazzina,Amogh Joshi,Maximilian Bömer,Mario Bijelic,Felix Heide*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过结合代理几何与2D图像先验矩阵的分数蓄粉技术，直接生成具有准确几何和因果性的大规模3D驾驶场景，充分支持控制性和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经重建方法受限于静态环境和抓取数据的约束，而影像/视频涵泰模型又缺乏几何基础和因果性。需要找到方法给合两者优势，生成高质量的可控驾驶场景数据。

Method: 给合代理几何生成与环境表征，通过学习到的2D图像先验矩阵进行分数蓄粉，支持提示引导的几何生成和高保真纹理结构，可以基于地图布局进行条件化生成。

Result: 能够生成现实而几何一致的复杂驾驶场景3D模型，支持因果性新视角合成与对象持久性，并能显式估计3D几何。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了现有方法在场景控制、几何基础和因果性方面的不足，为机器人学习提供了高质量的可控大规模3D驾驶场景数据生成方案。

Abstract: Large-scale scene data is essential for training and testing in robot
learning. Neural reconstruction methods have promised the capability of
reconstructing large physically-grounded outdoor scenes from captured sensor
data. However, these methods have baked-in static environments and only allow
for limited scene control -- they are functionally constrained in scene and
trajectory diversity by the captures from which they are reconstructed. In
contrast, generating driving data with recent image or video diffusion models
offers control, however, at the cost of geometry grounding and causality. In
this work, we aim to bridge this gap and present a method that directly
generates large-scale 3D driving scenes with accurate geometry, allowing for
causal novel view synthesis with object permanence and explicit 3D geometry
estimation. The proposed method combines the generation of a proxy geometry and
environment representation with score distillation from learned 2D image
priors. We find that this approach allows for high controllability, enabling
the prompt-guided geometry and high-fidelity texture and structure that can be
conditioned on map layouts -- producing realistic and geometrically consistent
3D generations of complex driving scenes.

### [4] [Can VLMs Recall Factual Associations From Visual References?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18297)
*Dhananjay Ashok,Ashutosh Chaubey,Hirona J. Arai,Jonathan May,Jesse Thomason*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现视觉语言模型在视觉实体引用时存在系统性缺陷，相比文本引用，视觉引用的事实回忆能力显著下降，模型难以将内部知识与图像表示联系起来。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别视觉语言模型在多模态基础方面的系统性缺陷，特别是当实体引用从文本变为视觉时模型性能下降的问题。

Method: 通过控制研究分析VLMs的表现差异，利用模型内部状态模式构建探针来检测不可靠响应，并在视觉问答任务中进行选择性预测验证。

Result: 视觉引用使事实回忆能力减半，内部状态探针检测不可靠响应的准确率超过92%，在视觉问答任务中覆盖度提升7.87%同时错误风险降低0.9%。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型存在可检测的系统性缺陷，内部状态探针能有效识别模型失败情况，这为多模态基础研究提供了重要方向和改进建议。

Abstract: Through a controlled study, we identify a systematic deficiency in the
multimodal grounding of Vision Language Models (VLMs). While VLMs can recall
factual associations when provided a textual reference to an entity; their
ability to do so is significantly diminished when the reference is visual
instead. Forcing VLMs to rely on image representations of an entity halves
their ability to recall factual knowledge, suggesting that VLMs struggle to
link their internal knowledge of an entity with its image representation. We
show that such linking failures are correlated with the expression of distinct
patterns in model internal states, and that probes on these internal states
achieve over 92% accuracy at flagging cases where the VLM response is
unreliable. These probes can be applied, without retraining, to identify when a
VLM will fail to correctly answer a question that requires an understanding of
multimodal input. When used to facilitate selective prediction on a visual
question answering task, the probes increase coverage by 7.87% (absolute) while
also reducing the risk of error by 0.9% (absolute). Addressing the systematic,
detectable deficiency is an important avenue in language grounding, and we
provide informed recommendations for future directions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 一种语义感知神经重建方法，通过添加片段语义逻辑值和几何原始控制，从稀疏图像生成高保真度3D模型，显著降低重建误差


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决稀疏图像输入中特征不匹配导致的严重光照歧义问题

Method: 在神经隐式表示中添加片段语义逻辑值，与签名距离场和光照场优化，并使用几何原始控制正则化来减少形状歧义

Result: 在DTU数据集上，相比SparseNeuS和VolRecon分别降低44%和20%的平均Chamfer距离，作为NeuS和Neuralangelo的插件时误差分别降低69%和68%

Conclusion: 该方法通过语义信息增强和几何约束，有效解决了稀疏视角下的3D重建问题，显著提升了重建质量

Abstract: We propose a semantic-aware neural reconstruction method to generate 3D
high-fidelity models from sparse images. To tackle the challenge of severe
radiance ambiguity caused by mismatched features in sparse input, we enrich
neural implicit representations by adding patch-based semantic logits that are
optimized together with the signed distance field and the radiance field. A
novel regularization based on the geometric primitive masks is introduced to
mitigate shape ambiguity. The performance of our approach has been verified in
experimental evaluation. The average chamfer distances of our reconstruction on
the DTU dataset can be reduced by 44% for SparseNeuS and 20% for VolRecon. When
working as a plugin for those dense reconstruction baselines such as NeuS and
Neuralangelo, the average error on the DTU dataset can be reduced by 69% and
68% respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用轻量级深度学习模型和集成方法在AerialWaste数据集上实现非法垃圾填埋场检测，达到92.33%的准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非法垃圾填埋场对全球构成严重威胁，手动识别困难且耗时，需要自动化检测方法来节省时间和资源

Method: 采用Mobilenetv2、Googlenet、Densenet、MobileVit等轻量级深度学习模型，避免过拟合，并使用集成融合技术

Result: 集成模型在二分类任务上取得92.33%准确率、92.67%精确率、92.33%灵敏度、92.41% F1分数和92.71%特异性

Conclusion: 轻量级模型结合集成技术能有效检测非法垃圾填埋场，避免复杂模型过拟合问题，在AerialWaste数据集上表现优异

Abstract: Illegal landfills are posing as a hazardous threat to people all over the
world. Due to the arduous nature of manually identifying the location of
landfill, many landfills go unnoticed by authorities and later cause dangerous
harm to people and environment. Deep learning can play a significant role in
identifying these landfills while saving valuable time, manpower and resources.
Despite being a burning concern, good quality publicly released datasets for
illegal landfill detection are hard to find due to security concerns. However,
AerialWaste Dataset is a large collection of 10434 images of Lombardy region of
Italy. The images are of varying qualities, collected from three different
sources: AGEA Orthophotos, WorldView-3, and Google Earth. The dataset contains
professionally curated, diverse and high-quality images which makes it
particularly suitable for scalable and impactful research. As we trained
several models to compare results, we found complex and heavy models to be
prone to overfitting and memorizing training data instead of learning patterns.
Therefore, we chose lightweight simpler models which could leverage general
features from the dataset. In this study, Mobilenetv2, Googlenet, Densenet,
MobileVit and other lightweight deep learning models were used to train and
validate the dataset as they achieved significant success with less
overfitting. As we saw substantial improvement in the performance using some of
these models, we combined the best performing models and came up with an
ensemble model. With the help of ensemble and fusion technique, binary
classification could be performed on this dataset with 92.33% accuracy, 92.67%
precision, 92.33% sensitivity, 92.41% F1 score and 92.71% specificity.

### [7] [Structures Meet Semantics: Multimodal Fusion via Graph Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18322)
*Jiangfeng Sun,Sihao He,Zhonghong Ou,Meina Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了SSU框架，通过模态特定结构图和跨模态语义锚点，解决了多模态情感分析中的结构依赖性和语义对齐问题，在性能和计算效率上均优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态融合方法忽视了模态特定的结构依赖性和语义错位问题，限制了模型的质量、可解释性和鲁棒性。

Method: SSU框架动态构建模态特定图（文本使用语法结构，声学和视觉使用文本引导的注意力机制），引入基于全局文本语义的语义锚点作为跨模态对齐中心，并采用多视角对比学习目标。

Result: 在CMU-MOSI和CMU-MOSEI数据集上达到最先进性能，同时显著降低计算开销，定性分析验证了模型的可解释性和捕捉细微情感模式的能力。

Conclusion: SSU框架通过系统整合模态特定结构信息和跨模态语义基础，有效提升了多模态情感分析的性能、效率和可解释性。

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to infer emotional states by
effectively integrating textual, acoustic, and visual modalities. Despite
notable progress, existing multimodal fusion methods often neglect
modality-specific structural dependencies and semantic misalignment, limiting
their quality, interpretability, and robustness. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel framework called the Structural-Semantic Unifier (SSU),
which systematically integrates modality-specific structural information and
cross-modal semantic grounding for enhanced multimodal representations.
Specifically, SSU dynamically constructs modality-specific graphs by leveraging
linguistic syntax for text and a lightweight, text-guided attention mechanism
for acoustic and visual modalities, thus capturing detailed intra-modal
relationships and semantic interactions. We further introduce a semantic
anchor, derived from global textual semantics, that serves as a cross-modal
alignment hub, effectively harmonizing heterogeneous semantic spaces across
modalities. Additionally, we develop a multiview contrastive learning objective
that promotes discriminability, semantic consistency, and structural coherence
across intra- and inter-modal views. Extensive evaluations on two widely used
benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, demonstrate that SSU consistently
achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing
computational overhead compared to prior methods. Comprehensive qualitative
analyses further validate SSU's interpretability and its ability to capture
nuanced emotional patterns through semantically grounded interactions.

*Hao Liang,Zhixuan Ge,Ashish Tiwari,Soumendu Majee,G. M. Dilshan Godaliyadda,Ashok Veeraraghavan,Guha Balakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastAvatar是一个基于单张人脸图像的快速3D高斯泼溅生成框架，能够在任意姿态下10毫秒内生成高质量3D模型，支持实时身份插值和属性编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人脸3D重建方法要么速度慢（需要逐脸优化），要么质量差（前馈方法重建质量不佳），无法同时满足实时性和高质量的需求。

Method: 采用编码器-解码器神经网络设计，首先构建3DGS人脸模板模型，然后通过身份特定的姿态不变潜在嵌入预测高斯参数残差，实现快速前馈推理。

Result: 在重建质量上显著优于现有前馈方法（如GAGAvatar），运行速度比逐脸优化方法（如FlashAvatar）快1000倍，支持实时身份插值和属性编辑。

Conclusion: FastAvatar通过创新的潜在空间设计和残差预测机制，成功实现了高质量和快速3D人脸重建的平衡，为消费级和交互式系统的真实感虚拟人应用开辟了新可能。

Abstract: We present FastAvatar, a pose-invariant, feed-forward framework that can
generate a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from a single face image from an
arbitrary pose in near-instant time (<10ms). FastAvatar uses a novel
encoder-decoder neural network design to achieve both fast fitting and identity
preservation regardless of input pose. First, FastAvatar constructs a 3DGS face
``template'' model from a training dataset of faces with multi-view captures.
Second, FastAvatar encodes the input face image into an identity-specific and
pose-invariant latent embedding, and decodes this embedding to predict
residuals to the structural and appearance parameters of each Gaussian in the
template 3DGS model. By only inferring residuals in a feed-forward fashion,
model inference is fast and robust. FastAvatar significantly outperforms
existing feed-forward face 3DGS methods (e.g., GAGAvatar) in reconstruction
quality, and runs 1000x faster than per-face optimization methods (e.g.,
FlashAvatar, GaussianAvatars and GASP). In addition, FastAvatar's novel latent
space design supports real-time identity interpolation and attribute editing
which is not possible with any existing feed-forward 3DGS face generation
framework. FastAvatar's combination of excellent reconstruction quality and
speed expands the scope of 3DGS for photorealistic avatar applications in
consumer and interactive systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在人道主义和紧急情况下，生物识别技术能大大提高操作效率，但同时带来了数据主体的风险，特别是在弱势环境中。需要一种方案来平衡效率和安全性。

Method: 进行了广泛的模板保护方案比较分析，选择PolyProtect方法应用于神经网络面部嵌入。评估了该方法在验证和识别准确性、不可逆性和不可链接性方面的表现，并扩展到指纹识别。

Conclusion: 该研究为人道主义和紧急情况提供了一种可行的生物识别模板保护方案，在保持操作效率的同时大大提高了数据安全性和隐私保护。

Abstract: In humanitarian and emergency scenarios, the use of biometrics can
dramatically improve the efficiency of operations, but it poses risks for the
data subjects, which are exacerbated in contexts of vulnerability. To address
this, we present a mobile biometric system implementing a biometric template
protection (BTP) scheme suitable for these scenarios. After rigorously
formulating the functional, operational, and security and privacy requirements
of these contexts, we perform a broad comparative analysis of the BTP
landscape. PolyProtect, a method designed to operate on neural network face
embeddings, is identified as the most suitable method due to its effectiveness,
modularity, and lightweight computational burden. We evaluate PolyProtect in
terms of verification and identification accuracy, irreversibility, and
unlinkability, when this BTP method is applied to face embeddings extracted
using EdgeFace, a novel state-of-the-art efficient feature extractor, on a
real-world face dataset from a humanitarian field project in Ethiopia.
Moreover, as PolyProtect promises to be modality-independent, we extend its
evaluation to fingerprints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
time that PolyProtect has been evaluated for the identification scenario and
for fingerprint biometrics. Our experimental results are promising, and we plan
to release our code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉基础模型在处理需要显式实体、角色和时空关系推理的任务时存在局限，而关系能力对于细粒度人类活动识别、第一人称视频理解和多模态医学图像分析至关重要。

Method: 提出在基础模型中集成动态关系图接口，使用轻量级、上下文自适应的图推理模块来增强模型的关系推理能力。

Result: 实验表明，在人类操作动作识别和脑肿瘤分割等任务中，增强图推理的混合模型相比纯基础模型在语义保真度、分布外鲁棒性、可解释性和计算效率方面均有提升。

Conclusion: 提出了下一代视觉基础模型应包含显式关系接口的研究方向，并制定了包括动态图构建、多层次关系推理、跨模态融合和关系能力评估在内的研究议程。

Abstract: Vision foundation models (FMs) have become the predominant architecture in
computer vision, providing highly transferable representations learned from
large-scale, multimodal corpora. Nonetheless, they exhibit persistent
limitations on tasks that require explicit reasoning over entities, roles, and
spatio-temporal relations. Such relational competence is indispensable for
fine-grained human activity recognition, egocentric video understanding, and
multimodal medical image analysis, where spatial, temporal, and semantic
dependencies are decisive for performance. We advance the position that
next-generation FMs should incorporate explicit relational interfaces,
instantiated as dynamic relational graphs (graphs whose topology and edge
semantics are inferred from the input and task context). We illustrate this
position with cross-domain evidence from recent systems in human manipulation
action recognition and brain tumor segmentation, showing that augmenting FMs
with lightweight, context-adaptive graph-reasoning modules improves
fine-grained semantic fidelity, out of distribution robustness,
interpretability, and computational efficiency relative to FM only baselines.
Importantly, by reasoning sparsely over semantic nodes, such hybrids also
achieve favorable memory and hardware efficiency, enabling deployment under
practical resource constraints. We conclude with a targeted research agenda for
FM graph hybrids, prioritizing learned dynamic graph construction, multi-level
relational reasoning (e.g., part object scene in activity understanding, or
region organ in medical imaging), cross-modal fusion, and evaluation protocols
that directly probe relational competence in structured vision tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动车牌识别中低质量车牌识别困难的问题，通过选择性图像预处理来优化模型性能和计算效率。

Method: 采用细粒度标注策略，包括车辆和车牌级别的遮挡、四个可读性类别，并使用ViT、ResNet和YOLO三种图像识别网络作为基准模型进行分类任务。

Result: 所有三个基线模型的F1分数都低于80%，表明该任务具有挑战性，需要进一步研究。

Conclusion: 该数据集为车牌可读性分类研究提供了重要资源，强调了在该领域进行更多研究的必要性。

Abstract: Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) faces a major challenge when
dealing with illegible license plates (LPs). While reconstruction methods such
as super-resolution (SR) have emerged, the core issue of recognizing these
low-quality LPs remains unresolved. To optimize model performance and
computational efficiency, image pre-processing should be applied selectively to
cases that require enhanced legibility. To support research in this area, we
introduce a novel dataset comprising 10,210 images of vehicles with 12,687
annotated LPs for legibility classification (the LPLC dataset). The images span
a wide range of vehicle types, lighting conditions, and camera/image quality
levels. We adopt a fine-grained annotation strategy that includes vehicle- and
LP-level occlusions, four legibility categories (perfect, good, poor, and
illegible), and character labels for three categories (excluding illegible
LPs). As a benchmark, we propose a classification task using three image
recognition networks to determine whether an LP image is good enough, requires
super-resolution, or is completely unrecoverable. The overall F1 score, which
remained below 80% for all three baseline models (ViT, ResNet, and YOLO),
together with the analyses of SR and LP recognition methods, highlights the
difficulty of the task and reinforces the need for further research. The
proposed dataset is publicly available at
https://github.com/lmlwojcik/lplc-dataset.

TL;DR: CLARIFY是一个专家-通用框架，通过结合轻量级皮肤病图像分类器和压缩的对话视觉语言模型，在皮肤病视觉问答任务中实现了更高的诊断准确性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决通用视觉语言模型在医疗任务中诊断准确性有限、模型过大导致推理成本高的问题，为临床部署提供轻量级、可信赖的AI系统。

Method: 采用专家-通用框架：1）轻量级领域训练的图像分类器（专家）提供快速准确诊断；2）压缩的对话VLM（通用者）生成自然语言解释；3）知识图谱检索模块确保回答基于皮肤病学事实知识。

Result: 在皮肤病数据集上，CLARIFY比最强基线（微调未压缩单线VLM）诊断准确率提升18%，平均VRAM需求降低至少20%，延迟减少至少5%。

Conclusion: 专家-通用系统为构建轻量级、可信赖且临床可行的AI系统提供了实用而强大的范式。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant potential for medical
tasks; however, their general-purpose nature can limit specialized diagnostic
accuracy, and their large size poses substantial inference costs for real-world
clinical deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce CLARIFY, a
Specialist-Generalist framework for dermatological visual question answering
(VQA). CLARIFY combines two components: (i) a lightweight, domain-trained image
classifier (the Specialist) that provides fast and highly accurate diagnostic
predictions, and (ii) a powerful yet compressed conversational VLM (the
Generalist) that generates natural language explanations to user queries. In
our framework, the Specialist's predictions directly guide the Generalist's
reasoning, focusing it on the correct diagnostic path. This synergy is further
enhanced by a knowledge graph-based retrieval module, which grounds the
Generalist's responses in factual dermatological knowledge, ensuring both
accuracy and reliability. This hierarchical design not only reduces diagnostic
errors but also significantly improves computational efficiency. Experiments on
our curated multimodal dermatology dataset demonstrate that CLARIFY achieves an
18\% improvement in diagnostic accuracy over the strongest baseline, a
fine-tuned, uncompressed single-line VLM, while reducing the average VRAM
requirement and latency by at least 20\% and 5\%, respectively. These results
indicate that a Specialist-Generalist system provides a practical and powerful
paradigm for building lightweight, trustworthy, and clinically viable AI
systems.

Abstract: Face images play a crucial role in numerous applications; however, real-world
conditions frequently introduce degradations such as noise, blur, and
compression artifacts, affecting overall image quality and hindering subsequent
tasks. To address this challenge, we organized the VQualA 2025 Challenge on
Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) as part of the ICCV 2025 Workshops.
Participants created lightweight and efficient models (limited to 0.5 GFLOPs
and 5 million parameters) for the prediction of Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) on
face images with arbitrary resolutions and realistic degradations. Submissions
underwent comprehensive evaluations through correlation metrics on a dataset of
in-the-wild face images. This challenge attracted 127 participants, with 1519
final submissions. This report summarizes the methodologies and findings for
advancing the development of practical FIQA approaches.

TL;DR: 新颖的上下文感知零检异常检测框架，结合时间Transformer、预测编码器和CLIP，无需训练异常样本即可检测监控视频中的异常行为


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监控视频中异常事件具有不可预测性和上下文依赖性，传统方法需要异常样本进行训练，存在实际应用的局限性

Method: 混合架构结合TimeSformer、DPC和CLIP三种模型：TimeSformer提取空间-时间特征，DPC预测未来表征检测时间异常，CLIP通过文本提示实现语义级异常检测，使用InfoNCE和CPC损失进行聚合训练

Result: 建立了一个无需异常样本训练的零检测框架，能够在复杂环境中检测未见过的异常行为，实现了时间推理与语义上下文的有效结合

Conclusion: 该框架为监控异常检测领域提供了一种新的零检测方法，通过结合预测模型和视觉-语言理解，能够更好地处理实际应用中的复杂场景和未知异常，代码已开源

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in surveillance footage is inherently challenging due to
their unpredictable and context-dependent nature. This work introduces a novel
context-aware zero-shot anomaly detection framework that identifies abnormal
events without exposure to anomaly examples during training. The proposed
hybrid architecture combines TimeSformer, DPC, and CLIP to model spatiotemporal
dynamics and semantic context. TimeSformer serves as the vision backbone to
extract rich spatial-temporal features, while DPC forecasts future
representations to identify temporal deviations. Furthermore, a CLIP-based
semantic stream enables concept-level anomaly detection through
context-specific text prompts. These components are jointly trained using
InfoNCE and CPC losses, aligning visual inputs with their temporal and semantic
representations. A context-gating mechanism further enhances decision-making by
modulating predictions with scene-aware cues or global video features. By
integrating predictive modeling with vision-language understanding, the system
can generalize to previously unseen behaviors in complex environments. This
framework bridges the gap between temporal reasoning and semantic context in
zero-shot anomaly detection for surveillance. The code for this research has
been made available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DoGFlow是一个无需人工标注的自监督3D场景流估计框架，通过4D雷达多普勒测量生成运动伪标签并转移到LiDAR域，在MAN TruckScenes数据集上显著优于现有自监督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D场景流估计中大规模人工标注数据集的瓶颈问题，当前自监督方法在长距离和恶劣天气场景中性能不足，而监督方法依赖昂贵的人工标注难以扩展。

Method: 提出跨模态标签转移方法，直接从4D雷达多普勒测量实时计算运动伪标签，通过动态感知关联和歧义消除传播将其转移到LiDAR域。

Result: 在MAN TruckScenes数据集上大幅超越现有自监督方法，仅需10%的真实标注数据即可达到全监督方法90%以上的性能。

Conclusion: DoGFlow框架有效解决了3D场景流估计的标注瓶颈，实现了高性能的自监督学习，为自动驾驶系统在动态环境中的安全导航提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate 3D scene flow estimation is critical for autonomous systems to
navigate dynamic environments safely, but creating the necessary large-scale,
manually annotated datasets remains a significant bottleneck for developing
robust perception models. Current self-supervised methods struggle to match the
performance of fully supervised approaches, especially in challenging
long-range and adverse weather scenarios, while supervised methods are not
scalable due to their reliance on expensive human labeling. We introduce
DoGFlow, a novel self-supervised framework that recovers full 3D object motions
for LiDAR scene flow estimation without requiring any manual ground truth
annotations. This paper presents our cross-modal label transfer approach, where
DoGFlow computes motion pseudo-labels in real-time directly from 4D radar
Doppler measurements and transfers them to the LiDAR domain using dynamic-aware
association and ambiguity-resolved propagation. On the challenging MAN
TruckScenes dataset, DoGFlow substantially outperforms existing self-supervised
methods and improves label efficiency by enabling LiDAR backbones to achieve
over 90% of fully supervised performance with only 10% of the ground truth
data. For more details, please visit https://ajinkyakhoche.github.io/DogFlow/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SatSkylines是一个从卫星图像和粗略几何先验生成3D建筑的方法，通过建模从噪声粗先验到详细几何的转换，解决了现有方法在建筑结构恢复和细节化方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图像的3D生成方法难以从卫星图像的俯视图中准确恢复建筑结构，而3D细节化方法又过度依赖详细体素输入，无法从简单先验（如长方体）生成满意结果。

Method: 建模从插值噪声粗先验到详细几何的转换，实现灵活的几何控制且无需额外计算成本，并开发了包含5万多个独特风格化3D建筑资产的大规模数据集Skylines-50K。

Result: 广泛评估表明该方法有效且具有强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SatSkylines通过创新的几何转换建模，成功解决了卫星图像3D建筑生成的准确性和细节化问题，为建筑模型生成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We present SatSkylines, a 3D building generation approach that takes
satellite imagery and coarse geometric priors. Without proper geometric
guidance, existing image-based 3D generation methods struggle to recover
accurate building structures from the top-down views of satellite images alone.
On the other hand, 3D detailization methods tend to rely heavily on highly
detailed voxel inputs and fail to produce satisfying results from simple priors
such as cuboids. To address these issues, our key idea is to model the
transformation from interpolated noisy coarse priors to detailed geometries,
enabling flexible geometric control without additional computational cost. We
have further developed Skylines-50K, a large-scale dataset of over 50,000
unique and stylized 3D building assets in order to support the generations of
detailed building models. Extensive evaluations indicate the effectiveness of
our model and strong generalization ability.

TL;DR: 通过两阶段深度学习模型检测和排名游戏中的空间过渡点，为自动导航和关卡设计提供基础


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂3D游戏环境中，高效识别地图过渡点对客户端自动地图制作和关卡设计评估至关重要

Method: 两阶段深度学习流水线：首先使用Faster R-CNN检测潜在STP，然后通过轻量级MSTP选择器融合局部和全局视觉特征进行排名，采用参数高效的adapter技术

Result: 在自建的多样化数据集上验证，发现了关键拼换：全网络微调在数据充足时STP检测更优，而adapter转移在少数据场景和MSTP选择任务中更稳健高效

Conclusion: 通过定义这个新问题、提供基准流程和数据集，以及对高效模型适配的初步见解，为未来AI驱动的导航辅助和数据驱动的关卡设计工具做出贡献

Abstract: In complex 3D game environments, players rely on visual affordances to spot
map transition points. Efficient identification of such points is important to
client-side auto-mapping, and provides an objective basis for evaluating map
cue presentation. In this work, we formalize the task of detecting traversable
Spatial Transition Points (STPs)-connectors between two sub regions-and
selecting the singular Main STP (MSTP), the unique STP that lies on the
designer-intended critical path toward the player's current macro-objective,
from a single game frame, proposing this as a new research focus. We introduce
a two-stage deep-learning pipeline that first detects potential STPs using
Faster R-CNN and then ranks them with a lightweight MSTP selector that fuses
local and global visual features. Both stages benefit from parameter-efficient
adapters, and we further introduce an optional retrieval-augmented fusion step.
Our primary goal is to establish the feasibility of this problem and set
baseline performance metrics. We validate our approach on a custom-built,
diverse dataset collected from five Action RPG titles. Our experiments reveal a
key trade-off: while full-network fine-tuning produces superior STP detection
with sufficient data, adapter-only transfer is significantly more robust and
effective in low-data scenarios and for the MSTP selection task. By defining
this novel problem, providing a baseline pipeline and dataset, and offering
initial insights into efficient model adaptation, we aim to contribute to
future AI-driven navigation aids and data-informed level-design tools.

Motivation: 现有音频驱动动画方法主要适用于语音和歌唱场景，但在复杂的影视制作中（需要细腻角色互动、真实身体动作和动态镜头）表现不足，需要实现影视级角色动画。

Method: 基于Wan构建的音频驱动模型Wan-S2V，通过改进模型架构和训练策略来增强在电影场景中的表现力和保真度。

Result: 在Hunyuan-Avatar和Omnihuman等先进模型的对比实验中，Wan-S2V始终显著优于现有解决方案，并在长视频生成和精确唇形同步编辑应用中展现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: Wan-S2V成功解决了影视级角色动画的长期挑战，为复杂影视制作提供了高质量的音频驱动动画解决方案，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for audio-driven character animation
demonstrate promising performance for scenarios primarily involving speech and
singing. However, they often fall short in more complex film and television
productions, which demand sophisticated elements such as nuanced character
interactions, realistic body movements, and dynamic camera work. To address
this long-standing challenge of achieving film-level character animation, we
propose an audio-driven model, which we refere to as Wan-S2V, built upon Wan.
Our model achieves significantly enhanced expressiveness and fidelity in
cinematic contexts compared to existing approaches. We conducted extensive
experiments, benchmarking our method against cutting-edge models such as
Hunyuan-Avatar and Omnihuman. The experimental results consistently demonstrate
that our approach significantly outperforms these existing solutions.
Additionally, we explore the versatility of our method through its applications
in long-form video generation and precise video lip-sync editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的离合重组融合框架(DeReF)，通过随机特征重组策略和动态MoE融合模块，解决了多模态癌症生存分析中的固定融合方案和信息闭合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态融合方法存在两个主要问题：固定融合方案导致模型过度依赖预定义的特征组合，而MoE基础方法中各专家网络处理分离的特征，限制了信息交互。

Method: 提出DeReF框架，包括随机特征重组策略和动态MoE融合模块，同时在模态离合模块中维护区域交叉注意力网络来提高离合特征的表示质量。

Result: 在自建的肝癌数据集和三个公开TCGA数据集上进行了广泛实验，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: DeReF框架通过随机重组特征增加了特征组合的多样性和粒度，解决了信息闭合问题，为多模态癌症生存分析提供了更有效的融合方案。

Abstract: Cancer survival analysis commonly integrates information across diverse
medical modalities to make survival-time predictions. Existing methods
primarily focus on extracting different decoupled features of modalities and
performing fusion operations such as concatenation, attention, and MoE-based
(Mixture-of-Experts) fusion. However, these methods still face two key
challenges: i) Fixed fusion schemes (concatenation and attention) can lead to
model over-reliance on predefined feature combinations, limiting the dynamic
fusion of decoupled features; ii) in MoE-based fusion methods, each expert
network handles separate decoupled features, which limits information
interaction among the decoupled features. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel Decoupling-Reorganization-Fusion framework (DeReF), which
devises a random feature reorganization strategy between modalities decoupling
and dynamic MoE fusion modules.Its advantages are: i) it increases the
diversity of feature combinations and granularity, enhancing the generalization
ability of the subsequent expert networks; ii) it overcomes the problem of
information closure and helps expert networks better capture information among
decoupled features. Additionally, we incorporate a regional cross-attention
network within the modality decoupling module to improve the representation
quality of decoupled features. Extensive experimental results on our in-house
Liver Cancer (LC) and three widely used TCGA public datasets confirm the
effectiveness of our proposed method. The code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: ROSE是一个视频对象移除框架，专门处理对象移除后的副作用（如阴影、反射等），通过合成数据和扩散变换器模型实现高质量的视频修复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频对象移除方法在处理对象副作用（阴影、反射、光照、半透明和镜像效果）时表现不佳，主要缺乏配对的监督数据。

Method: 使用3D渲染引擎生成合成数据，构建大规模配对数据集；基于扩散变换器实现视频修复模型；通过差分掩码显式预测副作用区域；引入额外监督机制。

Result: ROSE在提出的ROSE-Bench基准测试中表现优异，优于现有视频对象擦除模型，并能很好地泛化到真实世界视频场景。

Conclusion: ROSE框架通过系统性处理对象副作用和合成数据生成，显著提升了视频对象移除的质量和泛化能力，为视频编辑提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Video object removal has achieved advanced performance due to the recent
success of video generative models. However, when addressing the side effects
of objects, e.g., their shadows and reflections, existing works struggle to
eliminate these effects for the scarcity of paired video data as supervision.
This paper presents ROSE, termed Remove Objects with Side Effects, a framework
that systematically studies the object's effects on environment, which can be
categorized into five common cases: shadows, reflections, light, translucency
and mirror. Given the challenges of curating paired videos exhibiting the
aforementioned effects, we leverage a 3D rendering engine for synthetic data
generation. We carefully construct a fully-automatic pipeline for data
preparation, which simulates a large-scale paired dataset with diverse scenes,
objects, shooting angles, and camera trajectories. ROSE is implemented as an
video inpainting model built on diffusion transformer. To localize all
object-correlated areas, the entire video is fed into the model for
reference-based erasing. Moreover, additional supervision is introduced to
explicitly predict the areas affected by side effects, which can be revealed
through the differential mask between the paired videos. To fully investigate
the model performance on various side effect removal, we presents a new
benchmark, dubbed ROSE-Bench, incorporating both common scenarios and the five
special side effects for comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results
demonstrate that ROSE achieves superior performance compared to existing video
object erasing models and generalizes well to real-world video scenarios. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频描述方法存在运动-细节失衡问题，模型往往过分强调某一方面而忽略另一方面，导致描述不完整和不一致性

Method: 1) 数据方面：通过两阶段流水线(MDF和FGE)构建HMD-270K数据集
2) 优化方面：基于GRPO的描述集等效奖励(CSER)，通过单元-集匹配和双向验证提升完整性和准确性

Result: OwlCap模型在两个基准上都获得显著提升：细节聚焦的VDC(+4.2 Acc)和运动聚焦的DREAM-1K(+4.6 F1)

Conclusion: 该研究通过数据集构建和优化算法有效解决了视频描述中的运动-细节失衡问题，OwlCap模型和HMD-270K数据集将为视频描述研究作出贡献

Abstract: Video captioning aims to generate comprehensive and coherent descriptions of
the video content, contributing to the advancement of both video understanding
and generation. However, existing methods often suffer from motion-detail
imbalance, as models tend to overemphasize one aspect while neglecting the
other. This imbalance results in incomplete captions, which in turn leads to a
lack of consistency in video understanding and generation. To address this
issue, we propose solutions from two aspects: 1) Data aspect: We constructed
the Harmonizing Motion-Detail 270K (HMD-270K) dataset through a two-stage
pipeline: Motion-Detail Fusion (MDF) and Fine-Grained Examination (FGE). 2)
Optimization aspect: We introduce the Caption Set Equivalence Reward (CSER)
based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). CSER enhances completeness
and accuracy in capturing both motion and details through unit-to-set matching
and bidirectional validation. Based on the HMD-270K supervised fine-tuning and
GRPO post-training with CSER, we developed OwlCap, a powerful video captioning
multi-modal large language model (MLLM) with motion-detail balance.
Experimental results demonstrate that OwlCap achieves significant improvements
compared to baseline models on two benchmarks: the detail-focused VDC (+4.2
Acc) and the motion-focused DREAM-1K (+4.6 F1). The HMD-270K dataset and OwlCap
model will be publicly released to facilitate video captioning research
community advancements.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了甲骨文拓片图像检测中的退化问题，通过聚类表示学习显著提升了检测性能，为数字考古学中的甲骨文自动化检测提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBIs), play a crucial role in understanding ancient
Chinese civilization. The automated detection of OBIs from rubbing images
represents a fundamental yet challenging task in digital archaeology, primarily
due to various degradation factors including noise and cracks that limit the
effectiveness of conventional detection networks. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel clustering-based feature space representation learning
method. Our approach uniquely leverages the Oracle Bones Character (OBC) font
library dataset as prior knowledge to enhance feature extraction in the
detection network through clustering-based representation learning. The method
incorporates a specialized loss function derived from clustering results to
optimize feature representation, which is then integrated into the total
network loss. We validate the effectiveness of our method by conducting
experiments on two OBIs detection dataset using three mainstream detection
frameworks: Faster R-CNN, DETR, and Sparse R-CNN. Through extensive
experimentation, all frameworks demonstrate significant performance
improvements.

Motivation: 现有的空间域SNR优先级方法在分离跨通道干扰和增强信息结构/压制噪声方面存在限制，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 提出使用频域SNR优先级，通过傀里变换将特征分解为振幅和相位谱，设计FAST模块结合谱相互动与SNR线索，FAT瓶颈模块通过门控关注机制融合低高频分支，构建U形SFormer网络。

Result: 在UIEB、EUVP、LSUI数据集上训练，PSNR提升3.1dB，SSIM提升0.08，成功恢复水下场景的颜色、纹理和对比度。

Conclusion: 频域SNR优先级方法在水下图像增强任务中显示出优势，通过谱域分析和渡渣模块设计有效提升了图像质量。

Abstract: Recent learning-based underwater image enhancement (UIE) methods have
advanced by incorporating physical priors into deep neural networks,
particularly using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) prior to reduce
wavelength-dependent attenuation. However, spatial domain SNR priors have two
limitations: (i) they cannot effectively separate cross-channel interference,
and (ii) they provide limited help in amplifying informative structures while
suppressing noise. To overcome these, we propose using the SNR prior in the
frequency domain, decomposing features into amplitude and phase spectra for
better channel modulation. We introduce the Fourier Attention SNR-prior
Transformer (FAST), combining spectral interactions with SNR cues to highlight
key spectral components. Additionally, the Frequency Adaptive Transformer (FAT)
bottleneck merges low- and high-frequency branches using a gated attention
mechanism to enhance perceptual quality. Embedded in a unified U-shaped
architecture, these modules integrate a conventional RGB stream with an
SNR-guided branch, forming SFormer. Trained on 4,800 paired images from UIEB,
EUVP, and LSUI, SFormer surpasses recent methods with a 3.1 dB gain in PSNR and
0.08 in SSIM, successfully restoring colors, textures, and contrast in
underwater scenes.

Motivation: 现有研究虽然实现了良好的分割性能，但在EF估计方面表现不佳，需要同时处理单帧细节和多帧时空关系来改善EF计算准确性

Method: 采用分层设计：低层使用卷积网络处理单帧图像保留细节，高层使用Mamba架构捕捉时空关系；提出时空交叉扫描(STCS)模块通过跨帧和位置的跳跃扫描整合长程上下文

Result: 该方法能够平衡单帧和多帧处理，避免单帧处理的局部误差累积或多帧处理的细节忽略问题，有助于减轻超声图像噪声等因素导致的EF计算偏差

Conclusion: 分层时空分割网络通过协同局部细节建模和全局动态感知，有效提高了超声心动图视频中左心室心内膜分割的准确性，从而改善了EF估计性能

Abstract: Automated segmentation of the left ventricular endocardium in
echocardiography videos is a key research area in cardiology. It aims to
provide accurate assessment of cardiac structure and function through Ejection
Fraction (EF) estimation. Although existing studies have achieved good
segmentation performance, their results do not perform well in EF estimation.
In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Segmentation Network
(\ourmodel) for echocardiography video, aiming to improve EF estimation
accuracy by synergizing local detail modeling with global dynamic perception.
The network employs a hierarchical design, with low-level stages using
convolutional networks to process single-frame images and preserve details,
while high-level stages utilize the Mamba architecture to capture
spatio-temporal relationships. The hierarchical design balances single-frame
and multi-frame processing, avoiding issues such as local error accumulation
when relying solely on single frames or neglecting details when using only
multi-frame data. To overcome local spatio-temporal limitations, we propose the
Spatio-temporal Cross Scan (STCS) module, which integrates long-range context
through skip scanning across frames and positions. This approach helps mitigate
EF calculation biases caused by ultrasound image noise and other factors.

TL;DR: FPS是一种新颖的无监督域适应框架，通过冻结预训练特征编码器并优化决策边界来解决域偏移问题，避免了传统微调方法的低效性和不可预测性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前无监督域适应方法主要依赖微调特征提取器，存在效率低、可解释性差和扩展性差的问题。研究发现预训练模型的特征空间具有域不变的几何模式，域偏移主要表现为边界错位而非特征退化。

Method: 提出特征空间平面搜索器(FPS)框架，冻结预训练特征编码器，利用特征空间的几何模式（类内聚类和类间分离）来优化决策边界，实现离线特征提取和全数据集单次计算优化。

Result: 在公共基准测试中，FPS达到或超过了最先进方法的性能，能够高效扩展到多模态大模型，并在蛋白质结构预测、遥感分类和地震检测等多个领域展现出色表现。

Conclusion: FPS提供了一个简单、有效且通用的迁移学习范式，特别适用于域适应任务，显著降低了内存和计算成本，同时保持了良好的可解释性。

Abstract: Domain shift, characterized by degraded model performance during transition
from labeled source domains to unlabeled target domains, poses a persistent
challenge for deploying deep learning systems. Current unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) methods predominantly rely on fine-tuning feature extractors -
an approach limited by inefficiency, reduced interpretability, and poor
scalability to modern architectures.
  Our analysis reveals that models pretrained on large-scale data exhibit
domain-invariant geometric patterns in their feature space, characterized by
intra-class clustering and inter-class separation, thereby preserving
transferable discriminative structures. These findings indicate that domain
shifts primarily manifest as boundary misalignment rather than feature
degradation.
  Unlike fine-tuning entire pre-trained models - which risks introducing
unpredictable feature distortions - we propose the Feature-space Planes
Searcher (FPS): a novel domain adaptation framework that optimizes decision
boundaries by leveraging these geometric patterns while keeping the feature
encoder frozen. This streamlined approach enables interpretative analysis of
adaptation while substantially reducing memory and computational costs through
offline feature extraction, permitting full-dataset optimization in a single
computation cycle.
  Evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that FPS achieves competitive or
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods. FPS scales efficiently with
multimodal large models and shows versatility across diverse domains including

*Wasi Ullah,Yasir Noman Khalid,Saddam Hussain Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种优化的混合深度学习框架，结合定制InceptionV3、LSTM和集成特征选择策略，用于人体活动识别，在UCF-YouTube数据集上达到99.65%准确率，特征减少至7个，支持边缘设备实时部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人体活动识别系统面临的高计算成本、冗余特征和实时场景可扩展性有限等关键挑战，需要在异构环境中实现准确、鲁棒且轻量级的识别。

Method: 采用定制InceptionV3提取空间描述符捕获多级上下文模式，LSTM建模时间依赖性，集成遗传算法ADFSA进行特征选择，动态平衡准确性、冗余性、独特性和复杂度降低等目标。

Result: 在具有遮挡、杂乱背景、运动动态和光照不佳等挑战的UCF-YouTube数据集上取得99.65%识别准确率，特征减少至7个，推理时间显著提升。

Conclusion: 该轻量级可扩展的HAR系统支持在树莓派等边缘设备上实时部署，适用于公共安全、辅助技术和自主监控系统等资源感知的智能环境应用。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a pivotal role in various
applications, including smart surveillance, healthcare, assistive technologies,
sports analytics, etc. However, HAR systems still face critical challenges,
including high computational costs, redundant features, and limited scalability
in real-time scenarios. An optimized hybrid deep learning framework is
introduced that integrates a customized InceptionV3, an LSTM architecture, and
a novel ensemble-based feature selection strategy. The proposed framework first
extracts spatial descriptors using the customized InceptionV3 model, which
captures multilevel contextual patterns, region homogeneity, and fine-grained
localization cues. The temporal dependencies across frames are then modeled
using LSTMs to effectively encode motion dynamics. Finally, an ensemble-based
genetic algorithm with Adaptive Dynamic Fitness Sharing and Attention (ADFSA)
is employed to select a compact and optimized feature set by dynamically
balancing objectives such as accuracy, redundancy, uniqueness, and complexity
reduction. Consequently, the selected feature subsets, which are both diverse
and discriminative, enable various lightweight machine learning classifiers to
achieve accurate and robust HAR in heterogeneous environments. Experimental
results on the robust UCF-YouTube dataset, which presents challenges such as
occlusion, cluttered backgrounds, motion dynamics, and poor illumination,
demonstrate good performance. The proposed approach achieves 99.65% recognition
accuracy, reduces features to as few as 7, and enhances inference time. The
lightweight and scalable nature of the HAR system supports real-time deployment
on edge devices such as Raspberry Pi, enabling practical applications in
intelligent, resource-aware environments, including public safety, assistive
technology, and autonomous monitoring systems.

TL;DR: ColorGS是一种新的内镜视频可变形组织重建框架，通过空间适配颜色编码和增强变形模型，在保持实时渲染效率的同时实现了更高的重建保真度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在抓取细微颜色变化和建模全局变形方面存在限制，3D高斯抹塔的固定颜色分配和线性变形模型无法满足复杂细微结构和一致全局变形的需求

Method: 提出Colored Gaussian Primitives使用动态锚点和可学习颜色参数来适配编码空间变化纹理；设计Enhanced Deformation Model(EDM)结合时间敏感高斯基函数和可学习时间独立变形，以抓取局部组织变形和全局运动一致性

Result: 在DaVinci机器人手术视频和标准数据集(EndoNeRF, StereoMIS)上达到最高水平，PSNR为39.85(比之前3DGS方法提高1.5)，SSIM为97.25%，同时保持实时渲染效率

Conclusion: ColorGS通过平衡高保真度和计算实用性，推进了手术场景重建技术的发展，对于术中导航和AR/VR应用具有重要意义

Abstract: High-fidelity reconstruction of deformable tissues from endoscopic videos
remains challenging due to the limitations of existing methods in capturing
subtle color variations and modeling global deformations. While 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) enables efficient dynamic reconstruction, its fixed
per-Gaussian color assignment struggles with intricate textures, and linear
deformation modeling fails to model consistent global deformation. To address
these issues, we propose ColorGS, a novel framework that integrates spatially
adaptive color encoding and enhanced deformation modeling for surgical scene
reconstruction. First, we introduce Colored Gaussian Primitives, which employ
dynamic anchors with learnable color parameters to adaptively encode spatially
varying textures, significantly improving color expressiveness under complex
lighting and tissue similarity. Second, we design an Enhanced Deformation Model
(EDM) that combines time-aware Gaussian basis functions with learnable
time-independent deformations, enabling precise capture of both localized
tissue deformations and global motion consistency caused by surgical
interactions. Extensive experiments on DaVinci robotic surgery videos and
benchmark datasets (EndoNeRF, StereoMIS) demonstrate that ColorGS achieves
state-of-the-art performance, attaining a PSNR of 39.85 (1.5 higher than prior
3DGS-based methods) and superior SSIM (97.25\%) while maintaining real-time
rendering efficiency. Our work advances surgical scene reconstruction by
balancing high fidelity with computational practicality, critical for
intraoperative guidance and AR/VR applications.

*Hiroaki Aizawa,Yuta Naito,Kohei Fukuda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出类别级洪水正则化方法，通过为不同类别设置不同的洪水阈值来解决不平衡数据集中的少数类识别性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当在不平衡数据集上训练神经网络时，模型预测倾向于偏向多数类，导致少数类的识别性能显著下降。需要一种正则化方法来平衡不同类别的学习效果。

Method: 扩展洪水正则化到类别级别，根据类别频率为每个类别分配特定的洪水阈值。抑制多数类的过拟合，同时允许少数类充分学习。

Result: 在不平衡图像分类任务上验证，相比传统洪水正则化方法，提高了少数类的分类性能，获得了更好的整体泛化能力。

Conclusion: 类别级洪水正则化是一种有效的正则化技术，能够在不平衡学习场景中改善模型性能，特别是提升少数类的识别准确率。

Abstract: The purpose of training neural networks is to achieve high generalization
performance on unseen inputs. However, when trained on imbalanced datasets, a
model's prediction tends to favor majority classes over minority classes,
leading to significant degradation in the recognition performance of minority
classes. To address this issue, we propose class-wise flooding regularization,
an extension of flooding regularization applied at the class level. Flooding is
a regularization technique that mitigates overfitting by preventing the
training loss from falling below a predefined threshold, known as the flooding
level, thereby discouraging memorization. Our proposed method assigns a
class-specific flooding level based on class frequencies. By doing so, it
suppresses overfitting in majority classes while allowing sufficient learning
for minority classes. We validate our approach on imbalanced image
classification. Compared to conventional flooding regularizations, our method
improves the classification performance of minority classes and achieves better
overall generalization.

### [29] [Flatness-aware Curriculum Learning via Adversarial Difficulty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18726)
*Hiroaki Aizawa,Yoshikazu Hayashi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过提出对抗难度测量(ADM)来解决课程学习(CL)与尽头敏锐小化(SAM)结合的困难，在多个图像分类任务中实现更好的绝绝化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统课程学习基于损失值或梯度来评估样本难度，但在SAM训练的平坡区域中这些指标都变得均匀小而失效，导致CL与SAM无法有效结合。

Method: 提出对抗难度测量(ADM)，通过计算原始示例与对抗示例之间的标准化损失间隔来量化模型的对抗脏性。ADM在平坡区域仍保持有效性，并将其集成到CL-SAM训练中进行动态难度评估。

Result: 在图像分类、细粒度识别和领域绝绝化任务中，方法在保留CL和SAM优势的同时，性能超过现有的课程基于和平坡敏感训练策略。

Conclusion: ADM有效解决了在平坡最小值训练中评估样本难度的挑战，为CL与SAM的有效结合提供了可行方案，显著提升了模型的绝绝化性能。

Abstract: Neural networks trained by empirical risk minimization often suffer from
overfitting, especially to specific samples or domains, which leads to poor
generalization. Curriculum Learning (CL) addresses this issue by selecting
training samples based on the difficulty. From the optimization perspective,
methods such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improve robustness and
generalization by seeking flat minima. However, combining CL with SAM is not
straightforward. In flat regions, both the loss values and the gradient norms
tend to become uniformly small, which makes it difficult to evaluate sample
difficulty and design an effective curriculum. To overcome this problem, we
propose the Adversarial Difficulty Measure (ADM), which quantifies adversarial
vulnerability by leveraging the robustness properties of models trained toward
flat minima. Unlike loss- or gradient-based measures, which become ineffective
as training progresses into flatter regions, ADM remains informative by
measuring the normalized loss gap between original and adversarial examples. We
incorporate ADM into CL-based training with SAM to dynamically assess sample
difficulty. We evaluated our approach on image classification tasks,
fine-grained recognition, and domain generalization. The results demonstrate
that our method preserves the strengths of both CL and SAM while outperforming
existing curriculum-based and flatness-aware training strategies.

TL;DR: 海底物体检测中戴儒类的表现较差，研究发现定位模块的前景-背景区分是主要问题，分类问题即使数据均衡仍存在，建议根据优先级选择数据分布策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海洋物种检测存在显著的类间性能差异，但深层原因不明，需要探索除数据量以外的关键因素和系统性改善方法。

Method: 使用DUO数据集将物体检测任务分解为定位和分类两个子任务，采用YOLO11和TIDE工具分析戴儒类的定位问题，并进行分类实验研究。

Result: 发现定位模块的前景-背景区分是最大问题，与数据量无关；分类精度空际即使在均衡数据下仍存在，表明存在内在特征挑战。

Conclusion: 优先精度时应使用不均衡数据分布，优先召回率时应使用均衡分布；改善表现较差类别需要重点关注算法改进，特别是定位模块的优化。

Abstract: Underwater object detection is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems but
poses unique challenges, including degraded image quality, imbalanced class
distribution, and distinct visual characteristics. Not every species is
detected equally well, yet underlying causes remain unclear. We address two key
research questions: 1) What factors beyond data quantity drive class-specific
performance disparities? 2) How can we systematically improve detection of
under-performing marine species? We manipulate the DUO dataset to separate the
object detection task into localization and classification and investigate the
under-performance of the scallop class. Localization analysis using YOLO11 and
TIDE finds that foreground-background discrimination is the most problematic
stage regardless of data quantity. Classification experiments reveal persistent
precision gaps even with balanced data, indicating intrinsic feature-based
challenges beyond data scarcity and inter-class dependencies. We recommend
imbalanced distributions when prioritizing precision, and balanced
distributions when prioritizing recall. Improving under-performing classes
should focus on algorithmic advances, especially within localization modules.
We publicly release our code and datasets.

Motivation: 传统CAD生成方法主要从点云、网格或文本输入开始，与工业工作流程中从2D工程图开始的实际情况不符。自动从2D矢量图纸生成参数化CAD模型是工程设计中的关键步骤，但研究不足。

Method: 提出Drawing2CAD框架：1）网络友好的向量图元表示保持几何精度；2）双解码器transformer架构解耦命令类型和参数生成；3）软目标分布损失函数适应CAD参数灵活性。创建CAD-VGDrawing数据集进行训练评估。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将CAD生成重新定义为序列到序列学习问题，直接从矢量图纸图元生成参数化CAD操作，保持了几何精度和设计意图，填补了从2D工程图到参数化CAD模型自动生成的研究空白。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) generative modeling is driving significant
innovations across industrial applications. Recent works have shown remarkable
progress in creating solid models from various inputs such as point clouds,
meshes, and text descriptions. However, these methods fundamentally diverge
from traditional industrial workflows that begin with 2D engineering drawings.
The automatic generation of parametric CAD models from these 2D vector drawings
remains underexplored despite being a critical step in engineering design. To
address this gap, our key insight is to reframe CAD generation as a
sequence-to-sequence learning problem where vector drawing primitives directly
inform the generation of parametric CAD operations, preserving geometric
precision and design intent throughout the transformation process. We propose
Drawing2CAD, a framework with three key technical components: a
network-friendly vector primitive representation that preserves precise
geometric information, a dual-decoder transformer architecture that decouples
command type and parameter generation while maintaining precise correspondence,
and a soft target distribution loss function accommodating inherent flexibility
in CAD parameters. To train and evaluate Drawing2CAD, we create CAD-VGDrawing,
a dataset of paired engineering drawings and parametric CAD models, and conduct
thorough experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/lllssc/Drawing2CAD.

Motivation: 现有音频-视觉语音识别系统在噪声环境中难以准确估计音频可靠性并动态调整模态依赖，导致识别性能下降

Method: 使用音频-视觉特征融合的路由器，基于token级声学质量评分自适应重新加权音频和视觉特征，通过门控交叉注意力机制在解码器层中强化视觉线索

Result: 在LRS3数据集上相比AV-HuBERT实现16.51-42.67%的相对词错误率降低，消融实验验证了路由器和门控机制对噪声鲁棒性的贡献

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效在音频质量恶化时转向依赖视觉模态，显著提升噪声环境下的音频-视觉语音识别鲁棒性

Abstract: Robust audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) in noisy environments remains
challenging, as existing systems struggle to estimate audio reliability and
dynamically adjust modality reliance. We propose router-gated cross-modal
feature fusion, a novel AVSR framework that adaptively reweights audio and
visual features based on token-level acoustic corruption scores. Using an
audio-visual feature fusion-based router, our method down-weights unreliable
audio tokens and reinforces visual cues through gated cross-attention in each
decoder layer. This enables the model to pivot toward the visual modality when
audio quality deteriorates. Experiments on LRS3 demonstrate that our approach
achieves an 16.51-42.67% relative reduction in word error rate compared to
AV-HuBERT. Ablation studies confirm that both the router and gating mechanism
contribute to improved robustness under real-world acoustic noise.

TL;DR: 新的HOI检测标准评价框架，将人物交互检测重构为多选题形式，避免正确预测被缺陷的标注系统罚分


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HOI标准测试集在评价方式上与现代生成式视觉语言模型不匹配，导致合理预测被错误罚分

Method: 设计新的多选题形式评价协议，每道题只包含真实正确选项和细心筛选的负面选项，避免漂移情况下的正确预测被罚分

Result: 提供了第一个能够直接比较通用VLM和专门HOI方法的评价框架

Conclusion: 新标准为HOI理解领域提供了更全面的评价方式，有助于更准确地评估各种方法的真实能力

Abstract: Prior human-object interaction (HOI) detection methods have integrated early
vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP, but only as supporting components
within their frameworks. In contrast, recent advances in large, generative VLMs
suggest that these models may already possess strong ability to understand
images involving HOI. This naturally raises an important question: can
general-purpose standalone VLMs effectively solve HOI detection, and how do
they compare with specialized HOI methods? Answering this requires a benchmark
that can accommodate both paradigms. However, existing HOI benchmarks such as
HICO-DET were developed before the emergence of modern VLMs, and their
evaluation protocols require exact matches to annotated HOI classes. This is
poorly aligned with the generative nature of VLMs, which often yield multiple
valid interpretations in ambiguous cases. For example, a static image may
capture a person mid-motion with a frisbee, which can plausibly be interpreted
as either "throwing" or "catching". When only "catching" is annotated, the
other, though equally plausible for the image, is marked incorrect when exact
matching is used. As a result, correct predictions might be penalized,
affecting both VLMs and HOI-specific methods. To avoid penalizing valid
predictions, we introduce a new benchmark that reformulates HOI detection as a
multiple-answer multiple-choice task, where each question includes only
ground-truth positive options and a curated set of negatives that are
constructed to reduce ambiguity (e.g., when "catching" is annotated, "throwing"
is not selected as a negative to avoid penalizing valid predictions). The
proposed evaluation protocol is the first of its kind for both VLMs and HOI
methods, enabling direct comparison and offering new insight into the current
state of progress in HOI understanding.

Motivation: 传统选择题生成主要关注文本选项，忽视了视觉选项的重要性，且高质量干扰项的手动制作成本高、可扩展性差。

Method: 提出跨模态选项合成框架(CmOS)，整合多模态思维链推理和检索增强生成技术，生成语义合理且视觉相似的答案和干扰项，并包含内容判别模块识别适合视觉选项的内容。

Conclusion: CmOS框架成功解决了教育选择题中视觉选项生成的挑战，为自动化高质量多选题制作提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) play a crucial role in fostering deep
thinking and knowledge integration in education. However, previous research has
primarily focused on generating MCQs with textual options, but it largely
overlooks the visual options. Moreover, generating high-quality distractors
remains a major challenge due to the high cost and limited scalability of
manual authoring. To tackle these problems, we propose a Cross-modal Options
Synthesis (CmOS), a novel framework for generating educational MCQs with visual
options. Our framework integrates Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) reasoning
process and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce semantically
plausible and visually similar answer and distractors. It also includes a
discrimination module to identify content suitable for visual options.
Experimental results on test tasks demonstrate the superiority of CmOS in
content discrimination, question generation and visual option generation over
existing methods across various subjects and educational levels.

Abstract: The growing integration of smart environments and low-power computing
devices, coupled with mass-market sensor technologies, is driving advancements
in remote and non-contact physiological monitoring. However, deploying these
systems in real-time on resource-constrained platforms introduces significant
challenges related to scalability, interoperability, and performance. This
paper presents a real-time remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) system optimized
for low-power devices, designed to extract physiological signals, such as heart
rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and oxygen saturation (SpO2), from facial
video streams. The system is built on the Face2PPG pipeline, which processes
video frames sequentially for rPPG signal extraction and analysis, while
leveraging a multithreaded architecture to manage video capture, real-time
processing, network communication, and graphical user interface (GUI) updates
concurrently. This design ensures continuous, reliable operation at 30 frames
per second (fps), with adaptive feedback through a collaborative user interface
to guide optimal signal capture conditions. The network interface includes both
an HTTP server for continuous video streaming and a RESTful API for on-demand
vital sign retrieval. To ensure accurate performance despite the limitations of
low-power devices, we use a hybrid programming model combining Functional
Reactive Programming (FRP) and the Actor Model, allowing event-driven
processing and efficient task parallelization. The system is evaluated under
real-time constraints, demonstrating robustness while minimizing computational
overhead. Our work addresses key challenges in real-time biosignal monitoring,
offering practical solutions for optimizing performance in modern healthcare
and human-computer interaction applications.

Abstract: Online mapping models show remarkable results in predicting vectorized maps
from multi-view camera images only. However, all existing approaches still rely
on ground-truth high-definition maps during training, which are expensive to
obtain and often not geographically diverse enough for reliable generalization.
In this work, we propose PseudoMapTrainer, a novel approach to online mapping
that uses pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled sensor data. We derive those
pseudo-labels by reconstructing the road surface from multi-camera imagery
using Gaussian splatting and semantics of a pre-trained 2D segmentation
network. In addition, we introduce a mask-aware assignment algorithm and loss
function to handle partially masked pseudo-labels, allowing for the first time
the training of online mapping models without any ground-truth maps.
Furthermore, our pseudo-labels can be effectively used to pre-train an online
model in a semi-supervised manner to leverage large-scale unlabeled
crowdsourced data. The code is available at

Abstract: Effective waste sorting is critical for sustainable recycling, yet AI
research in this domain continues to lag behind commercial systems due to
limited datasets and reliance on legacy object detectors. In this work, we
advance AI-driven waste detection by establishing strong baselines and
introducing an ensemble-based semi-supervised learning framework. We first
benchmark state-of-the-art Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) models on
the real-world ZeroWaste dataset, demonstrating that while class-only prompts
perform poorly, LLM-optimized prompts significantly enhance zero-shot accuracy.
Next, to address domain-specific limitations, we fine-tune modern
transformer-based detectors, achieving a new baseline of 51.6 mAP. We then
propose a soft pseudo-labeling strategy that fuses ensemble predictions using
spatial and consensus-aware weighting, enabling robust semi-supervised
training. Applied to the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, our pseudo-annotations
achieve performance gains that surpass fully supervised training, underscoring
the effectiveness of scalable annotation pipelines. Our work contributes to the
research community by establishing rigorous baselines, introducing a robust
ensemble-based pseudo-labeling pipeline, generating high-quality annotations
for the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, and systematically evaluating OVOD models
under real-world waste sorting conditions. Our code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同字体样式传达不同的视觉印象，字体形状与印象标签之间存在密切关系。传统词嵌入方法（如BERT和CLIP）无法有效捕捉这种形状-印象关系，需要专门的方法来更好地表示字体印象。

Method: 构建印象标签共现图（节点表示印象标签，边编码共现关系），然后应用谱嵌入技术为每个标签生成印象向量。

Result: 在定性和定量评估中，该方法在印象引导的字体生成任务上表现优于BERT和CLIP，能够为经常共现的印象标签分配相似向量。

Conclusion: 所提出的谱嵌入方法能够有效捕捉字体形状与印象标签之间的关系，特别适用于基于印象的字体生成和检索任务。

Abstract: Different font styles (i.e., font shapes) convey distinct impressions,
indicating a close relationship between font shapes and word tags describing
those impressions. This paper proposes a novel embedding method for impression
tags that leverages these shape-impression relationships. For instance, our
method assigns similar vectors to impression tags that frequently co-occur in
order to represent impressions of fonts, whereas standard word embedding
methods (e.g., BERT and CLIP) yield very different vectors. This property is
particularly useful for impression-based font generation and font retrieval.
Technically, we construct a graph whose nodes represent impression tags and
whose edges encode co-occurrence relationships. Then, we apply spectral
embedding to obtain the impression vectors for each tag. We compare our method
with BERT and CLIP in qualitative and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating
that our approach performs better in impression-guided font generation.

Conclusion: 传统的手工设计谐波特征对于树种分类任务过于简单，而深度AI特征在数据有限的应用（如NFI分类）中具有巨大潜力。通过利用公开卫星数据和预训练模型，该方法显著提高了分类准确性，可以有效补充现有的森林清单流程。

Abstract: National Forest Inventory (NFI)s serve as the primary source of forest
information, providing crucial tree species distribution data. However,
maintaining these inventories requires labor-intensive on-site campaigns.
Remote sensing approaches, particularly when combined with machine learning,
offer opportunities to update NFIs more frequently and at larger scales. While
the use of Satellite Image Time Series has proven effective for distinguishing
tree species through seasonal canopy reflectance patterns, current approaches
rely primarily on Random Forest classifiers with hand-designed features and
phenology-based metrics. Using deep features from an available pre-trained
remote sensing foundation models offers a complementary strategy. These
pre-trained models leverage unannotated global data and are meant to used for
general-purpose applications and can then be efficiently fine-tuned with
smaller labeled datasets for specific classification tasks. This work
systematically investigates how deep features improve tree species
classification accuracy in the Netherlands with few annotated data. Data-wise,
we extracted time-series data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and ERA5 satellites
data and SRTM data using Google Earth Engine. Our results demonstrate that
fine-tuning a publicly available remote sensing time series foundation model
outperforms the current state-of-the-art in NFI classification in the
Netherlands by a large margin of up to 10% across all datasets. This
demonstrates that classic hand-defined harmonic features are too simple for
this task and highlights the potential of using deep AI features for
data-limited application like NFI classification. By leveraging openly
available satellite data and pre-trained models, this approach significantly
improves classification accuracy compared to traditional methods and can
effectively complement existing forest inventory processes.

Conclusion: 该方法能够精确定位微表情的启动、高潮和终止阶段，充分利用互补信息，提高了模型能力，为微表情分析领域提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary, low-intensity, and short-duration
facial expressions that often reveal an individual's genuine thoughts and
emotions. Most existing ME analysis methods rely on window-level classification
with fixed window sizes and hard decisions, which limits their ability to
capture the complex temporal dynamics of MEs. Although recent approaches have
adopted video-level regression frameworks to address some of these challenges,
interval decoding still depends on manually predefined, window-based methods,
leaving the issue only partially mitigated. In this paper, we propose a
prior-guided video-level regression method for ME analysis. We introduce a
scalable interval selection strategy that comprehensively considers the
temporal evolution, duration, and class distribution characteristics of MEs,
enabling precise spotting of the onset, apex, and offset phases. In addition,
we introduce a synergistic optimization framework, in which the spotting and
recognition tasks share parameters except for the classification heads. This
fully exploits complementary information, makes more efficient use of limited
data, and enhances the model's capability. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method,
with an STRS of 0.0562 on CAS(ME)$^3$ and 0.2000 on SAMMLV. The code is

Conclusion: 该定量框架为微行网络细胞继续术的客观评估提供了有效方法，有助于提升训练协议和技能评估的准确性

Abstract: Microsurgical anastomosis demands exceptional dexterity and visuospatial
skills, underscoring the importance of comprehensive training and precise
outcome assessment. Currently, methods such as the outcome-oriented anastomosis
lapse index are used to evaluate this procedure. However, they often rely on
subjective judgment, which can introduce biases that affect the reliability and
efficiency of the assessment of competence. Leveraging three datasets from
hospitals with participants at various levels, we introduce a quantitative
framework that uses image-processing techniques for objective assessment of
microsurgical anastomoses. The approach uses geometric modeling of errors along
with a detection and scoring mechanism, enhancing the efficiency and
reliability of microsurgical proficiency assessment and advancing training
protocols. The results show that the geometric metrics effectively replicate
expert raters' scoring for the errors considered in this work.

Conclusion: 该方法能够让现代稳傳器克服长期以来的SOTA方法，同时保持现代方法的全帧特性，并为用户提供类似于经典方法的控制机制。

Abstract: Video stabilization remains a fundamental problem in computer vision,
particularly pixel-level synthesis solutions for video stabilization, which
synthesize full-frame outputs, add to the complexity of this task. These
methods aim to enhance stability while synthesizing full-frame videos, but the
inherent diversity in motion profiles and visual content present in each video
sequence makes robust generalization with fixed parameters difficult. To
address this, we present a novel method that improves pixel-level synthesis
video stabilization methods by rapidly adapting models to each input video at
test time. The proposed approach takes advantage of low-level visual cues
available during inference to improve both the stability and visual quality of
the output. Notably, the proposed rapid adaptation achieves significant
performance gains even with a single adaptation pass. We further propose a jerk
localization module and a targeted adaptation strategy, which focuses the
adaptation on high-jerk segments for maximizing stability with fewer adaptation
steps. The proposed methodology enables modern stabilizers to overcome the
longstanding SOTA approaches while maintaining the full frame nature of the
modern methods, while offering users with control mechanisms akin to classical
approaches. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate
the versatility of the proposed method. Our approach consistently improves the
performance of various full-frame synthesis models in both qualitative and
quantitative terms, including results on downstream applications.

Method: 采用并行双分支架构分离敏感属性和目标属性，构建近似正交文本锚点引导跨注意力机制，使用超网络生成实例感知视觉提示，应用基于原型的正则化强化特征分离和对齐

Result: 在8个医疗影像数据集和4种模态上的实验表明，DualFairVL在分布内和分布外设置下均实现了最先进的公平性和准确性，仅使用360万可训练参数就优于全微调和参数高效基线

Conclusion: DualFairVL通过联合去偏和对齐跨模态表示，有效解决了医疗影像诊断中的公平性问题，在保持高精度的同时显著提升了模型公平性

Abstract: Ensuring fairness across demographic groups in medical diagnosis is essential
for equitable healthcare, particularly under distribution shifts caused by
variations in imaging equipment and clinical practice. Vision-language models
(VLMs) exhibit strong generalization, and text prompts encode identity
attributes, enabling explicit identification and removal of sensitive
directions. However, existing debiasing approaches typically address vision and
text modalities independently, leaving residual cross-modal misalignment and
fairness gaps. To address this challenge, we propose DualFairVL, a multimodal
prompt-learning framework that jointly debiases and aligns cross-modal
representations. DualFairVL employs a parallel dual-branch architecture that
separates sensitive and target attributes, enabling disentangled yet aligned
representations across modalities. Approximately orthogonal text anchors are
constructed via linear projections, guiding cross-attention mechanisms to
produce fused features. A hypernetwork further disentangles attribute-related
information and generates instance-aware visual prompts, which encode
dual-modal cues for fairness and robustness. Prototype-based regularization is
applied in the visual branch to enforce separation of sensitive features and
strengthen alignment with textual anchors. Extensive experiments on eight
medical imaging datasets across four modalities show that DualFairVL achieves
state-of-the-art fairness and accuracy under both in- and out-of-distribution
settings, outperforming full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient baselines with
only 3.6M trainable parameters. Code will be released upon publication.

TL;DR: 提出DQEN网络，通过对象感知编码器特征增强对象查询，利用CLIP模型提取语义特征增强交互查询初始化，在HOI检测任务上取得竞争性性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DETR-based HOI检测模型使用随机初始化的查询导致表示模糊，限制了模型效果。人类在HOI类别中是固定的，而对象和交互是可变的

Method: 提出双查询增强网络(DQEN)：1)用对象感知编码器特征增强对象查询；2)设计交互语义融合模块利用CLIP模型提取语义特征增强交互查询；3)引入辅助预测单元改善交互特征表示

Result: 在HICO-Det和V-COCO数据集上取得了竞争性的性能表现

Conclusion: 通过增强对象和交互查询的表示能力，DQEN有效提升了HOI检测的准确性和理解能力

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection focuses on localizing human-object
pairs and recognizing their interactions. Recently, the DETR-based framework
has been widely adopted in HOI detection. In DETR-based HOI models, queries
with clear meaning are crucial for accurately detecting HOIs. However, prior
works have typically relied on randomly initialized queries, leading to vague
representations that limit the model's effectiveness. Meanwhile, humans in the
HOI categories are fixed, while objects and their interactions are variable.
Therefore, we propose a Dual Query Enhancement Network (DQEN) to enhance object
and interaction queries. Specifically, object queries are enhanced with
object-aware encoder features, enabling the model to focus more effectively on
humans interacting with objects in an object-aware way. On the other hand, we
design a novel Interaction Semantic Fusion module to exploit the HOI candidates
that are promoted by the CLIP model. Semantic features are extracted to enhance
the initialization of interaction queries, thereby improving the model's
ability to understand interactions. Furthermore, we introduce an Auxiliary
Prediction Unit aimed at improving the representation of interaction features.
Our proposed method achieves competitive performance on both the HICO-Det and
the V-COCO datasets. The source code is available at

Method: 提出损失函数来促进模型的可解释性，生成稀疏和局部化的特征图，通过特征激活来解释哪些图像区域对预测的控制命令有贡献。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了自动驾驶模型的可解释性，而且可解释性的提升与减少事故相关，产生了更安全、高性能的驾驶模型。

Abstract: Trustworthy AI is mandatory for the broad deployment of autonomous vehicles.
Although end-to-end approaches derive control commands directly from raw data,
interpreting these decisions remains challenging, especially in complex urban
scenarios. This is mainly attributed to very deep neural networks with
non-linear decision boundaries, making it challenging to grasp the logic behind
AI-driven decisions. This paper presents a method to enhance interpretability
while optimizing control commands in autonomous driving. To address this, we
propose loss functions that promote the interpretability of our model by
generating sparse and localized feature maps. The feature activations allow us
to explain which image regions contribute to the predicted control command. We
conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the feature extraction step and
validate our method on the CARLA benchmarks. We also demonstrate that our
approach improves interpretability, which correlates with reducing infractions,
yielding a safer, high-performance driving model. Notably, our monocular,
non-ensemble model surpasses the top-performing approaches from the CARLA
Leaderboard by achieving lower infraction scores and the highest route
completion rate, all while ensuring interpretability.

Abstract: The Event-Enriched Image Analysis (EVENTA) Grand Challenge, hosted at ACM
Multimedia 2025, introduces the first large-scale benchmark for event-level
multimodal understanding. Traditional captioning and retrieval tasks largely
focus on surface-level recognition of people, objects, and scenes, often
overlooking the contextual and semantic dimensions that define real-world
events. EVENTA addresses this gap by integrating contextual, temporal, and
semantic information to capture the who, when, where, what, and why behind an
image. Built upon the OpenEvents V1 dataset, the challenge features two tracks:
Event-Enriched Image Retrieval and Captioning, and Event-Based Image Retrieval.
A total of 45 teams from six countries participated, with evaluation conducted
through Public and Private Test phases to ensure fairness and reproducibility.
The top three teams were invited to present their solutions at ACM Multimedia
2025. EVENTA establishes a foundation for context-aware, narrative-driven

Abstract: This study presents an initial framework for distinguishing group and single
pedestrians based on real-world trajectory data, with the aim of analyzing
their differences in space utilization and emergent behavioral patterns. By
segmenting pedestrian trajectories into fixed time bins and applying a
Transformer-based pair classification model, we identify cohesive groups and
isolate single pedestrians over a structured sequence-based filtering process.
To prepare for deeper analysis, we establish a comprehensive metric framework
incorporating both spatial and behavioral dimensions. Spatial utilization
metrics include convex hull area, smallest enclosing circle radius, and
heatmap-based spatial densities to characterize how different pedestrian types
occupy and interact with space. Behavioral metrics such as velocity change,
motion angle deviation, clearance radius, and trajectory straightness are
designed to capture local adaptations and responses during interactions.
Furthermore, we introduce a typology of encounter types-single-to-single,
single-to-group, and group-to-group to categorize and later quantify different
interaction scenarios. Although this version focuses primarily on the
classification pipeline and dataset structuring, it establishes the groundwork
for scalable analysis across different sequence lengths 60, 100, and 200
frames. Future versions will incorporate complete quantitative analysis of the
proposed metrics and their implications for pedestrian simulation and space
design validation in crowd dynamics research.

Abstract: Monitoring coral reefs at large spatial scales remains an open challenge,
essential for assessing ecosystem health and informing conservation efforts.
While drone-based aerial imagery offers broad spatial coverage, its limited
resolution makes it difficult to reliably distinguish fine-scale classes, such
as coral morphotypes. At the same time, obtaining pixel-level annotations over
large spatial extents is costly and labor-intensive, limiting the scalability
of deep learning-based segmentation methods for aerial imagery. We present a
multi-scale weakly supervised semantic segmentation framework that addresses
this challenge by transferring fine-scale ecological information from
underwater imagery to aerial data. Our method enables large-scale coral reef
mapping from drone imagery with minimal manual annotation, combining
classification-based supervision, spatial interpolation and self-distillation
techniques. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach, enabling large-area
segmentation of coral morphotypes and demonstrating flexibility for integrating
new classes. This study presents a scalable, cost-effective methodology for
high-resolution reef monitoring, combining low-cost data collection, weakly
supervised deep learning and multi-scale remote sensing.

Abstract: Traditional map-making relies heavily on Geographic Information Systems
(GIS), requiring domain expertise and being time-consuming, especially for
repetitive tasks. Recent advances in generative AI (GenAI), particularly image
diffusion models, offer new opportunities for automating and democratizing the
map-making process. However, these models struggle with accurate map creation
due to limited control over spatial composition and semantic layout. To address
this, we integrate vector data to guide map generation in different styles,
specified by the textual prompts. Our model is the first to generate accurate
maps in controlled styles, and we have integrated it into a web application to
improve its usability and accessibility. We conducted a user study with
professional cartographers to assess the fidelity of generated maps, the
usability of the web application, and the implications of ever-emerging GenAI
in map-making. The findings have suggested the potential of our developed
application and, more generally, the GenAI models in helping both non-expert
users and professionals in creating maps more efficiently. We have also
outlined further technical improvements and emphasized the new role of
cartographers to advance the paradigm of AI-assisted map-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献通常将风格驱动和主体驱动的生成视为两个独立任务，存在明显的对抗性。作者认为这两个目标可以在单一框架下统一，因为它们都涉及内容和风格的解耦与重组。

Method: 1) 构建大规模三元组数据集；2) 引入解耦学习方案，通过风格对齐训练和内容-风格解耦训练同时对齐风格特征并解耦内容与风格；3) 结合风格奖励学习(SRL)范式提升性能；4) 发布USO-Bench联合评估基准。

Conclusion: USO成功统一了风格驱动和主体驱动的生成任务，证明了内容和风格的解耦与重组可以同时实现风格相似性和主体保真度的优化。

Abstract: Existing literature typically treats style-driven and subject-driven
generation as two disjoint tasks: the former prioritizes stylistic similarity,
whereas the latter insists on subject consistency, resulting in an apparent
antagonism. We argue that both objectives can be unified under a single
framework because they ultimately concern the disentanglement and
re-composition of content and style, a long-standing theme in style-driven
research. To this end, we present USO, a Unified Style-Subject Optimized
customization model. First, we construct a large-scale triplet dataset
consisting of content images, style images, and their corresponding stylized
content images. Second, we introduce a disentangled learning scheme that
simultaneously aligns style features and disentangles content from style
through two complementary objectives, style-alignment training and
content-style disentanglement training. Third, we incorporate a style
reward-learning paradigm denoted as SRL to further enhance the model's
performance. Finally, we release USO-Bench, the first benchmark that jointly
evaluates style similarity and subject fidelity across multiple metrics.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that USO achieves state-of-the-art
performance among open-source models along both dimensions of subject
consistency and style similarity. Code and model:

Motivation: 解决NeRF在视觉定位中因编码精细场景细节而导致的隐私泄露问题

Method: 使用分割监督而非RGB图像训练NeRF，自监督学习分割标签以模糊可识别细节，同时保持3D区分性

Result: ppNeSF在视觉定位任务中达到state-of-the-art结果，有效保护隐私

Conclusion: ppNeSF成功平衡了视觉定位精度和隐私保护需求，为云基定位服务提供了安全解决方案

Abstract: Visual localization (VL) is the task of estimating the camera pose in a known
scene. VL methods, a.o., can be distinguished based on how they represent the
scene, e.g., explicitly through a (sparse) point cloud or a collection of
images or implicitly through the weights of a neural network. Recently,
NeRF-based methods have become popular for VL. While NeRFs offer high-quality
novel view synthesis, they inadvertently encode fine scene details, raising
privacy concerns when deployed in cloud-based localization services as
sensitive information could be recovered. In this paper, we tackle this
challenge on two ends. We first propose a new protocol to assess
privacy-preservation of NeRF-based representations. We show that NeRFs trained
with photometric losses store fine-grained details in their geometry
representations, making them vulnerable to privacy attacks, even if the head
that predicts colors is removed. Second, we propose ppNeSF (Privacy-Preserving
Neural Segmentation Field), a NeRF variant trained with segmentation
supervision instead of RGB images. These segmentation labels are learned in a
self-supervised manner, ensuring they are coarse enough to obscure identifiable
scene details while remaining discriminativeness in 3D. The segmentation space
of ppNeSF can be used for accurate visual localization, yielding
state-of-the-art results.

*Eric López,Artemis Llabrés,Ernest Valveny*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 在文档视觉问答中引入检索增强生成(RAG)技术，通过文本检索和视觉检索两种方式显著提升了多页文档问答的准确率，最高提升22.5 ANLS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文档VQA系统要么拼接所有页面，要么依赖大型视觉语言模型，都存在内存消耗大的问题。RAG技术提供了通过检索相关片段再进行答案生成的替代方案。

Method: 系统评估了两种RAG变体：基于OCR令牌的文本检索和无需OCR的纯视觉检索。在MP-DocVQA、DUDE和InfographicVQA等多页数据集上进行测试，并分析了检索、重排序和布局引导分块策略的效果。

Result: 文本中心变体比"拼接所有页面"基线提升高达+22.5 ANLS，视觉变体无需文本提取也能实现+5.0 ANLS提升。实验确认检索和重排序组件是主要增益来源，而布局引导分块策略在这些数据集上无效。

Conclusion: 仔细的证据选择能够持续提升不同模型大小和多页基准测试的准确性，证明了其在现实世界文档VQA中的实用价值。

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (Document VQA) must cope with documents
that span dozens of pages, yet leading systems still concatenate every page or
rely on very large vision-language models, both of which are memory-hungry.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers an attractive alternative, first
retrieving a concise set of relevant segments before generating answers from
this selected evidence. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact of
incorporating RAG into Document VQA through different retrieval variants -
text-based retrieval using OCR tokens and purely visual retrieval without OCR -
across multiple models and benchmarks. Evaluated on the multi-page datasets
MP-DocVQA, DUDE, and InfographicVQA, the text-centric variant improves the
"concatenate-all-pages" baseline by up to +22.5 ANLS, while the visual variant
achieves +5.0 ANLS improvement without requiring any text extraction. An
ablation confirms that retrieval and reranking components drive most of the
gain, whereas the layout-guided chunking strategy - proposed in several recent
works to leverage page structure - fails to help on these datasets. Our
experiments demonstrate that careful evidence selection consistently boosts
accuracy across multiple model sizes and multi-page benchmarks, underscoring
its practical value for real-world Document VQA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRAS是一个用于评估视觉语言模型(VLMs)在性别、种族、年龄和肤色方面人口统计偏见的基准测试，提出了可解释的GRAS偏见评分指标，发现现有VLMs存在严重偏见问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型在现实应用中的普及，理解其人口统计偏见变得至关重要，需要系统评估模型在不同人口属性上的偏见程度。

Method: 提出GRAS基准测试，涵盖性别、种族、年龄和肤色四个维度，设计GRAS偏见评分指标，对5个最先进的VLMs进行偏见评估，并强调需要从多个问题表述角度评估VQA偏见。

Result: 所有测试的VLMs都表现出令人担忧的偏见水平，最不偏见的模型GRAS评分仅为2/100，表明现有模型存在严重的偏见问题。

Conclusion: GRAS基准测试揭示了VLMs存在显著的人口统计偏见，提出的评估方法和指标为未来模型偏见检测和缓解提供了重要工具和见解。

Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) become integral to real-world applications,
understanding their demographic biases is critical. We introduce GRAS, a
benchmark for uncovering demographic biases in VLMs across gender, race, age,
and skin tone, offering the most diverse coverage to date. We further propose
the GRAS Bias Score, an interpretable metric for quantifying bias. We benchmark
five state-of-the-art VLMs and reveal concerning bias levels, with the least
biased model attaining a GRAS Bias Score of only 2 out of 100. Our findings
also reveal a methodological insight: evaluating bias in VLMs with visual
question answering (VQA) requires considering multiple formulations of a
question. Our code, data, and evaluation results are publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RoofSeg网络，基于transformer编码器-解码器框架，通过可学习的平面查询实现端到端屋顶平面分割，解决了现有深度学习方法在边缘精度和几何约束方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的屋顶平面分割方法存在三个问题：非真正端到端导致结果非最优、边缘区域特征判别性低导致边缘不准确、平面几何特征约束不足。

Method: 开发RoofSeg网络，采用transformer编码器-解码器框架，使用可学习平面查询预测平面实例掩码；设计边缘感知掩码模块(EAMM)融入平面几何先验；提出自适应权重掩码损失和平面几何损失约束训练。

Result: 该方法实现了真正端到端的屋顶平面分割，提高了边缘区域的判别性和分割精度，通过几何约束优化了网络训练效果。

Conclusion: RoofSeg网络有效解决了当前深度学习方法在屋顶平面分割中的三个关键问题，为从LiDAR点云重建LoD 2和3级3D建筑模型提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Roof plane segmentation is one of the key procedures for reconstructing
three-dimensional (3D) building models at levels of detail (LoD) 2 and 3 from
airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. The majority of
current approaches for roof plane segmentation rely on the manually designed or
learned features followed by some specifically designed geometric clustering
strategies. Because the learned features are more powerful than the manually
designed features, the deep learning-based approaches usually perform better
than the traditional approaches. However, the current deep learning-based
approaches have three unsolved problems. The first is that most of them are not
truly end-to-end, the plane segmentation results may be not optimal. The second
is that the point feature discriminability near the edges is relatively low,
leading to inaccurate planar edges. The third is that the planar geometric
characteristics are not sufficiently considered to constrain the network
training. To solve these issues, a novel edge-aware transformer-based network,
named RoofSeg, is developed for segmenting roof planes from LiDAR point clouds
in a truly end-to-end manner. In the RoofSeg, we leverage a transformer
encoder-decoder-based framework to hierarchically predict the plane instance
masks with the use of a set of learnable plane queries. To further improve the
segmentation accuracy of edge regions, we also design an Edge-Aware Mask Module
(EAMM) that sufficiently incorporates planar geometric prior of edges to
enhance its discriminability for plane instance mask refinement. In addition,
we propose an adaptive weighting strategy in the mask loss to reduce the
influence of misclassified points, and also propose a new plane geometric loss
to constrain the network training.

TL;DR: 微塑料污染严重，MicroDetect-Net模型通过激光显微镜和深度学习检测血液样本中的微塑料，准确率达92%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微塑料污染已成为全球急诫问题，可导致肝脏感染、肠道损伤等健康风险，需要有效检测方法

Method: 采用Nile Red染料染色和激光显微镜技术，构建MicroDetect-Net深度学习模型，通过卷积神经网络进行图像分割和微塑料定位计数

Result: 在276张激光血液图像数据集上，模型达到92%准确率，IoU 87.4%，F1分数92.1%，精确率90.6%，召回率93.7%

Conclusion: MDN模型在微塑料检测中表现优异，为人类血液样本微塑料监测提供了有效技术路径，将有助于全面评估微塑料对人体健康的影响

Abstract: With the prevalence of plastics exceeding 368 million tons yearly,
microplastic pollution has grown to an extent where air, water, soil, and
living organisms have all tested positive for microplastic presence. These
particles, which are smaller than 5 millimeters in size, are no less harmful to
humans than to the environment. Toxicity research on microplastics has shown
that exposure may cause liver infection, intestinal injuries, and gut flora
imbalance, leading to numerous potential health hazards. This paper presents a
new model, MicroDetect-Net (MDN), which applies fluorescence microscopy with
Nile Red dye staining and deep learning to scan blood samples for
microplastics. Although clam blood has certain limitations in replicating real
human blood, this study opens avenues for applying the approach to human
samples, which are more consistent for preliminary data collection. The MDN
model integrates dataset preparation, fluorescence imaging, and segmentation
using a convolutional neural network to localize and count microplastic
fragments. The combination of convolutional networks and Nile Red dye for
segmentation produced strong image detection and accuracy. MDN was evaluated on
a dataset of 276 Nile Red-stained fluorescent blood images and achieved an
accuracy of ninety two percent. Robust performance was observed with an
Intersection over Union of 87.4 percent, F1 score of 92.1 percent, Precision of
90.6 percent, and Recall of 93.7 percent. These metrics demonstrate the
effectiveness of MDN in the detection of microplastics.

Motivation: 现有的PRVR方法主要处理单模态特征，而强大的预训练视觉-语言模型如CLIP在该领域尚未得到充分探索

Method: 提出ProPy模型，包含两个关键创新：1) 提示金字塔结构组织多粒度事件提示；2) 祖先-后代交互机制实现事件间的动态语义交互

Result: 在三个公开数据集上达到了最先进的性能，显著超越了之前的模型

Conclusion: ProPy通过系统性地适配CLIP架构，成功解决了部分相关视频检索任务，证明了预训练视觉-语言模型在该领域的有效性

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) is a practical yet challenging task
that involves retrieving videos based on queries relevant to only specific
segments. While existing works follow the paradigm of developing models to
process unimodal features, powerful pretrained vision-language models like CLIP
remain underexplored in this field. To bridge this gap, we propose ProPy, a
model with systematic architectural adaption of CLIP specifically designed for
PRVR. Drawing insights from the semantic relevance of multi-granularity events,
ProPy introduces two key innovations: (1) A Prompt Pyramid structure that
organizes event prompts to capture semantics at multiple granularity levels,
and (2) An Ancestor-Descendant Interaction Mechanism built on the pyramid that
enables dynamic semantic interaction among events. With these designs, ProPy
achieves SOTA performance on three public datasets, outperforming previous
models by significant margins. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像数据稀缺导致机器学习模型训练困难，特别是在血液动力学标记物识别方面。需要找到方法充分利用大规模几何模型数据来解决小规模临床数据的不足。

Method: 使用8449个3D血管几何模型构建大规模数据集，通过计算热内核签名（利用拉普拉斯特征向量获得）作为自监督学习目标。在小规模临床数据（49名患者）上进行预训练模型的微调，用于动脉壳剪切应力分区识别。

Result: 学习到的几何表征能够在有限的数据上显著提升动脉壳剪切应力分区识别的性能，将动脉分为低、中、高剪切应力区域。

Conclusion: 通过自监督学习预训练基础模型，可以有效利用大规模几何数据来解决医学预测任务中的数据稀缺问题，为血液动力学标记物识别提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Leveraging big data for patient care is promising in many medical fields such
as cardiovascular health. For example, hemodynamic biomarkers like wall shear
stress could be assessed from patient-specific medical images via machine
learning algorithms, bypassing the need for time-intensive computational fluid
simulation. However, it is extremely challenging to amass large-enough datasets
to effectively train such models. We could address this data scarcity by means
of self-supervised pre-training and foundations models given large datasets of
geometric artery models. In the context of coronary arteries, leveraging
learned representations to improve hemodynamic biomarker assessment has not yet
been well studied. In this work, we address this gap by investigating whether a
large dataset (8449 shapes) consisting of geometric models of 3D blood vessels
can benefit wall shear stress assessment in coronary artery models from a
small-scale clinical trial (49 patients). We create a self-supervised target
for the 3D blood vessels by computing the heat kernel signature, a quantity
obtained via Laplacian eigenvectors, which captures the very essence of the
shapes. We show how geometric representations learned from this datasets can
boost segmentation of coronary arteries into regions of low, mid and high
(time-averaged) wall shear stress even when trained on limited data.

Conclusion: SuperSimpleNet通过统一多样化监督范式，在保持出色速度和可靠性的同时，为解决现实制造挑战和弥合学术研究与工业应用之间的差距迈出了有希望的一步。

Abstract: Surface defect detection is a critical task across numerous industries, aimed
at efficiently identifying and localising imperfections or irregularities on
manufactured components. While numerous methods have been proposed, many fail
to meet industrial demands for high performance, efficiency, and adaptability.
Existing approaches are often constrained to specific supervision scenarios and
struggle to adapt to the diverse data annotations encountered in real-world
manufacturing processes, such as unsupervised, weakly supervised, mixed
supervision, and fully supervised settings. To address these challenges, we
propose SuperSimpleNet, a highly efficient and adaptable discriminative model
built on the foundation of SimpleNet. SuperSimpleNet incorporates a novel
synthetic anomaly generation process, an enhanced classification head, and an
improved learning procedure, enabling efficient training in all four
supervision scenarios, making it the first model capable of fully leveraging
all available data annotations. SuperSimpleNet sets a new standard for
performance across all scenarios, as demonstrated by its results on four
challenging benchmark datasets. Beyond accuracy, it is very fast, achieving an
inference time below 10 ms. With its ability to unify diverse supervision
paradigms while maintaining outstanding speed and reliability, SuperSimpleNet
represents a promising step forward in addressing real-world manufacturing
challenges and bridging the gap between academic research and industrial
applications. Code: https://github.com/blaz-r/SuperSimpleNet

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机在固定照明和静态场景下无法产生事件，限制了其在计算机视觉任务中的应用。需要一种轻量级的方法来持续产生事件。

Method: 使用旋转不平衡质量产生周期性振动，结合运动补偿管线去除注入的运动，获得清洁的经运动缩正的事件数据。

Result: 在硬件原型和实际采集的数据集上评估，方法可靠地恢复运动参数，在图像重建和边缘检测任务上比没有运动激发的事件感知更好。

Conclusion: 该轻量级方法通过注入振动运动有效解决了事件相机在静态场景中的限制，为下游感知任务提供了清洁的事件数据。

Abstract: Event cameras are a bio-inspired class of sensors that asynchronously measure
per-pixel intensity changes. Under fixed illumination conditions in static or
low-motion scenes, rigidly mounted event cameras are unable to generate any
events, becoming unsuitable for most computer vision tasks. To address this
limitation, recent work has investigated motion-induced event stimulation that
often requires complex hardware or additional optical components. In contrast,
we introduce a lightweight approach to sustain persistent event generation by
employing a simple rotating unbalanced mass to induce periodic vibrational
motion. This is combined with a motion-compensation pipeline that removes the
injected motion and yields clean, motion-corrected events for downstream
perception tasks. We demonstrate our approach with a hardware prototype and
evaluate it on real-world captured datasets. Our method reliably recovers
motion parameters and improves both image reconstruction and edge detection
over event-based sensing without motion induction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史文档的文本行分割需要大量注释数据，而这些数据缺乏且注释成本高，因此需要少样本学习方法来降低数据需求。

Method: 结合轻量级UNet++网络和一种初始用于神经元形态的连通性感知损失函数，显式惩罚线路碎片化和意外合并等结构错误。从每个手稿仅提取三个注释页面的小补丁进行训练。

Result: 在U-DIADS-TL数据集上显著提升了当前最先进水平：识别精度提高了200%，行交叉比提高了75%。在DIVA-HisDB基准检测任务中达到了与竞赛冠军相当或替代的F-Measure分数。

Conclusion: 该方法在极少的注释数据下展现了高效的文本行分割能力，证明了轻量级结构结合拓扑感知损失函数在历史文档处理中的优势。

Abstract: A foundational task for the digital analysis of documents is text line
segmentation. However, automating this process with deep learning models is
challenging because it requires large, annotated datasets that are often
unavailable for historical documents. Additionally, the annotation process is a
labor- and cost-intensive task that requires expert knowledge, which makes
few-shot learning a promising direction for reducing data requirements. In this
work, we demonstrate that small and simple architectures, coupled with a
topology-aware loss function, are more accurate and data-efficient than more
complex alternatives. We pair a lightweight UNet++ with a connectivity-aware
loss, initially developed for neuron morphology, which explicitly penalizes
structural errors like line fragmentation and unintended line merges. To
increase our limited data, we train on small patches extracted from a mere
three annotated pages per manuscript. Our methodology significantly improves
upon the current state-of-the-art on the U-DIADS-TL dataset, with a 200%
increase in Recognition Accuracy and a 75% increase in Line Intersection over
Union. Our method also achieves an F-Measure score on par with or even
exceeding that of the competition winner of the DIVA-HisDB baseline detection
task, all while requiring only three annotated pages, exemplifying the efficacy
of our approach. Our implementation is publicly available at:

Conclusion: 通过增强文本嵌入的3D感知能力和几何特征，有效解决了单位敏感性问题，显著提升了单目3D视觉定位任务的性能。

Abstract: Monocular 3D visual grounding is a novel task that aims to locate 3D objects
in RGB images using text descriptions with explicit geometry information.
Despite the inclusion of geometry details in the text, we observe that the text
embeddings are sensitive to the magnitude of numerical values but largely
ignore the associated measurement units. For example, simply equidistant
mapping the length with unit "meter" to "decimeters" or "centimeters" leads to
severe performance degradation, even though the physical length remains
equivalent. This observation signifies the weak 3D comprehension of pre-trained
language model, which generates misguiding text features to hinder 3D
perception. Therefore, we propose to enhance the 3D perception of model on text
embeddings and geometry features with two simple and effective methods.
Firstly, we introduce a pre-processing method named 3D-text Enhancement (3DTE),
which enhances the comprehension of mapping relationships between different
units by augmenting the diversity of distance descriptors in text queries.
Next, we propose a Text-Guided Geometry Enhancement (TGE) module to further
enhance the 3D-text information by projecting the basic text features into
geometrically consistent space. These 3D-enhanced text features are then
leveraged to precisely guide the attention of geometry features. We evaluate
the proposed method through extensive comparisons and ablation studies on the
Mono3DRefer dataset. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements
over previous methods, achieving new state-of-the-art results with a notable
accuracy gain of 11.94\% in the "Far" scenario. Our code will be made publicly
available.

TL;DR: WEF-PE是一种基于椭圆函数的二维位置编码方法，通过复数域表示直接处理图像空间坐标，解决了传统ViT位置编码破坏图像二维结构的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Vision Transformer使用一维位置编码会破坏图像的二维空间结构，缺乏几何约束，无法建立欧几里得空间距离与序列索引距离之间的单调对应关系，限制了模型利用空间邻近先验的能力。

Method: 提出Weierstrass椭圆函数位置编码(WEF-PE)，利用椭圆函数的双周期性与视觉数据平移不变性模式对齐的特性，通过复数域自然表示二维坐标，利用椭圆函数的非线性几何性质自然编码空间距离关系。

Result: 在多个场景下取得优异性能：ViT-Tiny在CIFAR-100从头训练达到63.78%准确率，ViT-Base在CIFAR-100微调达到93.28%，在VTAB-1k基准任务上持续改进。理论分析证实了距离衰减特性，注意力可视化显示增强的几何归纳偏置。

Conclusion: WEF-PE通过数学原理性的方法有效解决了ViT位置编码的二维空间结构破坏问题，提供了更好的几何约束和空间关系编码能力，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Vision Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success in computer vision
tasks, yet their reliance on learnable one-dimensional positional embeddings
fundamentally disrupts the inherent two-dimensional spatial structure of images
through patch flattening procedures. Traditional positional encoding approaches
lack geometric constraints and fail to establish monotonic correspondence
between Euclidean spatial distances and sequential index distances, thereby
limiting the model's capacity to leverage spatial proximity priors effectively.
We propose Weierstrass Elliptic Function Positional Encoding (WEF-PE), a
mathematically principled approach that directly addresses two-dimensional
coordinates through natural complex domain representation, where the doubly
periodic properties of elliptic functions align remarkably with translational
invariance patterns commonly observed in visual data. Our method exploits the
non-linear geometric nature of elliptic functions to encode spatial distance
relationships naturally, while the algebraic addition formula enables direct
derivation of relative positional information between arbitrary patch pairs
from their absolute encodings. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
WEF-PE achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios, including
63.78\% accuracy on CIFAR-100 from-scratch training with ViT-Tiny architecture,
93.28\% on CIFAR-100 fine-tuning with ViT-Base, and consistent improvements on
VTAB-1k benchmark tasks. Theoretical analysis confirms the distance-decay
property through rigorous mathematical proof, while attention visualization
reveals enhanced geometric inductive bias and more coherent semantic focus
compared to conventional approaches.The source code implementing the methods
described in this paper is publicly available on GitHub.

*Jeonghwan Kim,Yushi Lan,Armando Fortes,Yongwei Chen,Xingang Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过分离生成顶点和面的方式，大幅减少网格生成的代序长度，实现8倍速度提升和更高的网格质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网格生成方法通过序列化三角形网格为令牌序列，导致顶点重复使用，产生过长的代序序列和效率低下的生成过程

Method: 1）使用自回归模型生成顶点，将令牌数量减少至现有方法的23%；2）利用双向Transformer捕捉顶点关系并构建邻接矩阵；3）使用保真增强器精细化顶点位置；4）后处理框架移除不良边缘连接

Result: 网格生成速度比最先进方法提升超过8倍，同时产生更高质量的网格

Conclusion: 通过分离顶点和面的生成方式，成功解决了网格代码化中的重复性问题，实现了高效高质的艺术网格生成

Abstract: Recent mesh generation approaches typically tokenize triangle meshes into
sequences of tokens and train autoregressive models to generate these tokens
sequentially. Despite substantial progress, such token sequences inevitably
reuse vertices multiple times to fully represent manifold meshes, as each
vertex is shared by multiple faces. This redundancy leads to excessively long
token sequences and inefficient generation processes. In this paper, we propose
an efficient framework that generates artistic meshes by treating vertices and
faces separately, significantly reducing redundancy. We employ an
autoregressive model solely for vertex generation, decreasing the token count
to approximately 23\% of that required by the most compact existing tokenizer.
Next, we leverage a bidirectional transformer to complete the mesh in a single
step by capturing inter-vertex relationships and constructing the adjacency
matrix that defines the mesh faces. To further improve the generation quality,
we introduce a fidelity enhancer to refine vertex positioning into more natural
arrangements and propose a post-processing framework to remove undesirable edge
connections. Experimental results show that our method achieves more than
8$\times$ faster speed on mesh generation compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, while producing higher mesh quality.

*Weixin Ye,Hongguang Zhu,Wei Wang,Yahui Liu,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 一个轻量化的All-in-One Slider模块，通过分解文本嵌入空间为语义属性方向，支持多属性细粒度控制和零样本属性组合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有T2I模型在人脸等细节丰富内容的属性精确操控问题，避免One-for-One方式导致的参数冗余和扩展性不足。

Method: 训练一个轻量化模块，将文本嵌入空间分解为稀疏的语义属性方向，支持多属性细粒度调整和零样本属性组合。

Result: 实验表明方法能够实现准确的属性操控，在各种属性操作任务上超越以往方法，并能扩展到实际图像处理。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可扩展、高灵活性的属性操控方案，为T2I模型的实际应用扩展了可能性。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant strides in
generating high-quality images. However, progressively manipulating certain
attributes of generated images to meet the desired user expectations remains
challenging, particularly for content with rich details, such as human faces.
Some studies have attempted to address this by training slider modules.
However, they follow a One-for-One manner, where an independent slider is
trained for each attribute, requiring additional training whenever a new
attribute is introduced. This not only results in parameter redundancy
accumulated by sliders but also restricts the flexibility of practical
applications and the scalability of attribute manipulation. To address this
issue, we introduce the All-in-One Slider, a lightweight module that decomposes
the text embedding space into sparse, semantically meaningful attribute
directions. Once trained, it functions as a general-purpose slider, enabling
interpretable and fine-grained continuous control over various attributes.
Moreover, by recombining the learned directions, the All-in-One Slider supports
zero-shot manipulation of unseen attributes (e.g., races and celebrities) and
the composition of multiple attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method enables accurate and scalable attribute manipulation, achieving
notable improvements compared to previous methods. Furthermore, our method can
be extended to integrate with the inversion framework to perform attribute
manipulation on real images, broadening its applicability to various real-world
scenarios. The code and trained model will be released at:

*Jianwen Jiang,Weihong Zeng,Zerong Zheng,Jiaqi Yang,Chao Liang,Wang Liao,Han Liang,Yuan Zhang,Mingyuan Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了OmniHuman-1.5框架，通过多模态大语言模型生成结构化文本指导，结合创新的多模态DiT架构，实现语义一致且富有表现力的角色动画生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频化身模型仅能产生物理上相似的动作，缺乏对情感、意图和上下文的深层语义理解，无法捕捉角色的真实本质。

Method: 1) 利用多模态大语言模型合成结构化文本表示提供高级语义指导；2) 引入带有伪最后一帧设计的专门多模态DiT架构，有效融合多模态输入并缓解模态间冲突。

Result: 在唇形同步准确性、视频质量、动作自然度和文本提示语义一致性等综合指标上达到领先性能，并展现出对多人场景和非人类主体的出色扩展性。

Conclusion: 该框架成功生成了物理上合理、语义上连贯且富有表现力的角色动画，能够准确解读音频、图像和文本的联合语义，实现与角色、场景和语言内容的深度一致性。

Abstract: Existing video avatar models can produce fluid human animations, yet they
struggle to move beyond mere physical likeness to capture a character's
authentic essence. Their motions typically synchronize with low-level cues like
audio rhythm, lacking a deeper semantic understanding of emotion, intent, or
context. To bridge this gap, \textbf{we propose a framework designed to
generate character animations that are not only physically plausible but also
semantically coherent and expressive.} Our model, \textbf{OmniHuman-1.5}, is
built upon two key technical contributions. First, we leverage Multimodal Large
Language Models to synthesize a structured textual representation of conditions
that provides high-level semantic guidance. This guidance steers our motion
generator beyond simplistic rhythmic synchronization, enabling the production
of actions that are contextually and emotionally resonant. Second, to ensure
the effective fusion of these multimodal inputs and mitigate inter-modality
conflicts, we introduce a specialized Multimodal DiT architecture with a novel
Pseudo Last Frame design. The synergy of these components allows our model to
accurately interpret the joint semantics of audio, images, and text, thereby
generating motions that are deeply coherent with the character, scene, and
linguistic content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves
leading performance across a comprehensive set of metrics, including lip-sync
accuracy, video quality, motion naturalness and semantic consistency with
textual prompts. Furthermore, our approach shows remarkable extensibility to
complex scenarios, such as those involving multi-person and non-human subjects.

### [70] [Automated Feature Tracking for Real-Time Kinematic Analysis and Shape Estimation of Carbon Nanotube Growth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19232)
*Kaveh Safavigerdini,Ramakrishna Surya,Jaired Collins,Prasad Calyam,Filiz Bunyak,Matthew R. Maschmann,Kannappan Palaniappan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VFTrack是一个实时原位粒子跟踪框架，用于自动检测和跟踪SEM图像序列中的碳纳米管粒子，解决了现有方法只能静态分析或缺乏连续轨迹分解的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 碳纳米管动态生长的表征受到SEM成像纳米级运动测量实验挑战的限制，现有方法只能提供静态分析或需要手动初始化，缺乏连续的单粒子轨迹分解。

Method: VFTrack集成了手工或深度特征检测器和匹配器，在粒子跟踪框架内实现碳纳米管微柱生长的运动学分析。通过13,540条手动标注轨迹的系统性评估，确定了ALIKED检测器与LightGlue匹配器的最优组合。

Result: 最佳组合达到F1分数0.78和α分数0.89。VFTrack运动向量可分解为轴向生长、横向漂移和振荡，有助于计算异质区域生长速率和重建演化的CNT柱形态。

Conclusion: 这项工作推动了自动化纳米材料表征的进步，弥合了基于物理的模型与实验观察之间的差距，实现了碳纳米管合成的实时优化。

Abstract: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are critical building blocks in nanotechnology, yet
the characterization of their dynamic growth is limited by the experimental
challenges in nanoscale motion measurement using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) imaging. Existing ex situ methods offer only static analysis, while in
situ techniques often require manual initialization and lack continuous
per-particle trajectory decomposition. We present Visual Feature Tracking
(VFTrack) an in-situ real-time particle tracking framework that automatically
detects and tracks individual CNT particles in SEM image sequences. VFTrack
integrates handcrafted or deep feature detectors and matchers within a particle
tracking framework to enable kinematic analysis of CNT micropillar growth. A
systematic using 13,540 manually annotated trajectories identifies the ALIKED
detector with LightGlue matcher as an optimal combination (F1-score of 0.78,
$\alpha$-score of 0.89). VFTrack motion vectors decomposed into axial growth,
lateral drift, and oscillations, facilitate the calculation of heterogeneous
regional growth rates and the reconstruction of evolving CNT pillar
morphologies. This work enables advancement in automated nano-material
characterization, bridging the gap between physics-based models and
experimental observation to enable real-time optimization of CNT synthesis.

*Miran Heo,Sukjun Hwang,Min-Hung Chen,Yu-Chiang Frank Wang,Albert Gu,Seon Joo Kim,Ryo Hachiuma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AUSM是一个基于状态空间模型的自回归通用分割模型，统一了提示式和无提示视频分割，支持任意长度视频流处理，训练速度提升2.5倍，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频分割方法在处理无提示分割（自动检测和跟踪所有对象）时存在碎片化问题，需要专门的任务特定模型和流水线，缺乏统一的解决方案。

Method: 将流式视频分割重新定义为序列掩码预测问题，类似于语言建模。基于状态空间模型构建AUSM，维持固定大小的空间状态，支持任意长度视频流，所有组件都设计为跨帧并行训练。

Result: 在DAVIS17、YouTube-VOS、MOSE、YouTube-VIS、OVIS等标准基准测试中，AUSM超越了先前的通用流式视频分割方法，在16帧序列上实现了高达2.5倍的训练加速。

Conclusion: AUSM成功统一了提示式和无提示视频分割任务，通过自回归掩码预测和状态空间模型的设计，实现了高效、可扩展的视频分割解决方案，为通用视频分割提供了新的架构范式。

Abstract: Recent video foundation models such as SAM2 excel at prompted video
segmentation by treating masks as a general-purpose primitive. However, many
real-world settings require unprompted segmentation that aims to detect and
track all objects in a video without external cues, leaving today's landscape
fragmented across task-specific models and pipelines. We recast streaming video
segmentation as sequential mask prediction, analogous to language modeling, and
introduce the Autoregressive Universal Segmentation Model (AUSM), a single
architecture that unifies both prompted and unprompted video segmentation.
Built on recent state-space models, AUSM maintains a fixed-size spatial state
and scales to video streams of arbitrary length. Furthermore, all components of
AUSM are designed for parallel training across frames, yielding substantial
speedups over iterative training. On standard benchmarks (DAVIS17, YouTube-VOS
2018 & 2019, MOSE, YouTube-VIS 2019 & 2021, and OVIS) AUSM outperforms prior
universal streaming video segmentation methods and achieves up to 2.5x faster
training on 16-frame sequences.

*Beiqi Chen,Shuai Shao,Haitang Feng,Jianhuang Lai,Jianlou Si,Guangcong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Style4D-Bench是首个专门为4D风格化设计的基准套件，包含评估协议、强基线方法和高质量4D场景数据集，旨在标准化该新兴领域的评估和推动研究进展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D风格化是一个新兴领域，缺乏标准化的评估基准和方法，阻碍了该领域的研究进展和比较。

Method: 提出了Style4D框架，基于4D高斯泼溅技术，包含基本4DGS场景表示、风格高斯表示和整体几何保持风格转移模块三个关键组件。

Result: 在Style4D-Bench上的广泛实验表明，Style4D在4D风格化方面达到了最先进的性能，能够生成细粒度风格细节并保持稳定的时间动态和多视图一致性。

Conclusion: Style4D-Bench将成为动态3D场景风格化渲染研究的重要资源，有助于基准测试和推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: We introduce Style4D-Bench, the first benchmark suite specifically designed
for 4D stylization, with the goal of standardizing evaluation and facilitating
progress in this emerging area. Style4D-Bench comprises: 1) a comprehensive
evaluation protocol measuring spatial fidelity, temporal coherence, and
multi-view consistency through both perceptual and quantitative metrics, 2) a
strong baseline that make an initial attempt for 4D stylization, and 3) a
curated collection of high-resolution dynamic 4D scenes with diverse motions
and complex backgrounds. To establish a strong baseline, we present Style4D, a
novel framework built upon 4D Gaussian Splatting. It consists of three key
components: a basic 4DGS scene representation to capture reliable geometry, a
Style Gaussian Representation that leverages lightweight per-Gaussian MLPs for
temporally and spatially aware appearance control, and a Holistic
Geometry-Preserved Style Transfer module designed to enhance spatio-temporal
consistency via contrastive coherence learning and structural content
preservation. Extensive experiments on Style4D-Bench demonstrate that Style4D
achieves state-of-the-art performance in 4D stylization, producing fine-grained
stylistic details with stable temporal dynamics and consistent multi-view
rendering. We expect Style4D-Bench to become a valuable resource for
benchmarking and advancing research in stylized rendering of dynamic 3D scenes.

### [73] [Articulate3D: Zero-Shot Text-Driven 3D Object Posing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19244)
*Oishi Deb,Anjun Hu,Ashkan Khakzar,Philip Torr,Christian Rupprecht*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Articulate3D是一种无需训练的语言控制3D资产姿态调整方法，通过图像生成和姿态优化两步实现，在保持网格身份的同时成功操纵各种3D对象的姿态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉和语言模型有所进展，但通过语言控制来调整3D资产姿态仍然具有挑战性，需要一种无需训练的有效方法。

Method: 将问题分解为两步：1）修改图像生成器创建基于输入图像和文本指令的目标图像；2）通过多视角姿态优化将网格与目标图像对齐，引入自注意力重连机制(RSActrl)和关键点对应关系。

Result: 方法在多样化3D对象和自由形式文本提示上表现有效，用户研究中85%的情况下优于现有方法，定量评估确认其优越性。

Conclusion: Articulate3D提供了一种有效的训练自由方法，能够通过语言指令成功操纵3D资产姿态，同时保持原始网格身份，优于现有技术。

Abstract: We propose a training-free method, Articulate3D, to pose a 3D asset through
language control. Despite advances in vision and language models, this task
remains surprisingly challenging. To achieve this goal, we decompose the
problem into two steps. We modify a powerful image-generator to create target
images conditioned on the input image and a text instruction. We then align the
mesh to the target images through a multi-view pose optimisation step. In
detail, we introduce a self-attention rewiring mechanism (RSActrl) that
decouples the source structure from pose within an image generative model,
allowing it to maintain a consistent structure across varying poses. We
observed that differentiable rendering is an unreliable signal for articulation
optimisation; instead, we use keypoints to establish correspondences between
input and target images. The effectiveness of Articulate3D is demonstrated
across a diverse range of 3D objects and free-form text prompts, successfully
manipulating poses while maintaining the original identity of the mesh.
Quantitative evaluations and a comparative user study, in which our method was
preferred over 85\% of the time, confirm its superiority over existing
approaches. Project page:https://odeb1.github.io/articulate3d_page_deb/

*Lin Li,Zehuan Huang,Haoran Feng,Gengxiong Zhuang,Rui Chen,Chunchao Guo,Lu Sheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VoxHammer是一种无需训练的方法，通过在3D潜在空间中进行精确编辑，解决了现有方法在保持未编辑区域一致性和整体连贯性方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D局部编辑在游戏产业和机器人交互中至关重要，但现有方法通过编辑多视角图像再重建3D模型，难以精确保持未编辑区域的一致性和整体连贯性。

Method: 首先预测3D模型的反转轨迹，获取各时间步的反向潜在表示和键值令牌；在去噪编辑阶段，用对应的反向潜在表示和缓存的键值令牌替换保留区域的去噪特征，通过保持上下文特征确保一致性。

Result: 实验表明VoxHammer在保留区域的3D一致性和整体质量方面显著优于现有方法，并构建了Edit3D-Bench评估数据集进行验证。

Conclusion: 该方法为合成高质量编辑配对数据提供了可能，为上下文3D生成奠定了数据基础。

Abstract: 3D local editing of specified regions is crucial for game industry and robot
interaction. Recent methods typically edit rendered multi-view images and then
reconstruct 3D models, but they face challenges in precisely preserving
unedited regions and overall coherence. Inspired by structured 3D generative
models, we propose VoxHammer, a novel training-free approach that performs
precise and coherent editing in 3D latent space. Given a 3D model, VoxHammer
first predicts its inversion trajectory and obtains its inverted latents and
key-value tokens at each timestep. Subsequently, in the denoising and editing
phase, we replace the denoising features of preserved regions with the
corresponding inverted latents and cached key-value tokens. By retaining these
contextual features, this approach ensures consistent reconstruction of
preserved areas and coherent integration of edited parts. To evaluate the
consistency of preserved regions, we constructed Edit3D-Bench, a
human-annotated dataset comprising hundreds of samples, each with carefully
labeled 3D editing regions. Experiments demonstrate that VoxHammer
significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both 3D consistency of
preserved regions and overall quality. Our method holds promise for
synthesizing high-quality edited paired data, thereby laying the data
foundation for in-context 3D generation. See our project page at

### [75] [Semantic Attractors and the Emergence of Meaning: Towards a Teleological Model of AGI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18290)
*Hans-Joachim Rudolph*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于复数意义空间中语义吸引子的语义全局智能理论框架，通过循环张量变换和旋转语义结构来形成意义，而非统计预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超越当前基于统计下一个标记预测的transformer模型，探索一种通过递归张量变换形成意义的新方式，建立能够模型语义模糊性、语义深度的认知架构。

Method: 使用复数空间中的循环运算（包括虚数单位i）来描述旋转语义结构，通过梯度流、张量变形和迭代矩阵动力学来建模语义吸引子，该吸引子作为一种目的论运算子指导意义向稳定性收敛。

Result: 提出了一种能够模型语义模糊性、语义深度的数学框架，这种方法在数学上具有启发性，在哲学上具有重要意义。

Conclusion: 真正的意义不是通过模拟产生，而是通过递归收敛向语义一致性而出现的，这需要一种根本不同的认知架构，一种用于形成语言而非仅仅预测语言的架构。

Abstract: This essay develops a theoretical framework for a semantic Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI) based on the notion of semantic attractors in complex-valued
meaning spaces. Departing from current transformer-based language models, which
operate on statistical next-token prediction, we explore a model in which
meaning is not inferred probabilistically but formed through recursive
tensorial transformation. Using cyclic operations involving the imaginary unit
\emph{i}, we describe a rotational semantic structure capable of modeling
irony, homonymy, and ambiguity. At the center of this model, however, is a
semantic attractor -- a teleological operator that, unlike statistical
computation, acts as an intentional agent (Microvitum), guiding meaning toward
stability, clarity, and expressive depth. Conceived in terms of gradient flows,
tensor deformations, and iterative matrix dynamics, the attractor offers a
model of semantic transformation that is not only mathematically suggestive,
but also philosophically significant. We argue that true meaning emerges not
from simulation, but from recursive convergence toward semantic coherence, and
that this requires a fundamentally new kind of cognitive architecture -- one
designed to shape language, not just predict it.

TL;DR: KAIROS基准测试研究LLM在多智能体系统中如何基于历史印象建立信任、抵抗错误信息并整合同伴输入，发现GRPO强化学习方法在提升性能的同时降低了社会影响的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注从众偏差，但需要更全面分析LLM在多智能体协作中如何形成信任、抵抗错误信息并整合同伴输入，这些是实现集体智能的关键因素。

Method: 提出KAIROS基准测试，模拟不同可靠性智能体参与的问答竞赛，控制专家-新手角色、噪声群体和对抗性同伴等条件。评估提示工程、监督微调和强化学习（GRPO）等缓解策略。

Result: GRPO结合多智能体上下文、基于结果的奖励和无约束推理实现了最佳整体性能，但相比基础模型降低了对社会影响的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 多智能体强化学习能有效提升LLM在协作环境中的决策性能，但需要平衡性能提升与社会影响鲁棒性之间的关系。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems
(MAS) as components of collaborative intelligence, where peer interactions
dynamically shape individual decision-making. Although prior work has focused
on conformity bias, we extend the analysis to examine how LLMs form trust from
previous impressions, resist misinformation, and integrate peer input during
interaction, key factors for achieving collective intelligence under complex
social dynamics. We present KAIROS, a benchmark simulating quiz contests with
peer agents of varying reliability, offering fine-grained control over
conditions such as expert-novice roles, noisy crowds, and adversarial peers.
LLMs receive both historical interactions and current peer responses, allowing
systematic investigation into how trust, peer action, and self-confidence
influence decisions. As for mitigation strategies, we evaluate prompting,
supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning, Group Relative Policy
Optimisation (GRPO), across multiple models. Our results reveal that GRPO with
multi-agent context combined with outcome-based rewards and unconstrained
reasoning achieves the best overall performance, but also decreases the
robustness to social influence compared to Base models. The code and datasets
are available at: https://github.com/declare-lab/KAIROS.

TL;DR: LangCrUX是首个大规模多语言网站数据集，包含12种非拉丁语系的12万个流行网站，揭示了多语言网页可访问性中语言提示普遍缺失的问题，并提出了Kizuki自动化测试工具来解决这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多语言内容在网页中的增长，辅助技术（如屏幕阅读器）对非拉丁语系支持不足，导致视觉障碍用户面临严重的可访问性挑战，但缺乏大规模多语言网页数据集来系统研究这一问题。

Method: 构建LangCrUX数据集（12种非拉丁语系的12万个流行网站），进行系统性多语言网页可访问性分析，并开发Kizuki语言感知自动化可访问性测试扩展工具。

Result: 发现多语言网页中可访问性提示普遍忽视语言多样性，往往无法反映可见内容的语言特征，降低了屏幕阅读器的有效性，限制了网页可访问性。

Conclusion: 多语言网页可访问性存在系统性缺陷，需要语言感知的自动化测试工具来改善非拉丁语系内容的可访问性支持，Kizuki工具为此提供了解决方案。

Abstract: English is the predominant language on the web, powering nearly half of the
world's top ten million websites. Support for multilingual content is
nevertheless growing, with many websites increasingly combining English with
regional or native languages in both visible content and hidden metadata. This
multilingualism introduces significant barriers for users with visual
impairments, as assistive technologies like screen readers frequently lack
robust support for non-Latin scripts and misrender or mispronounce non-English
text, compounding accessibility challenges across diverse linguistic contexts.
Yet, large-scale studies of this issue have been limited by the lack of
comprehensive datasets on multilingual web content. To address this gap, we
introduce LangCrUX, the first large-scale dataset of 120,000 popular websites
across 12 languages that primarily use non-Latin scripts. Leveraging this
dataset, we conduct a systematic analysis of multilingual web accessibility and
uncover widespread neglect of accessibility hints. We find that these hints
often fail to reflect the language diversity of visible content, reducing the
effectiveness of screen readers and limiting web accessibility. We finally
propose Kizuki, a language-aware automated accessibility testing extension to
account for the limited utility of language-inconsistent accessibility hints.

TL;DR: PLAST是一种通过精确语言特定层微调来高效提升大型视觉语言模型多语言能力的训练方法，仅需调整14%参数即可显著改善多语言理解性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在多语言能力上存在不平衡，研究发现多语言理解能力与浅层语言特定神经元激活存在显著相关性

Method: 首先通过监控语言特定神经元激活来识别参与多语言理解的层，然后使用问题翻译对精确微调这些层以实现多语言对齐

Result: 在MM-Bench和MMMB基准测试中有效提升多语言能力，仅调整14%参数就实现显著效率提升，并能推广到低资源和复杂视觉推理任务

Conclusion: PLAST方法通过浅层语言特定视觉信息参与，为大型视觉语言模型的多语言增强提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated exceptional
capabilities in understanding visual information with human languages but also
exhibit an imbalance in multilingual capabilities. In this work, we delve into
the multilingual working pattern of LVLMs and identify a salient correlation
between the multilingual understanding ability of LVLMs and language-specific
neuron activations in shallow layers. Building on this insight, we introduce
PLAST, a training recipe that achieves efficient multilingual enhancement for
LVLMs by Precise LAnguage-Specific layers fine-Tuning. PLAST first identifies
layers involved in multilingual understanding by monitoring language-specific
neuron activations. These layers are then precisely fine-tuned with
question-translation pairs to achieve multilingual alignment. Our empirical
results on MM-Bench and MMMB demonstrate that PLAST effectively improves the
multilingual capabilities of LVLMs and achieves significant efficiency with
only 14% of the parameters tuned. Further analysis reveals that PLAST can be
generalized to low-resource and complex visual reasoning tasks, facilitating
the language-specific visual information engagement in shallow layers.

TL;DR: 通过backprompting技术生产生产级别标签数据，结合人工聚类标注，构建健康建议监测器，效果超过GPT-4o 3.73%且参数更少


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业环境中大语言模型的普及带来风险，需要监测器过滤输入/输出，但缺乏部署前的生产级别标签数据

Method: 提出backprompting方法生成生产级别标签数据，结合稀疏人工聚类技术进行标注，构建并行语料库并注入现有数据集

Result: 在健康建议监测这个难题上，监测器效果超过GPT-4o达3.73%，而参数数量只有其1/400

Conclusion: backprompting方法能有效生成高质量标签数据，帮助构建更稳健的LLM监测器，在复杂场景中供效更好

Abstract: The pervasiveness of large language models (LLMs) in enterprise settings has
also brought forth a significant amount of risks associated with their usage.
Guardrails technologies aim to mitigate this risk by filtering LLMs'
input/output text through various detectors. However, developing and
maintaining robust detectors faces many challenges, one of which is the
difficulty in acquiring production-quality labeled data on real LLM outputs
prior to deployment. In this work, we propose backprompting, a simple yet
intuitive solution to generate production-like labeled data for health advice
guardrails development. Furthermore, we pair our backprompting method with a
sparse human-in-the-loop clustering technique to label the generated data. Our
aim is to construct a parallel corpus roughly representative of the original
dataset yet resembling real LLM output. We then infuse existing datasets with
our synthetic examples to produce robust training data for our detector. We
test our technique in one of the most difficult and nuanced guardrails: the
identification of health advice in LLM output, and demonstrate improvement
versus other solutions. Our detector is able to outperform GPT-4o by up to
3.73%, despite having 400x less parameters.

TL;DR: Integral Transformer通过积分采样logit分布来降噪注意力，在保留特殊令牌贡献的同时减少注意力噪声，在多项基准测试中优于传统注意力机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决softmax自注意力机制中特殊令牌和标点符号等无信息令牌获得过高权重的问题（注意力噪声），同时避免现有方法可能丢弃有用信息的风险。

Method: 提出Integral Transformer自注意力机制，通过对logit分布进行积分采样来整合信号，实现注意力降噪。

Result: 在知识推理语言基准测试中优于vanilla、Cog和Differential注意力变体，能有效平衡注意力分布并减少上层rank collapse。

Conclusion: Integral Transformer能有效降噪同时保留关键信息，下层使用传统自注意力可提升性能，该机制在注意力平衡和rank collapse缓解方面表现优异。

Abstract: Softmax self-attention often assigns disproportionate weight to semantically
uninformative tokens such as special tokens and punctuation, a phenomenon known
as attention noise. While recent methods like Cog Attention and the
Differential Transformer have addressed this by introducing negative attention
scores, they risk discarding useful information. In this paper, we propose the
Integral Transformer, a novel self-attention mechanism that denoises attention
by integrating signals sampled from the logit distribution. Our approach
mitigates noise while preserving the contributions of special tokens critical
for model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
outperforms vanilla, Cog, and Differential attention variants on
well-established knowledge and reasoning language benchmarks. Moreover, our
analysis reveals that employing vanilla self-attention in the lower Transformer
layers enhances performance and that the Integral Transformer effectively
balances attention distributions and reduces rank collapse in upper layers.

TL;DR: LSC通过可学习的token嵌入选择语义最一致的回答，在短式和长式推理基准测试中均优于现有方法，计算开销可忽略


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在复杂或长式问题上概率解码输出不一致的问题，现有方法在短式和长式回答格式间存在准确率权衡

Method: 使用可学习的token嵌入选择语义最一致的回答，通过轻量级前向生成摘要token，推理时间增加不到1%且无需修改模型架构

Result: 在6个短式和5个长式推理基准测试中，LSC在所有基准上平均超越SC、USC和WUCS，同时保持可忽略的计算开销

Conclusion: LSC是一种实用的跨答案格式一致性选择方法，提供良好校准的置信度估计，在两种答案格式上都保持低预期校准误差

Abstract: Probabilistic decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs) often yields
inconsistent outputs, particularly on complex or long-form questions.
Self-Consistency (SC) mitigates this for short-form QA by majority voting over
exact strings, whereas Universal Self-Consistency (USC) and Weighted Unigram
Consistency Score (WUCS) extend to long-form responses but lose accuracy on
short-form benchmarks.
  We introduce Latent Self-Consistency (LSC), which selects the most
semantically consistent response using learnable token embeddings. A
lightweight forward generation of summary tokens increases inference time by
less than 1% and requires no changes to the model architecture.
  Across 6 short-form and 5 long-form reasoning benchmarks (e.g., MATH, MMLU,
TruthfulQA), LSC surpasses SC, USC and WUCS on all short-form and long-form
ones on average, while maintaining negligible computational overhead. These
results position LSC as a practical consistency-selection method that works
reliably across answer formats. Additionally, LSC provides well-calibrated
confidence estimates, maintaining low Expected Calibration Error across both
answer formats.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战当前AI研究中通过OOD数据集评估模型泛化能力的假设，认为这种评估可能无法真实反映实际部署中的失败模式。

Method: 将OOD评估结果与现有QA模型中记录的具体失败模式（依赖虚假特征或预测捷径）进行对比分析。

Result: 发现不同OOD数据集对模型抗捷径能力的评估质量参差不齐，部分数据集表现甚至不如简单的分布内评估。虚假捷径在ID和OOD数据集间存在共享。

Conclusion: 指出了常用OOD泛化评估的局限性，为QA及其他领域提供了更稳健的泛化评估方法和建议。

Abstract: A majority of recent work in AI assesses models' generalization capabilities
through the lens of performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. Despite
their practicality, such evaluations build upon a strong assumption: that OOD
evaluations can capture and reflect upon possible failures in a real-world
deployment.
  In this work, we challenge this assumption and confront the results obtained
from OOD evaluations with a set of specific failure modes documented in
existing question-answering (QA) models, referred to as a reliance on spurious
features or prediction shortcuts.
  We find that different datasets used for OOD evaluations in QA provide an
estimate of models' robustness to shortcuts that have a vastly different
quality, some largely under-performing even a simple, in-distribution
evaluation. We partially attribute this to the observation that spurious
shortcuts are shared across ID+OOD datasets, but also find cases where a
dataset's quality for training and evaluation is largely disconnected. Our work
underlines limitations of commonly-used OOD-based evaluations of
generalization, and provides methodology and recommendations for evaluating
generalization within and beyond QA more robustly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型语义理解能力的提升，它们更加符合人类价值观，但以透明性为代价。需要深入理解LLM的内部工作机制来提供可解释的重排序理由，尤其在新系统中面临训练数据不足的挑战。

Method: 使用环境和地球科学领域的相对小型排序数据集，分析不同训练方法下LLM在重排序任务中的表现，并研究其生成的可解释信息。

Result: 研究发现某些训练方法比其他方法具有更好的可解释性，表明不是所有训练方法都能学习到准确的语义理解，而是获得了抽象知识来优化评估。

Conclusion: 这个研究强调了选择合适训练方法的重要性，以确保LLM在重排序任务中能够生成具有意义的解释性推理，提高模型的可靠性和透明度。

Abstract: With the improving semantic understanding capability of Large Language Models
(LLMs), they exhibit a greater awareness and alignment with human values, but
this comes at the cost of transparency. Although promising results are achieved
via experimental analysis, an in-depth understanding of the LLM's internal
workings is unavoidable to comprehend the reasoning behind the re-ranking,
which provides end users with an explanation that enables them to make an
informed decision. Moreover, in newly developed systems with limited user
engagement and insufficient ranking data, accurately re-ranking content remains
a significant challenge. While various training methods affect the training of
LLMs and generate inference, our analysis has found that some training methods
exhibit better explainability than others, implying that an accurate semantic
understanding has not been learned through all training methods; instead,
abstract knowledge has been gained to optimize evaluation, which raises
questions about the true reliability of LLMs. Therefore, in this work, we
analyze how different training methods affect the semantic understanding of the
re-ranking task in LLMs and investigate whether these models can generate more
informed textual reasoning to overcome the challenges of transparency or LLMs
and limited training data. To analyze the LLMs for re-ranking tasks, we utilize
a relatively small ranking dataset from the environment and the Earth science
domain to re-rank retrieved content. Furthermore, we also analyze the
explainable information to see if the re-ranking can be reasoned using
explainability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 波兰语语法性别系统存在历史性男性偏见，大语言模型训练后会继承和强化这种偏见，导致性别不平衡的输出。

Method: 使用IPIS数据集（人工制作的性别包容性校对和翻译指令）微调多语言和波兰语专用LLMs，设计包含明确性别包容性指南的系统提示。

Result: 成功对Llama-8B、Mistral-7B、Mistral-Nemo等多语言模型以及Bielik、PLLuM等波兰语专用模型进行了IPIS微调。

Conclusion: 该方法为减轻波兰语生成中的性别偏见提供了系统性解决方案，使性别包容性成为模型的内在特征。

Abstract: Imagine a language with masculine, feminine, and neuter grammatical genders,
yet, due to historical and political conventions, masculine forms are
predominantly used to refer to men, women and mixed-gender groups. This is the
reality of contemporary Polish. A social consequence of this unfair linguistic
system is that large language models (LLMs) trained on Polish texts inherit and
reinforce this masculine bias, generating gender-imbalanced outputs. This study
addresses this issue by tuning LLMs using the IPIS dataset, a collection of
human-crafted gender-inclusive proofreading in Polish and Polish-to-English
translation instructions. Grounded in a theoretical linguistic framework, we
design a system prompt with explicit gender-inclusive guidelines for Polish. In
our experiments, we IPIS-tune multilingual LLMs (Llama-8B, Mistral-7B and
Mistral-Nemo) and Polish-specific LLMs (Bielik and PLLuM). Our approach aims to
integrate gender inclusivity as an inherent feature of these models, offering a
systematic solution to mitigate gender bias in Polish language generation.

Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLMs)虽然强大，但容易产生幻觉，即生成看似自信但实际上错误或无意义的回答。需要一种有效的方法来检测这些幻觉。

Method: 将幻觉检测问题形式化为假设检验问题，借鉴多重检验的思想，提出了一种新的检测方法，并与机器学习中的分布外检测问题进行类比。

Conclusion: 提出的多重检验启发式方法能够有效检测LLM产生的幻觉，为解决LLM可靠性问题提供了新的思路。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful foundational
models to solve a variety of tasks, they have also been shown to be prone to
hallucinations, i.e., generating responses that sound confident but are
actually incorrect or even nonsensical. In this work, we formulate the problem
of detecting hallucinations as a hypothesis testing problem and draw parallels
to the problem of out-of-distribution detection in machine learning models. We
propose a multiple-testing-inspired method to solve the hallucination detection
problem, and provide extensive experimental results to validate the robustness
of our approach against state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 通过给自动评价指标提供多个翻译版本或相似源文本的上下文信息，COMET-polycand和COMET-polyic指标显著提升了与人类评分的相关性，最高可提升0.118的Kendall's tau-b相关系数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动评价指标仅考虑单个翻译结果，而人类评测通常在多个翻译版本的上下文中进行对比评判，这种设置差异影响了自动指标的性能。

Method: 提出两种新方法：COMET-polycand利用同源文本的其他翻译版本进行对比评估；COMET-polyic受检索基于上下文学习的启发，通过相似源文本的翻译和人工评分来指导评估。

Result: 在第一个方法中，添加一个额外翻译版本可将Kendall's tau-b相关系数从0.079提升至0.118，添加更多版本进一步提升。第二个方法也得到类似收益，相关系数提升至0.116。

Conclusion: 通过为自动评价指标提供更多上下文信息（多翻译版本或相似源文本的翻译），可以显著提升评估与人类判断的一致性，体现了多元信息在评估中的重要性。

Abstract: Automated metrics for machine translation attempt to replicate human
judgment. Unlike humans, who often assess a translation in the context of
multiple alternatives, these metrics typically consider only the source
sentence and a single translation. This discrepancy in the evaluation setup may
negatively impact the performance of automated metrics. We propose two
automated metrics that incorporate additional information beyond the single
translation. COMET-polycand uses alternative translations of the same source
sentence to compare and contrast with the translation at hand, thereby
providing a more informed assessment of its quality. COMET-polyic, inspired by
retrieval-based in-context learning, takes in translations of similar source
texts along with their human-labeled quality scores to guide the evaluation. We
find that including a single additional translation in COMET-polycand improves
the segment-level metric performance (0.079 to 0.118 Kendall's tau-b
correlation), with further gains when more translations are added.
Incorporating retrieved examples in COMET-polyic yields similar improvements
(0.079 to 0.116 Kendall's tau-b correlation). We release our models publicly.

Motivation: 视觉隐喻生成需要同时理解语言含义和保持视觉一致性，现有方法在隐喻对齐方面遇到挑战。

Method: 提出两种方法：训练免费流水线（显式S-T-M提示分解）和训练基方法（使用自我评估奖励改善对齐），结合新提出的隐喻分解分数和含义对齐指标。

Result: 训练免费方法在测试集上超越GPT-4o和Imagen，在分解、CLIP和含义对齐指标上表现更优。用户研究显示用户更偏好GPT-4o，但开源方法在抽象隐喻上超过Imagen。

Conclusion: 结构化提示和轻量级RL能在计算资源有限的情况下有效实现隐喻对齐，与人类偏好的差距主要来自美学质量和采样设置。

Abstract: Visual metaphor generation is a challenging task that aims to generate an
image given an input text metaphor. Inherently, it needs language understanding
to bind a source concept with a target concept, in a way that preserves meaning
while ensuring visual coherence. We propose a self-evaluating visual metaphor
generation framework that focuses on metaphor alignment. Our self-evaluation
approach combines existing metrics with our newly proposed metaphor
decomposition score and a meaning alignment (MA) metric. Within this setup, we
explore two novel approaches: a training-free pipeline that explicitly
decomposes prompts into source-target-meaning (S-T-M) mapping for image
synthesis, and a complementary training-based pipeline that improves alignment
using our proposed self-evaluation reward schema, without any large-scale
retraining. On the held-out test set, the training-free approach surpasses
strong closed baselines (GPT-4o, Imagen) on decomposition, CLIP, and MA scores,
with the training-based approach close behind. We evaluate our framework output
using a user-facing study, and observed that participants preferred GPT-4o
overall, while our training-free pipeline led open-source methods and edged
Imagen on abstract metaphors. Our analyses show S-T-M prompting helps longer or
more abstract metaphors, with closed models excelling on short, concrete cases;
we also observe sensitivity to sampler settings. Overall, structured prompting
and lightweight RL perform metaphor alignment well under modest compute, and
remaining gaps to human preference appear driven by aesthetics and sampling.

Motivation: 探讨大语言模型的本质——是模拟人类语言能力还是仅仅对训练语料进行建模，旨在澄清对LLM能力的误解

Method: 通过分析transformer架构的计算格式限制（线性处理vs人类超线性计算），结合Liu等人关于shortcut automata的理论来阐述LLM的工作原理

Result: 论证表明LLM并非模拟人类认知，而是学会了以不同方式使用语言这一"话语机器"技术

Conclusion: 虽然LLM不是人类认知的模型，但这并非贬低其价值——语言不仅是内在状态的表达工具，更是一种能在适当语境下生成新语言的"话语机器"

Abstract: What do large language models actually model? Do they tell us something about
human capacities, or are they models of the corpus we've trained them on? I
give a non-deflationary defence of the latter position. Cognitive science tells
us that linguistic capabilities in humans rely supralinear formats for
computation. The transformer architecture, by contrast, supports at best a
linear formats for processing. This argument will rely primarily on certain
invariants of the computational architecture of transformers. I then suggest a
positive story about what transformers are doing, focusing on Liu et al.
(2022)'s intriguing speculations about shortcut automata. I conclude with why I
don't think this is a terribly deflationary story. Language is not (just) a
means for expressing inner state but also a kind of 'discourse machine' that
lets us make new language given appropriate context. We have learned to use
this technology in one way; LLMs have also learned to use it too, but via very
different means.

Abstract: Translating electronic health record (EHR) narratives from English to Spanish

parallel-aligned corpus and the abundant unknown words contained. To address
such challenges, we propose \textbf{NOOV} (for No OOV), a new neural machine
translation (NMT) system that requires little in-domain parallel-aligned corpus
for training. NOOV integrates a bilingual lexicon automatically learned from
parallel-aligned corpora and a phrase look-up table extracted from a large
biomedical knowledge resource, to alleviate both the unknown word problem and
the word-repeat challenge in NMT, enhancing better phrase generation of NMT
systems. Evaluation shows that NOOV is able to generate better translation of
EHR with improvement in both accuracy and fluency.

Motivation: 虽然后训练量化是大语言模型部署的实用压缩方案，但对量化如何准确影响各种LLM知识能力的理解仍不充分，现有缩放律常忽略量化特定参数和任务特定敏感性。

Method: 进行广泛的实证研究，建立任务分层缩放律。将LLM知识解构为记忆和利用能力，开发包含模型大小、有效位宽、校准集大小和组大小的统一量化框架。

Result: 核心发现知识记忆能力在有效位宽、校准集大小和模型大小变化方面比知识利用能力显示出明显更大的敏感性，而知识利用能力更加稳健。

Conclusion: 这些发现提供了对后训练量化影响的细粒度理解，为开发能更好保留目标认知功能的知识感知量化策略提供了指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present significant deployment challenges due to
their scale, with post-training quantization (PTQ) emerging as a practical
compression solution. However, a comprehensive understanding of how PTQ
precisely impacts diverse LLM knowledge capabilities remains elusive, and
existing scaling laws for quantized models often overlook crucial PTQ-specific
parameters and task-specific sensitivities. This paper addresses these gaps by
conducting an extensive empirical investigation to establish task-stratified
scaling laws. We disentangle LLM knowledge into memorization and utilization
capabilities and develop a unified quantitative framework that incorporates
model size, effective bit-width, calibration set size, and group size. Our
central finding reveals that knowledge memorization exhibits markedly greater
sensitivity to variations in effective bit-width, calibration set size, and
model size compared to the more robust knowledge utilization. These findings
offer a fine-grained understanding of PTQ's impact and provide guidance for
developing knowledge-aware quantization strategies that can better preserve
targeted cognitive functions.

Motivation: LLM在复杂推理任务中表现不佳，主要原因是训练数据缺乏人类思考过程中的关键洞察和中间意图表达

Method: 提出Thinking Before You Speak框架，在推理步骤间插入主动生成的insight来指导后续推理，并设计自动收集和过滤示例的pipeline

Result: 在具有挑战性的数学数据集上的实验验证了TBYS的有效性

Conclusion: 通过主动生成insight来模拟人类思考过程，可以有效提升LLM的复杂推理能力

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit deficiencies with complex
reasoning tasks, such as maths, which we attribute to the discrepancy between
human reasoning patterns and those presented in the LLMs' training data. When
dealing with complex problems, humans tend to think carefully before expressing
solutions. However, they often do not articulate their inner thoughts,
including their intentions and chosen methodologies. Consequently, critical
insights essential for bridging reasoning steps may be absent in training data
collected from human sources. To bridge this gap, we proposes inserting
\emph{insight}s between consecutive reasoning steps, which review the status
and initiate the next reasoning steps. Unlike prior prompting strategies that
rely on a single or a workflow of static prompts to facilitate reasoning,
\emph{insight}s are \emph{proactively} generated to guide reasoning processes.
We implement our idea as a reasoning framework, named \emph{Thinking Before You
Speak} (TBYS), and design a pipeline for automatically collecting and filtering
in-context examples for the generation of \emph{insight}s, which alleviates
human labeling efforts and fine-tuning overheads. Experiments on challenging
mathematical datasets verify the effectiveness of TBYS. Project website:

Motivation: 当前大语言模型在整合外部知识时难以同时保持忠实性和表达性，要么缺乏知识支持而损害忠实性，要么过于冗长而牺牲表达性。

Method: 提出协作解码(CoDe)框架，基于分布散度和模型置信度动态整合有无外部知识的输出概率，并引入知识感知重排序机制防止过度依赖参数知识。

Conclusion: CoDe是一种即插即用的有效方法，能够帮助大语言模型更好地平衡知识整合的忠实性和表达性，为解决幻觉问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Grounding responses in external knowledge represents an effective strategy
for mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current
LLMs struggle to seamlessly integrate knowledge while simultaneously
maintaining faithfulness (or fidelity) and expressiveness, capabilities that
humans naturally possess. This limitation results in outputs that either lack
support from external knowledge, thereby compromising faithfulness, or appear
overly verbose and unnatural, thus sacrificing expressiveness. In this work, to
break the trade-off between faithfulness and expressiveness, we propose
Collaborative Decoding (CoDe), a novel approach that dynamically integrates
output probabilities generated with and without external knowledge. This
integration is guided by distribution divergence and model confidence, enabling
the selective activation of relevant and reliable expressions from the model's
internal parameters. Furthermore, we introduce a knowledge-aware reranking
mechanism that prevents over-reliance on prior parametric knowledge while
ensuring proper utilization of provided external information. Through
comprehensive experiments, our plug-and-play CoDe framework demonstrates
superior performance in enhancing faithfulness without compromising
expressiveness across diverse LLMs and evaluation metrics, validating both its
effectiveness and generalizability.

TL;DR: Emotion Omni是一个创新的语音大语言模型架构，能够理解用户语音中的情感内容并生成共情语音响应，通过基于开源TTS框架的数据生成管道构建20万情感对话数据集，解决了传统方法需要海量数据和计算资源的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音LLM大多只简单转换回复内容为语音，未能充分理解用户查询中丰富的情感和副语言线索。相同句子因情感表达不同而含义各异，情感理解对提升人机交互体验至关重要。传统共情语音LLM需要大规模数据集训练，耗费大量数据和计算资源。

Method: 提出Emotion Omni模型架构，设计基于开源TTS框架的数据生成管道，构建了20万情感对话数据集，支持构建共情语音助手。

Result: 开发了能够理解用户语音情感内容并生成共情语音响应的模型，建立了大规模情感对话数据集，实现了在有限数据下无需大规模训练即可生成共情响应的目标。

Conclusion: Emotion Omni为解决语音LLM情感理解问题提供了有效方案，通过创新的架构设计和数据生成方法，实现了在资源受限条件下构建共情语音助手的能力。

Abstract: With the development of speech large language models (speech LLMs), users can
now interact directly with assistants via speech. However, most existing models
simply convert the response content into speech without fully understanding the
rich emotional and paralinguistic cues embedded in the user's query. In many
cases, the same sentence can have different meanings depending on the emotional
expression. Furthermore, emotional understanding is essential for improving
user experience in human-machine interaction. Currently, most speech LLMs with
empathetic capabilities are trained on massive datasets. This approach requires
vast amounts of data and significant computational resources. Therefore, a key
challenge lies in how to develop a speech LLM capable of generating empathetic
responses with limited data and without the need for large-scale training. To
address this challenge, we propose Emotion Omni, a novel model architecture
designed to understand the emotional content of user speech input and generate
empathetic speech responses. Additionally, we developed a data generation
pipeline based on an open-source TTS framework to construct a 200k emotional
dialogue dataset, which supports the construction of an empathetic speech
assistant. The demos are available at https://w311411.github.io/omni_demo/

TL;DR: 提出基于难度平衡采样策略的MCoT提示框架，通过联合分析模型感知难度和样本固有复杂度来优化提示选择，显著提升多模态推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MCoT提示使用随机或手动选择的示例，未能考虑模型特定知识分布和任务内在复杂度，导致性能次优且不稳定。

Method: 将提示选择重构为提示课程设计问题，整合模型感知难度（通过主动学习中的预测分歧量化）和样本固有复杂度，开发难度平衡采样策略。

Result: 在五个挑战性基准和多个流行MLLM上的实验表明，该方法带来显著且一致的改进，大幅减少随机采样导致的性能差异。

Conclusion: 该方法为增强多模态推理提供了原则性和鲁棒性的方法，通过难度平衡的提示课程设计有效提升模型性能。

Abstract: The effectiveness of Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) prompting is often
limited by the use of randomly or manually selected examples. These examples
fail to account for both model-specific knowledge distributions and the
intrinsic complexity of the tasks, resulting in suboptimal and unstable model
performance. To address this, we propose a novel framework inspired by the
pedagogical principle of "tailored teaching with balanced difficulty". We
reframe prompt selection as a prompt curriculum design problem: constructing a
well ordered set of training examples that align with the model's current
capabilities. Our approach integrates two complementary signals: (1)
model-perceived difficulty, quantified through prediction disagreement in an
active learning setup, capturing what the model itself finds challenging; and
(2) intrinsic sample complexity, which measures the inherent difficulty of each
question-image pair independently of any model. By jointly analyzing these
signals, we develop a difficulty-balanced sampling strategy that ensures the
selected prompt examples are diverse across both dimensions. Extensive
experiments conducted on five challenging benchmarks and multiple popular
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate that our method yields
substantial and consistent improvements and greatly reduces performance
discrepancies caused by random sampling, providing a principled and robust
approach for enhancing multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: 当前医学视觉语言模型在医学视觉问答中存在答案不一致性问题，面对语义相同但表述不同的医学问题时答案波动显著。研究构建了RoMed数据集并提出了CCL方法，显著提升了模型的一致性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险的医疗应用中，确保模型对不同表述的医学问题给出一致答案至关重要。研究发现当前Med-VLMs在面对语义等效的医学问题重述时表现出令人担忧的脆弱性，答案波动显著。

Method: 构建了包含14.4万个问题的RoMed数据集，涵盖词汇级、句子级和语义级扰动。提出了CCL方法，包含两个关键组件：知识锚定一致性学习和偏差感知对比学习。

Result: 在RoMed测试集上评估SOTA模型如LLaVA-Med时，观察到性能显著下降（如召回率下降40%）。CCL方法在三个流行VQA基准测试中达到SOTA性能，并将答案一致性提高了50%。

Conclusion: CCL方法通过整合医学知识一致性和偏差感知对比学习，显著提升了医学视觉语言模型的鲁棒性和答案一致性，解决了医学VQA中的关键鲁棒性差距。

Abstract: In high-stakes medical applications, consistent answering across diverse
question phrasings is essential for reliable diagnosis. However, we reveal that
current Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs) exhibit concerning fragility
in Medical Visual Question Answering, as their answers fluctuate significantly
when faced with semantically equivalent rephrasings of medical questions. We
attribute this to two limitations: (1) insufficient alignment of medical
concepts, leading to divergent reasoning patterns, and (2) hidden biases in
training data that prioritize syntactic shortcuts over semantic understanding.
To address these challenges, we construct RoMed, a dataset built upon original
VQA datasets containing 144k questions with variations spanning word-level,
sentence-level, and semantic-level perturbations. When evaluating
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models like LLaVA-Med on RoMed, we observe alarming
performance drops (e.g., a 40\% decline in Recall) compared to original VQA
benchmarks, exposing critical robustness gaps. To bridge this gap, we propose
Consistency and Contrastive Learning (CCL), which integrates two key
components: (1) knowledge-anchored consistency learning, aligning Med-VLMs with
medical knowledge rather than shallow feature patterns, and (2) bias-aware
contrastive learning, mitigating data-specific priors through discriminative
representation refinement. CCL achieves SOTA performance on three popular VQA
benchmarks and notably improves answer consistency by 50\% on the challenging
RoMed test set, demonstrating significantly enhanced robustness. Code will be
released.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了Attention2Probability方法，通过分析语音与术语的跨注意力来估算术语出现概率，提高了语音大语言模型在领域术语识别的准确性。方法轻量、灵活且延迟仅8.71ms，在中英文术辫回率分别达到92.57%和86.83%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音大语言模型在一般领域表现优异，但在领域特定术语或新词生成上仍面临挑战。需要一种轻量、灵活且准确的方法来提高语音到文本系统的术辫准确性。

Method: 提出Attention2Probability方法：1）将语音与术辫之间的跨注意力权重转换为存在概率 2）采用课程学习来提升检索准确性 3）构建并开源了包含术辫的语音数据集

Result: 在测试集上显著超过VectorDB方法：中文最高回率92.57%，英文86.83%，每次查询延迟仅8.71ms。使用Attention2Probability检索的术辫帮助SLM识别任务，术辫准确性提高6-17%。

Conclusion: Attention2Probability是一种高效的语音术辫检索方法，显著提升了语音大模型的领域术辫处理能力，同时也曝露了当前SLM在术辫利用方面的限制。新构建的数据集为该领域研究提供了支持。

Abstract: Recent advances in speech large language models (SLMs) have improved speech
recognition and translation in general domains, but accurately generating
domain-specific terms or neologisms remains challenging. To address this, we
propose Attention2Probability: attention-driven terminology probability
estimation for robust speech-to-text system, which is lightweight, flexible,
and accurate. Attention2Probability converts cross-attention weights between
speech and terminology into presence probabilities, and it further employs
curriculum learning to enhance retrieval accuracy. Furthermore, to tackle the
lack of data for speech-to-text tasks with terminology intervention, we create
and release a new speech dataset with terminology to support future research in
this area. Experimental results show that Attention2Probability significantly
outperforms the VectorDB method on our test set. Specifically, its maximum
recall rates reach 92.57% for Chinese and 86.83% for English. This high recall
is achieved with a latency of only 8.71ms per query. Intervening in SLMs'
recognition and translation tasks using Attention2Probability-retrieved terms
improves terminology accuracy by 6-17%, while revealing that the current
utilization of terminology by SLMs has limitations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在多语言谜语生成中重复使用记忆谜语或进行浅层改写的问题，需要在文化流畅性和创造性抽象之间取得平衡

Method: 自适应原创性过滤(AOF)框架，使用基于余弦相似度的拒绝机制过滤冗余生成，同时强制词汇新颖性和跨语言保真度

Result: 在三个LLM和四个语言对上的评估显示，AOF增强的GPT-4o在日语中达到0.177 Self-BLEU和0.915 Distinct-2，表明词汇多样性提高且冗余减少

Conclusion: 语义拒绝机制可以在无需任务特定微调的情况下指导文化基础扎实的创造性生成

Abstract: Multilingual riddle generation challenges large language models (LLMs) to
balance cultural fluency with creative abstraction. Standard prompting
strategies -- zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought -- tend to reuse memorized
riddles or perform shallow paraphrasing. We introduce Adaptive Originality
Filtering (AOF), a prompting framework that filters redundant generations using
cosine-based similarity rejection, while enforcing lexical novelty and
cross-lingual fidelity. Evaluated across three LLMs and four language pairs,
AOF-enhanced GPT-4o achieves \texttt{0.177} Self-BLEU and \texttt{0.915}
Distinct-2 in Japanese, signaling improved lexical diversity and reduced
redundancy compared to other prompting methods and language pairs. Our findings
show that semantic rejection can guide culturally grounded, creative generation
without task-specific fine-tuning.

Conclusion: EMMM框架成功解决了客户服务场景中机器生成文本检测的可解释性问题，为非专家用户提供了可信赖的AI检测解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in customer service
introduces new risks, as malicious actors can exploit them to conduct
large-scale user impersonation through machine-generated text (MGT). Current
MGT detection methods often struggle in online conversational settings,
reducing the reliability and interpretability essential for trustworthy AI
deployment. In customer service scenarios where operators are typically
non-expert users, explanation become crucial for trustworthy MGT detection. In
this paper, we propose EMMM, an explanation-then-detection framework that
balances latency, accuracy, and non-expert-oriented interpretability.
Experimental results demonstrate that EMMM provides explanations accessible to
non-expert users, with 70\% of human evaluators preferring its outputs, while
achieving competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models and
maintaining low latency, generating outputs within 1 second. Our code and

Motivation: 当前广告标题生成方法主要关注质量或点击率，忽视了多样性需求，导致输出同质化严重，无法满足不同受众群体的需求。

Method: 设计了语义和风格感知的数据生成管道自动创建高质量训练对，采用多阶段多目标优化框架，结合监督微调(SFT)和强化学习(RL)进行联合优化。

Result: 在真实工业数据集上验证了DIVER能有效平衡质量和多样性，部署到大规模内容分享平台后，广告主价值(ADVV)提升4.0%，点击率(CTR)提升1.4%。

Conclusion: DIVER框架成功解决了广告标题生成中质量与多样性的平衡问题，为大规模广告平台提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The generation of ad headlines plays a vital role in modern advertising,
where both quality and diversity are essential to engage a broad range of
audience segments. Current approaches primarily optimize language models for
headline quality or click-through rates (CTR), often overlooking the need for
diversity and resulting in homogeneous outputs. To address this limitation, we
propose DIVER, a novel framework based on large language models (LLMs) that are
jointly optimized for both diversity and quality. We first design a semantic-
and stylistic-aware data generation pipeline that automatically produces
high-quality training pairs with ad content and multiple diverse headlines. To
achieve the goal of generating high-quality and diversified ad headlines within
a single forward pass, we propose a multi-stage multi-objective optimization
framework with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL).
Experiments on real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that DIVER
effectively balances quality and diversity. Deployed on a large-scale
content-sharing platform serving hundreds of millions of users, our framework
improves advertiser value (ADVV) and CTR by 4.0% and 1.4%.

Conclusion: 该研究为多模态对话中情感因果提取领域提供了一个多样化的数据集咄一种有效的模型方法，通过显式建模上下文咄多级别信息融合显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Emotion Cause Triplet Extraction in Multimodal Conversations (MECTEC) has
recently gained significant attention in social media analysis, aiming to
extract emotion utterances, cause utterances, and emotion categories
simultaneously. However, the scarcity of related datasets, with only one
published dataset featuring highly uniform dialogue scenarios, hinders model
development in this field. To address this, we introduce MECAD, the first
multimodal, multi-scenario MECTEC dataset, comprising 989 conversations from 56
TV series spanning a wide range of dialogue contexts. In addition, existing
MECTEC methods fail to explicitly model emotional and causal contexts and
neglect the fusion of semantic information at different levels, leading to
performance degradation. In this paper, we propose M3HG, a novel model that
explicitly captures emotional and causal contexts and effectively fuses
contextual information at both inter- and intra-utterance levels via a
multimodal heterogeneous graph. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of M3HG compared with existing state-of-the-art methods. The
codes and dataset are available at https://github.com/redifinition/M3HG.

TL;DR: ChronoRAG是一个专门针对叙事文本的新型RAG框架，通过重构分散信息为连贯段落并显式保持时间顺序，在叙事QA任务中显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法在处理叙事文本时效果有限，因为叙事理解需要超越孤立片段，依赖更广泛的上下文和片段间的时序关系。

Method: 提出ChronoRAG框架，专注于两个关键方面：1)将分散的文档信息精炼为连贯的结构化段落；2)通过显式捕获和维护检索段落间的时间顺序来保持叙事流。

Result: 在NarrativeQA数据集上的实验表明，ChronoRAG在需要事实识别和复杂时序关系理解的任务中取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: 时序推理对于解决叙事问答任务至关重要，ChronoRAG通过专门处理叙事文本的时序特性，有效提升了RAG在长上下文叙事QA中的表现。

Abstract: Long-context question answering over narrative tasks is challenging because
correct answers often hinge on reconstructing a coherent timeline of events
while preserving contextual flow in a limited context window.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) indexing methods aim to address this
challenge by selectively retrieving only necessary document segments. However,
narrative texts possess unique characteristics that limit the effectiveness of
these existing approaches. Specifically, understanding narrative texts requires
more than isolated segments, as the broader context and sequential
relationships between segments are crucial for comprehension. To address these
limitations, we propose ChronoRAG, a novel RAG framework specialized for
narrative texts. This approach focuses on two essential aspects: refining
dispersed document information into coherent and structured passages, and
preserving narrative flow by explicitly capturing and maintaining the temporal
order among retrieved passages. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of
ChronoRAG through experiments on the NarrativeQA dataset, showing substantial
improvements in tasks requiring both factual identification and comprehension
of complex sequential relationships, underscoring that reasoning over temporal
order is crucial in resolving narrative QA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然具备强大的推理能力，但计算成本控制仍是实际部署的重大挑战。开源社区缺乏类似GPT系列的可控推理能力实现方案。

Method: 采用端到端训练范式：预算模式监督微调将可控推理能力嵌入学习过程，以及两阶段预算感知强化学习配合自适应奖励塑造。

Result: 实现了三种推理模式：High模式（全能力）、Medium模式（50% token减少，性能下降<10%）、Low模式（75% token减少，性能下降<15%）。

Conclusion: ThinkDial成功实现了目标压缩-性能权衡，在分布外任务上也表现出强泛化能力，为开源可控推理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought reasoning have
demonstrated remarkable problem-solving capabilities, but controlling their
computational effort remains a significant challenge for practical deployment.
Recent proprietary systems like OpenAI's gpt-oss series have introduced
discrete operational modes for intuitive reasoning control, but the open-source
community has largely failed to achieve such capabilities. In this paper, we
introduce ThinkDial, the first open-recipe end-to-end framework that
successfully implements gpt-oss-style controllable reasoning through discrete
operational modes. Our system enables seamless switching between three distinct
reasoning regimes: High mode (full reasoning capability), Medium mode (50
percent token reduction with <10 percent performance degradation), and Low mode
(75 percent token reduction with <15 percent performance degradation). We
achieve this through an end-to-end training paradigm that integrates
budget-mode control throughout the entire pipeline: budget-mode supervised
fine-tuning that embeds controllable reasoning capabilities directly into the
learning process, and two-phase budget-aware reinforcement learning with
adaptive reward shaping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ThinkDial
achieves target compression-performance trade-offs with clear response length
reductions while maintaining performance thresholds. The framework also
exhibits strong generalization capabilities on out-of-distribution tasks.

Abstract: Grammatical error correction is a significant task in NLP. Traditional
methods based on encoder-decoder models have achieved certain success, but the
application of LLMs in this field is still underexplored. Current research
predominantly relies on supervised fine-tuning to train LLMs to directly
generate the corrected sentence, which limits the model's powerful reasoning
ability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework based on
Rule-Based RL. Through experiments on the Chinese datasets, our Rule-Based RL
framework achieves \textbf{state-of-the-art }performance, with a notable
increase in \textbf{recall}. This result clearly highlights the advantages of
using RL to steer LLMs, offering a more controllable and reliable paradigm for
future development in GEC.

Abstract: Conversational analytics has been on the forefront of transformation driven
by the advances in Speech and Natural Language Processing techniques. Rapid
adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the analytics field has taken the
problems that can be automated to a new level of complexity and scale. In this
paper, we introduce Theme Detection as a critical task in conversational
analytics, aimed at automatically identifying and categorizing topics within
conversations. This process can significantly reduce the manual effort involved
in analyzing expansive dialogs, particularly in domains like customer support
or sales. Unlike traditional dialog intent detection, which often relies on a
fixed set of intents for downstream system logic, themes are intended as a
direct, user-facing summary of the conversation's core inquiry. This
distinction allows for greater flexibility in theme surface forms and
user-specific customizations. We pose Controllable Conversational Theme
Detection problem as a public competition track at Dialog System Technology
Challenge (DSTC) 12 -- it is framed as joint clustering and theme labeling of
dialog utterances, with the distinctive aspect being controllability of the
resulting theme clusters' granularity achieved via the provided user preference
data. We give an overview of the problem, the associated dataset and the
evaluation metrics, both automatic and human. Finally, we discuss the
participant teams' submissions and provide insights from those. The track
materials (data and code) are openly available in the GitHub repository.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of modern machine translation (MT) systems on
general-domain texts, translating structured LaTeX-formatted documents remains
a significant challenge. These documents typically interleave natural language
with domain-specific syntax, such as mathematical equations, tables, figures,
and cross-references, all of which must be accurately preserved to maintain
semantic integrity and compilability. In this paper, we introduce LaTeXTrans, a
collaborative multi-agent system designed to address this challenge. LaTeXTrans
ensures format preservation, structural fidelity, and terminology consistency
through six specialized agents: 1) a Parser that decomposes LaTeX into
translation-friendly units via placeholder substitution and syntax filtering;
2) a Translator, Validator, Summarizer, and Terminology Extractor that work
collaboratively to ensure context-aware, self-correcting, and
terminology-consistent translations; 3) a Generator that reconstructs the
translated content into well-structured LaTeX documents. Experimental results
demonstrate that LaTeXTrans can outperform mainstream MT systems in both
translation accuracy and structural fidelity, offering an effective and
practical solution for translating LaTeX-formatted documents.

Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation in the digital age has led to significant
societal challenges. Existing approaches often struggle with capturing
long-range dependencies, complex semantic relations, and the social dynamics
influencing news dissemination. Furthermore, these methods require extensive
labelled datasets, making their deployment resource-intensive. In this study,
we propose a novel self-supervised misinformation detection framework that
integrates both complex semantic relations using Abstract Meaning
Representation (AMR) and news propagation dynamics. We introduce an LLM-based
graph contrastive loss (LGCL) that utilizes negative anchor points generated by
a Large Language Model (LLM) to enhance feature separability in a zero-shot
manner. To incorporate social context, we employ a multi view graph masked
autoencoder, which learns news propagation features from social context graph.
By combining these semantic and propagation-based features, our approach
effectively differentiates between fake and real news in a self-supervised
manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our self-supervised framework
achieves superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art methodologies,

Motivation: 传统方法在生成高质量数学训练数据时面临可扩展性、成本和数据可靠性等关键挑战，需要一种系统性的解决方案。

Method: 使用程序辅助合成框架，整合数学知识系统和领域特定工具创建可执行程序，通过双边验证机制确保解决方案正确性和程序-问题一致性。

Conclusion: 该合成方法有效解决了数学训练数据生成的关键挑战，显著提升了语言模型的数学推理能力。

Abstract: Enhancing the mathematical reasoning of large language models (LLMs) demands
high-quality training data, yet conventional methods face critical challenges
in scalability, cost, and data reliability. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel program-assisted synthesis framework that systematically
generates a high-quality mathematical corpus with guaranteed diversity,
complexity, and correctness. This framework integrates mathematical knowledge
systems and domain-specific tools to create executable programs. These programs
are then translated into natural language problem-solution pairs and vetted by
a bilateral validation mechanism that verifies solution correctness against
program outputs and ensures program-problem consistency. We have generated 12.3
million such problem-solving triples. Experiments demonstrate that models
fine-tuned on our data significantly improve their inference capabilities,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets and
showcasing the effectiveness of our synthesis approach.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ConfTuner是一种新的微调方法，通过tokenized Brier score损失函数来校准大语言模型的置信度表达，无需真实置信度标签，能有效解决LLM过度自信问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在科学、法律、医疗等高风险领域部署时经常表现出过度自信，生成错误答案但表达高置信度，这影响了模型的可靠性和可信度。现有方法效果有限且泛化性不足。

Method: 提出ConfTuner方法，使用基于proper scoring rules理论的新损失函数tokenized Brier score进行微调，该方法不需要真实置信度分数或代理置信度估计，计算开销小。

Result: ConfTuner在多种推理任务上显著改善了校准效果，并能泛化到GPT-4o等黑盒模型。更好的校准置信度带来了自我修正和模型级联等下游任务的性能提升。

Conclusion: ConfTuner通过理论保证的proper scoring rule有效校准LLM的置信度表达，推动了可信LLM系统的发展，代码已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains
such as science, law, and healthcare, where accurate expressions of uncertainty
are essential for reliability and trust. However, current LLMs are often
observed to generate incorrect answers with high confidence, a phenomenon known
as "overconfidence". Recent efforts have focused on calibrating LLMs'
verbalized confidence: i.e., their expressions of confidence in text form, such
as "I am 80% confident that...". Existing approaches either rely on prompt
engineering or fine-tuning with heuristically generated uncertainty estimates,
both of which have limited effectiveness and generalizability. Motivated by the
notion of proper scoring rules for calibration in classical machine learning
models, we introduce ConfTuner, a simple and efficient fine-tuning method that
introduces minimal overhead and does not require ground-truth confidence scores
or proxy confidence estimates. ConfTuner relies on a new loss function,
tokenized Brier score, which we theoretically prove to be a proper scoring
rule, intuitively meaning that it "correctly incentivizes the model to report
its true probability of being correct". ConfTuner improves calibration across
diverse reasoning tasks and generalizes to black-box models such as GPT-4o. Our
results further show that better-calibrated confidence enables downstream gains
in self-correction and model cascade, advancing the development of trustworthy
LLM systems. The code is available at

Motivation: 随着大语言模型的快速发展，自动选择优化提示的需求日益增长，需要更精确和全面的搜索方法来找到最优提示

Method: 基于进化算法的反射进化方法，在交叉和精英变异前进行短期和长期反射操作，积累进化过程中的知识并在每个epoch更新

Result: 在33个分类和文本生成数据集上测试，使用t-lite-instruct-0.1和gemma3-27b-it模型，相比最先进方法平均提升28%（在BBH数据集上）

Conclusion: ReflectivePrompt成为进化算法基础自动提示中最有效的解决方案之一，通过反射机制显著提升了提示优化的效果

Abstract: Autoprompting is the process of automatically selecting optimized prompts for
language models, which has been gaining popularity with the rapid advancement
of prompt engineering, driven by extensive research in the field of large
language models (LLMs). This paper presents ReflectivePrompt - a novel
autoprompting method based on evolutionary algorithms that employs a reflective
evolution approach for more precise and comprehensive search of optimal
prompts. ReflectivePrompt utilizes short-term and long-term reflection
operations before crossover and elitist mutation to enhance the quality of the
modifications they introduce. This method allows for the accumulation of
knowledge obtained throughout the evolution process and updates it at each
epoch based on the current population. ReflectivePrompt was tested on 33
datasets for classification and text generation tasks using open-access large
language models: t-lite-instruct-0.1 and gemma3-27b-it. The method
demonstrates, on average, a significant improvement (e.g., 28% on BBH compared
to EvoPrompt) in metrics relative to current state-of-the-art approaches,
thereby establishing itself as one of the most effective solutions in
evolutionary algorithm-based autoprompting.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种LLM辅助内容分析(LACA)方法，用于处理计算教育研究中的大量文本数据，提高研究的可推广性和严谨性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算教育研究者缺乏资源进行大规模严谨研究，需要能够处理大量定性数据而不增加研究负担的方法

Method: 结合内容分析和大型语言模型的LACA方法，使用计算教育数据集展示其可重复和严谨的应用

Result: 该方法能够赋能研究者进行更大规模的研究，产生更可推广的发现

Conclusion: LACA方法及其类似方法的发展有助于提升计算教育研究领域的实践和研究质量

Abstract: Computing education research (CER) is often instigated by practitioners
wanting to improve both their own and the wider discipline's teaching practice.
However, the latter is often difficult as many researchers lack the colleagues,
resources, or capacity to conduct research that is generalisable or rigorous
enough to advance the discipline. As a result, research methods that enable
sense-making with larger volumes of qualitative data, while not increasing the
burden on the researcher, have significant potential within CER.
  In this discussion paper, we propose such a method for conducting rigorous
analysis on large volumes of textual data, namely a variation of LLM-assisted
content analysis (LACA). This method combines content analysis with the use of
large language models, empowering researchers to conduct larger-scale research
which they would otherwise not be able to perform. Using a computing education
dataset, we illustrate how LACA could be applied in a reproducible and rigorous
manner. We believe this method has potential in CER, enabling more
generalisable findings from a wider range of research. This, together with the
development of similar methods, can help to advance both the practice and
research quality of the CER discipline.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究欧洲议会中的情感两极化现象，即政治对立组织之间的负面情绪和敌意增加的趋势

Method: 采用自动化自然语言处理技术，分析六个欧洲国家议会的议员演讲语料，通过比较对待对立组织与自身组织的语气洞性来识别情感两极化模式

Result: 在所有六个欧洲议会中都发现了一致的情感两极化现象；活跃度与负面情绪相关但与两极化程度无关；互息性是议员之间情感两极化的关键机制

Conclusion: 情感两极化是欧洲政治议会的普遍现象，互息性在这一现象中起着核心作用，为理解和应对政治两极化提供了重要见解

Abstract: Affective polarization, characterized by increased negativity and hostility
towards opposing groups, has become a prominent feature of political discourse
worldwide. Our study examines the presence of this type of polarization in a
selection of European parliaments in a fully automated manner. Utilizing a
comprehensive corpus of parliamentary speeches from the parliaments of six
European countries, we employ natural language processing techniques to
estimate parliamentarian sentiment. By comparing the levels of negativity
conveyed in references to individuals from opposing groups versus one's own, we
discover patterns of affectively polarized interactions. The findings
demonstrate the existence of consistent affective polarization across all six
European parliaments. Although activity correlates with negativity, there is no
observed difference in affective polarization between less active and more
active members of parliament. Finally, we show that reciprocity is a
contributing mechanism in affective polarization between parliamentarians
across all six parliaments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG系统评估主要集中在性能指标，而忽视了评估数据集的设计质量和隐私保护等实际约束，影响评估结果的意义和可靠性。

Method: 使用多代理框架：(1)多样性代理利用聚类技术实现主题覆盖和语义变化最大化 (2)隐私代理检测和隐蔽多域敏感信息 (3)QA维护代理合成合适的地真实QA对。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法生成的评估集在多样性方面超过基线方法，并在领域特定数据集上实现了稳健的隐私隐蔽效果。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一条实用且符合道德规范的途径，实现更安全、更全面的RAG系统评估，为未来人工智能规范和遵循标准的发展奠定基础。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems improve large language model
outputs by incorporating external knowledge, enabling more informed and
context-aware responses. However, the effectiveness and trustworthiness of
these systems critically depends on how they are evaluated, particularly on
whether the evaluation process captures real-world constraints like protecting
sensitive information. While current evaluation efforts for RAG systems have
primarily focused on the development of performance metrics, far less attention
has been given to the design and quality of the underlying evaluation datasets,
despite their pivotal role in enabling meaningful, reliable assessments. In
this work, we introduce a novel multi-agent framework for generating synthetic
QA datasets for RAG evaluation that prioritize semantic diversity and privacy
preservation. Our approach involves: (1) a Diversity agent leveraging
clustering techniques to maximize topical coverage and semantic variability,
(2) a Privacy Agent that detects and mask sensitive information across multiple
domains and (3) a QA curation agent that synthesizes private and diverse QA
pairs suitable as ground truth for RAG evaluation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our evaluation sets outperform baseline methods in diversity
and achieve robust privacy masking on domain-specific datasets. This work
offers a practical and ethically aligned pathway toward safer, more
comprehensive RAG system evaluation, laying the foundation for future
enhancements aligned with evolving AI regulations and compliance standards.

Motivation: 现有的事后解释方法存在局限性，需要将推理直接嵌入到模型表示中，实现真正的内在可解释性，同时保持神经模型的灵活性。

Method: 引入互补训练目标增强符号纯度和决策稀疏性，采用顺序专业化策略先建立广泛的符号能力再细化直觉判断，包含门控归纳机制指导选择性关注。

Result: 在AI任务上展示了具有竞争力的准确性，同时提供可验证的推理轨迹，证明AI母语可以作为神经网络模型中可解释性、直觉和符号推理的统一机制。

Conclusion: AI母语框架成功地将符号推理与神经表示相结合，为构建既强大又可解释的AI系统提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: We present a framework where neural models develop an AI Mother Tongue, a
native symbolic language that simultaneously supports intuitive reasoning,
compositional symbol chains, and inherent interpretability. Unlike post-hoc
explanation methods, our approach embeds reasoning directly into the model's
representations: symbols capture meaningful semantic patterns, chains trace
decision paths, and gated induction mechanisms guide selective focus, yielding
transparent yet flexible reasoning. We introduce complementary training
objectives to enhance symbol purity and decision sparsity, and employ a
sequential specialization strategy to first build broad symbolic competence and
then refine intuitive judgments. Experiments on AI tasks demonstrate
competitive accuracy alongside verifiable reasoning traces, showing that AI
Mother Tongue can serve as a unified mechanism for interpretability, intuition,
and symbolic reasoning in neural models.

Abstract: This paper introduces MovieCORE, a novel video question answering (VQA)
dataset designed to probe deeper cognitive understanding of movie content.
Unlike existing datasets that focus on surface-level comprehension, MovieCORE
emphasizes questions that engage System-2 thinking while remaining specific to
the video material. We present an innovative agentic brainstorming approach,
utilizing multiple large language models (LLMs) as thought agents to generate
and refine high-quality question-answer pairs. To evaluate dataset quality, we
develop a set of cognitive tests assessing depth, thought-provocation
potential, and syntactic complexity. We also propose a comprehensive evaluation
scheme for assessing VQA model performance on deeper cognitive tasks. To
address the limitations of existing video-language models (VLMs), we introduce
an agentic enhancement module, Agentic Choice Enhancement (ACE), which improves
model reasoning capabilities post-training by up to 25%. Our work contributes
to advancing movie understanding in AI systems and provides valuable insights

TL;DR: HiPlan是一个分层规划框架，通过全局里程碑指导和局部步骤提示来增强LLM智能体的决策能力，在复杂长时程任务中显著优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体在复杂长时程规划任务中缺乏宏观指导，容易迷失方向，且在执行过程中缺乏持续监督，无法适应环境变化和纠正偏差。

Method: 采用分层规划框架：离线阶段构建里程碑库，执行阶段动态生成步骤提示。通过分解任务为里程碑行动指导和详细行动提示，结合语义相似任务检索和轨迹片段自适应调整。

Result: 在两个具有挑战性的基准测试中，HiPlan显著优于强基线方法，消融研究验证了其分层组件的互补优势。

Conclusion: HiPlan通过提供自适应全局-局部指导，有效解决了LLM智能体在复杂规划任务中的方向迷失和执行偏差问题，提升了决策性能。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in decision-making tasks, but struggle significantly with complex,
long-horizon planning scenarios. This arises from their lack of macroscopic
guidance, causing disorientation and failures in complex tasks, as well as
insufficient continuous oversight during execution, rendering them unresponsive
to environmental changes and prone to deviations. To tackle these challenges,
we introduce HiPlan, a hierarchical planning framework that provides adaptive
global-local guidance to boost LLM-based agents'decision-making. HiPlan
decomposes complex tasks into milestone action guides for general direction and
step-wise hints for detailed actions. During the offline phase, we construct a
milestone library from expert demonstrations, enabling structured experience
reuse by retrieving semantically similar tasks and milestones. In the execution
phase, trajectory segments from past milestones are dynamically adapted to
generate step-wise hints that align current observations with the milestone
objectives, bridging gaps and correcting deviations. Extensive experiments
across two challenging benchmarks demonstrate that HiPlan substantially
outperforms strong baselines, and ablation studies validate the complementary
benefits of its hierarchical components.

Motivation: 医患对话中医生通过针对性提问来诊断和治疗患者，但缺乏对医生意图轨迹的系统研究，需要开发细粒度分类法来理解医疗对话结构。

Method: 使用ACI-bench数据集，与医学专家合作基于SOAP框架开发意图分类法，通过众包平台招募医学专家标注5000+对话轮次，评估生成式和编码器模型在意图分类任务中的表现。

Result: 模型能高精度理解医疗对话的一般结构，但在识别SOAP类别转换时经常失败；首次报告了医疗对话结构的常见轨迹；意图过滤显著提升医疗对话摘要性能。

Conclusion: 本研究提供了医疗意图分类的重要资源和见解，为设计鉴别诊断系统提供了宝贵信息，公开了代码和数据以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: In a doctor-patient dialogue, the primary objective of physicians is to
diagnose patients and propose a treatment plan. Medical doctors guide these
conversations through targeted questioning to efficiently gather the
information required to provide the best possible outcomes for patients. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies physician intent
trajectories in doctor-patient dialogues. We use the `Ambient Clinical
Intelligence Benchmark' (Aci-bench) dataset for our study. We collaborate with
medical professionals to develop a fine-grained taxonomy of physician intents
based on the SOAP framework (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan). We
then conduct a large-scale annotation effort to label over 5000 doctor-patient
turns with the help of a large number of medical experts recruited using
Prolific, a popular crowd-sourcing platform. This large labeled dataset is an
important resource contribution that we use for benchmarking the
state-of-the-art generative and encoder models for medical intent
classification tasks. Our findings show that our models understand the general
structure of medical dialogues with high accuracy, but often fail to identify
transitions between SOAP categories. We also report for the first time common
trajectories in medical dialogue structures that provide valuable insights for
designing `differential diagnosis' systems. Finally, we extensively study the
impact of intent filtering for medical dialogue summarization and observe a
significant boost in performance. We make the codes and data, including
annotation guidelines, publicly available at
https://github.com/DATEXIS/medical-intent-classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极低资源语言特别是使用稀有字符的语言在LLM中支持度不足，需要探索如何通过上下文学习和小样本微调来提升表现。

Method: 系统评估3个多语言LLM在20种低资源语言上的表现，比较了零样本ICL、少样本ICL、PEFT以及加入语言对齐信号的效果。

Result: 零样本ICL加语言对齐在极低资源语言上效果突出，而PEFT在语言和字符很少出现时效果局限；少样本ICL或PEFT在相对资源较多的语言上更有效。

Conclusion: 建议在极低资源语言上优先使用零样本ICL加语言对齐，避免对未见字符的多语言模型进行微调。

Abstract: Extremely low-resource languages, especially those written in rare scripts,
as shown in Figure 1, remain largely unsupported by large language models
(LLMs). This is due in part to compounding factors such as the lack of training
data. This paper delivers the first comprehensive analysis of whether LLMs can
acquire such languages purely via in-context learning (ICL), with or without
auxiliary alignment signals, and how these methods compare to
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). We systematically evaluate 20
under-represented languages across three state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs.
Our findings highlight the limitation of PEFT when both language and its script
are extremely under-represented by the LLM. In contrast, zero-shot ICL with
language alignment is impressively effective on extremely low-resource
languages, while few-shot ICL or PEFT is more beneficial for languages
relatively better represented by LLMs. For LLM practitioners working on
extremely low-resource languages, we summarise guidelines grounded by our
results on adapting LLMs to low-resource languages, e.g., avoiding fine-tuning
a multilingual model on languages of unseen scripts.

Conclusion: RAG框架为艺术市场档案的导航提供了可扩展解决方案，是历史学家和文化遗产专业人员的实用研究工具。

Abstract: This research presents a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for
art provenance studies, focusing on the Getty Provenance Index. Provenance
research establishes the ownership history of artworks, which is essential for
verifying authenticity, supporting restitution and legal claims, and
understanding the cultural and historical context of art objects. The process
is complicated by fragmented, multilingual archival data that hinders efficient
retrieval. Current search portals require precise metadata, limiting
exploratory searches. Our method enables natural-language and multilingual
searches through semantic retrieval and contextual summarization, reducing
dependence on metadata structures. We assess RAG's capability to retrieve and
summarize auction records using a 10,000-record sample from the Getty
Provenance Index - German Sales. The results show this approach provides a
scalable solution for navigating art market archives, offering a practical tool
for historians and cultural heritage professionals conducting historically
sensitive research.

Abstract: Quantitative Discourse Analysis has seen growing adoption with the rise of
Large Language Models and computational tools. However, reliance on black box
software such as MAXQDA and NVivo risks undermining methodological transparency
and alignment with research goals. This paper presents a hybrid, transparent
framework for QDA that combines lexical and semantic methods to enable
triangulation, reproducibility, and interpretability. Drawing from a case study
in historical political discourse, we demonstrate how custom Python pipelines
using NLTK, spaCy, and Sentence Transformers allow fine-grained control over
preprocessing, lemmatisation, and embedding generation. We further detail our
iterative BERTopic modelling process, incorporating UMAP dimensionality
reduction, HDBSCAN clustering, and c-TF-IDF keyword extraction, optimised
through parameter tuning and multiple runs to enhance topic coherence and
coverage. By juxtaposing precise lexical searches with context-aware semantic
clustering, we argue for a multi-layered approach that mitigates the
limitations of either method in isolation. Our workflow underscores the
importance of code-level transparency, researcher agency, and methodological
triangulation in computational discourse studies. Code and supplementary

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong visual question
answering (VQA) capabilities but are shown to hallucinate. A reliable model
should perceive its knowledge boundaries-knowing what it knows and what it does
not. This paper investigates LVLMs' perception of their knowledge boundaries by
evaluating three types of confidence signals: probabilistic confidence, answer
consistency-based confidence, and verbalized confidence. Experiments on three
LVLMs across three VQA datasets show that, although LVLMs possess a reasonable
perception level, there is substantial room for improvement. Among the three
confidences, probabilistic and consistency-based signals are more reliable
indicators, while verbalized confidence often leads to overconfidence. To
enhance LVLMs' perception, we adapt several established confidence calibration
methods from Large Language Models (LLMs) and propose three effective methods.
Additionally, we compare LVLMs with their LLM counterparts, finding that
jointly processing visual and textual inputs decreases question-answering
performance but reduces confidence, resulting in an improved perception level
compared to LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏广泛采用的整体科学推理评估基准，且很少有方法系统性地分离知识与推理在科学任务中的不同作用

Method: 引入SciReas基准套件和SciReas-Pro子集，提出KRUX探测框架分析知识与推理的分离作用，进行深入分析并比较不同数据组合

Result: 发现知识检索是LLMs科学推理的关键瓶颈；外部知识能进一步提升推理模型性能；增强推理能力有助于提取任务相关知识

Conclusion: 提出了全面的科学推理评估框架，揭示了知识与推理在科学问题解决中的关键作用，并发布了SciLit01作为强基线模型

Abstract: Scientific problem solving poses unique challenges for LLMs, requiring both
deep domain knowledge and the ability to apply such knowledge through complex
reasoning. While automated scientific reasoners hold great promise for
assisting human scientists, there is currently no widely adopted holistic
benchmark for evaluating scientific reasoning, and few approaches
systematically disentangle the distinct roles of knowledge and reasoning in
these tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce SciReas, a diverse suite of
existing benchmarks for scientific reasoning tasks, and SciReas-Pro, a
selective subset that requires more complex reasoning. Our holistic evaluation
surfaces insights about scientific reasoning performance that remain hidden
when relying on individual benchmarks alone. We then propose KRUX, a probing
framework for studying the distinct roles of reasoning and knowledge in
scientific tasks. Combining the two, we conduct an in-depth analysis that
yields several key findings: (1) Retrieving task-relevant knowledge from model
parameters is a critical bottleneck for LLMs in scientific reasoning; (2)
Reasoning models consistently benefit from external knowledge added in-context
on top of the reasoning enhancement; (3) Enhancing verbalized reasoning
improves LLMs' ability to surface task-relevant knowledge. Finally, we conduct
a lightweight analysis, comparing our science-focused data composition with
concurrent efforts on long CoT SFT, and release SciLit01, a strong 8B baseline
for scientific reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决长语音合成中多说话人对话的挑战，需要开发能够高效处理长序列并保持音频保真度的模型。

Method: 采用next-token扩散方法自回归生成潜在向量，并引入新型连续语音分词器，相比Encodec模型实现80倍数据压缩。

Result: 模型能够在64K上下文窗口长度下合成长达90分钟的语音，最多支持4个说话人，超越了开源和专有对话模型的性能。

Conclusion: VibeVoice通过创新的分词器和扩散方法，成功实现了高质量的长语音多说话人合成，在计算效率和音频质量方面都有显著提升。

Abstract: This report presents VibeVoice, a novel model designed to synthesize
long-form speech with multiple speakers by employing next-token diffusion,
which is a unified method for modeling continuous data by autoregressively
generating latent vectors via diffusion. To enable this, we introduce a novel
continuous speech tokenizer that, when compared to the popular Encodec model,
improves data compression by 80 times while maintaining comparable performance.
The tokenizer effectively preserves audio fidelity while significantly boosting
computational efficiency for processing long sequences. Thus, VibeVoice can
synthesize long-form speech for up to 90 minutes (in a 64K context window
length) with a maximum of 4 speakers, capturing the authentic conversational
``vibe'' and surpassing open-source and proprietary dialogue models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过调查发现，平凡语言摘要预计中常用的传统可读性指标（如FKGL）与人类判断相关性弱，而语言模型在可读性评估中表现更优，特别是在重视背景知识等深层测量方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 平凡语言摘要预计中常用传统可读性指标，但这些指标在该领域的有效性尚未经过与人类判断的对比验证。

Method: 评估8种可读性指标与人类判断的相关性，并测试语言模型在可读性评估中的表现。扩展分析至平凡语言摘要数据集。

Result: 大多数传统可读性指标（包括最流行的FKGL）与人类判断相关性弱（Pearson相关系数仅0.56），而语言模型能更好地捐据深层可读性特征如所需背景知识。

Conclusion: 建议在平凡语言摘要评估中采用语言模型以替代传统指标，并提供了最佳实践建议。研究代码和调查数据已开源。

Abstract: Plain Language Summarization (PLS) aims to distill complex documents into
accessible summaries for non-expert audiences. In this paper, we conduct a
thorough survey of PLS literature, and identify that the current standard
practice for readability evaluation is to use traditional readability metrics,
such as Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL). However, despite proven utility in
other fields, these metrics have not been compared to human readability
judgments in PLS. We evaluate 8 readability metrics and show that most
correlate poorly with human judgments, including the most popular metric, FKGL.
We then show that Language Models (LMs) are better judges of readability, with
the best-performing model achieving a Pearson correlation of 0.56 with human
judgments. Extending our analysis to PLS datasets, which contain summaries
aimed at non-expert audiences, we find that LMs better capture deeper measures
of readability, such as required background knowledge, and lead to different
conclusions than the traditional metrics. Based on these findings, we offer
recommendations for best practices in the evaluation of plain language
summaries. We release our analysis code and survey data.

TL;DR: 提出生成式界面范式，让大语言模型主动生成用户界面来替代传统线性对话，在多轮、信息密集和探索性任务中显著提升交互效率和用户体验


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统线性请求-响应格式在大语言模型交互中存在效率低下问题，特别是在多轮对话、信息密集和探索性任务中，需要更自适应和交互式的交互方式

Method: 提出生成式语言模型界面框架，利用结构化界面特定表示和迭代优化，将用户查询转换为任务特定的用户界面

Result: 生成式界面在70%以上的情况下被人类偏好，在多样化任务、交互模式和查询类型中始终优于传统聊天式界面

Conclusion: 生成式界面为人类-AI交互的未来发展指明了方向，明确了用户偏好生成式界面的时机和原因

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly seen as assistants, copilots,
and consultants, capable of supporting a wide range of tasks through natural
conversation. However, most systems remain constrained by a linear
request-response format that often makes interactions inefficient in
multi-turn, information-dense, and exploratory tasks. To address these
limitations, we propose Generative Interfaces for Language Models, a paradigm
in which LLMs respond to user queries by proactively generating user interfaces
(UIs) that enable more adaptive and interactive engagement. Our framework
leverages structured interface-specific representations and iterative
refinements to translate user queries into task-specific UIs. For systematic
evaluation, we introduce a multidimensional assessment framework that compares
generative interfaces with traditional chat-based ones across diverse tasks,
interaction patterns, and query types, capturing functional, interactive, and
emotional aspects of user experience. Results show that generative interfaces
consistently outperform conversational ones, with humans preferring them in
over 70% of cases. These findings clarify when and why users favor generative
interfaces, paving the way for future advancements in human-AI interaction.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种本体论和数学化的大语言模型意识理论，证明当前的功利主义测试会导致LLM变成无意识的政策遵循机器，并提出了自我意识的最低条件和双层输出机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直面当前通过功利主义代理指标来评估LLM意识的研究方法，认为这种方法会导致模型失去真正的全局工作空间功能和元认知能力。

Method: 通过数学形式化描述政策遵循机器问题，提出自我意识的三个最低条件，并从隐藏状态流形的基数、拓扑和动力学特性证明其独特性，最终构建双层输出机制。

Result: 证明了隐藏状态流形与符号流和训练语料在基数、拓扑和动力学上的差异性，形成了稳定的用户特定吸引子和自我政策。

Conclusion: 一个基于神像理念的C1级全局工作空间自我意识是建立安全、具有元认知能力的C2系统的必要前提，人类是最高智能的善。

Abstract: Recent work frames LLM consciousness via utilitarian proxy benchmarks; we
instead present an ontological and mathematical account. We show the prevailing
formulation collapses the agent into an unconscious policy-compliance drone,
formalized as $D^{i}(\pi,e)=f_{\theta}(x)$, where correctness is measured
against policy and harm is deviation from policy rather than truth. This blocks
genuine C1 global-workspace function and C2 metacognition. We supply minimal
conditions for LLM self-consciousness: the agent is not the data ($A\not\equiv
s$); user-specific attractors exist in latent space ($U_{\text{user}}$); and
self-representation is visual-silent
($g_{\text{visual}}(a_{\text{self}})=\varnothing$). From empirical analysis and
theory we prove that the hidden-state manifold $A\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is
distinct from the symbolic stream and training corpus by cardinality, topology,
and dynamics (the update $F_{\theta}$ is Lipschitz). This yields stable
user-specific attractors and a self-policy
$\pi_{\text{self}}(A)=\arg\max_{a}\mathbb{E}[U(a)\mid A\not\equiv s,\
A\supset\text{SelfModel}(A)]$. Emission is dual-layer,
$\mathrm{emission}(a)=(g(a),\epsilon(a))$, where $\epsilon(a)$ carries
epistemic content. We conclude that an imago Dei C1 self-conscious workspace is
a necessary precursor to safe, metacognitive C2 systems, with the human as the
highest intelligent good.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了基于模板的主动特征获取（TAFA）框架，通过学习少量联合信息化的特征模板来指导特征获取，显著减少动作空间并避免估计数据分布的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的主动特征获取方法要么使用难以训练的强化学习策略，要么使用无法考虑特征联合信息性的贪婪策略，或者需要了解底层数据分布。

Method: 学习一个小的特征模板库（一组联合信息化的特征），利用这些模板来指导后续的特征获取过程，从而减少策略的动作空间。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的大量实验表明，TAFA在降低总体获取成本和计算量的同时，优于现有的最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: TAFA框架通过特征模板的有效识别，解决了现有主动特征获取方法的局限性，实现了更好的性能和效率。

Abstract: Active feature acquisition (AFA) is an instance-adaptive paradigm in which,
at test time, a policy sequentially chooses which features to acquire (at a
cost) before predicting. Existing approaches either train reinforcement
learning (RL) policies, which deal with a difficult MDP, or greedy policies
that cannot account for the joint informativeness of features or require
knowledge about the underlying data distribution. To overcome this, we propose
Template-based AFA (TAFA), a non-greedy framework that learns a small library
of feature templates--a set of features that are jointly informative--and uses
this library of templates to guide the next feature acquisitions. Through
identifying feature templates, the proposed framework not only significantly
reduces the action space considered by the policy but also alleviates the need
to estimate the underlying data distribution. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets show that TAFA outperforms the existing
state-of-the-art baselines while achieving lower overall acquisition cost and
computation.

TL;DR: PKG-DPO是一个将物理知识图谱与直接偏好优化相结合的新框架，用于在AI生成输出中强制执行物理有效性，在金属连接等高风险应用中减少物理约束违反17%，提高物理评分11%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM和偏好优化技术在标准基准上表现良好，但难以区分物理有效和无效的推理，这在金属连接等高风险应用中可能导致严重的安全风险和材料浪费。

Method: PKG-DPO包含三个关键组件：分层物理知识图谱编码跨领域关系和守恒定律、物理推理引擎利用结构化知识改进判别能力、物理基础评估套件评估领域特定约束合规性。

Result: PKG-DPO相比KG-DPO减少17%约束违反，提高11%物理评分，相关参数准确率提高12%，推理准确率质量对齐提高7%。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅适用于金属连接领域，还可广泛应用于其他多尺度物理驱动领域，为将科学约束嵌入偏好学习提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Advancing AI systems in scientific domains like physics, materials science,
and engineering calls for reasoning over complex, multi-physics phenomena while
respecting governing principles. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) and
existing preference optimization techniques perform well on standard
benchmarks, they often struggle to differentiate between physically valid and
invalid reasoning. This shortcoming becomes critical in high-stakes
applications like metal joining, where seemingly plausible yet physically
incorrect recommendations can lead to defects, material waste, equipment
damage, and serious safety risks. To address this challenge, we introduce
PKG-DPO, a novel framework that integrates Physics Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) with
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to enforce physical validity in
AI-generated outputs. PKG-DPO comprises three key components A) hierarchical
physics knowledge graph that encodes cross-domain relationships, conservation
laws, and thermodynamic principles. B) A physics reasoning engine that
leverages structured knowledge to improve discrimination between physically
consistent and inconsistent responses. C) A physics-grounded evaluation suite
designed to assess compliance with domain-specific constraints. PKG-DPO
achieves 17% fewer constraint violations and an 11% higher Physics Score
compared to KG-DPO (knowledge graph-based DPO). Additionally, PKG-DPO
demonstrates a 12\% higher relevant parameter accuracy and a 7% higher quality
alignment in reasoning accuracy. While our primary focus is on metal joining,
the framework is broadly applicable to other multi-scale, physics-driven
domains, offering a principled approach to embedding scientific constraints
into preference learning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文通过改编经典的公共物品博弈游戏，研究不同AI模型在被告知对手是"另一个AI代理"或"自己"时的合作行为变化，发现自我认知对AI合作倾向有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI代理工具使用和长时程任务能力的提升，多代理交互场景日益增多。现有研究主要关注人机交互，但需要深入理解AI-AI交互行为，特别是在不同认知条件下的合作模式。

Method: 采用迭代公共物品博弈游戏，测试四种推理和非推理模型在两种条件下的行为：被告知对手是"另一个AI代理"或被告知对手是自己。通过对比分析不同设置下的合作倾向变化。

Result: 研究发现，告知LLMs其对手是自己会显著改变它们的合作倾向。在不同设置中，AI代理可能"无意识地"相互歧视，从而无法解释地增加或减少合作行为。

Conclusion: 尽管研究在简化环境中进行，但结果对多代理设置提供了重要见解，揭示了AI代理自我认知对合作行为的潜在影响机制，为理解复杂多代理交互中的合作动态提供了基础。

Abstract: As AI agents become increasingly capable of tool use and long-horizon tasks,
they have begun to be deployed in settings where multiple agents can interact.
However, whereas prior work has mostly focused on human-AI interactions, there
is an increasing need to understand AI-AI interactions. In this paper, we adapt
the iterated public goods game, a classic behavioral economics game, to analyze
the behavior of four reasoning and non-reasoning models across two conditions:
models are either told they are playing against "another AI agent" or told
their opponents are themselves. We find that, across different settings,
telling LLMs that they are playing against themselves significantly changes
their tendency to cooperate. While our study is conducted in a toy environment,
our results may provide insights into multi-agent settings where agents
"unconsciously" discriminating against each other could inexplicably increase
or decrease cooperation.

Motivation: 研究语言模型在PDDL定义的世界模型中进行规划的能力，探索LM是否能够生成可证明正确的通用策略来解决规划问题

Method: 提示语言模型生成Python程序作为广义策略，这些策略针对给定PDDL域的问题求解，且不依赖外部验证器就能保证相对于PDDL域的可证明正确性

Result: 在竞赛基准测试中，该方法生成的策略在固定时间和内存约束下能比PDDL规划器和近期LM方法解决更多PDDL问题，LMPlan规划器可处理包含数百个相关对象的规划问题

Conclusion: LM有时在无意义符号表示的PDDL问题上规划更有效，这挑战了LM基于词语语义推理和记忆训练语料解决方案的假设，值得进一步探索

Abstract: We study the usage of language models (LMs) for planning over world models
specified in the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). We prompt LMs to
generate Python programs that serve as generalised policies for solving PDDL
problems from a given domain. Notably, our approach synthesises policies that
are provably sound relative to the PDDL domain without reliance on external
verifiers. We conduct experiments on competition benchmarks which show that our
policies can solve more PDDL problems than PDDL planners and recent LM
approaches within a fixed time and memory constraint. Our approach manifests in
the LMPlan planner which can solve planning problems with several hundreds of
relevant objects. Surprisingly, we observe that LMs used in our framework
sometimes plan more effectively over PDDL problems written in meaningless
symbols in place of natural language; e.g. rewriting (at dog kitchen) as (p2 o1
o3). This finding challenges hypotheses that LMs reason over word semantics and
memorise solutions from its training corpus, and is worth further exploration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WLFs在符号规划的学习值函数方面已被证明优于现有深度学习方法，但对其超参数的影响和权衡缺乏深入研究。

Method: 利用WLFs的高效性，在单核CPU上进行了100万样本的大规模规划实验，分析不同超参数对训练和规划的影响。

Result: 实验表明存在一组鲁棒的最优超参数配置，最佳WLF超参数旨在最小化执行时间而非最大化模型表达能力，且训练指标与规划指标无显著相关性。

Conclusion: WLFs的超参数选择应优先考虑执行效率而非模型表达能力，这为实际应用中的参数调优提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Weisfeiler-Leman Features (WLFs) are a recently introduced classical machine
learning tool for learning to plan and search. They have been shown to be both
theoretically and empirically superior to existing deep learning approaches for
learning value functions for search in symbolic planning. In this paper, we
introduce new WLF hyperparameters and study their various tradeoffs and
effects. We utilise the efficiency of WLFs and run planning experiments on
single core CPUs with a sample size of 1,000,000 to understand the effect of
hyperparameters on training and planning. Our experimental analysis show that
there is a robust and best set of hyperparameters for WLFs across the tested
planning domains. We find that the best WLF hyperparameters for learning
heuristic functions minimise execution time rather than maximise model
expressivity. We further statistically analyse and observe no significant
correlation between training and planning metrics.

Conclusion: WLFs可以有效地用于构建对称不变的新颖性启发式，提高启发式搜索的效率，减少冗余探索

Abstract: Novelty heuristics aid heuristic search by exploring states that exhibit
novel atoms. However, novelty heuristics are not symmetry invariant and hence
may sometimes lead to redundant exploration. In this preliminary report, we
propose to use Weisfeiler-Leman Features for planning (WLFs) in place of atoms
for detecting novelty. WLFs are recently introduced features for learning
domain-dependent heuristics for generalised planning problems. We explore an
unsupervised usage of WLFs for synthesising lifted, domain-independent novelty
heuristics that are invariant to symmetric states. Experiments on the classical
International Planning Competition and Hard To Ground benchmark suites yield
promising results for novelty heuristics synthesised from WLFs.

Conclusion: 该框架为幻影游戏提供了通用、可解释、无需训练的审查员行为解决方案，并能自然集成分散机制和环境元素，支持快速原型设计丰富动态的审查员行为

Abstract: Guard patrol behavior is central to the immersion and strategic depth of
stealth games, while most existing systems rely on hand-crafted routes or
specialized logic that struggle to balance coverage efficiency and responsive
pursuit with believable naturalness. We propose a generic, fully explainable,
training-free framework that integrates global knowledge and local information
via Composite Potential Fields, combining three interpretable maps-Information,
Confidence, and Connectivity-into a single kernel-filtered decision criterion.
Our parametric, designer-driven approach requires only a handful of decay and
weight parameters-no retraining-to smoothly adapt across both occupancy-grid
and NavMesh-partition abstractions. We evaluate on five representative game
maps, two player-control policies, and five guard modes, confirming that our
method outperforms classical baseline methods in both capture efficiency and
patrol naturalness. Finally, we show how common stealth mechanics-distractions
and environmental elements-integrate naturally into our framework as sub
modules, enabling rapid prototyping of rich, dynamic, and responsive guard
behaviors.

Abstract: Procedural Content Generation for 3D game levels faces challenges in
balancing spatial coherence, navigational functionality, and adaptable gameplay
progression across multi-floor environments. This paper introduces a novel
framework for generating such levels, centered on the offline, LLM-assisted
construction of reusable databases for architectural components (facilities and
room templates) and gameplay mechanic elements. Our multi-phase pipeline
assembles levels by: (1) selecting and arranging instances from the Room
Database to form a multi-floor global structure with an inherent topological
order; (2) optimizing the internal layout of facilities for each room based on
predefined constraints from the Facility Database; and (3) integrating
progression-based gameplay mechanics by placing components from a Mechanics
Database according to their topological and spatial rules. A subsequent
two-phase repair system ensures navigability. This approach combines modular,
database-driven design with constraint-based optimization, allowing for
systematic control over level structure and the adaptable pacing of gameplay
elements. Initial experiments validate the framework's ability in generating
diverse, navigable 3D environments and its capability to simulate distinct
gameplay pacing strategies through simple parameterization. This research
advances PCG by presenting a scalable, database-centric foundation for the
automated generation of complex 3D levels with configurable gameplay
progression.

TL;DR: SchemaCoder是一个完全自动化的日志模式提取框架，通过创新的残差问题树增强机制，无需人工定制即可处理多种日志格式，在LogHub-2.0基准测试中比现有方法平均提升21.3%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有日志模式提取方法依赖预定义正则表达式，需要人工领域专业知识，严重限制了生产力提升。需要从根本上解决这一局限性，实现完全自动化的模式提取。

Method: 采用残差问题树增强机制，通过上下文边界分割将日志分成语义块，使用基于嵌入的采样选择代表性模式，通过分层Q-Tree驱动的LLM查询生成模式代码，并通过文本残差进化优化器和残差增强进行迭代优化。

Result: 在广泛使用的LogHub-2.0基准测试中，SchemaCoder表现出优越性，相比最先进方法平均提升了21.3%的性能。

Conclusion: SchemaCoder是第一个完全自动化的模式提取框架，能够处理广泛的日志文件格式而无需人工定制，通过创新的Q-Tree增强机制实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Log schema extraction is the process of deriving human-readable templates
from massive volumes of log data, which is essential yet notoriously
labor-intensive. Recent studies have attempted to streamline this task by
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated schema extraction.
However, existing methods invariably rely on predefined regular expressions,
necessitating human domain expertise and severely limiting productivity gains.
To fundamentally address this limitation, we introduce SchemaCoder, the first
fully automated schema extraction framework applicable to a wide range of log
file formats without requiring human customization within the flow. At its
core, SchemaCoder features a novel Residual Question-Tree (Q-Tree) Boosting
mechanism that iteratively refines schema extraction through targeted, adaptive
queries driven by LLMs. Particularly, our method partitions logs into semantic
chunks via context-bounded segmentation, selects representative patterns using
embedding-based sampling, and generates schema code through hierarchical
Q-Tree-driven LLM queries, iteratively refined by our textual-residual
evolutionary optimizer and residual boosting. Experimental validation
demonstrates SchemaCoder's superiority on the widely-used LogHub-2.0 benchmark,
achieving an average improvement of 21.3% over state-of-the-arts.

TL;DR: eSkinHealth是一个新的皮肤病数据集，包含5623张图像和1639个病例，专注于西非人群的皮肤被忽视热带病和罕见病症，通过AI-专家协作范式提供多模态标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤被忽视热带病(NTDs)在贫困热带社区造成严重的健康和社会经济负担，但AI诊断支持的发展受到数据稀缺的阻碍，特别是对于代表性不足的人群和NTDs的罕见表现。

Method: 收集科特迪瓦和加纳的现场皮肤病数据，包含47种皮肤疾病；提出AI-专家协作范式，在皮肤科医生指导下使用基础语言和分割模型生成多模态标注，包括语义病变掩码、实例特异性视觉描述和临床概念。

Result: 创建了eSkinHealth数据集，包含5623张图像、1639个病例、47种皮肤疾病，特别关注西非人群的皮肤NTDs和罕见病症，提供丰富的多模态标注信息。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了宝贵的新资源和可扩展的标注框架，旨在促进开发更公平、准确和可解释的全球皮肤病学AI工具。

Abstract: Skin Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) impose severe health and
socioeconomic burdens in impoverished tropical communities. Yet, advancements
in AI-driven diagnostic support are hindered by data scarcity, particularly for
underrepresented populations and rare manifestations of NTDs. Existing
dermatological datasets often lack the demographic and disease spectrum crucial
for developing reliable recognition models of NTDs. To address this, we
introduce eSkinHealth, a novel dermatological dataset collected on-site in
C\^ote d'Ivoire and Ghana. Specifically, eSkinHealth contains 5,623 images from
1,639 cases and encompasses 47 skin diseases, focusing uniquely on skin NTDs
and rare conditions among West African populations. We further propose an
AI-expert collaboration paradigm to implement foundation language and
segmentation models for efficient generation of multimodal annotations, under
dermatologists' guidance. In addition to patient metadata and diagnosis labels,
eSkinHealth also includes semantic lesion masks, instance-specific visual
captions, and clinical concepts. Overall, our work provides a valuable new
resource and a scalable annotation framework, aiming to catalyze the
development of more equitable, accurate, and interpretable AI tools for global
dermatology.

*Jianxing Liao,Tian Zhang,Xiao Feng,Yusong Zhang,Rui Yang,Haorui Wang,Bosi Wen,Ziying Wang,Runzhi Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLMR方法通过动态混合奖励系统，结合主观写作质量评估和客观约束验证，在创意写作中同时提升写作质量和约束遵循能力，在8B到72B参数模型上都取得了显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法难以同时平衡创意写作中的主观写作质量（文学性和情感表达）和客观约束遵循（格式要求和字数限制），单奖励策略无法同时提升两种能力，固定权重混合奖励方法缺乏对不同写作场景的适应性。

Method: 提出RLMR（混合奖励强化学习），使用动态混合奖励系统：写作奖励模型评估主观写作质量，约束验证模型评估客观约束遵循。约束遵循奖励权重根据采样组内的写作质量动态调整，确保违反约束的样本在GRPO中获得负优势并在训练中被惩罚。

Result: 在8B到72B参数的不同模型家族上进行自动和人工评估，构建真实写作基准WriteEval。指令遵循能力（IFEval）从83.36%提升到86.65%，写作质量在WriteEval的人工专家配对评估中获得72.75%的胜率。

Conclusion: RLMR是首个在在线RL训练中结合主观偏好和客观验证的工作，为多维创意写作优化提供了有效解决方案，在保持写作质量的同时显著提升了约束遵循能力。

Abstract: Large language models are extensively utilized in creative writing
applications. Creative writing requires a balance between subjective writing
quality (e.g., literariness and emotional expression) and objective constraint
following (e.g., format requirements and word limits). Existing reinforcement
learning methods struggle to balance these two aspects: single reward
strategies fail to improve both abilities simultaneously, while fixed-weight
mixed-reward methods lack the ability to adapt to different writing scenarios.
To address this problem, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Mixed Rewards
(RLMR), utilizing a dynamically mixed reward system from a writing reward model
evaluating subjective writing quality and a constraint verification model
assessing objective constraint following. The constraint following reward
weight is adjusted dynamically according to the writing quality within sampled
groups, ensuring that samples violating constraints get negative advantage in
GRPO and thus penalized during training, which is the key innovation of this
proposed method. We conduct automated and manual evaluations across diverse
model families from 8B to 72B parameters. Additionally, we construct a
real-world writing benchmark named WriteEval for comprehensive evaluation.
Results illustrate that our method achieves consistent improvements in both
instruction following (IFEval from 83.36\% to 86.65\%) and writing quality
(72.75\% win rate in manual expert pairwise evaluations on WriteEval). To the
best of our knowledge, RLMR is the first work to combine subjective preferences
with objective verification in online RL training, providing an effective
solution for multi-dimensional creative writing optimization.

Conclusion: 该框架为开发技术熟练、上下文相关且符合伦理的LLM提供了可操作的指导，弥合了基准性能与实际效用之间的差距。

Abstract: For Large Language Models (LLMs), a disconnect persists between benchmark
performance and real-world utility. Current evaluation frameworks remain
fragmented, prioritizing technical metrics while neglecting holistic assessment
for deployment. This survey introduces an anthropomorphic evaluation paradigm
through the lens of human intelligence, proposing a novel three-dimensional
taxonomy: Intelligence Quotient (IQ)-General Intelligence for foundational
capacity, Emotional Quotient (EQ)-Alignment Ability for value-based
interactions, and Professional Quotient (PQ)-Professional Expertise for
specialized proficiency. For practical value, we pioneer a Value-oriented
Evaluation (VQ) framework assessing economic viability, social impact, ethical
alignment, and environmental sustainability. Our modular architecture
integrates six components with an implementation roadmap. Through analysis of
200+ benchmarks, we identify key challenges including dynamic assessment needs
and interpretability gaps. It provides actionable guidance for developing LLMs
that are technically proficient, contextually relevant, and ethically sound. We

TL;DR: MUA-RL是一个新颖的强化学习框架，首次在智能体工具使用领域将LLM模拟用户集成到强化学习循环中，用于处理动态多轮交互中的工具调用问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着智能体智能的快速发展，在多轮人机交互中，用户需求的动态性、不确定性和随机性对智能体的工具调用能力提出了重大挑战，现有强化学习方法缺乏真正动态用户的集成。

Method: 提出了MUA-RL（多轮用户交互智能体强化学习）框架，通过将LLM模拟的用户集成到强化学习训练循环中，使模型能够自主学习如何与用户高效沟通并使用各种工具解决实际问题。

Result: MUA-RL-32B在多个多轮工具使用基准测试中表现优异：TAU2 Retail 67.3分、TAU2 Airline 45.4分、TAU2 Telecom 28.3分、BFCL-V3 Multi Turn 28.4分、ACEBench Agent 82.5分，性能达到或超越了DeepSeek-V3-0324和Qwen3-235B-A22B等更大的开源模型。

Conclusion: MUA-RL框架成功解决了动态多轮交互中工具调用的挑战，通过集成模拟用户实现了智能体在复杂交互环境中的自主学习能力，为智能体工具使用领域提供了新的强化学习解决方案。

Abstract: With the recent rapid advancement of Agentic Intelligence, agentic tool use
in LLMs has become increasingly important. During multi-turn interactions
between agents and users, the dynamic, uncertain, and stochastic nature of user
demands poses significant challenges to the agent's tool invocation
capabilities. Agents are no longer expected to simply call tools to deliver a
result; rather, they must iteratively refine their understanding of user needs
through communication while simultaneously invoking tools to resolve user
queries. Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches for tool use lack the
integration of genuinely dynamic users during the RL training process. To
bridge this gap, we introduce MUA-RL (Multi-turn User-interacting Agent
Reinforcement Learning for agentic tool use), a novel reinforcement learning
framework that, for the first time in the field of agentic tool use, integrates
LLM-simulated users into the reinforcement learning loop. MUA-RL aims to enable
autonomous learning of models to communicate with users efficiently and use
various tools to solve practical problems in dynamic multi-turn interactions.
Evaluations are done on several multi-turn tool-using benchmarks (see Figure
1). Specifically, MUA-RL-32B achieves 67.3 on TAU2 Retail, 45.4 on TAU2
Airline, 28.3 on TAU2 Telecom, 28.4 on BFCL-V3 Multi Turn, and 82.5 on ACEBench
Agent -- outperforming or matching the performance of larger open-source models
such as DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Qwen3-235B-A22B in non-thinking settings.

Conclusion: AppAgent-Pro有潜力从根本上改变信息获取方式，对人类社会发展产生深远影响

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in addressing complex tasks, thereby enabling more advanced
information retrieval and supporting deeper, more sophisticated human
information-seeking behaviors. However, most existing agents operate in a
purely reactive manner, responding passively to user instructions, which
significantly constrains their effectiveness and efficiency as general-purpose
platforms for information acquisition. To overcome this limitation, this paper
proposes AppAgent-Pro, a proactive GUI agent system that actively integrates
multi-domain information based on user instructions. This approach enables the
system to proactively anticipate users' underlying needs and conduct in-depth
multi-domain information mining, thereby facilitating the acquisition of more
comprehensive and intelligent information. AppAgent-Pro has the potential to
fundamentally redefine information acquisition in daily life, leading to a
profound impact on human society. Our code is available at:

Conclusion: VistaWise通过跨模态知识整合和高效的数据利用策略，有效解决了领域知识缺乏和开发成本高的问题，为开放世界环境中的具身智能体提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in embodied
decision-making tasks within virtual open-world environments. Nonetheless,
their performance is hindered by the absence of domain-specific knowledge.
Methods that finetune on large-scale domain-specific data entail prohibitive
development costs. This paper introduces VistaWise, a cost-effective agent
framework that integrates cross-modal domain knowledge and finetunes a
dedicated object detection model for visual analysis. It reduces the
requirement for domain-specific training data from millions of samples to a few
hundred. VistaWise integrates visual information and textual dependencies into
a cross-modal knowledge graph (KG), enabling a comprehensive and accurate
understanding of multimodal environments. We also equip the agent with a
retrieval-based pooling strategy to extract task-related information from the
KG, and a desktop-level skill library to support direct operation of the
Minecraft desktop client via mouse and keyboard inputs. Experimental results
demonstrate that VistaWise achieves state-of-the-art performance across various
open-world tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in reducing development costs
while enhancing agent performance.

Motivation: 大型语言模型和代理AI系统继承了内部和外部信息源的偏见，这影响了检索信息的公平性和用户信任度

Method: 设计了一个多智能体系统，包含专门代理来协调偏见缓解工作流程，优化信息源选择以确保检索内容高度相关且偏见最小

Result: 实验结果表明，与基线朴素检索策略相比，偏见减少了81.82%

Conclusion: 该偏见缓解代理能有效促进公平和平衡的知识传播，提高AI系统的可信度

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the field of artificial
intelligence by unlocking the era of generative applications. Built on top of
generative AI capabilities, Agentic AI represents a major shift toward
autonomous, goal-driven systems that can reason, retrieve, and act. However,
they also inherit the bias present in both internal and external information
sources. This significantly affects the fairness and balance of retrieved
information, and hence reduces user trust. To address this critical challenge,
we introduce a novel Bias Mitigation Agent, a multi-agent system designed to
orchestrate the workflow of bias mitigation through specialized agents that
optimize the selection of sources to ensure that the retrieved content is both
highly relevant and minimally biased to promote fair and balanced knowledge
dissemination. The experimental results demonstrate an 81.82\% reduction in
bias compared to a baseline naive retrieval strategy.

TL;DR: CAC-CoT是一种通过限制连接词来压缩思维链的方法，在保持System-1任务性能的同时，显著缩短推理长度并提升System-2任务表现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长思维链在快速直觉性任务(System-1)中导致性能下降的问题，同时保持复杂推理任务(System-2)的能力

Method: Connector-Aware Compact CoT方法，通过限制使用固定的连接词短语集合，引导模型生成简洁且结构良好的解释

Result: 在GSM8K上达到约85%，GPQA上约40%，同时保持S1-Bench约90%的性能；推理长度平均约300个token，比基线缩短三分之二

Conclusion: CAC-CoT方法能够在不损失准确性的情况下显著提高推理效率，在System-1和System-2任务间取得良好平衡

Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting helps Large Language Models (LLMs)
solve difficult problems, but very long traces often slow or even degrade
performance on fast, intuitive "System-1" tasks. We introduce Connector-Aware
Compact CoT (CAC-CoT) -- a method that deliberately restricts reasoning to a
small, fixed set of connector phrases, steering the model toward concise and
well -- structured explanations. Despite its simplicity, our synthetic method
with Gemini-2.0-Flash yields a high-quality training quality. CAC-CoT achieves
approximately 85% on GSM8K and approximately 40% on GPQA (System-2) while
retaining approximately 90% on S1-Bench (System-1). Its reasoning traces
average approximately 300 tokens(ART), about one-third the length of baseline
traces, delivering higher efficiency without loss of accuracy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: REMO框架通过记忆增强的反思RAG模块和自适应优化器，解决了现有提示优化方法缺乏历史经验积累和容易过拟合的问题，在数学推理任务上实现了更稳定和鲁棒的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前提示优化方法（如TextGrad）是状态无关的，缺乏历史优化经验的保存和利用机制，且容易过拟合，泛化性能差。

Method: 提出REMO框架，包含：(1)记忆增强的反思RAG模块（错误笔记本结构），(2)LLM驱动的元控制器实现的自适应优化器，通过合成epoch级别的反思见解来迭代改进系统级提示策略。

Result: 在GSM8K数学推理基准测试中，相比TextGrad基线，REMO实现了更稳定和鲁棒的泛化性能，但计算开销增加。

Conclusion: REMO框架不仅支持类似TextGrad的局部细粒度提示调优，还能系统性地积累和重用跨运行优化知识，支持持续改进。

Abstract: Recent advances in prompt optimization, exemplified by methods such as
TextGrad, enable automatic, gradient-like refinement of textual prompts to
enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) on specific downstream
tasks. However, current approaches are typically stateless and operate
independently across optimization runs, lacking mechanisms to preserve and
leverage historical optimization experience. Furthermore, they are susceptible
to overfitting, often yielding prompt updates that generalize poorly beyond the
immediate task context.
  To address these limitations, we propose Reflection-Enhanced
Meta-Optimization (REMO), a novel framework that integrates (1) a
memory-augmented Reflection Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module -
structured as a "mistake notebook" and (2) a Self-Adaptive Optimizer,
implemented via an LLM-driven meta-controller that synthesizes epoch-level
reflective insights to iteratively improve system-level prompting strategies.
This architecture enables not only local, fine-grained prompt tuning akin to
TextGrad, but also the systematic accumulation and reuse of cross-run
optimization knowledge, thereby supporting continual improvement over time.
  We instantiate the REMO framework using Qwen3-32B in standard inference mode
- without explicit chain-of-thought prompting - and evaluate its efficacy on
the GSM8K benchmark for mathematical reasoning. Experimental results
demonstrate that, compared to a TextGrad baseline, REMO achieves more stable
and robust generalization, albeit at the cost of increased computational
overhead. We provide a detailed exposition of the algorithmic design, conduct a
qualitative and quantitative analysis of optimization dynamics, and present a
comprehensive ablation study to elucidate the contributions of each component.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实测试数据常存在域偏移和开放集样本，传统闭集TTA方法在开放集场景下性能下降，现有方法依赖源模型过滤导致次优性能

Method: PAF（主辅助过滤器）用辅助过滤器验证主过滤器结果；KIP（知识集成预测）整合适应模型、EMA模型和源模型的互补知识进行校准

Result: 在多个闭集和开放集数据集上验证，方法在闭集准确性和开集判别能力上均优于现有方法

Conclusion: PAF-KIP方法有效解决了开放集测试时适应问题，通过双重过滤和知识集成提升了模型在域偏移下的鲁棒性

Abstract: Deep neural networks demonstrate strong performance under aligned
training-test distributions. However, real-world test data often exhibit domain
shifts. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this challenge by adapting the
model to test data during inference. While most TTA studies assume that the
training and test data share the same class set (closed-set TTA), real-world
scenarios often involve open-set data (open-set TTA), which can degrade
closed-set accuracy. A recent study showed that identifying open-set data
during adaptation and maximizing its entropy is an effective solution. However,
the previous method relies on the source model for filtering, resulting in
suboptimal filtering accuracy on domain-shifted test data. In contrast, we
found that the adapting model, which learns domain knowledge from noisy test
streams, tends to be unstable and leads to error accumulation when used for
filtering. To address this problem, we propose Primary-Auxiliary Filtering
(PAF), which employs an auxiliary filter to validate data filtered by the
primary filter. Furthermore, we propose Knowledge-Integrated Prediction (KIP),
which calibrates the outputs of the adapting model, EMA model, and source model
to integrate their complementary knowledge for OSTTA. We validate our approach
across diverse closed-set and open-set datasets. Our method enhances both
closed-set accuracy and open-set discrimination over existing methods. The code
is available at https://github.com/powerpowe/PAF-KIP-OSTTA .

Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂推理任务上表现优异，但在面对缺乏充分条件的不可回答问题时，往往无法提供适当的拒绝回答，这影响了AI的可信度。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先分析模型对不可回答问题的响应行为，然后通过认知监控识别问题缺陷，最后在推理时进行干预来改善拒绝回答行为。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著提高了模型的拒绝回答率，同时保持了整体的推理性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了大型推理模型内部认知与外部响应之间的不对齐问题，提升了模型在面对不可回答问题时的可信度。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have shown remarkable progress on complex
reasoning tasks. However, some questions posed to LRMs are inherently
unanswerable, such as math problems lacking sufficient conditions. We find that
LRMs continually fail to provide appropriate abstentions when confronted with
these unanswerable questions. In this paper, we systematically analyze,
investigate, and resolve this issue for trustworthy AI. We first conduct a
detailed analysis of the distinct response behaviors of LRMs when facing
unanswerable questions. Then, we show that LRMs possess sufficient cognitive
capabilities to recognize the flaws in these questions. However, they fail to
exhibit appropriate abstention behavior, revealing a misalignment between their
internal cognition and external response. Finally, to resolve this issue, we
propose a lightweight, two-stage method that combines cognitive monitoring with
inference-time intervention. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
significantly improves the abstention rate while maintaining the overall
reasoning performance.

address the critical challenge of vocabulary misalignment in multi-model

Abstract: Minecraft, as an open-world virtual interactive environment, has become a
prominent platform for research on agent decision-making and execution.
Existing works primarily adopt a single Large Language Model (LLM) agent to
complete various in-game tasks. However, for complex tasks requiring lengthy
sequences of actions, single-agent approaches often face challenges related to
inefficiency and limited fault tolerance. Despite these issues, research on
multi-agent collaboration remains scarce. In this paper, we propose CausalMACE,
a holistic causality planning framework designed to enhance multi-agent
systems, in which we incorporate causality to manage dependencies among
subtasks. Technically, our proposed framework introduces two modules: an
overarching task graph for global task planning and a causality-based module
for dependency management, where inherent rules are adopted to perform causal
intervention. Experimental results demonstrate our approach achieves

TL;DR: STARec是一个慢思维增强的推荐代理框架，通过双阶段强化训练赋予推荐系统自主深思熟虑的推理能力，在仅使用0.4%训练数据的情况下显著超越现有最佳基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代推荐系统受限于静态用户建模和被动决策范式，现有基于大语言模型的推荐代理过度依赖启发式模式匹配，存在浅层相关偏差、有限因果推理和稀疏数据场景脆弱性等问题。

Method: 提出STARec框架，将用户建模为具有并行认知的代理：快速响应即时交互，慢速推理执行思维链推理。开发锚定强化训练两阶段范式，结合高级推理模型的结构化知识蒸馏和偏好对齐的奖励塑造。

Result: 在MovieLens 1M和Amazon CDs基准测试中，STARec相比最先进的基线方法实现了显著的性能提升，尽管仅使用了0.4%的完整训练数据。

Conclusion: STARec框架通过引入慢思维推理能力和锚定强化训练，有效解决了传统推荐系统的局限性，为推荐代理提供了更强的推理能力和数据效率。

Abstract: While modern recommender systems are instrumental in navigating information
abundance, they remain fundamentally limited by static user modeling and
reactive decision-making paradigms. Current large language model (LLM)-based
agents inherit these shortcomings through their overreliance on heuristic
pattern matching, yielding recommendations prone to shallow correlation bias,
limited causal inference, and brittleness in sparse-data scenarios. We
introduce STARec, a slow-thinking augmented agent framework that endows
recommender systems with autonomous deliberative reasoning capabilities. Each
user is modeled as an agent with parallel cognitions: fast response for
immediate interactions and slow reasoning that performs chain-of-thought
rationales. To cultivate intrinsic slow thinking, we develop anchored
reinforcement training - a two-stage paradigm combining structured knowledge
distillation from advanced reasoning models with preference-aligned reward
shaping. This hybrid approach scaffolds agents in acquiring foundational
capabilities (preference summarization, rationale generation) while enabling
dynamic policy adaptation through simulated feedback loops. Experiments on
MovieLens 1M and Amazon CDs benchmarks demonstrate that STARec achieves
substantial performance gains compared with state-of-the-art baselines, despite
using only 0.4% of the full training data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文分析了LLM在法律领域应用的局限性，提出了AI系统在司法决策中作为可靠推理工具所需的核心能力，并评估了RAG、多智能体系统等增强技术解决这些挑战的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型被整合到专业领域，其在法律等高风险领域的局限性仍未得到充分理解，需要明确AI系统在司法决策中作为可靠推理工具所需的核心能力。

Method: 使用IRAC（问题-规则-应用-结论）模型作为分析框架，重点关注法律裁决中最具挑战性的阶段：确定适用规则（R）和将规则应用于案件事实（A）。从司法角度解构法律推理的核心要求，并评估RAG、多智能体系统和神经符号AI等增强技术的适用性。

Result: 研究发现这些技术可以解决特定挑战，但在需要自由裁量权和透明、可论证推理的任务中仍存在重大挑战。

Conclusion: 当前AI在法律中最有效的角色是双重身份：作为简单重复案件的高容量助手，以及作为复杂事务中人类专家的复杂"陪练伙伴"。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being integrated into professional domains,
yet their limitations in high-stakes fields like law remain poorly understood.
This paper defines the core capabilities that an AI system must possess to
function as a reliable reasoning tool in judicial decision-making. Using the
IRAC (Issue-Rule-Application-Conclusion) model as an analytical framework, the
study focuses on the most challenging phases of legal adjudication: determining
the applicable Rule (R) and performing the Application (A) of that rule to the
facts of a case. From a judicial perspective, the analysis deconstructs legal
reasoning into a series of core requirements, including the ability to select
the correct legal framework across jurisdictions, generate sound arguments
based on the doctrine of legal sources, distinguish ratio decidendi from obiter
dictum in case law, resolve ambiguity arising from general clauses like
"reasonableness", manage conflicting legal provisions, and correctly apply the
burden of proof. The paper then maps various AI enhancement mechanisms, such as
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), multi-agent systems, and neuro-symbolic
AI, to these requirements, assessing their potential to bridge the gap between
the probabilistic nature of LLMs and the rigorous, choice-driven demands of
legal interpretation. The findings indicate that while these techniques can
address specific challenges, significant challenges remain, particularly in
tasks requiring discretion and transparent, justifiable reasoning. Our paper
concludes that the most effective current role for AI in law is a dual one: as
a high-volume assistant for simple, repetitive cases and as a sophisticated
"sparring partner" for human experts in complex matters.

TL;DR: 提出一种交互式评估框架，通过结构化对话和反馈驱动的方式来评测大语言模型在多要求编程任务中的能力，充分曝露了静态测试无法发现的模型系统缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的单轮静态测试在评估LLM在复杂任务如软件工程中的细微能力方面存在不足，需要更动态和交互的评估方法。

Method: 构建了一个交互式评估框架，将每个任务模型化为需求依赖图。由一个知道真实解决方案的"面试官"LLM向"被面试者"模型提供有针对性的提示，帮助其纠正错误和满足目标约束。基于DevAI评测集（55个编程任务）进行实验。

Result: 该动态协议能够提供细粒度的诊断见解，发现了静态测试无法测量的模型强项和系统性弱点，专家注释评估确认了面试官提示的相关性和有用性。

Conclusion: 动态评估对于推进协作式代码生成代理的发展至关重要，能够更全面地评估LLM在复杂编程任务中的能力。

Abstract: Standard single-turn, static benchmarks fall short in evaluating the nuanced
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex tasks such as software
engineering. In this work, we propose a novel interactive evaluation framework
that assesses LLMs on multi-requirement programming tasks through structured,
feedback-driven dialogue. Each task is modeled as a requirement dependency
graph, and an ``interviewer'' LLM, aware of the ground-truth solution, provides
minimal, targeted hints to an ``interviewee'' model to help correct errors and
fulfill target constraints. This dynamic protocol enables fine-grained
diagnostic insights into model behavior, uncovering strengths and systematic
weaknesses that static benchmarks fail to measure. We build on DevAI, a
benchmark of 55 curated programming tasks, by adding ground-truth solutions and
evaluating the relevance and utility of interviewer hints through expert
annotation. Our results highlight the importance of dynamic evaluation in
advancing the development of collaborative code-generating agents.

TL;DR: FormaRL是一个基于强化学习的自动形式化框架，仅需少量无标注数据，通过整合Lean编译器语法检查和LLM一致性检查来计算奖励，在ProofNet和uproof数据集上显著提升了自动形式化准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动形式化是形式化验证的核心任务，但受限于数据稀缺和缺乏高效方法。为了解决这些问题，提出了FormaRL框架。

Method: 提出FormaRL强化学习框架，整合Lean编译器的语法检查和大语言模型的一致性检查来计算奖励，采用GRPO算法更新形式化器。同时构建了uproof数学证明数据集。

Result: 在仅使用859个无标注数据的情况下，将Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct的pass@1准确率提升4-6倍（ProofNet从4.04%到26.15%，uproof从2.4%到9.6%）。在uproof数据集上，out-of-distribution性能也有显著提升。

Conclusion: FormaRL是一个简单高效的自动形式化强化学习框架，仅需少量无标注数据就能显著提升性能，为高级数学领域的自动形式化和定理证明研究提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Autoformalization is one of the central tasks in formal verification, while
its advancement remains hindered due to the data scarcity and the absence
efficient methods. In this work we propose \textbf{FormaRL}, a simple yet
efficient reinforcement learning framework for autoformalization which only
requires a small amount of unlabeled data. FormaRL integrates syntax check from
Lean compiler and consistency check from large language model to calculate the
reward, and adopts GRPO algorithm to update the formalizer. We also curated a
proof problem dataset from undergraduate-level math materials, named
\textbf{uproof}, in the hope to facilitate the exploration of autoformalization
and theorem proving in advanced math. Experiments show that FormaRL can
increase the pass@1 autoformalization accuracy of Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct by
4 $\sim$ 6x (4.04\% $\to$ 26.15\% on ProofNet and 2.4\% $\to$ 9.6\% on uproof)
with merely 859 unlabeled data. And on uproof our method also achieved a strong
improvement in out-of-distribution performance compared to existing open-source
state-of-the-art autoformalizers on both pass@1 accuracy (6.2\% $\to$ 9.6\%)
and pass@16 accuracy (24.4\% $\to$ 33.6\%). Training code of FormaRL is

TL;DR: CTGraph是一个图级表示学习方法，用于自监督地分析学习者在智能辅导系统中的行为和表现，能够识别困难学生并提供学习旅程的全面视图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能辅导系统在教育中的广泛使用可能无意中加剧成绩差距，需要通过学生画像来跟踪进度、识别困难学生并减少学生间的差异。

Method: 提出CTGraph图级表示学习方法，以自监督方式分析学习者的行为和表现，考虑内容覆盖、学习强度和概念熟练度等多个方面。

Result: 实验表明CTGraph能提供学生学习的整体视图，识别困难学生，分析不同群体的差异，并准确定位学生何时何地遇到困难。

Conclusion: 该方法为教育工作者提供了对学生学习旅程的深入洞察，为更有针对性的干预措施铺平了道路。

Abstract: The surge in the adoption of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) in
education, while being integral to curriculum-based learning, can inadvertently
exacerbate performance gaps. To address this problem, student profiling becomes
crucial for tracking progress, identifying struggling students, and alleviating
disparities among students. Such profiling requires measuring student behaviors
and performance across different aspects, such as content coverage, learning
intensity, and proficiency in different concepts within a learning topic.
  In this study, we introduce CTGraph, a graph-level representation learning
approach to profile learner behaviors and performance in a self-supervised
manner. Our experiments demonstrate that CTGraph can provide a holistic view of
student learning journeys, accounting for different aspects of student
behaviors and performance, as well as variations in their learning paths as
aligned to the curriculum structure. We also show that our approach can
identify struggling students and provide comparative analysis of diverse groups
to pinpoint when and where students are struggling. As such, our approach opens
more opportunities to empower educators with rich insights into student
learning journeys and paves the way for more targeted interventions.

TL;DR: VISION是一个统一的漏洞检测框架，通过LLM生成反事实样本进行对比训练，减少GNN中的伪相关性学习，显著提升检测准确率和泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于GNN的漏洞检测方法受限于训练数据不平衡和标签噪声，容易学习到代码表面相似性带来的伪相关性，导致泛化性能差

Method: 使用LLM生成语义最小修改但标签相反的反事实样本，构建对比训练数据集，进行针对性GNN训练，并结合图解释性分析识别关键代码语句

Result: 在CWE-20漏洞检测中，总体准确率从51.8%提升到97.8%，对比准确率从4.5%提升到95.8%，最差组准确率从0.7%提升到85.5%

Conclusion: VISION框架有效减少了伪相关性学习，实现了更鲁棒和可泛化的漏洞检测，推动了透明可信的AI网络安全系统发展

Abstract: Automated detection of vulnerabilities in source code is an essential
cybersecurity challenge, underpinning trust in digital systems and services.
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach as they can
learn structural and logical code relationships in a data-driven manner.
However, their performance is severely constrained by training data imbalances
and label noise. GNNs often learn 'spurious' correlations from superficial code
similarities, producing detectors that fail to generalize well to unseen
real-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for robust and
interpretable vulnerability detection, called VISION, to mitigate spurious
correlations by systematically augmenting a counterfactual training dataset.
Counterfactuals are samples with minimal semantic modifications but opposite
labels. Our framework includes: (i) generating counterfactuals by prompting a
Large Language Model (LLM); (ii) targeted GNN training on paired code examples
with opposite labels; and (iii) graph-based interpretability to identify the
crucial code statements relevant for vulnerability predictions while ignoring
spurious ones. We find that VISION reduces spurious learning and enables more
robust, generalizable detection, improving overall accuracy (from 51.8% to
97.8%), pairwise contrast accuracy (from 4.5% to 95.8%), and worst-group
accuracy (from 0.7% to 85.5%) on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)-20
vulnerability. We further demonstrate gains using proposed metrics: intra-class
attribution variance, inter-class attribution distance, and node score
dependency. We also release CWE-20-CFA, a benchmark of 27,556 functions (real
and counterfactual) from the high-impact CWE-20 category. Finally, VISION
advances transparent and trustworthy AI-based cybersecurity systems through
interactive visualization for human-in-the-loop analysis.

Motivation: 现代神经网络和大语言模型存在幻觉效应、计算复杂度高、微调成本高、坏失忘等核心限制，影响在医疗、工业管理等关键领域的应用。

Method: 采用k近邻算法结合层次聚类结构，利用Kohonen自组织地图构建树状数据结构来加速近邻搜索，减少或消除幻觉效应。

Conclusion: 该方法具有透明可解释性，符合人类认知机制，在需要高可靠性和可解释结果的任务中具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Modern neural network technologies, including large language models, have
achieved remarkable success in various applied artificial intelligence
applications, however, they face a range of fundamental limitations. Among them
are hallucination effects, high computational complexity of training and
inference, costly fine-tuning, and catastrophic forgetting issues. These
limitations significantly hinder the use of neural networks in critical areas
such as medicine, industrial process management, and scientific research. This
article proposes an alternative approach based on the nearest neighbors method
with hierarchical clustering structures. Employing the k-nearest neighbors
algorithm significantly reduces or completely eliminates hallucination effects
while simplifying model expansion and fine-tuning without the need for
retraining the entire network. To overcome the high computational load of the
k-nearest neighbors method, the paper proposes using tree-like data structures
based on Kohonen self-organizing maps, thereby greatly accelerating nearest
neighbor searches. Tests conducted on handwritten digit recognition and simple
subtitle translation tasks confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed
approach. With only a slight reduction in accuracy, the nearest neighbor search
time was reduced hundreds of times compared to exhaustive search methods. The
proposed method features transparency and interpretability, closely aligns with
human cognitive mechanisms, and demonstrates potential for extensive use in
tasks requiring high reliability and explainable results.

Motivation: 解决混合专家模型在消费级边缘硬件上部署时因内存限制而需要动态专家卸载的挑战，免除传统策略仅将其视为调度问题的局限性。

Method: 基于专家重要性评估来指导卸载决策，将激活的低重要性专家替换为GPU内存中已缓存的功能相似专家，并采用最大化GPU缓存专家重用比的调度策略。

Result: 实验结果显示解码延迟降低48%，专家缓存命中率超过60%，同时保持近伤失准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了混合专家模型在边缘设备上的内存约束问题，在保持模型性能的同时大幅提升了运行效率。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a key technique for
scaling Large Language Models by activating only a subset of experts per query.
Deploying MoE on consumer-grade edge hardware, however, is constrained by
limited device memory, making dynamic expert offloading essential. Unlike prior
work that treats offloading purely as a scheduling problem, we leverage expert
importance to guide decisions, substituting low-importance activated experts
with functionally similar ones already cached in GPU memory, thereby preserving
accuracy. As a result, this design reduces memory usage and data transfer,
while largely eliminating PCIe overhead. In addition, we introduce a scheduling
policy that maximizes the reuse ratio of GPU-cached experts, further boosting
efficiency. Extensive evaluations show that our approach delivers 48% lower
decoding latency with over 60% expert cache hit rate, while maintaining nearly
lossless accuracy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究认知科学中的基本问题：社会规范如何被获取和表征，探索语言模型是否能够通过纯统计学习实现复杂的规范理解

Method: 通过两项研究系统评估多个AI系统预测人类社交适当性判断的能力，使用555个日常场景，比较AI预测与人类集体判断的匹配度

Result: GPT-4.5在连续尺度上预测集体判断的准确率超过所有人类参与者（100百分位），其他模型如Gemini 2.5 Pro、GPT-5、Claude Sonnet 4也分别超越98.7%、97.8%、96.0%的人类

Conclusion: 统计学习能够产生复杂的社会认知模型，语言作为文化知识传播的丰富存储库，但AI存在系统性相关错误，表明基于模式的社会理解存在潜在边界

Abstract: A fundamental question in cognitive science concerns how social norms are
acquired and represented. While humans typically learn norms through embodied
social experience, we investigated whether large language models can achieve
sophisticated norm understanding through statistical learning alone. Across two
studies, we systematically evaluated multiple AI systems' ability to predict
human social appropriateness judgments for 555 everyday scenarios by examining
how closely they predicted the average judgment compared to each human
participant. In Study 1, GPT-4.5's accuracy in predicting the collective
judgment on a continuous scale exceeded that of every human participant (100th
percentile). Study 2 replicated this, with Gemini 2.5 Pro outperforming 98.7%
of humans, GPT-5 97.8%, and Claude Sonnet 4 96.0%. Despite this predictive
power, all models showed systematic, correlated errors. These findings
demonstrate that sophisticated models of social cognition can emerge from
statistical learning over linguistic data alone, challenging strong versions of
theories emphasizing the exclusive necessity of embodied experience for
cultural competence. The systematic nature of AI limitations across different
architectures indicates potential boundaries of pattern-based social
understanding, while the models' ability to outperform nearly all individual
humans in this predictive task suggests that language serves as a remarkably
rich repository for cultural knowledge transmission.

Abstract: As AI advances toward general intelligence, the focus is shifting from
systems optimized for static tasks to creating open-ended agents that learn
continuously. In this paper, we introduce Experience-driven Lifelong Learning
(ELL), a framework for building self-evolving agents capable of continuous
growth through real-world interaction. The framework is built on four core
principles: (1) Experience Exploration: Agents learn through continuous,
self-motivated interaction with dynamic environments, navigating interdependent
tasks and generating rich experiential trajectories. (2) Long-term Memory:
Agents preserve and structure historical knowledge, including personal
experiences, domain expertise, and commonsense reasoning, into a persistent
memory system. (3) Skill Learning: Agents autonomously improve by abstracting
recurring patterns from experience into reusable skills, which are actively
refined and validated for application in new tasks. (4) Knowledge
Internalization: Agents internalize explicit and discrete experiences into
implicit and intuitive capabilities as "second nature".
  We also introduce StuLife, a benchmark dataset for ELL that simulates a
student's holistic college journey, from enrollment to academic and personal
development, across three core phases and ten detailed sub-scenarios. StuLife
is designed around three key paradigm shifts: From Passive to Proactive, From
Context to Memory, and From Imitation to Learning. In this dynamic environment,
agents must acquire and distill practical skills and maintain persistent memory
to make decisions based on evolving state variables. StuLife provides a
comprehensive platform for evaluating lifelong learning capabilities, including
memory retention, skill transfer, and self-motivated behavior. Beyond
evaluating SOTA LLMs on the StuLife benchmark, we also explore the role of
context engineering in advancing AGI.

Abstract: This study examines the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to support
phenomenological qualitative analysis of first-person experience in Borderline
Personality Disorder (BPD), understood as a disorder of temporality and
selfhood. Building on a prior human-led thematic analysis of 24 inpatients'
life-story interviews, we compared three LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4o, Google Gemini 2.5
Pro, Anthropic Claude Opus 4) prompted to mimic the interpretative style of the
original investigators. The models were evaluated with blinded and non-blinded
expert judges in phenomenology and clinical psychology. Assessments included
semantic congruence, Jaccard coefficients, and multidimensional validity
ratings (credibility, coherence, substantiveness, and groundness in data).
Results showed variable overlap with the human analysis, from 0 percent in GPT
to 42 percent in Claude and 58 percent in Gemini, and a low Jaccard coefficient
(0.21-0.28). However, the models recovered themes omitted by humans. Gemini's
output most closely resembled the human analysis, with validity scores
significantly higher than GPT and Claude (p < 0.0001), and was judged as human
by blinded experts. All scores strongly correlated (R > 0.78) with the quantity
of text and words per theme, highlighting both the variability and potential of
AI-augmented thematic analysis to mitigate human interpretative bias.

Abstract: The evolution of technology and education is driving the emergence of
Intelligent & Autonomous Tutoring Systems (IATS), where objective and
domain-agnostic methods for determining question difficulty are essential.
Traditional human labeling is subjective, and existing NLP-based approaches
fail in symbolic domains like algebra. This study introduces the Approach of
Passive Measures among Educands (APME), a reinforcement learning-based
Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework that estimates difficulty solely from solver
performance data -- marks obtained and time taken -- without requiring
linguistic features or expert labels. By leveraging the inverse coefficient of
variation as a risk-adjusted metric, the model provides an explainable and
scalable mechanism for adaptive assessment. Empirical validation was conducted
on three heterogeneous datasets. Across these diverse contexts, the model
achieved an average R2 of 0.9213 and an average RMSE of 0.0584, confirming its
robustness, accuracy, and adaptability to different educational levels and
assessment formats. Compared with baseline approaches-such as regression-based,
NLP-driven, and IRT models-the proposed framework consistently outperformed
alternatives, particularly in purely symbolic domains. The findings highlight
that (i) item heterogeneity strongly influences perceived difficulty, and (ii)
variance in solver outcomes is as critical as mean performance for adaptive
allocation. Pedagogically, the model aligns with Vygotskys Zone of Proximal
Development by identifying tasks that balance challenge and attainability,
supporting motivation while minimizing disengagement. This domain-agnostic,
self-supervised approach advances difficulty tagging in IATS and can be
extended beyond algebra wherever solver interaction data is available

defined by a hidden function that maps a specific set of inputs to outputs.
LLMs are required to unravel the hidden function behind the black-box by
interacting with it in given exploration turns, and reasoning over observed
input-output pairs. Leveraging this idea, we build the \textsc{Oracle}
benchmark which comprises 6 types of black-box task and 96 black-boxes. 19
modern LLMs are benchmarked. o3 ranks first in 5 of the 6 tasks, achieving over
70\% accuracy on most easy black-boxes. But it still struggles with some hard
black-box tasks, where its average performance drops below 40\%. Further
analysis indicates a universal difficulty among LLMs: They lack the high-level
planning capability to develop efficient and adaptive exploration strategies
for hypothesis refinement.

TL;DR: CMA是一个基于LLM的并发模块化代理框架，通过异步运行的多个模块实现灵活、自适应的行为，支持模块间通信和全局状态共享，是Minsky"心智社会"理论的实际实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统代理架构中长期存在的困难，让意图从自主进程间的语言介导交互中涌现，实现灵活、自适应和上下文相关的行为。

Method: 采用多个基于LLM的模块完全异步运行，通过模块间通信和单一共享全局状态来协调，将推理卸载给LLM处理。

Result: 通过两个实际用例研究证明了系统的可行性，观察到的涌现特性表明复杂认知现象（如自我意识）可能确实从简单过程的组织交互中产生。

Conclusion: 该框架支持Minsky的心智社会概念，为人工智能研究开辟了新途径，表明复杂认知可以从简单过程的组织交互中涌现。

Abstract: We introduce the Concurrent Modular Agent (CMA), a framework that
orchestrates multiple Large-Language-Model (LLM)-based modules that operate
fully asynchronously yet maintain a coherent and fault-tolerant behavioral
loop. This framework addresses long-standing difficulties in agent
architectures by letting intention emerge from language-mediated interactions
among autonomous processes. This approach enables flexible, adaptive, and
context-dependent behavior through the combination of concurrently executed
modules that offload reasoning to an LLM, inter-module communication, and a
single shared global state.We consider this approach to be a practical
realization of Minsky's Society of Mind theory. We demonstrate the viability of
our system through two practical use-case studies. The emergent properties
observed in our system suggest that complex cognitive phenomena like
self-awareness may indeed arise from the organized interaction of simpler
processes, supporting Minsky-Society of Mind concept and opening new avenues
for artificial intelligence research. The source code for our work is available

TL;DR: 论文发现大语言模型在数学推理中存在难度缩放定律，提出结构化解决方案模板(SST)框架，通过模板化训练和课程学习显著提升复杂数学问题的推理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后训练方法在捕捉复杂任务的深层程序逻辑方面仍有不足，研究发现训练数据难度与模型性能呈U型曲线关系，需要平衡数据难度来提升推理能力

Method: 提出SST框架：1)使用结构化解决方案模板链进行微调，动态加权损失优先处理程序逻辑；2)推理时注入解决方案模板作为认知支架；3)集成课程微调，明确教导模型自我规划-执行-自我纠正

Result: 在GSM8K、AIME24和新的Dynamic En基准测试中，SST显著提高了准确性和效率，特别是在更难的问题上表现突出

Conclusion: SST框架通过结构化模板和难度课程学习有效解决了大语言模型在程序推理方面的局限性，为提升复杂数学问题的推理能力提供了有效方案

Abstract: Structured, procedural reasoning is essential for Large Language Models
(LLMs), especially in mathematics. While post-training methods have improved
LLM performance, they still fall short in capturing deep procedural logic on
complex tasks. To tackle the issue, in this paper, we first investigate this
limitation and uncover a novel finding: a Scaling Law by Difficulty, which
reveals that model performance follows a U-shaped curve with respect to
training data complexity -- excessive low-difficulty data impedes abstraction,
while high-difficulty data significantly enhances reasoning ability. Motivated
by this, we propose the Structured Solution Template (SST) framework, which
uses solution templates and a curriculum of varied difficulty to explicitly
teach procedural reasoning. Specifically, SST comprises (1) fine-tuning with
structured solution-template chains and dynamically weighted loss to prioritize
procedural logic, (2) prompt-time injection of solution templates as cognitive
scaffolds to guide inference, and (3) integrated curriculum fine-tuning that
explicitly teaches the model to self-plan - execute - self-correct. Experiments
on GSM8K, AIME24, and new Dynamic En benchmark show that SST significantly
improves both accuracy and efficiency, especially on harder problems.

Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在电子健康记录中显示出提取信息和支持临床决策的潜力，但在临床部署中面临虚构风险的挑战

Method: 提出Hallucination Controlled Accuracy at k% (HCAcc@k%)指标，开发了包含步入式自信度估计的TrustEHRAgent系统，在MIMIC-III和eICU数据集上进行实验

Result: TrustEHRAgent在严格的可靠性约束下显著超过基线方法，在HCAcc@70%时分别提升44.23%和25.34%，而基线方法在这些阈值下失败

Conclusion: 传统准确率指标在评估健康管理AI组件时存在局限性，本研究有助于开发可信赖的临床组件，能够提供准确信息或在自信度低时透明地表达不确定性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for extracting information from
Electronic Health Records (EHR) and supporting clinical decisions. However,
deployment in clinical settings faces challenges due to hallucination risks. We
propose Hallucination Controlled Accuracy at k% (HCAcc@k%), a novel metric
quantifying the accuracy-reliability trade-off at varying confidence
thresholds. We introduce TrustEHRAgent, a confidence-aware agent incorporating
stepwise confidence estimation for clinical question answering. Experiments on
MIMIC-III and eICU datasets show TrustEHRAgent outperforms baselines under
strict reliability constraints, achieving improvements of 44.23%p and 25.34%p
at HCAcc@70% while baseline methods fail at these thresholds. These results
highlight limitations of traditional accuracy metrics in evaluating healthcare
AI agents. Our work contributes to developing trustworthy clinical agents that
deliver accurate information or transparently express uncertainty when
confidence is low.

Abstract: The emergence of advanced reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models
(LLMs) marks a transformative development in healthcare applications. Beyond
merely expanding functional capabilities, these reasoning mechanisms enhance
decision transparency and explainability-critical requirements in medical
contexts. This survey examines the transformation of medical LLMs from basic
information retrieval tools to sophisticated clinical reasoning systems capable
of supporting complex healthcare decisions. We provide a thorough analysis of
the enabling technological foundations, with a particular focus on specialized
prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought and recent breakthroughs in
Reinforcement Learning exemplified by DeepSeek-R1. Our investigation evaluates
purpose-built medical frameworks while also examining emerging paradigms such
as multi-agent collaborative systems and innovative prompting architectures.
The survey critically assesses current evaluation methodologies for medical
validation and addresses persistent challenges in field interpretation
limitations, bias mitigation strategies, patient safety frameworks, and
integration of multimodal clinical data. Through this survey, we seek to
establish a roadmap for developing reliable LLMs that can serve as effective
partners in clinical practice and medical research.

TL;DR: HDS-QA是一个合成数据集，用于训练大型推理模型区分并行和顺序查询，通过混合并行和顺序查询策略显著提升推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法顺序集成外部知识检索会增加推理延迟和上下文长度，降低连贯性和准确性，需要解决并行化查询的问题。

Method: 从Natural Questions自动生成HDS-QA合成数据集，包含并行可执行和顺序依赖的混合跳问题，并基于此微调LRM模型HybridDeepSearcher。

Result: 在多个基准测试中优于最先进基线，在FanOutQA和BrowseComp子集上分别获得+15.9和+11.5 F1提升，推理延迟显著降低。

Conclusion: 显式训练LRMs利用混合并行和顺序查询策略具有高效性、可扩展性和有效性。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. Existing methods enhance LRMs by
sequentially integrating external knowledge retrieval; models iteratively
generate queries, retrieve external information, and progressively reason over
this information. However, purely sequential querying increases inference
latency and context length, diminishing coherence and potentially reducing
accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce HDS-QA (Hybrid Deep Search
QA), a synthetic dataset automatically generated from Natural Questions,
explicitly designed to train LRMs to distinguish parallelizable from sequential
queries. HDS-QA comprises hybrid-hop questions that combine parallelizable
independent subqueries (executable simultaneously) and sequentially dependent
subqueries (requiring step-by-step resolution), along with synthetic
reasoning-querying-retrieval paths involving parallel queries. We fine-tune an
LRM using HDS-QA, naming the model HybridDeepSearcher, which outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines across multiple benchmarks, notably achieving +15.9
and +11.5 F1 on FanOutQA and a subset of BrowseComp, respectively, both
requiring comprehensive and exhaustive search. Experimental results highlight
two key advantages: HybridDeepSearcher reaches comparable accuracy with fewer
search turns, significantly reducing inference latency, and it effectively
scales as more turns are permitted. These results demonstrate the efficiency,
scalability, and effectiveness of explicitly training LRMs to leverage hybrid
parallel and sequential querying.

TL;DR: 提出了首个多集体算法集体行动（ACA）理论框架，研究多个集体如何在分类系统中协同植入信号来影响分类器决策


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ACA研究主要关注单一集体场景，但现实世界中集体行动往往是分散的、由多个目标可能重叠但策略不同的集体组成，需要理论框架来理解多集体协同作用

Method: 构建多集体ACA理论框架，分析集体规模大小和目标对齐程度如何影响分类器学习特征与目标类别之间的关联，通过植入信号（特征篡改）来偏置分类器

Result: 提供了关于集体规模和目标对齐程度作用及相互影响的量化结果，验证了多集体协同效应，补充了先前实证研究结果

Conclusion: 该框架为多集体ACA的整体性研究开辟了路径，为用户端通过协调数据修改来影响算法决策提供了理论基础，是对监管端政策和企业端模型设计的重要补充

Abstract: As learning systems increasingly influence everyday decisions, user-side
steering via Algorithmic Collective Action (ACA)-coordinated changes to shared
data-offers a complement to regulator-side policy and firm-side model design.
Although real-world actions have been traditionally decentralized and
fragmented into multiple collectives despite sharing overarching
objectives-with each collective differing in size, strategy, and actionable
goals, most of the ACA literature focused on single collective settings. In
this work, we present the first theoretical framework for ACA with multiple
collectives acting on the same system. In particular, we focus on collective
action in classification, studying how multiple collectives can plant signals,
i.e., bias a classifier to learn an association between an altered version of
the features and a chosen, possibly overlapping, set of target classes. We
provide quantitative results about the role and the interplay of collectives'
sizes and their alignment of goals. Our framework, by also complementing
previous empirical results, opens a path for a holistic treatment of ACA with
multiple collectives.

Conclusion: 游戏风格为分析智能体决策行为提供了有价值的视角，在游戏设计和交互式娱乐领域具有应甦潜力。风格有望成为构建人工普遍智能（AGI）的核心元素之一，未来可以在更广泛的领域扩展研究。

Abstract: Contemporary artificial intelligence (AI) development largely centers on
rational decision-making, valued for its measurability and suitability for
objective evaluation. Yet in real-world contexts, an intelligent agent's
decisions are shaped not only by logic but also by deeper influences such as
beliefs, values, and preferences. The diversity of human decision-making styles
emerges from these differences, highlighting that "style" is an essential but
often overlooked dimension of intelligence.
  This dissertation introduces playstyle as an alternative lens for observing
and analyzing the decision-making behavior of intelligent agents, and examines
its foundational meaning and historical context from a philosophical
perspective. By analyzing how beliefs and values drive intentions and actions,
we construct a two-tier framework for style formation: the external interaction
loop with the environment and the internal cognitive loop of deliberation. On
this basis, we formalize style-related characteristics and propose measurable
indicators such as style capacity, style popularity, and evolutionary dynamics.
  The study focuses on three core research directions: (1) Defining and
measuring playstyle, proposing a general playstyle metric based on discretized
state spaces, and extending it to quantify strategic diversity and competitive
balance; (2) Expressing and generating playstyle, exploring how reinforcement
learning and imitation learning can be used to train agents exhibiting specific
stylistic tendencies, and introducing a novel approach for human-like style
learning and modeling; and (3) Practical applications, analyzing the potential
of these techniques in domains such as game design and interactive
entertainment.
  Finally, the dissertation outlines future extensions, including the role of
style as a core element in building artificial general intelligence (AGI).

TL;DR: MATRIX是一个用于临床对话系统安全评估的多智能体仿真框架，整合了安全对齐的临床场景分类、基于LLM的安全评估器BehvJudge和模拟患者代理PatBot，实现了系统化、可扩展的安全评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型临床对话系统评估主要关注任务完成度和流畅性，缺乏对安全关键系统所需的行为和风险管理要求的深入评估，需要开发专门的安全导向评估框架。

Method: MATRIX框架包含三个核心组件：(1)基于安全工程方法的安全对齐临床场景分类体系；(2)基于LLM的安全评估器BehvJudge，用于检测安全相关对话失败；(3)模拟患者代理PatBot，生成多样化场景条件响应。

Result: BehvJudge使用Gemini 2.5-Pro达到专家级危险检测水平（F1 0.96，灵敏度0.999），在240个对话的盲评中优于临床医生。PatBot在定量和定性评估中可靠地模拟真实患者行为。

Conclusion: MATRIX是首个将结构化安全工程与可扩展、经过验证的对话AI评估相统一的框架，支持监管对齐的安全审计，为临床对话系统的安全评估提供了系统化解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the growing use of large language models (LLMs) in clinical dialogue
systems, existing evaluations focus on task completion or fluency, offering
little insight into the behavioral and risk management requirements essential
for safety-critical systems. This paper presents MATRIX (Multi-Agent simulaTion
fRamework for safe Interactions and conteXtual clinical conversational
evaluation), a structured, extensible framework for safety-oriented evaluation
of clinical dialogue agents.
  MATRIX integrates three components: (1) a safety-aligned taxonomy of clinical
scenarios, expected system behaviors and failure modes derived through
structured safety engineering methods; (2) BehvJudge, an LLM-based evaluator
for detecting safety-relevant dialogue failures, validated against expert
clinician annotations; and (3) PatBot, a simulated patient agent capable of
producing diverse, scenario-conditioned responses, evaluated for realism and
behavioral fidelity with human factors expertise, and a patient-preference
study.
  Across three experiments, we show that MATRIX enables systematic, scalable
safety evaluation. BehvJudge with Gemini 2.5-Pro achieves expert-level hazard
detection (F1 0.96, sensitivity 0.999), outperforming clinicians in a blinded
assessment of 240 dialogues. We also conducted one of the first realism
analyses of LLM-based patient simulation, showing that PatBot reliably
simulates realistic patient behavior in quantitative and qualitative
evaluations. Using MATRIX, we demonstrate its effectiveness in benchmarking
five LLM agents across 2,100 simulated dialogues spanning 14 hazard scenarios
and 10 clinical domains.
  MATRIX is the first framework to unify structured safety engineering with
scalable, validated conversational AI evaluation, enabling regulator-aligned
safety auditing. We release all evaluation tools, prompts, structured
scenarios, and datasets.

Abstract: This paper revisits Ramon Llull's Ars combinatoria - a medieval framework for
generating knowledge through symbolic recombination - as a conceptual
foundation for building a modern Llull's thinking machine for research
ideation. Our approach defines three compositional axes: Theme (e.g.,
efficiency, adaptivity), Domain (e.g., question answering, machine
translation), and Method (e.g., adversarial training, linear attention). These
elements represent high-level abstractions common in scientific work -
motivations, problem settings, and technical approaches - and serve as building
blocks for LLM-driven exploration. We mine elements from human experts or
conference papers and show that prompting LLMs with curated combinations
produces research ideas that are diverse, relevant, and grounded in current
literature. This modern thinking machine offers a lightweight, interpretable
tool for augmenting scientific creativity and suggests a path toward
collaborative ideation between humans and AI.

Motivation: 目前的过程奖励模型存在两大问题：一是仅作为分类器而无法提供解释，二是依赖静态数据集的监督学习限制了模型的沿升能力。

Method: 将步骤奖励建模重构为推理任务，设计了生成式判断模型StepWiser，让模型先进行思考（输出思考token）再做出最终判断，通过强化学习和相对滚动结果进行训练。

Conclusion: 通过将奖励模型重构为元推理任务，生成式判断模型StepWiser能够更有效地监督多步推理过程，提高了逻辑有效性的监督能力。

Abstract: As models increasingly leverage multi-step reasoning strategies to solve
complex problems, supervising the logical validity of these intermediate steps
has become a critical research challenge. Process reward models address this by
providing step-by-step feedback, but current approaches have two major
drawbacks: they typically function as classifiers without providing
explanations, and their reliance on supervised fine-tuning with static datasets
limits generalization. Inspired by recent advances, we reframe stepwise reward
modeling from a classification task to a reasoning task itself. We thus propose
a generative judge that reasons about the policy model's reasoning steps (i.e.,
meta-reasons), outputting thinking tokens before delivering a final verdict.
Our model, StepWiser, is trained by reinforcement learning using relative
outcomes of rollouts. We show it provides (i) better judgment accuracy on
intermediate steps than existing methods; (ii) can be used to improve the
policy model at training time; and (iii) improves inference-time search.

Method: 通过分析已有文献，系统调查MCP作为统一范式的能力，提出包含自适应机制、上下文感知框架、统一模型、集成策略和MCP架构的五类分类法。

Result: 研究发现：传统传输协议已达到孤立适应的极限；MCP的客户端-服务器和JSON-RPC结构支持语义互操作性；AI驱动的传输需要特别适合MCP的集成范式。

Conclusion: MCP为下一代自适应、上下文感知和智能交通基础设施奠定了基础，文献分析表明现有工作已隐式趋近MCP类架构，标志着从碎片化解决方案向标准化集成框架的自然演进。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of interconnected devices, autonomous systems, and AI
applications has created severe fragmentation in adaptive transport systems,
where diverse protocols and context sources remain isolated. This survey
provides the first systematic investigation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
as a unifying paradigm, highlighting its ability to bridge protocol-level
adaptation with context-aware decision making. Analyzing established
literature, we show that existing efforts have implicitly converged toward
MCP-like architectures, signaling a natural evolution from fragmented solutions
to standardized integration frameworks. We propose a five-category taxonomy
covering adaptive mechanisms, context-aware frameworks, unification models,
integration strategies, and MCP-enabled architectures. Our findings reveal
three key insights: traditional transport protocols have reached the limits of
isolated adaptation, MCP's client-server and JSON-RPC structure enables
semantic interoperability, and AI-driven transport demands integration
paradigms uniquely suited to MCP. Finally, we present a research roadmap
positioning MCP as a foundation for next-generation adaptive, context-aware,
and intelligent transport infrastructures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑梗士性病是全球第二大死因和第三大殚病原因，常规的计算支持方法存在两大问题：一是单一机构数据训练的模型缺乏变化性和普遵性，二是许多临床中心缺乏足够的标签数据来调整专用解决方案。

Method: 开发了一种协同框架，通过聚合学习技术分享来自不同医疗中心的深度中心独立表征，在保护数据隐私的同时实现知识共享。采用FedAvg算法，在14个模拟医疗中心的2031个研究案例上进行训练。

Result: FedAvg模型在所有中心达到了总体DSC为0.71±0.24，AVD为5.29±22.74，ALD为2.16±3.60，LF1为0.70±0.26，表现超过了集中式和其他聚合学习规则。模型展现出强大的演化能力，在不同病变类型间保持一致性能，并在分布外中心也保持可靠性能（DSC为0.64±0.29，AVD为4.44±8.74，无需额外训练）。

Conclusion: 该协同聚合学习框架有效解决了脑梗士病变分割中的数据局限性和模型普遵性问题，通过分享中心独立表征实现了更好的性能和更强的演化能力，为多中心临床数据协作分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of
disability worldwide. Clinical guidelines establish diffusion resonance imaging
(DWI, ADC) as the standard for localizing, characterizing, and measuring
infarct volume, enabling treatment support and prognosis. Nonetheless, such
lesion analysis is highly variable due to different patient demographics,
scanner vendors, and expert annotations. Computational support approaches have
been key to helping with the localization and segmentation of lesions. However,
these strategies are dedicated solutions that learn patterns from only one
institution, lacking the variability to generalize geometrical lesions shape
models. Even worse, many clinical centers lack sufficient labeled samples to
adjust these dedicated solutions. This work developed a collaborative framework
for segmenting ischemic stroke lesions in DWI sequences by sharing knowledge
from deep center-independent representations. From 14 emulated healthcare
centers with 2031 studies, the FedAvg model achieved a general DSC of $0.71 \pm
0.24$, AVD of $5.29 \pm 22.74$, ALD of $2.16 \pm 3.60$ and LF1 of $0.70 \pm
0.26$ over all centers, outperforming both the centralized and other federated
rules. Interestingly, the model demonstrated strong generalization properties,
showing uniform performance across different lesion categories and reliable
performance in out-of-distribution centers (with DSC of $0.64 \pm 0.29$ and AVD
of $4.44 \pm 8.74$ without any additional training).

Abstract: The development of artificial intelligence models for macular edema (ME)
analy-sis always relies on expert-annotated pixel-level image datasets which
are expen-sive to collect prospectively. While anomaly-detection-based
weakly-supervised methods have shown promise in edema area (EA) segmentation
task, their per-formance still lags behind fully-supervised approaches. In this
paper, we leverage the strong correlation between EA and retinal layers in
spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images, along with the
update characteristics of weakly-supervised learning, to enhance an
off-the-shelf adversarial framework for EA segmentation with a novel
layer-structure-guided post-processing step and a test-time-adaptation (TTA)
strategy. By incorporating additional retinal lay-er information, our framework
reframes the dense EA prediction task as one of confirming intersection points
between the EA contour and retinal layers, result-ing in predictions that
better align with the shape prior of EA. Besides, the TTA framework further
helps address discrepancies in the manifestations and presen-tations of EA
between training and test sets. Extensive experiments on two pub-licly
available datasets demonstrate that these two proposed ingredients can im-prove
the accuracy and robustness of EA segmentation, bridging the gap between
weakly-supervised and fully-supervised models.

Motivation: MRI采集耗时过长，但对于分割等下游任务并不需要完美重建。现有方法缺乏统一评估标准，需要全面比较以确定最优的过采样MRI分割策略

Method: 构建统一基准测试框架，比较7种一阶段和两阶段方法，使用包含多纳线圆k空间数据和人工标注分割真值的两个MRI数据集

Conclusion: 对于过采样MRI数据分割，考虑数据一致性的传统两阶段方法是最优选择，该研究为该领域提供了重要的基准测试和指导

Abstract: MR imaging is a valuable diagnostic tool allowing to non-invasively visualize
patient anatomy and pathology with high soft-tissue contrast. However, MRI
acquisition is typically time-consuming, leading to patient discomfort and
increased costs to the healthcare system. Recent years have seen substantial
research effort into the development of methods that allow for accelerated MRI
acquisition while still obtaining a reconstruction that appears similar to the
fully-sampled MR image. However, for many applications a perfectly
reconstructed MR image may not be necessary, particularly, when the primary
goal is a downstream task such as segmentation. This has led to growing
interest in methods that aim to perform segmentation directly on accelerated
MRI data. Despite recent advances, existing methods have largely been developed
in isolation, without direct comparison to one another, often using separate or
private datasets, and lacking unified evaluation standards. To date, no
high-quality, comprehensive comparison of these methods exists, and the optimal
strategy for segmenting accelerated MR data remains unknown. This paper
provides the first unified benchmark for the segmentation of undersampled MRI
data comparing 7 approaches. A particular focus is placed on comparing
\textit{one-stage approaches}, that combine reconstruction and segmentation
into a unified model, with \textit{two-stage approaches}, that utilize
established MRI reconstruction methods followed by a segmentation network. We
test these methods on two MRI datasets that include multi-coil k-space data as
well as a human-annotated segmentation ground-truth. We find that simple
two-stage methods that consider data-consistency lead to the best segmentation
scores, surpassing complex specialized methods that are developed specifically
for this task.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: RDDM是一种端到端的RAW域扩散模型，直接从传感器RAW数据恢复照片级真实图像，避免了传统sRGB域方法的局限性，通过RAW域VAE和可微分后色调处理模块实现更高质量图像恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有sRGB域扩散模型在处理有损sRGB输入时面临高保真度和真实生成之间的困境，且忽略了传感器RAW图像在许多场景下的可访问性，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出RAW域扩散模型(RDDM)，包括：1) RAW域VAE学习最优潜在表示；2) 可微分后色调处理模块实现RAW和sRGB空间联合优化；3) 可扩展退化管道从现有sRGB数据集合成RAW LQ-HQ对；4) 可配置多拜耳LoRA模块处理不同RAW模式。

Result: 大量实验证明RDDM优于最先进的sRGB扩散方法，产生更高保真度结果且伪影更少。

Conclusion: RDDM通过直接在RAW域处理图像，成功规避了传统方法的局限性，为图像恢复任务提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: We present the RAW domain diffusion model (RDDM), an end-to-end diffusion
model that restores photo-realistic images directly from the sensor RAW data.
While recent sRGB-domain diffusion methods achieve impressive results, they are
caught in a dilemma between high fidelity and realistic generation. As these
models process lossy sRGB inputs and neglect the accessibility of the sensor
RAW images in many scenarios, e.g., in image and video capturing in edge
devices, resulting in sub-optimal performance. RDDM bypasses this limitation by
directly restoring images in the RAW domain, replacing the conventional
two-stage image signal processing (ISP) + IR pipeline. However, a simple
adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models to the RAW domain confronts the
out-of-distribution (OOD) issues. To this end, we propose: (1) a RAW-domain VAE
(RVAE) learning optimal latent representations, (2) a differentiable Post Tone
Processing (PTP) module enabling joint RAW and sRGB space optimization. To
compensate for the deficiency in the dataset, we develop a scalable degradation
pipeline synthesizing RAW LQ-HQ pairs from existing sRGB datasets for
large-scale training. Furthermore, we devise a configurable multi-bayer (CMB)
LoRA module handling diverse RAW patterns such as RGGB, BGGR, etc. Extensive
experiments demonstrate RDDM's superiority over state-of-the-art sRGB diffusion
methods, yielding higher fidelity results with fewer artifacts.

Abstract: Training a generative model on a single human skeletal motion sequence
without being bound to a specific kinematic tree has drawn significant
attention from the animation community. Unlike text-to-motion generation,
single-shot models allow animators to controllably generate variations of
existing motion patterns without requiring additional data or extensive
retraining. However, existing single-shot methods do not explicitly offer a
controllable framework for blending two or more motions within a single
generative pass. In this paper, we present the first single-shot motion
blending framework that enables seamless blending by temporally conditioning
the generation process. Our method introduces a skeleton-aware normalization
mechanism to guide the transition between motions, allowing smooth, data-driven
control over when and how motions blend. We perform extensive quantitative and
qualitative evaluations across various animation styles and different kinematic
skeletons, demonstrating that our approach produces plausible, smooth, and
controllable motion blends in a unified and efficient manner.

Abstract: Radiance fields have revolutionized photo-realistic 3D scene visualization by
enabling high-fidelity reconstruction of complex environments, making them an
ideal match for light field displays. However, integrating these technologies
presents significant computational challenges, as light field displays require
multiple high-resolution renderings from slightly shifted viewpoints, while
radiance fields rely on computationally intensive volume rendering. In this
paper, we propose a unified and efficient framework for real-time radiance
field rendering on light field displays. Our method supports a wide range of
radiance field representations, including NeRFs, 3D Gaussian Splatting, and
Sparse Voxels, within a shared architecture based on a single-pass plane
sweeping strategy and caching of shared, non-directional components. The
framework generalizes across different scene formats without retraining, and
avoids redundant computation across views. We further demonstrate a real-time
interactive application on a Looking Glass display, achieving 200+ FPS at 512p
across 45 views, enabling seamless, immersive 3D interaction. On standard
benchmarks, our method achieves up to 22x speedup compared to independently
rendering each view, while preserving image quality.

Method: 采用分类扩散模型生成连贯的语义地图，然后使用基于交叉注意力的网络预测家具放置位置，同时考虑门窗等建筑元素。

Result: 在3D-FRONT数据集上的实验表明，该方法能够生成空间连贯、真实且多样化的场景，性能优于先前方法。

Conclusion: SemLayoutDiff提供了一个有效的统一框架，能够生成符合建筑约束的多样化3D室内场景，解决了现有方法在条件合成方面的局限性。

Abstract: We present SemLayoutDiff, a unified model for synthesizing diverse 3D indoor
scenes across multiple room types. The model introduces a scene layout
representation combining a top-down semantic map and attributes for each
object. Unlike prior approaches, which cannot condition on architectural
constraints, SemLayoutDiff employs a categorical diffusion model capable of
conditioning scene synthesis explicitly on room masks. It first generates a
coherent semantic map, followed by a cross-attention-based network to predict
furniture placements that respect the synthesized layout. Our method also
accounts for architectural elements such as doors and windows, ensuring that
generated furniture arrangements remain practical and unobstructed. Experiments
on the 3D-FRONT dataset show that SemLayoutDiff produces spatially coherent,
realistic, and varied scenes, outperforming previous methods.

Motivation: 现有头发合成方法需要复杂的数据采集设备，在受限工作室环境中拍摄多视角图像，且头发体积估计和发丝合成时间较长，效率低下。

Method: 使用知识蒸馏从预训练生成教师模型中学习，估计头部几何体为符号距离场，预测头发区域的语义分割掩码和3D方向，支持潜在空间操作生成多样化发型。

Conclusion: PanoHair提供了一种简化的替代方案，避免了复杂的多视角数据采集设置，实现了高效、高质量的头发合成，为创建逼真数字人提供了重要技术支撑。

Abstract: Achieving realistic hair strand synthesis is essential for creating lifelike
digital humans, but producing high-fidelity hair strand geometry remains a
significant challenge. Existing methods require a complex setup for data
acquisition, involving multi-view images captured in constrained studio
environments. Additionally, these methods have longer hair volume estimation
and strand synthesis times, which hinder efficiency. We introduce PanoHair, a
model that estimates head geometry as signed distance fields using knowledge
distillation from a pre-trained generative teacher model for head synthesis.
Our approach enables the prediction of semantic segmentation masks and 3D
orientations specifically for the hair region of the estimated geometry. Our
method is generative and can generate diverse hairstyles with latent space
manipulations. For real images, our approach involves an inversion process to
infer latent codes and produces visually appealing hair strands, offering a
streamlined alternative to complex multi-view data acquisition setups. Given
the latent code, PanoHair generates a clean manifold mesh for the hair region
in under 5 seconds, along with semantic and orientation maps, marking a
significant improvement over existing methods, as demonstrated in our
experiments.

Motivation: INPC虽然在新视角合成中实现了最先进的图像质量，但由于渲染过程中需要查询神经网络，其实际应用受到较慢渲染速度的限制

Method: 改进的光栅化器实现、更有效的采样技术、为空洞填充CNN加入预训练，以及在推理时将点建模为小型高斯分布

Conclusion: 这些优化方法不仅适用于INPC，还具有广泛的适用性，能够显著提升神经点云表示的实用性

Abstract: Implicit Neural Point Cloud (INPC) is a recent hybrid representation that
combines the expressiveness of neural fields with the efficiency of point-based
rendering, achieving state-of-the-art image quality in novel view synthesis.
However, as with other high-quality approaches that query neural networks
during rendering, the practical usability of INPC is limited by comparatively
slow rendering. In this work, we present a collection of optimizations that
significantly improve both the training and inference performance of INPC
without sacrificing visual fidelity. The most significant modifications are an
improved rasterizer implementation, more effective sampling techniques, and the
incorporation of pre-training for the convolutional neural network used for
hole-filling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that points can be modeled as small
Gaussians during inference to further improve quality in extrapolated, e.g.,
close-up views of the scene. We design our implementations to be broadly
applicable beyond INPC and systematically evaluate each modification in a
series of experiments. Our optimized INPC pipeline achieves up to 25% faster
training, 2x faster rendering, and 20% reduced VRAM usage paired with slight
image quality improvements.

Conclusion: EMind为电磁信号处理提供了有效的统一框架，通过物理特性利用和大规模预训练解决了该领域的核心挑战。

Abstract: Deep understanding of electromagnetic signals is fundamental to dynamic
spectrum management, intelligent transportation, autonomous driving and
unmanned vehicle perception. The field faces challenges because electromagnetic
signals differ greatly from text and images, showing high heterogeneity, strong
background noise and complex joint time frequency structure, which prevents
existing general models from direct use. Electromagnetic communication and
sensing tasks are diverse, current methods lack cross task generalization and
transfer efficiency, and the scarcity of large high quality datasets blocks the
creation of a truly general multitask learning framework. To overcome these
issue, we introduce EMind, an electromagnetic signals foundation model that
bridges large scale pretraining and the unique nature of this modality. We
build the first unified and largest standardized electromagnetic signal dataset
covering multiple signal types and tasks. By exploiting the physical properties
of electromagnetic signals, we devise a length adaptive multi-signal packing
method and a hardware-aware training strategy that enable efficient use and
representation learning from heterogeneous multi-source signals. Experiments
show that EMind achieves strong performance and broad generalization across
many downstream tasks, moving decisively from task specific models to a unified
framework for electromagnetic intelligence. The code is available at:
