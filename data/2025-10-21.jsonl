Unlike traditional AI\nresearch asking \"what is intelligence?\" (ontological), SCL asks \"under what\nconditions does cognition emerge?\" (epistemological). Grounded in philosophy of\nmind and cognitive phenomenology, SCL bridges conceptual philosophy and\nimplementable cognition. Drawing on process philosophy, enactive cognition, and\nextended mind theory, we define intelligence not as a property but as a\nperformed process -- a continuous loop of judgment, memory, control, action,\nand regulation. SCL makes three contributions. First, it operationalizes\nphilosophical insights into computationally interpretable structures, enabling\n\"executable epistemology\" -- philosophy as structural experiment. Second, it\nshows that functional separation within cognitive architecture yields more\ncoherent and interpretable behavior than monolithic prompt based systems,\nsupported by agent evaluations. Third, it redefines intelligence: not\nrepresentational accuracy but the capacity to reconstruct its own epistemic\nstate through intentional understanding. This framework impacts philosophy of\nmind, epistemology, and AI. For philosophy, it allows theories of cognition to\nbe enacted and tested. For AI, it grounds behavior in epistemic structure\nrather than statistical regularity.

The design enables the independent control of diversity nature by\nmanipulating stream composition (contextual structure) and the diversity level\nby varying which statistical streams each fact appears in. Through controlled\nexperiments, we find that while higher contextual diversity delays\nin-distribution (ID) factual accuracy, its impact on out-of-distribution (OOD)\nfactual generalization depends critically on contextual structure. In some\ncases, OOD performance follows the same trend as ID, but in others, diversity\nbecomes essential for non-trivial factual recall. Even when low diversity\nprohibits factual recall, optimal diversity levels depend on training duration.\nBeyond factual recall failures, we identify structures where statistical\ngeneralization fails independently, and others where both capabilities degrade.\nThis shows how the interplay between contextual design and diversity level\nimpacts different generalization aspects.

To appear in IJCNN 2025", "summary": "Argument Mining (AM) helps in automating the extraction of complex\nargumentative structures such as Argument Components (ACs) like Premise, Claim\netc. and Argumentative Relations (ARs) like Support, Attack etc. in an\nargumentative text. Due to the inherent complexity of reasoning involved with\nthis task, modelling dependencies between ACs and ARs is challenging. Most of\nthe recent approaches formulate this task through a generative paradigm by\nflattening the argumentative structures. In contrast to that, this study\njointly formulates the key tasks of AM in an end-to-end fashion using\nAutoregressive Argumentative Structure Prediction (AASP) framework. The\nproposed AASP framework is based on the autoregressive structure prediction\nframework that has given good performance for several NLP tasks. AASP framework\nmodels the argumentative structures as constrained pre-defined sets of actions\nwith the help of a conditional pre-trained language model. These actions build\nthe argumentative structures step-by-step in an autoregressive manner to\ncapture the flow of argumentative reasoning in an efficient way. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on three standard AM benchmarks demonstrate that AASP\nachieves state-of-theart (SoTA) results across all AM tasks in two benchmarks\nand delivers strong results in one benchmark."}

Their linear complexity and hidden-state\nrecurrence make them particularly attractive for modeling long sequences,\nwhereas attention becomes quadratically expensive. However, current training\nmethods for video understanding are tailored towards transformers and fail to\nfully leverage the unique attributes of SSMs. For example, video models are\noften trained at a fixed resolution and video length to balance the quadratic\nscaling of attention cost against performance. Consequently, these models\nsuffer from degraded performance when evaluated on videos with spatial and\ntemporal resolutions unseen during training; a property we call spatio-temporal\ninflexibility. In the context of action recognition, this severely limits a\nmodel's ability to retain performance across both short- and long-form videos.\nTherefore, we propose a flexible training method that leverages and improves\nthe inherent adaptability of SSMs. Our method samples videos at varying\ntemporal and spatial resolutions during training and dynamically interpolates\nmodel weights to accommodate any spatio-temporal scale. This instills our SSM,\nwhich we call StretchySnake, with spatio-temporal flexibility and enables it to\nseamlessly handle videos ranging from short, fine-grained clips to long,\ncomplex activities. We introduce and compare five different variants of\nflexible training, and identify the most effective strategy for video SSMs. On\nshort-action (UCF-101, HMDB-51) and long-action (COIN, Breakfast) benchmarks,\nStretchySnake outperforms transformer and SSM baselines alike by up to 28%,\nwith strong adaptability to fine-grained actions (SSV2, Diving-48). Therefore,\nour method provides a simple drop-in training recipe that makes video SSMs more\nrobust, resolution-agnostic, and efficient across diverse action recognition\nscenarios."}

The\ncore of our approach lies in decoupling tasks into two distinct phases: Offline\nknowledge ingestion and online task processing. During knowledge ingestion, an\nLLM translates an informal problem specification into a formal, symbolic\nknowledge base. This formal representation is crucial as it can be verified and\nrefined by human experts, ensuring its correctness and alignment with domain\nrequirements. In the subsequent task processing phase, each incoming input is\nencoded into the same formal language.

We also use same-language country\npairs to disentangle language from cultural aspects.

This has created a void in the\nunderstanding of the vision encoder, which determines how MLLMs perceive\nimages. The recent shift in MLLM training paradigms, from Supervised Finetuning\n(SFT) to Reinforcement Learning (RL), magnifies this oversight-namely, the\nsignificant lack of analysis on how such training reshapes the vision encoder\nas well as the MLLM. To address this, we first investigate the impact of\ntraining strategies on MLLMs, where RL shows a clear advantage over SFT in\nstrongly vision-related VQA benchmarks. Motivated by this, we conduct a\ncritical yet under-explored analysis of the vision encoder of MLLMs through\ndiverse and in-depth experiments, ranging from ImageNet classification and\nsegmentation to gradient visualization. Our results demonstrate that MLLM's\npost-training strategy (i.e., SFT or RL) not only leads to distinct outcomes on\nMLLM downstream tasks, but also fundamentally reshapes MLLM's underlying visual\nrepresentations. Specifically, the key finding of our study is that RL produces\nstronger and precisely localized visual representations compared to SFT,\nboosting the ability of the vision encoder for MLLM. We then reframe our\nfindings into a simple recipe for building strong vision encoders for MLLMs,\nPreference-Instructed Vision OpTimization (PIVOT). When integrated into MLLMs,\na PIVOT-trained vision encoder outperforms even larger and more heavily-trained\ncounterparts, despite requiring less than 1% of the computational cost of\nstandard vision pretraining.

While\nsimilar to conventional decoding errors in potentially compromising the\nusability of transcriptions for downstream applications, hallucinations can be\nmore detrimental due to their preservation of syntactically and semantically\nplausible structure. This apparent coherence can mislead subsequent processing\nstages and introduce serious risks, particularly in critical domains such as\nhealthcare and law. Conventional evaluation metrics are primarily centered on\nerror-based metrics and fail to distinguish between phonetic inaccuracies and\nhallucinations. Consequently, there is a critical need for new evaluation\nframeworks that can effectively identify and assess models with a heightened\npropensity for generating hallucinated content. To this end, we introduce\nSHALLOW, the first benchmark framework that systematically categorizes and\nquantifies hallucination phenomena in ASR along four complementary axes:\nlexical, phonetic, morphological, and semantic. We define targeted metrics\nwithin each category to produce interpretable profiles of model behavior.\nThrough evaluation across various architectures and speech domains, we have\nfound that SHALLOW metrics correlate strongly with word error rate (WER) when\nrecognition quality is high (i.e., low WER).

While powerful models exist for\nhumans and animals, equally expressive approaches for modeling plants are\nlacking. In this work, we present Demeter, a data-driven parametric model that\nencodes key factors of a plant morphology, including topology, shape,\narticulation, and deformation into a compact learned representation. Unlike\nprevious parametric models, Demeter handles varying shape topology across\nvarious species and models three sources of shape variation: articulation,\nsubcomponent shape variation, and non-rigid deformation. To advance crop plant\nmodeling, we collected a large-scale, ground-truthed dataset from a soybean\nfarm as a testbed.

For example, \"summer is approaching\" parallels \"We\nare approaching the summer\". In such expressions, humans rely on a frame of\nreference (FoR) to interpret meaning relative to a particular viewpoint.\nExtending this concept to time, a temporal frame of reference (t-FoR) defines\nhow temporal relations are perceived relative to an experiencer's moment of\n\"now\". While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advances in\nnatural language understanding, their ability to interpret and reason about\ntime remains limited. In this work, we introduce TUuD (Temporal Understanding\nunder Deictic t-FoR), a framework that evaluates how LLMs interpret time-event\nand event-event relations when the reference point of \"now\" dynamically shifts\nalong a timeline. Following recent work on temporal cognition\n\\cite{li2025other}, LLMs are prompted to rate the similarity between the\ncurrent moment and a target event from 0.00 (completely dissimilar) to 1.00\n(highly similar), where similarity quantifies perceived temporal alignment\nbetween the two points. Our results show that four evaluated LLMs exhibit\nmeasurable adaptation to a deictic t-FoR, with similarity ratings peaking\naround the present and decreasing toward past and future events. The\nadaptation, however, weakens beyond near-term contexts, suggesting that while\nLLMs display partial human-like temporal cognition, their temporal reasoning\nremains sensitive to reference-frame shifts and temporal distance."}

In this paper, we introduce REALM, an\ninnovative MLLM-agent framework that enables open-world reasoning-based\nsegmentation without requiring extensive 3D-specific post-training. We perform\nsegmentation directly on 3D Gaussian Splatting representations, capitalizing on\ntheir ability to render photorealistic novel views that are highly suitable for\nMLLM comprehension.

In this paper, we introduce REconstruction and Alignment of text\nDescriptions (READ), a fine-tuning method designed to enhance compositional\nreasoning by adding two auxiliary objectives to the contrastive learning: (1) a\ntoken-level reconstruction objective, where a frozen pre-trained decoder\nreconstructs alternative captions based on the embedding of the original\ncaption; and (2) a sentence-level alignment objective, which explicitly aligns\nparaphrased sentences in the embedding space. We show that READ-CLIP, a model\nderived by applying the READ method to the pre-trained CLIP model, achieves the\nstate-of-the-art performance across five major compositional reasoning\nbenchmarks, outperforming the strongest conventional fine-tuning baseline by up\nto 4.1%.

Optimized using deep learning, UTAP comprises a fixed and weak\nnoise pattern that, when added to a pathology image, systematically disrupts\nthe feature representation capabilities of multiple pathology foundation\nmodels. Therefore, UTAP induces performance drops in downstream tasks that\nutilize foundation models, including misclassification across a wide range of\nunseen data distributions. In addition to compromising the model performance,\nwe demonstrate two key features of UTAP: (1) universality: its perturbation can\nbe applied across diverse field-of-views independent of the dataset that UTAP\nwas developed on, and (2) transferability: its perturbation can successfully\ndegrade the performance of various external, black-box pathology foundation\nmodels - never seen before. These two features indicate that UTAP is not a\ndedicated attack associated with a specific foundation model or image dataset,\nbut rather constitutes a broad threat to various emerging pathology foundation\nmodels and their applications. We systematically evaluated UTAP across various\nstate-of-the-art pathology foundation models on multiple datasets, causing a\nsignificant drop in their performance with visually imperceptible modifications\nto the input images using a fixed noise pattern.

Through a unified\nframework and comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that a combination\nof three design principles is critical: (1) an expressive, non-linear Chunk\nEncoder with a dedicated CLS token to produce representations for retrieval;\n(2) a Bypassing Residual Path to stably integrate retrieved global information\nwithout it being overridden by the local residual stream; and (3) enforced\nselection sparsity during pre-training to bridge the train-test distribution\ngap. We provide a theoretical motivation for intra-chunk information processing\nand landmark generation. By combining these principles, we establish a new\nstate-of-the-art for training-free length extrapolation, successfully\ngeneralizing models trained on a 4K context to 32 million tokens on RULER and\nBABILong. Our findings provide a clear and empirically-grounded set of design\nprinciples for developing future, highly-capable long-context language models."}

This significantly limits LLMs' reliability in knowledge-intensive\napplications. To address this, we introduce a novel Attention-Shifting (AS)\nframework for selective unlearning. AS is driven by two design objectives: (1)\ncontext-preserving suppression that attenuates attention to fact-bearing tokens\nwithout disrupting LLMs' linguistic structure; and (2) hallucination-resistant\nresponse shaping that discourages fabricated completions when queried about\nunlearning content. AS realizes these objectives through two attention-level\ninterventions, which are importance-aware suppression applied to the unlearning\nset to reduce reliance on memorized knowledge and attention-guided retention\nenhancement that reinforces attention toward semantically essential tokens in\nthe retained dataset to mitigate unintended degradation. These two components\nare jointly optimized via a dual-loss objective, which forms a soft boundary\nthat localizes unlearning while preserving unrelated knowledge under\nrepresentation superposition.

We evaluate six LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-Chat-V3,\nGemini-2.5-Flash, Claude-3.5-Haiku, Llama-4-Maverick) under five prompt types\n(zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), CoT-few-shot, self-reflection)\nacross relevance classification and six Level-2 tasks, using accuracy,\nprecision, recall, and F1. Results show pronounced model-prompt interaction\neffects: CoT-few-shot yields the most reliable precision-recall balance;\nzero-shot maximizes recall for high-sensitivity passes; and self-reflection\nunderperforms due to over-inclusivity and instability across models. GPT-4o and\nDeepSeek provide robust overall performance, while GPT-4o-mini performs\ncompetitively at a substantially lower dollar cost. A cost-performance analysis\nfor relevance classification (per 1,000 abstracts) reveals large absolute\ndifferences among model-prompt pairings; GPT-4o-mini remains low-cost across\nprompts, and structured prompts (CoT/CoT-few-shot) on GPT-4o-mini offer\nattractive F1 at a small incremental cost. We recommend a staged workflow that\n(1) deploys low-cost models with structured prompts for first-pass screening\nand (2) escalates only borderline cases to higher-capacity models. These\nfindings highlight LLMs' uneven but promising potential to automate literature\nscreening. By systematically analyzing prompt-model interactions, we provide a\ncomparative benchmark and practical guidance for task-adaptive LLM deployment."}

A promising approach is to reconstruct\nvisual stimuli, essentially images, from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging\n(fMRI) signals. This involves two stages: transforming fMRI signals into a\nlatent space and then using a pretrained generative model to reconstruct\nimages. The reconstruction quality depends on how similar the latent space is\nto the structure of neural activity and how well the generative model produces\nimages from that space. Yet, it remains unclear which type of latent space best\nsupports this transformation and how it should be organized to represent visual\nstimuli effectively. We present two key findings. First, fMRI signals are more\nsimilar to the text space of a language model than to either a vision based\nspace or a joint text image space.

Existing computational approaches to legal reasoning\npredominantly rely on generic reasoning frameworks such as syllogism and IRAC,\nwhich do not comprehensively examine the nuanced processes that underpin legal\nreasoning.

In this work, we present a novel\nframework for explicitly modeling legal reasoning in the analysis of Chinese\ntort-related civil cases. We first operationalize the legal reasoning processes\nused in tort analysis into the LawChain framework. LawChain is a three-module\nreasoning framework, with each module consisting of multiple finer-grained\nsub-steps. Informed by the LawChain framework, we introduce the task of tort\nlegal reasoning and construct an evaluation benchmark, LawChain$_{eval}$, to\nsystematically assess the critical steps within analytical reasoning chains for\ntort analysis. Leveraging this benchmark, we evaluate state-of-the-art large\nlanguage models for their legal reasoning ability in civil tort contexts. Our\nresults indicate that current models still fall short in accurately handling\ncrucial elements of tort legal reasoning. Furthermore, we introduce several\nbaseline approaches that explicitly incorporate LawChain-style reasoning\nthrough prompting or post-training. We conduct further experiments on\nadditional legal analysis tasks, such as Legal Named-Entity Recognition and\nCriminal Damages Calculation, to verify the generalizability of these\nbaselines. The proposed baseline approaches achieve significant improvements in\ntort-related legal reasoning and generalize well to related legal analysis\ntasks, thus demonstrating the value of explicitly modeling legal reasoning\nchains to enhance the reasoning capabilities of language models."}

This is the camera-ready version", "summary": "Despite recent advances, vision-language models trained with standard\ncontrastive objectives still struggle with compositional reasoning -- the\nability to understand structured relationships between visual and linguistic\nelements. This shortcoming is largely due to the tendency of the text encoder\nto focus on individual words rather than their relations, a limitation\nreinforced by contrastive training that primarily aligns words with visual\nobjects. In this paper, we introduce REconstruction and Alignment of text\nDescriptions (READ), a fine-tuning method designed to enhance compositional\nreasoning by adding two auxiliary objectives to the contrastive learning: (1) a\ntoken-level reconstruction objective, where a frozen pre-trained decoder\nreconstructs alternative captions based on the embedding of the original\ncaption; and (2) a sentence-level alignment objective, which explicitly aligns\nparaphrased sentences in the embedding space. We show that READ-CLIP, a model\nderived by applying the READ method to the pre-trained CLIP model, achieves the\nstate-of-the-art performance across five major compositional reasoning\nbenchmarks, outperforming the strongest conventional fine-tuning baseline by up\nto 4.1%. Furthermore, applying the READ to existing CLIP variants (including\nNegCLIP and FSC-CLIP) also improves performance on these benchmarks.\nQuantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that our proposed objectives --\nreconstruction and alignment -- offer complementary benefits: the former\nencourages the encoder to capture relationships between words within a caption,\nwhile the latter ensures consistent representations for paraphrases expressed\nwith different wording."}

Manual inspection is costly and hazardous, and existing\nautomatic systems typically address individual defect types or provide\nunstructured outputs that cannot directly guide maintenance crews. This paper\nproposes a comprehensive pipeline that leverages street CCTV streams for multi\ndefect detection and segmentation using the YOLO family of object detectors and\npasses the detections to a vision language model (VLM) for scene aware\nsummarization. The VLM generates a structured action plan in JSON format that\nincludes incident descriptions, recommended tools, dimensions, repair plans,\nand urgent alerts. We review literature on pothole, crack and leak detection,\nhighlight recent advances in large vision language models such as QwenVL and\nLLaVA, and describe the design of our early prototype. Experimental evaluation\non public datasets and captured CCTV clips demonstrates that the system\naccurately identifies diverse defects and produces coherent summaries. We\nconclude by discussing challenges and directions for scaling the system to city\nwide deployments."}

In this\nwork, we propose a novel, zero-shot method that reframes the problem by\nintroducing a prompt-aware perspective, explicitly modeling visual token\npruning as a balance between task relevance and information diversity. Our\nhierarchical approach first selects a core set of task-relevant visual tokens\nand then supplements them with diversity tokens to preserve broader context.\nExperiments across multiple models and benchmarks show that our method achieves\nperformance that matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art with only minimal\naccuracy loss, even when pruning up to 90\\% of the tokens.

We investigate this question\nthrough entity comparison tasks by asking models to compare entities along\nnumerical attributes (e.g., ``Which river is longer, the Danube or the\nNile?''), which offer clear ground truth for systematic analysis. Despite\nhaving sufficient numerical knowledge to answer correctly, LLMs frequently make\npredictions that contradict this knowledge.

For smaller models, a simple logistic regression\nusing only these surface cues predicts model choices more accurately than the\nmodel's own numerical predictions, suggesting heuristics largely override\nprincipled reasoning.

Weakly-supervised affordance\ngrounding mimics this process by learning to locate object regions that enable\nactions on egocentric images, using exocentric interaction images with\nimage-level annotations. However, extracting affordance knowledge solely from\nexocentric images and transferring it one-way to egocentric images limits the\napplicability of previous works in complex interaction scenarios. Instead, this\nstudy introduces LoopTrans, a novel closed-loop framework that not only\ntransfers knowledge from exocentric to egocentric but also transfers back to\nenhance exocentric knowledge extraction. Within LoopTrans, several innovative\nmechanisms are introduced, including unified cross-modal localization and\ndenoising knowledge distillation, to bridge domain gaps between object-centered\negocentric and interaction-centered exocentric images while enhancing knowledge\ntransfer.

The same event can appear calm in one outlet and alarming in\nanother, reflecting subtle emotional bias in reporting. Negative or emotionally\ncharged headlines tend to attract more attention and spread faster, which in\nturn encourages outlets to frame stories in ways that provoke stronger\nreactions. This research explores that tendency through large-scale emotion\nanalysis of Bengali news. Using zero-shot inference with Gemma-3 4B, we\nanalyzed 300000 Bengali news headlines and their content to identify the\ndominant emotion and overall tone of each. The findings reveal a clear\ndominance of negative emotions, particularly anger, fear, and disappointment,\nand significant variation in how similar stories are emotionally portrayed\nacross outlets.

Realizing these capabilities is essential for building models\nsimulating humans. We present ELLSA (End-to-end Listen, Look, Speak and Act),\nwhich, to our knowledge, is the first full-duplex, end-to-end model that\nsimultaneously perceives and generates across vision, text, speech, and action\nwithin a single architecture, enabling interaction patterns previously out of\nreach, yielding more natural, human-like behaviors. At its core is a novel\nSA-MoE architecture (Self-Attention Mixture-of-Experts) that routes each\nmodality to specialized experts and fuses them through a unified attention\nbackbone. This provides a generalizable solution for joint multimodal\nperception and concurrent generation, leveraging strong pre-trained components\nwhile enabling efficient modality integration and mitigating modality\ninterference. On speech-interaction and robot-manipulation benchmarks, ELLSA\nmatches modality-specific baselines, while uniquely supporting advanced\nmultimodal and full-duplex behaviors such as dialogue and action turn-taking,\ndefective instruction rejection, speaking-while-acting, context-grounded visual\nquestion answering, and action barge-ins. We contend that ELLSA represents a\nstep toward more natural and general interactive intelligence, contributing to\nthe broader pursuit of artificial general intelligence. All data, code and\nmodel checkpoints will be released upon acceptance."}

However, existing methods almost exclusively rely on a\ntemplate adult body shape to model the training data, which poses challenges\nwhen generalizing to individuals with largely different body shapes (such as a\nchild). This is primarily due to the variation in IMU-measured acceleration\ncaused by changes in body shape. To fill this gap, we propose Shape-aware\nInertial Poser (SAIP), the first solution considering body shape differences in\nsparse inertial-based motion capture. Specifically, we decompose the sensor\nmeasurements related to shape and pose in order to effectively model their\njoint correlations. Firstly, we train a regression model to transfer the\nIMU-measured accelerations of a real body to match the template adult body\nmodel, compensating for the shape-related sensor measurements. Then, we can\neasily follow the state-of-the-art methods to estimate the full body motions of\nthe template-shaped body. Finally, we utilize a second regression model to map\nthe joint velocities back to the real body, combined with a shape-aware\nphysical optimization strategy to calculate global motions on the subject.\nFurthermore, our method relies on body shape awareness, introducing the first\ninertial shape estimation scheme. This is accomplished by modeling the\nshape-conditioned IMU-pose correlation using an MLP-based network. To validate\nthe effectiveness of SAIP, we also present the first IMU motion capture dataset\ncontaining individuals of different body sizes. This dataset features 10\nchildren and 10 adults, with heights ranging from 110 cm to 190 cm, and a total\nof 400 minutes of paired IMU-Motion samples. Extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that SAIP can effectively handle motion capture tasks for diverse\nbody shapes. The code and dataset are available at\nhttps://github.com/yinlu5942/SAIP."}

While these methods improve visual\nquality, they can unintentionally encode and amplify social biases. To\nsystematically trace how such biases evolve throughout the alignment pipeline,\nwe introduce VideoBiasEval, a comprehensive diagnostic framework for evaluating\nsocial representation in video generation. Grounded in established social bias\ntaxonomies, VideoBiasEval employs an event-based prompting strategy to\ndisentangle semantic content (actions and contexts) from actor attributes\n(gender and ethnicity). It further introduces multi-granular metrics to\nevaluate (1) overall ethnicity bias, (2) gender bias conditioned on ethnicity,\n(3) distributional shifts in social attributes across model variants, and (4)\nthe temporal persistence of bias within videos. Using this framework, we\nconduct the first end-to-end analysis connecting biases in human preference\ndatasets, their amplification in reward models, and their propagation through\nalignment-tuned video diffusion models. Our results reveal that alignment\ntuning not only strengthens representational biases but also makes them\ntemporally stable, producing smoother yet more stereotyped portrayals. These\nfindings highlight the need for bias-aware evaluation and mitigation throughout\nthe alignment process to ensure fair and socially responsible video generation."}

In this work, we systematically investigate whether\nthese failures arise from not perceiving the evidence or from not leveraging it\neffectively. By examining layer-wise attention dynamics, we find that shallow\nlayers focus primarily on text, while deeper layers sparsely but reliably\nattend to localized evidence regions. Surprisingly, VLMs often perceive the\nvisual evidence when outputting incorrect answers, a phenomenon we term\n``seeing but not believing'' that widely exists in major VLM families.
