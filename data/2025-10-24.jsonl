Traditional clustering and\nclassification methods fail to adequately represent these complex\nrelationships, particularly when labeled data or suitable pre-trained models\nare unavailable. Hypergraphs effectively capture overlapping relationships, but\nto translate their complexity into information and insights for domain expert\nusers visualization is essential. We propose an interactive visual analytics\napproach specifically designed for the construction, exploration, and analysis\nof hypergraphs on large-scale complex image collections. Our core contributions\ninclude: (1) a scalable pipeline for constructing hypergraphs directly from raw\nimage data, including a similarity measure to evaluate constructed hypergraphs\nagainst a ground truth, (2) interactive visualization techniques that integrate\nspatial hypergraph representations, interactive grids, and matrix\nvisualizations, enabling users to dynamically explore and interpret\nrelationships without becoming overwhelmed and disoriented, and (3) practical\ninsights on how domain experts can effectively use the application, based on\nevaluation with real-life image collections.

This study provides the first expert-grounded benchmark of\nLLMs in LCA, addressing the absence of standardized evaluation frameworks in a\nfield where no clear ground truth or consensus protocols exist.\n  Methods: We evaluated eleven general-purpose LLMs, spanning both commercial\nand open-source families, across 22 LCA-related tasks. Seventeen experienced\npractitioners reviewed model outputs against criteria directly relevant to LCA\npractice, including scientific accuracy, explanation quality, robustness,\nverifiability, and adherence to instructions. We collected 168 expert reviews.\n  Results: Experts judged 37% of responses to contain inaccurate or misleading\ninformation. Ratings of accuracy and quality of explanation were generally\nrated average or good on many models even smaller models, and format adherence\nwas generally rated favourably.

There was\nno clear-cut distinction between ratings on open-weight versus closed-weight\nLLMs, with open-weight models outperforming or competing on par with\nclosed-weight models on criteria such as accuracy and quality of explanation.\n  Conclusion: These findings highlight the risks of applying LLMs na\\\"ively in\nLCA, such as when LLMs are treated as free-form oracles, while also showing\nbenefits especially around quality of explanation and alleviating labour\nintensiveness of simple tasks.

This work aims to achieve quantitative transcranial\nultrasound by reconstructing an accurate speed-of-sound (SoS) map of the brain.\nTraditional physics-based full-waveform inversion (FWI) is limited by weak\nsignals caused by skull-induced attenuation, mode conversion, and phase\naberration, as well as incomplete spatial coverage since full-aperture arrays\nare clinically impractical. In contrast, purely data-driven methods that learn\ndirectly from raw ultrasound data often fail to model the complex nonlinear and\nnonlocal wave propagation through bone, leading to anatomically plausible but\nquantitatively biased SoS maps under low signal-to-noise and sparse-aperture\nconditions.

However, its\nquadratic complexity remains a critical bottleneck for practical applications.\nGiven that Conv offers linear complexity and strong visual priors, continuing\nefforts have been made to promote the renaissance of Conv. However, a\npersistent performance chasm remains, highlighting that these modernizations\nhave not yet captured the intrinsic expressivity that defines SA. In this\npaper, we re-examine the design of the CNNs, directed by a key question: what\nprinciples give SA its edge over Conv? As a result, we reveal two fundamental\ninsights that challenge the long-standing design intuitions in prior research\n(e.g., Receptive field). The two findings are: (1) \\textit{Adaptive routing}:\nSA dynamically regulates positional information flow according to semantic\ncontent, whereas Conv employs static kernels uniformly across all positions.\n(2) \\textit{Lateral inhibition}: SA induces score competition among token\nweighting, effectively suppressing redundancy and sharpening representations,\nwhereas Conv filters lack such inhibitory dynamics and exhibit considerable\nredundancy. Based on this, we propose \\textit{Attentive Convolution} (ATConv),\na principled reformulation of the convolutional operator that intrinsically\ninjects these principles. Interestingly, with only $3\\times3$ kernels, ATConv\nconsistently outperforms various SA mechanisms in fundamental vision tasks.\nBuilding on ATConv, we introduce AttNet, a CNN family that can attain\n\\textbf{84.4\\%} ImageNet-1K Top-1 accuracy with only 27M parameters.

We benchmark\nPartNeXt on two tasks: (1) class-agnostic part segmentation, where\nstate-of-the-art methods (e.g., PartField, SAMPart3D) struggle with\nfine-grained and leaf-level parts, and (2) 3D part-centric question answering,\na new benchmark for 3D-LLMs that reveals significant gaps in open-vocabulary\npart grounding. Additionally, training Point-SAM on PartNeXt yields substantial\ngains over PartNet, underscoring the dataset's superior quality and diversity.\nBy combining scalable annotation, texture-aware labels, and multi-task\nevaluation, PartNeXt opens new avenues for research in structured 3D\nunderstanding."}

A human preference can be\nvisualized as a high-dimensional vector where different directions represent\ntrade-offs between desired attributes (e.g., helpfulness vs. verbosity). Yet,\nbecause the training data often reflects dominant, average preferences, LLMs\ntend to perform well on common requests but fall short in specific, individual\nneeds. This mismatch creates a preference coverage gap. Existing methods often\naddress this through costly retraining, which may not be generalized to the\nfull spectrum of diverse preferences. This brittleness means that when a user's\nrequest reflects a nuanced preference deviating from the training data's\ncentral tendency, model performance can degrade unpredictably. To address this\nchallenge, we introduce Robust Preference Selection (RPS), a post-hoc,\ntraining-free method by leveraging directional neighborhood consensus. Instead\nof forcing a model to generate a response from a single, highly specific\npreference, RPS samples multiple responses from a local neighborhood of related\npreferences to create a superior candidate pool. It then selects the response\nthat best aligns with the user's original intent. We provide a theoretical\nframework showing our neighborhood generation strategy is provably superior to\na strong baseline that also samples multiple candidates. Comprehensive\nexperiments across three distinct alignment paradigms (DPA, DPO, and SFT)\ndemonstrate that RPS consistently improves robustness against this baseline,\nachieving win rates of up to 69% on challenging preferences from\nunder-represented regions of the space without any model retraining. Our work\npresents a practical, theoretically-grounded solution for enhancing the\nreliability of preference-aligned models."}

These issues\nlead to underexposure, color casts, and tonal inconsistency, which degrade the\nperformance of downstream vision tasks. To address this, we propose\nACamera-Net, a lightweight and scene-adaptive camera parameter adjustment\nnetwork that directly predicts optimal exposure and white balance from RAW\ninputs. The framework consists of two modules: ACamera-Exposure, which\nestimates ISO to alleviate underexposure and contrast loss, and ACamera-Color,\nwhich predicts correlated color temperature and gain factors for improved color\nconsistency. Optimized for real-time inference on edge devices, ACamera-Net can\nbe seamlessly integrated into imaging pipelines.

While MBR has proven effective in machine\ntranslation, where the variability of a language model's outcome space is\nnaturally constrained, it may face challenges in more open-ended tasks such as\ndialogue or instruction-following. We hypothesise that in such settings,\napplying MBR with standard similarity-based utility functions may result in\nselecting responses that are broadly representative of the model's\ndistribution, yet sub-optimal with respect to any particular grouping of\ngenerations that share an underlying latent structure. In this work, we\nintroduce three lightweight adaptations to the utility function, designed to\nmake MBR more sensitive to structural variability in the outcome space. To test\nour hypothesis, we curate a dataset capturing three representative types of\nlatent structure: dialogue act, emotion, and response structure (e.g., a\nsentence, a paragraph, or a list). We further propose two metrics to evaluate\nthe structural optimality of MBR. Our analysis demonstrates that common\nsimilarity-based utility functions fall short by these metrics. In contrast,\nour proposed adaptations considerably improve structural optimality.

Using these benchmarks, researchers have found that LLMs\nsometimes fail to keep secrets private when responding to complex tasks (e.g.,\nleaking employee salaries in meeting summaries).

DyPE takes advantage of the spectral\nprogression inherent to the diffusion process, where low-frequency structures\nconverge early, while high-frequencies take more steps to resolve.\nSpecifically, DyPE dynamically adjusts the model's positional encoding at each\ndiffusion step, matching their frequency spectrum with the current stage of the\ngenerative process. This approach allows us to generate images at resolutions\nthat exceed the training resolution dramatically, e.g., 16 million pixels using\nFLUX.

To validate this, we introduce\nND-LoRA (Neural Diversity Low-Rank Adaptation), combining parallel LoRA\nadapters with Barlow Twins regularization, and demonstrate that ND-LoRA reduces\nhallucinations by up to 25.6% (and 14.6% on average) without degrading general\naccuracy.

In such\nuses, users may need to share private information (e.g., health records,\ncontact details). To evaluate LLMs' ability to identify and redact such private\ninformation, prior work developed benchmarks (e.g., ConfAIde, PrivacyLens) with\nreal-life scenarios. Using these benchmarks, researchers have found that LLMs\nsometimes fail to keep secrets private when responding to complex tasks (e.g.,\nleaking employee salaries in meeting summaries). However, these evaluations\nrely on LLMs (proxy LLMs) to gauge compliance with privacy norms, overlooking\nreal users' perceptions. Moreover, prior work primarily focused on the\nprivacy-preservation quality of responses, without investigating nuanced\ndifferences in helpfulness. To understand how users perceive the\nprivacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of LLM responses to\nprivacy-sensitive scenarios, we conducted a user study with 94 participants\nusing 90 scenarios from PrivacyLens. We found that, when evaluating identical\nresponses to the same scenario, users showed low agreement with each other on\nthe privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of the LLM response. Further,\nwe found high agreement among five proxy LLMs, while each individual LLM had\nlow correlation with users' evaluations. These results indicate that the\nprivacy and helpfulness of LLM responses are often specific to individuals, and\nproxy LLMs are poor estimates of how real users would perceive these responses\nin privacy-sensitive scenarios.

Since toxicity documentation is often embedded in clinical\nnotes, we aimed to develop and evaluate natural language processing (NLP)\nmethods to extract treatment and toxicity information.\n  Materials and Methods: We constructed a gold-standard dataset of 236 clinical\nnotes from 204,165 adult oncology patients.
