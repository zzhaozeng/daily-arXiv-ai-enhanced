Our key idea is to leverage\n2DGS as a bridge, which connects novel view synthesis to learned geometric\npriors and then transfers these priors to achieve surface reconstruction.\nSpecifically, we incorporate a feed-forward network to predict per-view\npixel-aligned 2DGS, which enables the network to synthesize novel view images\nand thus eliminates the need for direct 3D ground-truth supervision. To improve\nthe accuracy of 2DGS position and orientation prediction, we propose a Weighted\nChamfer Distance Loss to regularize the depth maps, especially in overlapping\nareas of input views, and also a normal prediction network to align the\norientation of 2DGS with normal vectors predicted by a monocular normal\nestimator.

Our findings indicate that\nwhile LLM-based rerankers demonstrate superior performance on familiar queries,\ntheir generalization ability to novel queries varies, with lightweight models\noffering comparable efficiency. We further identify that the novelty of queries\nsignificantly impacts reranking effectiveness, highlighting limitations in\nexisting approaches.\nhttps://github.com/DataScienceUIBK/llm-reranking-generalization-study"}

Delta-SVD first applies Singular Value Decomposition\n(SVD) to factorize the weight deltas, followed by an energy-based rank\ntruncation strategy to balance compression efficiency and reconstruction\nfidelity. The resulting compressed models are fully plug-and-play and can be\nre-constructed on-the-fly during inference. Notably, the proposed approach is\nsimple, efficient, and preserves the original model architecture. Experiments\non a multiple subject dataset demonstrate that Delta-SVD achieves substantial\ncompression with negligible loss in generation quality measured by CLIP score,\nSSIM and FID. Our method enables scalable and efficient deployment of\npersonalized diffusion models, making it a practical solution for real-world\napplications that require storing and deploying large-scale subject\ncustomizations."}

However, existing CapsNet and\nvariants often rely on a single high-level feature map, overlooking the rich\ncomplementary information from multi-scale features. Furthermore, conventional\nfeature fusion strategies (e.g., addition and concatenation) struggle to\nreconcile multi-scale feature discrepancies, leading to suboptimal\nclassification performance. To address these limitations, we propose the\nMulti-Scale Patchify Capsule Network (MSPCaps), a novel architecture that\nintegrates multi-scale feature learning and efficient capsule routing.\nSpecifically, MSPCaps consists of three key components: a Multi-Scale ResNet\nBackbone (MSRB), a Patchify Capsule Layer (PatchifyCaps), and Cross-Agreement\nRouting (CAR) blocks. First, the MSRB extracts diverse multi-scale feature\nrepresentations from input images, preserving both fine-grained details and\nglobal contextual information. Second, the PatchifyCaps partitions these\nmulti-scale features into primary capsules using a uniform patch size,\nequipping the model with the ability to learn from diverse receptive fields.\nFinally, the CAR block adaptively routes the multi-scale capsules by\nidentifying cross-scale prediction pairs with maximum agreement. Unlike the\nsimple concatenation of multiple self-routing blocks, CAR ensures that only the\nmost coherent capsules contribute to the final voting. Our proposed MSPCaps\nachieves remarkable scalability and superior robustness, consistently\nsurpassing multiple baseline methods in terms of classification accuracy, with\nconfigurations ranging from a highly efficient Tiny model (344.3K parameters)\nto a powerful Large model (10.9M parameters), highlighting its potential in\nadvancing feature representation learning."}

The\nmain innovation lies in two strategies: a window partitioning design that\napplies grid windows to the model input, and a window-wise contrastive learning\ndesign to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between local density\nlevels. Moreover, a global attention module is applied to the end of the model\nto handle the occasionally occurring large-sized individuals.

Second, Global Average Pooling (GAP)\ncompresses critical local forgery cues into a single vector, thus discarding\ndiscriminative patterns vital for real-fake classification. To address these\nissues, we propose a novel Local Focus Mechanism (LFM) that explicitly attends\nto discriminative local features for differentiating fake from real images. LFM\nintegrates a Salience Network (SNet) with a task-specific Top-K Pooling (TKP)\nmodule to select the K most informative local patterns. To mitigate potential\noverfitting introduced by Top-K pooling, we introduce two regularization\ntechniques: Rank-Based Linear Dropout (RBLD) and Random-K Sampling (RKS), which\nenhance the model's robustness. LFM achieves a 3.7 improvement in accuracy and\na 2.8 increase in average precision over the state-of-the-art Neighboring Pixel\nRelationships (NPR) method, while maintaining exceptional efficiency at 1789\nFPS on a single NVIDIA A6000 GPU. Our approach sets a new benchmark for\ncross-domain deepfake detection. The source code are available in\nhttps://github.com/lmlpy/LFM.git"}

We introduce a pipeline\nthat combines word alignment, etymology-aware edit distance, and smoothing to\nannotate a parallel corpus with word-level AGS. A regression model is then\ntrained to predict AGS in context. Our approach outperforms strong baselines,\nincluding state-of-the-art dialect ID systems, on a multi-dialect benchmark.\nAGS offers a scalable, linguistically grounded way to model lexical generality,\nenriching representations of Arabic dialectness."}

To address this, we introduce Holistic DPO, a training\napproach balancing positive and negative persuasion examples. Unlike prompting\nor resist-only training, Holistic DPO enhances both robustness to\nmisinformation and receptiveness to corrections, improving\nLlama-3.1-8B-Instruct's accuracy under misleading persuasion in safety contexts\nfrom 4.21% to 76.54%.

Although deep learning-based computer-aided diagnostic\n(CADx) systems have shown remarkable progress. However, conventional\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers face persistent\nchallenges, including high computational cost, sensitivity to minor contrast\nvariations, structural heterogeneity, and texture inconsistencies in MRI data.\nTherefore, a novel hybrid framework, CE-RS-SBCIT, is introduced, integrating\nresidual and spatial learning-based CNNs with transformer-driven modules. The\nproposed framework exploits local fine-grained and global contextual cues\nthrough four core innovations: (i) a smoothing and boundary-based\nCNN-integrated Transformer (SBCIT), (ii) tailored residual and spatial learning\nCNNs, (iii) a channel enhancement (CE) strategy, and (iv) a novel spatial\nattention mechanism. The developed SBCIT employs stem convolution and\ncontextual interaction transformer blocks with systematic smoothing and\nboundary operations, enabling efficient global feature modeling. Moreover,\nResidual and spatial CNNs, enhanced by auxiliary transfer-learned feature maps,\nenrich the representation space, while the CE module amplifies discriminative\nchannels and mitigates redundancy. Furthermore, the spatial attention mechanism\nselectively emphasizes subtle contrast and textural variations across tumor\nclasses. Extensive evaluation on challenging MRI datasets from Kaggle and\nFigshare, encompassing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors, and healthy\ncontrols, demonstrates superior performance, achieving 98.30% accuracy, 98.08%\nsensitivity, 98.25% F1-score, and 98.43% precision."}

In this paper,\nwe introduce Gaussian Primitive Optimization (GPO), a novel iterative framework\nthat performs structured message passing to overcome these challenges. After an\ninitial coarse alignment, we extract keypoints at salient anatomical structures\n(e.g., major vessels) to serve as a minimal set of descriptor-based control\nnodes (DCN). Each node is modelled as a Gaussian primitive with trainable\nposition, displacement, and radius, thus adapting its spatial influence to\nlocal deformation scales. A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Gaussian interpolation\nthen blends and propagates displacement signals from these information-rich\nnodes to construct a globally coherent displacement field; focusing\ninterpolation on the top (K) neighbors reduces computational overhead while\npreserving local detail. By strategically anchoring nodes in high-gradient\nregions, GPO ensures robust gradient flow, mitigating vanishing gradient signal\nin textureless areas. The framework is optimized end-to-end via a multi-term\nloss that enforces both keypoint consistency and intensity alignment.\nExperiments on the FIRE dataset show that GPO reduces the target registration\nerror from 6.2\\,px to ~2.4\\,px and increases the AUC at 25\\,px from 0.770 to\n0.938, substantially outperforming existing methods.

However, conventional\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers face persistent\nchallenges, including high computational cost, sensitivity to minor contrast\nvariations, structural heterogeneity, and texture inconsistencies in MRI data.\nTherefore, a novel hybrid framework, CE-RS-SBCIT, is introduced, integrating\nresidual and spatial learning-based CNNs with transformer-driven modules. The\nproposed framework exploits local fine-grained and global contextual cues\nthrough four core innovations: (i) a smoothing and boundary-based\nCNN-integrated Transformer (SBCIT), (ii) tailored residual and spatial learning\nCNNs, (iii) a channel enhancement (CE) strategy, and (iv) a novel spatial\nattention mechanism. The developed SBCIT employs stem convolution and\ncontextual interaction transformer blocks with systematic smoothing and\nboundary operations, enabling efficient global feature modeling. Moreover,\nResidual and spatial CNNs, enhanced by auxiliary transfer-learned feature maps,\nenrich the representation space, while the CE module amplifies discriminative\nchannels and mitigates redundancy. Furthermore, the spatial attention mechanism\nselectively emphasizes subtle contrast and textural variations across tumor\nclasses. Extensive evaluation on challenging MRI datasets from Kaggle and\nFigshare, encompassing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors, and healthy\ncontrols, demonstrates superior performance, achieving 98.30% accuracy, 98.08%\nsensitivity, 98.25% F1-score, and 98.43% precision."}

The PPM is lightweight,\nmodel-agnostic, and operates independently of the LVLM architecture, ensuring\nseamless integration with various models. Extensive experiments on multiple\nbenchmarks demonstrate that CoViPAL outperforms training-free pruning methods\nunder equal token budgets and surpasses training-based methods with comparable\nsupervision. CoViPAL offers a scalable and efficient solution to improve\ninference efficiency in LVLMs without compromising accuracy."}

In this paper, a strong correlation is revealed between the\nvariation patterns of the shallow-layer feature differences in the diffusion\nmodel and those of final model outputs. Moreover, we have observed that the\nfeatures from different model layers form similar trajectories. Based on these\nobservations, we present DiCache, a novel training-free adaptive caching\nstrategy for accelerating diffusion models at runtime, answering both when and\nhow to cache within a unified framework. Specifically, DiCache is composed of\ntwo principal components: (1) Online Probe Profiling Scheme leverages a\nshallow-layer online probe to obtain a stable prior for the caching error in\nreal time, enabling the model to autonomously determine caching schedules. (2)\nDynamic Cache Trajectory Alignment combines multi-step caches based on\nshallow-layer probe feature trajectory to better approximate the current\nfeature, facilitating higher visual quality. Extensive experiments validate\nDiCache's capability in achieving higher efficiency and improved visual\nfidelity over state-of-the-art methods on various leading diffusion models\nincluding WAN 2.1, HunyuanVideo for video generation, and Flux for image\ngeneration."}

Consequently, recorded brain signals become weaker,\nuncertain, and contain poor visual context over time. This paper presents one\nof the first vision-learning approaches to address this problem. First, we\nstatistically and experimentally demonstrate the existence of inconsistency in\nbrain signals and its impact on the Vision-Brain Understanding (VBU) model. Our\nfindings show that brain signal representations shift over recording sessions,\nleading to compounding bias, which poses challenges for model learning and\ndegrades performance. Then, we propose a new Bias-Mitigation Continual Learning\n(BRAIN) approach to address these limitations. In this approach, the model is\ntrained in a continual learning setup and mitigates the growing bias from each\nlearning step. A new loss function named De-bias Contrastive Learning is also\nintroduced to address the bias problem. In addition, to prevent catastrophic\nforgetting, where the model loses knowledge from previous sessions, the new\nAngular-based Forgetting Mitigation approach is introduced to preserve learned\nknowledge in the model.

To address this, we introduce Language-Grounded Sparse\nEncoders (LanSE), a novel architecture that creates interpretable evaluation\nmetrics by identifying interpretable visual patterns and automatically\ndescribing them in natural language. Through large-scale human evaluation (more\nthan 11,000 annotations) and large multimodal model (LMM) based analysis, LanSE\ndemonstrates reliable capabilities to detect interpretable visual patterns in\nsynthetic images with more than 93\\% accuracy in natural images. LanSE further\nprovides a fine-grained evaluation framework that quantifies four key\ndimensions of generation quality, prompt match, visual realism, physical\nplausibility, and content diversity. LanSE reveals nuanced model differences\ninvisible to existing metrics, for instance, FLUX's superior physical\nplausibility and SDXL-medium's strong content diversity, while aligning with\nhuman judgments. By bridging interpretability with practical evaluation needs,\nLanSE offers all users of generative AI models a powerful tool for model\nselection, quality control of synthetic content, and model improvement.

This yields a single\nversatile network that can adapt to different deployment scenarios, from fully\ncalibrated lab environments to in-the-wild monocular videos without\ncalibration. The model was trained using 3D keypoints from AMASS dataset with\ncorresponding 2D synthetic data generated by sampling random camera poses and\nintrinsics.

However, redundancy in vision tokens results in the\ndegenerated inference efficiency of VLMs. While many algorithms have been\nproposed to reduce the number of vision tokens, most of them apply only\nunimodal information (i.e., vision/text) for pruning and ignore the inherent\nmultimodal property of vision-language tasks. Moreover, it lacks a generic\ncriterion that can be applied to different modalities. To mitigate this\nlimitation, in this work, we propose to leverage both vision and text tokens to\nselect informative vision tokens by the criterion of coverage. We first\nformulate the subset selection problem as a maximum coverage problem.\nAfterward, a subset of vision tokens is optimized to cover the text tokens and\nthe original set of vision tokens, simultaneously. Finally, a VLM agent can be\nadopted to further improve the quality of text tokens for guiding vision\npruning. The proposed method MMTok is extensively evaluated on benchmark\ndatasets with different VLMs. The comparison illustrates that vision and text\ninformation are complementary, and combining multimodal information can surpass\nthe unimodal baseline with a clear margin.
