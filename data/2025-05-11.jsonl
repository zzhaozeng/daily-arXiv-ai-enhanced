We pioneer a render-enhanced point-to-shape auto-encoder that\ncompresses meshes into a compact latent space by designing perceptual\noptimization with ray-based regularization. This ensures that the 3D shapes are\naccurately represented and reconstructed to preserve geometric details within\nthe latent space.

In the model construction\nprocess, based on the advanced diffusion model architecture, we innovatively\nintroduce interaction conditions and the GAN model to increase the denoising\nstep size. As a result, when generating gesture sequences, the model can not\nonly dynamically generate based on the speaker's speech information but also\nrespond in realtime to the listener's feedback, enabling synergistic\ninteraction between the two. Abundant experimental results demonstrate that\ncompared with the current state-of-the-art gesture generation methods, the\nmodel we proposed has achieved remarkable improvements in the naturalness,\ncoherence, and speech-gesture synchronization of the generated gestures. In the\nsubjective evaluation experiments, users highly praised the generated\ninteraction scenarios, believing that they are closer to real life human\ncommunication situations. Objective index evaluations also show that our model\noutperforms the baseline methods in multiple key indicators, providing more\npowerful support for effective communication."}

To balance the\nefficiency and performance, we propose a Speed-Accuracy Tradeoff Network\n(SATNet) for Lightweight RGB-D SOD from three fundamental perspectives: depth\nquality, modality fusion, and feature representation. Concerning depth quality,\nwe introduce the Depth Anything Model to generate high-quality depth maps,which\neffectively alleviates the multi-modal gaps in the current datasets. For\nmodality fusion, we propose a Decoupled Attention Module (DAM) to explore the\nconsistency within and between modalities. Here, the multi-modal features are\ndecoupled into dual-view feature vectors to project discriminable information\nof feature maps. For feature representation, we develop a Dual Information\nRepresentation Module (DIRM) with a bi-directional inverted framework to\nenlarge the limited feature space generated by the lightweight backbones. DIRM\nmodels texture features and saliency features to enrich feature space, and\nemploy two-way prediction heads to optimal its parameters through a\nbi-directional backpropagation. Finally, we design a Dual Feature Aggregation\nModule (DFAM) in the decoder to aggregate texture and saliency features.\nExtensive experiments on five public RGB-D SOD datasets indicate that the\nproposed SATNet excels state-of-the-art (SOTA) CNN-based heavyweight models and\nachieves a lightweight framework with 5.2 M parameters and 415 FPS."}

In contrast to prior works, we introduce convex relaxation\ntechniques to solve this task for the first time. Specifically, we employ a\n``soft'' association scheme, realized via a truncated multi-selection error,\nthat allows for joint estimation of VPs' locations and line-VP associations.\nThis approach leads to a primal problem that can be reformulated into a\nquadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem, which is then\nrelaxed into a convex semidefinite programming (SDP) problem. To solve this SDP\nproblem efficiently, we present a globally optimal outlier-robust iterative\nsolver (called \\textbf{GlobustVP}), which independently searches for one VP and\nits associated lines in each iteration, treating other lines as outliers.

To address\nchallenge (2), xTrace uses facial affect descriptors that are not only\nexplainable, but can also achieve a high degree of accuracy and robustness with\nlow computational complexity. The key components of xTrace are benchmarked\nagainst three existing tools: MediaPipe, OpenFace, and Augsburg Affect Toolbox.\nOn an in-the-wild validation set composed of 50k videos, xTrace achieves 0.86\nmean CCC and 0.13 mean absolute error values. We present a detailed error\nanalysis of affect predictions from xTrace, illustrating (a). its ability to\nrecognise emotions with high accuracy across most bins in the 2D emotion space,\n(b). its robustness to non-frontal head pose angles, and (c). a strong\ncorrelation between its uncertainty estimates and its accuracy."}

Its severity is typically\nevaluated by estimating the percentage of obstructed airway. This estimation\ncan be obtained from CT data or through visual inspection by experts exploring\nthe region. However, visual inspections are inherently subjective, leading to\nless consistent and robust diagnoses. No public methods or datasets are\ncurrently available for automated evaluation of this condition from\nbronchoscopy video.\n  Methods: We propose a pipeline for automated subglottic stenosis severity\nestimation during the bronchoscopy exploration, without requiring the physician\nto traverse the stenosed region. Our approach exploits the physical effect of\nillumination decline in endoscopy to segment and track the lumen and obtain a\n3D model of the airway. This 3D model is obtained from a single frame and is\nused to measure the airway narrowing.\n  Results: Our pipeline is the first to enable automated and robust subglottic\nstenosis severity measurement using bronchoscopy images. The results show\nconsistency with ground-truth estimations from CT scans and expert estimations,\nand reliable repeatability across multiple estimations on the same patient. Our\nevaluation is performed on our new Subglottic Stenosis Dataset of real\nbronchoscopy procedures data.\n  Conclusion: We demonstrate how to automate evaluation of subglottic stenosis\nseverity using only bronchoscopy. Our approach can assist with and shorten\ndiagnosis and monitoring procedures, with automated and repeatable estimations\nand less exploration time, and save radiation exposure to patients as no CT is\nrequired. Additionally, we release the first public benchmark for subglottic\nstenosis severity assessment."}

This vulnerability poses a\nsignificant safety risk, and can cause autonomous vehicles to fail to detect\nobjects near emergency vehicles. In addition, this vulnerability could be\nexploited by adversaries to compromise the security of advanced driving\nassistance systems (ADASs).

Hair\nstrand reconstruction is a fundamental problem in computer vision and graphics\nthat can be used for high-fidelity digital avatar synthesis, animation, and\nAR/VR applications. However, accurately recovering hair strands from raw scan\ndata remains challenging due to human hair's complex and fine-grained\nstructure. Existing methods typically rely on RGB captures, which can be\nsensitive to the environment and can be a challenging domain for extracting the\norientation of guiding strands, especially in the case of challenging\nhairstyles. To reconstruct the hair purely from the observed geometry, our\nmethod finds sharp surface features directly on the scan and estimates strand\norientation through a neural 2D line detector applied to the renderings of scan\nshading. Additionally, we incorporate a diffusion prior trained on a diverse\nset of synthetic hair scans, refined with an improved noise schedule, and\nadapted to the reconstructed contents via a scan-specific text prompt. We\ndemonstrate that this combination of supervision signals enables accurate\nreconstruction of both simple and intricate hairstyles without relying on color\ninformation.

In this study, we propose a novel network\narchitecture named CTO, which combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs),\nVision Transformer (ViT) models, and explicit edge detection operators to\ntackle this challenge. CTO surpasses existing methods in terms of segmentation\naccuracy and strikes a better balance between accuracy and efficiency, without\nthe need for additional data inputs or label injections. Specifically, CTO\nadheres to the canonical encoder-decoder network paradigm, with a dual-stream\nencoder network comprising a mainstream CNN stream for capturing local features\nand an auxiliary StitchViT stream for integrating long-range dependencies.\nFurthermore, to enhance the model's ability to learn boundary areas, we\nintroduce a boundary-guided decoder network that employs binary boundary masks\ngenerated by dedicated edge detection operators to provide explicit guidance\nduring the decoding process. We validate the performance of CTO through\nextensive experiments conducted on seven challenging medical image segmentation\ndatasets, namely ISIC 2016, PH2, ISIC 2018, CoNIC, LiTS17, and BTCV.
