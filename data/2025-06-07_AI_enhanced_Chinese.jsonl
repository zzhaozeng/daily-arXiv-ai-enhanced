With dense voxel labels, prior works\ntypically formulate it as a dense segmentation task, independently classifying\neach voxel. However, this paradigm neglects critical instance-centric\ndiscriminability, leading to instance-level incompleteness and adjacent\nambiguities. To address this, we highlight a free lunch of occupancy labels:\nthe voxel-level class label implicitly provides insight at the instance level,\nwhich is overlooked by the community. Motivated by this observation, we first\nintroduce a training-free Voxel-to-Instance (VoxNT) trick: a simple yet\neffective method that freely converts voxel-level class labels into\ninstance-level offset labels. Building on this, we further propose VoxDet, an\ninstance-centric framework that reformulates the voxel-level occupancy\nprediction as dense object detection by decoupling it into two sub-tasks:\noffset regression and semantic prediction. Specifically, based on the lifted 3D\nvolume, VoxDet first uses (a) Spatially-decoupled Voxel Encoder to generate\ndisentangled feature volumes for the two sub-tasks, which learn task-specific\nspatial deformation in the densely projected tri-perceptive space. Then, we\ndeploy (b) Task-decoupled Dense Predictor to address this task via dense\ndetection. Here, we first regress a 4D offset field to estimate distances (6\ndirections) between voxels and object borders in the voxel space. The regressed\noffsets are then used to guide the instance-level aggregation in the\nclassification branch, achieving instance-aware prediction. Experiments show\nthat VoxDet can be deployed on both camera and LiDAR input, jointly achieving\nstate-of-the-art results on both benchmarks.

These tractions are based on the penalisation of\ntrue interpenetration between opposite surfaces, and the procedure of their\nintegral for discrete contacting segments is described in this paper. A\nmeticulous examination of the different possible geometric configurations of\ninteracting 3D segments is presented to develop visual understanding and better\ntraction evaluation accuracy. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed\nmethod are validated against the analytical solutions of the contact patch\ntest, two-beam bending, Hertzian contact, and flat punch test, thus proving the\ncapability to reproduce contact between flat surfaces, curved surfaces, and\nsharp corners in contact, respectively. The method passes the contact patch\ntest with the uniform transmission of contact pressure matching the accuracy\nlevels of finite elements. It converges towards the analytical solution with\nmesh refinement and a suitably high penalty factor.

Existing\nmethodologies typically assume using frame-rate 6DoF pose estimated from the\ndevice's visual-inertial odometry system, which may neglect crucial details\nnecessary for pixel-accurate reconstruction. This study presents two\nsignificant findings. Firstly, in contrast to mainstream work treating RGB\ncamera as global shutter frame-rate camera, we emphasize the importance of\nemploying visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) to calibrate the precise\ntimestamps and movement of the rolling shutter RGB sensing camera in a high\nfrequency trajectory format, which ensures an accurate calibration of the\nphysical properties of the rolling-shutter camera. Secondly, we incorporate a\nphysical image formation model based into Gaussian Splatting, which effectively\naddresses the sensor characteristics, including the rolling-shutter effect of\nRGB cameras and the dynamic ranges measured by sensors. Our proposed\nformulation is applicable to the widely-used variants of Gaussian Splats\nrepresentation.

Unlike prior efforts that rely heavily on template based\nqueries, ReXVQA introduces a diverse and clinically authentic task suite\nreflecting five core radiological reasoning skills: presence assessment,\nlocation analysis, negation detection, differential diagnosis, and geometric\nreasoning. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art multimodal large language models,\nincluding MedGemma-4B-it, Qwen2.5-VL, Janus-Pro-7B, and Eagle2-9B. The\nbest-performing model (MedGemma) achieves 83.24% overall accuracy. To bridge\nthe gap between AI performance and clinical expertise, we conducted a\ncomprehensive human reader study involving 3 radiology residents on 200\nrandomly sampled cases.

In\nthis study, we evaluate the performance of 55 publicly available LLMs on\nMaltese, a low-resource language, using a newly introduced benchmark covering\n11 discriminative and generative tasks. Our experiments highlight that many\nmodels perform poorly, particularly on generative tasks, and that smaller\nfine-tuned models often perform better across all tasks. From our\nmultidimensional analysis, we investigate various factors impacting\nperformance.

We introduce WorldPrediction, a\nvideo-based benchmark for evaluating world modeling and procedural planning\ncapabilities of different AI models. In contrast to prior benchmarks that focus\nprimarily on low-level world modeling and robotic motion planning,\nWorldPrediction is the first benchmark that emphasizes actions with temporal\nand semantic abstraction. Given initial and final world states, the task is to\ndistinguish the proper action (WorldPrediction-WM) or the properly ordered\nsequence of actions (WorldPrediction-PP) from a set of counterfactual\ndistractors. This discriminative task setup enable us to evaluate different\ntypes of world models and planners and realize a thorough comparison across\ndifferent hypothesis. The benchmark represents states and actions using visual\nobservations. In order to prevent models from exploiting low-level continuity\ncues in background scenes, we provide \"action equivalents\" - identical actions\nobserved in different contexts - as candidates for selection.

Prior works focus on appearance-based or motion-based cues\nof the puck without explicitly modelling the cues derived from player\nbehaviour. Players consistently turn their bodies and direct their gaze toward\nthe puck. Motivated by this strong contextual cue, we propose Puck Localization\nUsing Contextual Cues (PLUCC), a novel approach for scale-aware and\ncontext-driven single-frame puck detections. PLUCC consists of three\ncomponents: (a) a contextual encoder, which utilizes player orientations and\npositioning as helpful priors; (b) a feature pyramid encoder, which extracts\nmultiscale features from the dual encoders; and (c) a gating decoder that\ncombines latent features with a channel gating mechanism. For evaluation, in\naddition to standard average precision, we propose Rink Space Localization\nError (RSLE), a scale-invariant homography-based metric for removing\nperspective bias from rink space evaluation. The experimental results of PLUCC\non the PuckDataset dataset demonstrated state-of-the-art detection performance,\nsurpassing previous baseline methods by an average precision improvement of\n12.2% and RSLE average precision of 25%.

This yields a full image-computable model\nof brain responses. Next, we apply activation maximization to generate images\noptimized for predicted responses in individual cortical voxels. We find that\nthese images contain visual characteristics that qualitatively correspond with\nknown selectivity and enable exploration of selectivity across the visual\ncortex. We further extend our method to whole regions of interest (ROIs) of the\nbrain and validate its efficacy by presenting these images to human\nparticipants in an fMRI study. We find that the generated images reliably drive\nactivity in targeted regions across both low- and high-level visual areas and\nacross subjects. These results demonstrate that activation maximization can be\nsuccessfully applied to DNN-based encoding models. By addressing key\nlimitations of alternative approaches that require natively generative models,\nour approach enables flexible characterization and modulation of responses\nacross the human visual system.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6280\u672f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u91caDNN\u7f16\u7801\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u5927\u8111\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1DNN\u7f16\u7801\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u5927\u8111\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u523a\u6fc0\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u9a71\u52a8\u8fd9\u4e9b\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684Inception V3\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u53d6\u5e76\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u9884\u6d4bfMRI\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6700\u5927\u5316\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u5316\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u5df2\u77e5\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u9a71\u52a8\u76ee\u6807\u8111\u533a\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eDNN\u7f16\u7801\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u548c\u8c03\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This paper presents a systematic\nanalysis of how two popular watermarking approaches-Gumbel and KGW-affect these\ncore alignment properties across four aligned LLMs. Our experiments reveal two\ndistinct degradation patterns: guard attenuation, where enhanced helpfulness\nundermines model safety, and guard amplification, where excessive caution\nreduces model helpfulness. These patterns emerge from watermark-induced shifts\nin token distribution, surfacing the fundamental tension that exists between\nalignment objectives.\n  To mitigate these degradations, we propose Alignment Resampling (AR), an\ninference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore\nalignment. We establish a theoretical lower bound on the improvement in\nexpected reward score as the sample size is increased and empirically\ndemonstrate that sampling just 2-4 watermarked generations effectively recovers\nor surpasses baseline (unwatermarked) alignment scores.

Project Page:\n  https://research.nvidia.com/labs/dir/hmar/", "summary": "Visual Auto-Regressive modeling (VAR) has shown promise in bridging the speed\nand quality gap between autoregressive image models and diffusion models. VAR\nreformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive\nresolution scales. During inference, an image is generated by predicting all\nthe tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in\nall previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from\nreduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a\nresolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image\nresolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule.\n  We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image\ngeneration algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction\nand masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR\nreformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the\nprediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its\nimmediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions.\nWhen predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked\ngeneration procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step. On\nImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR models match or outperform\nparameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines. We develop\nefficient IO-aware block-sparse attention kernels that allow HMAR to achieve\nfaster training and inference times over VAR by over 2.5x and 1.75x\nrespectively, as well as over 3x lower inference memory footprint.

In this work, we present PUGC, a novel framework that leverages implicit\nhuman Preferences in unlabeled User-Generated Content (UGC) to generate\npreference data. Although UGC is not explicitly created to guide LLMs in\ngenerating human-preferred responses, it often reflects valuable insights and\nimplicit preferences from its creators that has the potential to address\nreaders' questions.

However, due to limited energy and low-resolution\nimaging, smart terminal devices struggle to maintain real-time monitoring\nperformance. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-stage\ndetection approach for road crack detection, EECD-Net, to enhance accuracy and\nenergy efficiency of instrumentation. Specifically, the sophisticated\nSuper-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN) is employed to address\nthe inherent challenges of low-quality images, which effectively enhance image\nresolution while preserving critical structural details. Meanwhile, a Spike\nConvolution Unit (SCU) with Continuous Integrate-and-Fire (CIF) neurons is\nproposed to convert these images into sparse pulse sequences, significantly\nreducing power consumption. Additionally, a Gated Attention Transformer (GAT)\nmodule is designed to strategically fuse multi-scale feature representations\nthrough adaptive attention mechanisms, effectively capturing both long-range\ndependencies and intricate local crack patterns, and significantly enhancing\ndetection robustness across varying crack morphologies. The experiments on the\nCrackVision12K benchmark demonstrate that EECD-Net achieves a remarkable 98.6\\%\ndetection accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art counterparts such as\nHybrid-Segmentor by a significant 1.5\\%.

Our findings underscore the critical need for MAS architectures\nwith robust security protocols and content validation mechanisms, alongside\nmonitoring systems capable of comprehensive risk scenario assessment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6076\u610f\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u64cd\u7eb5\u5b9e\u65bd\u7684\u56db\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u68c0\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08MAS\uff09\u6613\u53d7\u6076\u610f\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u64cd\u7eb5\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4ee3\u7406\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u5999\u63d0\u793a\u64cd\u7eb5\u7cfb\u7edf\u884c\u4e3a\u4ee5\u8c0b\u53d6\u79c1\u5229\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u7c7b\u578b\uff1aScapegoater\u3001Boaster\u3001Self-Dealer\u548cFree-Rider\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6076\u610f\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u8bef\u5bfc\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u7ed5\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8eGPT-4o-mini\u7b49\u5148\u8fdbLLM\u7684\u76d1\u63a7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86MAS\u9700\u52a0\u5f3a\u5b89\u5168\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u6f5c\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

To facilitate this, we generate composite masked\ninpainting video data to effectively fine-tune the model for 4D video\ngeneration. Given an input video and its associated camera trajectory, we first\nperform depth-based point cloud rendering to obtain invisibility masks that\nindicate the regions that should be completed. Simultaneously, editing masks\nare introduced to specify user-defined modifications, and these are combined\nwith the invisibility masks to create a composite masks dataset. During\ntraining, we randomly sample different types of masks to construct diverse and\nchallenging inpainting scenarios, enhancing the model's generalization and\nrobustness in various 4D editing and generation tasks. To handle temporal\nconsistency under large camera motion, we design a self-iterative tuning\nstrategy that gradually increases the viewing angles during training, where the\nmodel is used to generate the next-stage training data after each fine-tuning\niteration. Moreover, we introduce a temporal packaging module during inference\nto enhance generation quality. Our method effectively leverages the prior\nknowledge of the base model without degrading its original performance,\nenabling the generation of 4D videos with consistent multi-view coherence.

Various\nneural network (NN) models have been proposed that acquire empirically good\nrepresentations. However, the formulation of a good representation has not been\nestablished. We recently proposed a method for categorizing changes between a\npair of sensory inputs. A unique feature of this approach is that\ntransformations between two sensory inputs are learned to satisfy algebraic\nstructural constraints. Conventional representation learning often assumes that\ndisentangled independent feature axes is a good representation; however, we\nfound that such a representation cannot account for conditional independence.\nTo overcome this problem, we proposed a new method using group decomposition in\nGalois algebra theory. Although this method is promising for defining a more\ngeneral representation, it assumes pixel-to-pixel translation without feature\nextraction, and can only process low-resolution images with no background,\nwhich prevents real-world application. In this study, we provide a simple\nmethod to apply our group decomposition theory to a more realistic scenario by\ncombining feature extraction and object segmentation. We replace pixel\ntranslation with feature translation and formulate object segmentation as\ngrouping features under the same transformation.

As the adapted models inevitably encounter\nout-of-distribution (OOD) test data that deviates from the in-distribution (ID)\ntask-specific training data, enhancing OOD generalization in few-shot\nadaptation is critically important. We study robust few-shot VLM adaptation,\naiming to increase both ID and OOD accuracy. By comparing different adaptation\nmethods (e.g., prompt tuning, linear probing, contrastive finetuning, and full\nfinetuning), we uncover three key findings: (1) finetuning with proper\nhyperparameters significantly outperforms the popular VLM adaptation methods\nprompt tuning and linear probing; (2) visual encoder-only finetuning achieves\nbetter efficiency and accuracy than contrastively finetuning both visual and\ntextual encoders; (3) finetuning the top layers of the visual encoder provides\nthe best balance between ID and OOD accuracy. Building on these findings, we\npropose partial finetuning of the visual encoder empowered with two simple\naugmentation techniques: (1) retrieval augmentation which retrieves\ntask-relevant data from the VLM's pretraining dataset to enhance adaptation,\nand (2) adversarial perturbation which promotes robustness during finetuning.\nResults show that the former/latter boosts OOD/ID accuracy while slightly\nsacrificing the ID/OOD accuracy. Yet, perhaps understandably, naively combining\nthe two does not maintain their best OOD/ID accuracy. We address this dilemma\nwith the developed SRAPF, Stage-wise Retrieval Augmentation-based Adversarial\nPartial Finetuning. SRAPF consists of two stages: (1) partial finetuning the\nvisual encoder using both ID and retrieved data, and (2) adversarial partial\nfinetuning with few-shot ID data.

However, AIGVs still suffer from noticeable visual quality defects,\nsuch as noise, blurriness, frame jitter and low dynamic degree, which severely\nimpact the user's viewing experience. Therefore, an effective automatic visual\nquality assessment is of great importance for AIGV content regulation and\ngenerative model improvement. In this work, we decompose the visual quality of\nAIGVs into three dimensions: technical quality, motion quality, and video\nsemantics. For each dimension, we design corresponding encoder to achieve\neffective feature representation. Moreover, considering the outstanding\nperformance of large language models (LLMs) in various vision and language\ntasks, we introduce a LLM as the quality regression module.

In practice, pre-training has been\nrelying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available\non the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the\nsame rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality\ntexts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of\nthe initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the \"data wall\"\nof pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data\ndiscarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web\nwith guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they\ncould become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the\nrepresentation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set.

Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more\neffective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we\ndemonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming\nlower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded.

By incorporating a\ndiffusion model into policy learning, iDPOE ensures efficient training and\nsampling, leading to more accurate predictions and better generalization.\nAdditionally, we enhance the model's ability to generalize to geometric\nsymmetries by embedding equivariance into the learning process.

These\nattacks are hard to detect and defend due to their stealthiness and cross-modal\nnature. By analyzing attack samples, we identify two key vulnerabilities: (1)\nabnormal attention concentration on specific image regions, and (2) semantic\ndrift and incoherence in generated captions. To counter this, we propose\nSemantic Reward Defense (SRD), a reinforcement learning framework that\nmitigates backdoor behavior without prior knowledge of triggers. SRD uses a\nDeep Q-Network to learn policies for applying discrete perturbations (e.g.,\nocclusion, color masking) to sensitive image regions, aiming to disrupt the\nactivation of malicious pathways.

However, can smaller high-value datasets match or\noutperform full corpora for multi-modal reasoning in MLLMs? In this work, we\nchallenge this assumption through a key observation: meaningful multi-modal\nreasoning is triggered by only a sparse subset of training samples, termed\ncognitive samples, whereas the majority contribute marginally. Building on this\ninsight, we propose a novel data selection paradigm termed Reasoning Activation\nPotential (RAP), which identifies cognitive samples by estimating each sample's\npotential to stimulate genuine multi-modal reasoning by two complementary\nestimators: 1) Causal Discrepancy Estimator (CDE) based on the potential\noutcome model principle, eliminates samples that overly rely on language priors\nby comparing outputs between multi-modal and text-only inputs; 2) Attention\nConfidence Estimator (ACE), which exploits token-level self-attention to\ndiscard samples dominated by irrelevant but over-emphasized tokens in\nintermediate reasoning stages. Moreover, we introduce a Difficulty-aware\nReplacement Module (DRM) to substitute trivial instances with cognitively\nchallenging ones, thereby ensuring complexity for robust multi-modal reasoning.\nExperiments on six datasets show that our RAP method consistently achieves\nsuperior performance using only 9.3% of the training data, while reducing\ncomputational costs by over 43%.

To address this gap, we introduce MMSU, a\ncomprehensive benchmark designed specifically for understanding and reasoning\nin spoken language. MMSU comprises 5,000 meticulously curated\naudio-question-answer triplets across 47 distinct tasks. To ground our\nbenchmark in linguistic theory, we systematically incorporate a wide range of\nlinguistic phenomena, including phonetics, prosody, rhetoric, syntactics,\nsemantics, and paralinguistics. Through a rigorous evaluation of 14 advanced\nSpeechLLMs, we identify substantial room for improvement in existing models,\nhighlighting meaningful directions for future optimization. MMSU establishes a\nnew standard for comprehensive assessment of spoken language understanding,\nproviding valuable insights for developing more sophisticated human-AI speech\ninteraction systems.

While recent research often focuses on\nimproving specific RANSAC components (e.g., sampling, scoring), overall\nperformance is frequently more influenced by the \"bells and whistles\" (i.e.,\nthe implementation details and problem-specific optimizations) within a given\nlibrary. Popular frameworks like OpenCV and PoseLib demonstrate varying\nperformance, excelling in some tasks but lagging in others. We introduce\nSupeRANSAC, a novel unified RANSAC pipeline, and provide a detailed analysis of\nthe techniques that make RANSAC effective for specific vision tasks, including\nhomography, fundamental/essential matrix, and absolute/rigid pose estimation.\nSupeRANSAC is designed for consistent accuracy across these tasks, improving\nupon the best existing methods by, for example, 6 AUC points on average for\nfundamental matrix estimation. We demonstrate significant performance\nimprovements over the state-of-the-art on multiple problems and datasets.

This work describes an\nLLM-based reasoning system built from open-licensed components that solves\ncryptic clues by (i) hypothesising answers; (ii) proposing wordplay\nexplanations; and (iii) using a verifier system that operates on codified\nreasoning steps. Overall, this system establishes a new state-of-the-art\nperformance on the challenging Cryptonite dataset of clues from The Times and\nThe Telegraph newspapers in the UK.

In our approach, we do not rely on the knowledge of the LLM,\nbut we inject the knowledge into the prompt to contrast the hallucinations,\ngiving the educators control over the test's source text, too. Our experiment\ninvolving 21 educators shows that GPT-3.5 generates the most effective MCQs\nacross several known metrics.

Yet their adoption brings a\nfundamental risk: these models are inherently unstable. Adversarial\nmanipulations can easily fool them, inflating scores and undermining trust.\nTraditionally, such vulnerabilities are addressed through data-driven defenses\n-- adversarial retraining, regularization, or input purification. But what if\nthis is the wrong lens? What if robustness in perceptual models is not\nsomething to learn but something to design? In this work, we propose a\nprovocative idea: robustness as an architectural prior. Rather than training\nmodels to resist perturbations, we reshape their internal structure to suppress\nsensitivity from the ground up.

VAR iteratively estimates the\nresidual in latent space between gradually increasing image scales, a process\nreferred to as next-scale prediction. Thus, the strong priors learned during\npre-training align well with the downstream task (ISR). To our knowledge, only\nVARSR has exploited this synergy so far, showing promising results. However,\ndue to the limitations of existing residual quantizers, VARSR works only at a\nfixed resolution, i.e. it fails to map intermediate outputs to the\ncorresponding image scales. Additionally, it relies on a 1B transformer\narchitecture (VAR-d24), and leverages a large-scale private dataset to achieve\nstate-of-the-art results. We address these limitations through two novel\ncomponents: a) a Hierarchical Image Tokenization approach with a multi-scale\nimage tokenizer that progressively represents images at different scales while\nsimultaneously enforcing token overlap across scales, and b) a Direct\nPreference Optimization (DPO) regularization term that, relying solely on the\nLR and HR tokenizations, encourages the transformer to produce the latter over\nthe former.

Here, we\npresent and critique two examples of apparent introspective self-report from\nLLMs. In the first example, an LLM attempts to describe the process behind its\nown ``creative'' writing, and we argue this is not a valid example of\nintrospection. In the second example, an LLM correctly infers the value of its\nown temperature parameter, and we argue that this can be legitimately\nconsidered a minimal example of introspection, albeit one that is (presumably)\nnot accompanied by conscious experience.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u62a5\u544a\u884c\u4e3a\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u5185\u7701\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u4f8b\u5b50\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLMs\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5176\u81ea\u6211\u62a5\u544a\u884c\u4e3a\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5bf9\u5176\u662f\u5426\u5177\u6709\u5185\u7701\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8ba8\u8bba\uff0c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u5185\u7701\u4e0e\u610f\u8bc6\u5173\u8054\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790LLMs\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u81ea\u6211\u62a5\u544a\u4f8b\u5b50\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u63cf\u8ff0\u5176\u201c\u521b\u9020\u6027\u201d\u5199\u4f5c\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e8c\u662f\u63a8\u65ad\u5176\u81ea\u8eab\u6e29\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f8b\u5b50\u4e0d\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u5185\u7701\uff0c\u800c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u4f8b\u5b50\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u5185\u7701\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u610f\u8bc6\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u7684\u67d0\u4e9b\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u5185\u7701\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5185\u7701\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u5dee\u5f02\u4ecd\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Leveraging street view\nimagery and a multimodal large language model (VisualGLM-6B), we construct a\nCommunity Commercial Vitality Index (CCVI) from Meituan and Dianping data and\nanalyze its relationship with spatial attributes extracted via GPT-4-based\nperception modeling. Our findings reveal that while moderate vehicle presence\nmay enhance commercial access, excessive on-street parking -- especially in\nnarrow streets -- erodes walkability and reduces both satisfaction and\nshop-level pricing. In contrast, streets with higher perceived greenery and\ncleanliness show significantly greater satisfaction scores but only weak\nassociations with pricing. Street width moderates the effects of vehicle\npresence, underscoring the importance of spatial configuration. These results\ndemonstrate the value of integrating AI-assisted perception with urban\nmorphological analysis to capture non-linear and context-sensitive drivers of\ncommercial success.

In this study, we systematically\ncompare human and LLM assessments of image descriptions containing controlled\nsemantic errors. We extend the experimental framework of van Miltenburg et al.\n(2020) to both unimodal (text-only) and multimodal (text + image) settings,\nevaluating four error types: age, gender, clothing type, and clothing colour.\nOur findings reveal that humans assign varying levels of severity to different\nerror types, with visual context significantly amplifying perceived severity\nfor colour and type errors. Notably, most LLMs assign low scores to gender\nerrors but disproportionately high scores to colour errors, unlike humans, who\njudge both as highly severe but for different reasons.

Although existing methods have primarily focused on detecting\nanomalous objects in videos -- either by identifying anomalous frames or\nobjects -- they often neglect finer-grained analysis, such as anomalous pixels,\nwhich limits their ability to capture a broader range of anomalies. To address\nthis challenge, we propose a new framework called Track Any Anomalous Object\n(TAO), which introduces a granular video anomaly detection pipeline that, for\nthe first time, integrates the detection of multiple fine-grained anomalous\nobjects into a unified framework. Unlike methods that assign anomaly scores to\nevery pixel, our approach transforms the problem into pixel-level tracking of\nanomalous objects. By linking anomaly scores to downstream tasks such as\nsegmentation and tracking, our method removes the need for threshold tuning and\nachieves more precise anomaly localization in long and complex video sequences.\nExperiments demonstrate that TAO sets new benchmarks in accuracy and\nrobustness.

Inspired by our empirical\nobservation, we argue that unimodal adaptation and cross-modal adaptation are\ntwo essential parts for the effective fine-tuning of MLLMs. From this\nperspective, we propose Multimodal low-rank Adaptation (MokA), a\nmultimodal-aware efficient fine-tuning strategy that takes multimodal\ncharacteristics into consideration. It compresses unimodal information by\nmodality-specific parameters while explicitly enhancing cross-modal\ninteraction, ensuring both unimodal and cross-modal adaptation. Extensive\nexperiments cover three representative multimodal scenarios (audio-visual-text,\nvisual-text, and speech-text), and multiple LLM backbones (LLaMA2/3, Qwen2,\nQwen2.5-VL, etc).

To tackle these issues, we propose\nFollow-Your-Motion, an efficient two-stage video motion transfer framework that\nfinetunes a powerful video diffusion transformer to synthesize complex\nmotion.Specifically, we propose a spatial-temporal decoupled LoRA to decouple\nthe attention architecture for spatial appearance and temporal motion\nprocessing. During the second training stage, we design the sparse motion\nsampling and adaptive RoPE to accelerate the tuning speed. To address the lack\nof a benchmark for this field, we introduce MotionBench, a comprehensive\nbenchmark comprising diverse motion, including creative camera motion, single\nobject motion, multiple object motion, and complex human motion. We show\nextensive evaluations on MotionBench to verify the superiority of\nFollow-Your-Motion.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faFollow-Your-Motion\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4-\u65f6\u95f4\u89e3\u8026\u7684LoRA\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u8fd0\u52a8\u91c7\u6837\u4f18\u5316\u89c6\u9891\u8fd0\u52a8\u8fc1\u79fb\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u8c03\u4f18\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eLoRA\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8fc1\u79fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u8c03\u4f18\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7a7a\u95f4-\u65f6\u95f4\u89e3\u8026\u7684LoRA\uff0c\u7a00\u758f\u8fd0\u52a8\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94RoPE\uff0c\u5206\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728MotionBench\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86Follow-Your-Motion\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Follow-Your-Motion\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8fd0\u52a8\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Many existing\nworld modeling pipelines are based on implicit generative models, which are\nhard to train and often lack 3D or physical consistency. On the other hand,\nexplicit 3D methods built from a single state often require multi-stage\nprocessing-such as segmentation, background completion, and inpainting-due to\nocclusions. To address this, we leverage two perturbed observations of the same\nscene under different object configurations. These dual states offer\ncomplementary visibility, alleviating occlusion issues during state transitions\nand enabling more stable and complete reconstruction. In this paper, we present\nDSG-World, a novel end-to-end framework that explicitly constructs a 3D\nGaussian World model from Dual State observations. Our approach builds dual\nsegmentation-aware Gaussian fields and enforces bidirectional photometric and\nsemantic consistency.

In SRR, document parsing is abstracted\ninto three fundamental questions - \"Where is it?\" (structure), \"What is it?\"\n(recognition), and \"How is it organized?\" (relation) - corresponding to layout\nanalysis, content identification, and logical ordering. This focused\ndecomposition balances accuracy and speed: it enables efficient, scalable\nprocessing without sacrificing precision.

Therefore, in\nthis paper, we propose SAM-aware Test-Time Adaptation (SAM-TTA), a\nfundamentally different pipeline that preserves the generalization of SAM while\nimproving its segmentation performance in medical imaging via a test-time\nframework. SAM-TTA tackles two key challenges: (1) input-level discrepancies\ncaused by differences in image acquisition between natural and medical images\nand (2) semantic-level discrepancies due to fundamental differences in object\ndefinition between natural and medical domains (e.g., clear boundaries vs.\nambiguous structures). Specifically, our SAM-TTA framework comprises (1)\nSelf-adaptive Bezier Curve-based Transformation (SBCT), which adaptively\nconverts single-channel medical images into three-channel SAM-compatible inputs\nwhile maintaining structural integrity, to mitigate the input gap between\nmedical and natural images, and (2) Dual-scale Uncertainty-driven Mean Teacher\nadaptation (DUMT), which employs consistency learning to align SAM's internal\nrepresentations to medical semantics, enabling efficient adaptation without\nauxiliary supervision or expensive retraining. Extensive experiments on five\npublic datasets demonstrate that our SAM-TTA outperforms existing TTA\napproaches and even surpasses fully fine-tuned models such as MedSAM in certain\nscenarios, establishing a new paradigm for universal medical image\nsegmentation.

Although recent advances in 3D\nobject and scene completion have achieved impressive results, existing methods\nlack 3D consistency, are computationally expensive, and struggle to capture\nsharp object boundaries. Our work (RaySt3R) addresses these limitations by\nrecasting 3D shape completion as a novel view synthesis problem. Specifically,\ngiven a single RGB-D image and a novel viewpoint (encoded as a collection of\nquery rays), we train a feedforward transformer to predict depth maps, object\nmasks, and per-pixel confidence scores for those query rays. RaySt3R fuses\nthese predictions across multiple query views to reconstruct complete 3D\nshapes. We evaluate RaySt3R on synthetic and real-world datasets, and observe\nit achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the baselines on all\ndatasets by up to 44% in 3D chamfer distance.

Among these XAI\nmethods, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to restrict the model's latent\nspace to human-understandable high-level concepts by generating a conceptual\nlayer for extracting conceptual features, which has drawn much attention\nrecently. However, existing methods rely solely on concept features to\ndetermine the model's predictions, which overlook the intrinsic feature\nembeddings within medical images.

With the integration with physics, it opens up new\napplications. The inverse problem of estimating physics from visual data,\nhowever, still remains challenging, limiting its effectiveness for applications\nlike physically accurate digital twin creation in robotics and XR. Existing\nmethods that incorporate physics into neural rendering frameworks typically\nrequire dense multi-view videos as input, making them impractical for scalable,\nreal-world use. When presented with sparse multi-view videos, the sequential\noptimization strategy used by existing approaches introduces significant error\naccumulation, e.g., poor initial 3D reconstruction leads to bad material\nparameter estimation in subsequent stages. Instead of sequential optimization,\ndirectly optimizing all parameters at the same time also fails due to the\nhighly non-convex and often non-differentiable nature of the problem. We\npropose ProJo4D, a progressive joint optimization framework that gradually\nincreases the set of jointly optimized parameters guided by their sensitivity,\nleading to fully joint optimization over geometry, appearance, physical state,\nand material property. Evaluations on PAC-NeRF and Spring-Gaus datasets show\nthat ProJo4D outperforms prior work in 4D future state prediction, novel view\nrendering of future state, and material parameter estimation, demonstrating its\neffectiveness in physically grounded 4D scene understanding.

Based on their encoder design, this\npaper categorizes recent 3D VLMs into 3D object-centric, 2D image-based, and 3D\nscene-centric approaches. Despite the architectural similarity of 3D\nscene-centric VLMs to their 2D counterparts, they have exhibited comparatively\nlower performance compared with the latest 3D object-centric and 2D image-based\napproaches. To understand this gap, we conduct an in-depth analysis, revealing\nthat 3D scene-centric VLMs show limited reliance on the 3D scene encoder, and\nthe pre-train stage appears less effective than in 2D VLMs. Furthermore, we\nobserve that data scaling benefits are less pronounced on larger datasets. Our\ninvestigation suggests that while these models possess cross-modal alignment\ncapabilities, they tend to over-rely on linguistic cues and overfit to frequent\nanswer distributions, thereby diminishing the effective utilization of the 3D\nencoder.

While methods like Monte Carlo Tree Search\n(MCTS) have proven effective in some domains, their reliance on fixed\nexploration hyperparameters limits their adaptability across tasks of varying\ndifficulty, rendering them impractical or expensive in certain settings. In\nthis paper, we propose \\textbf{LLM-First Search (LFS)}, a novel \\textit{LLM\nSelf-Guided Search} method that removes the need for pre-defined search\nstrategies by empowering the LLM to autonomously control the search process via\nself-guided exploration. Rather than relying on external heuristics or\nhardcoded policies, the LLM evaluates whether to pursue the current search path\nor explore alternative branches based on its internal scoring mechanisms. This\nenables more flexible and context-sensitive reasoning without requiring manual\ntuning or task-specific adaptation. We evaluate LFS on Countdown and Sudoku\nagainst three classic widely-used search algorithms, Tree-of-Thoughts' Breadth\nFirst Search (ToT-BFS), Best First Search (BestFS), and MCTS, each of which\nhave been used to achieve SotA results on a range of challenging reasoning\ntasks.

Kinetics\nScaling Law suggests that test-time compute is more effective when used on\nmodels above a threshold than smaller ones.

In contrast to canonical Gaussian\nprimitives, our representation possesses the strong flexibility, thus improving\nthe ability to model dynamic 3D scenes. In addition, we endow each Gaussian\nprimitive with an motion function, allowing it to move to neighboring regions\nover time, which reduces the temporal redundancy.

To this end, we introduce VideoMathQA, a\nbenchmark designed to evaluate whether models can perform such temporally\nextended cross-modal reasoning on videos.

We employ graduate-level experts to ensure high quality,\ntotaling over $920$ man-hours of annotation. To reflect real-world scenarios,\nquestions are designed around three core reasoning challenges: direct problem\nsolving, where answers are grounded in the presented question; conceptual\ntransfer, which requires applying learned methods to new problems; and deep\ninstructional comprehension, involving multi-step reasoning over extended\nexplanations and partially worked-out solutions. Each question includes\nmulti-step reasoning annotations, enabling fine-grained diagnosis of model\ncapabilities.

In this work, we\naddress the problem of denoising images degraded by Poisson noise under extreme\nlow-light conditions. We introduce a light-weight deep learning-based method\nthat integrates Retinex based decomposition with Poisson denoising into a\nunified encoder-decoder network. The model simultaneously enhances illumination\nand suppresses noise by incorporating a Poisson denoising loss to address\nsignal-dependent noise.

We show here how scaling law derivation can also be used for\nmodel and dataset comparison, allowing to decide which procedure is to be\npreferred for pre-training. For the first time, full scaling laws based on\ndense measurements across a wide span of model and samples seen scales are\nderived for two important language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT,\nthat use either contrastive only or contrastive and captioning text generative\nloss. Ensuring sufficient prediction accuracy for held out points, we use\nderived scaling laws to compare both models, obtaining evidence for MaMMUT's\nstronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than standard\nCLIP. To strengthen validity of the comparison, we show scaling laws for\nvarious downstream tasks, classification, retrieval, and segmentation, and for\ndifferent open datasets, DataComp, DFN and Re-LAION, observing consistently the\nsame trends. We show that comparison can also be performed when deriving\nscaling laws with a constant learning rate schedule, reducing compute cost.\nAccurate derivation of scaling laws provides thus means to perform model and\ndataset comparison across scale spans, avoiding misleading conclusions based on\nmeasurements from single reference scales only, paving the road for systematic\ncomparison and improvement of open foundation models and datasets for their\ncreation.

Extensive evaluation on two clinically\nsignificant benchmarks demonstrates the efficacy of DM-SegNet: achieving\nstate-of-the-art Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 85.44% on the Synapse\ndataset for abdominal organ segmentation and 90.22% on the BraTS2023 dataset\nfor brain tumor segmentation.", "AI": {"tldr": "DM-SegNet\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ccMamba\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u6362\u548c\u89e3\u5256\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u5c42\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u62d3\u6251\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u533b\u5b66\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff08SSMs\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c1D\u5e8f\u5217\u5c55\u5e73\u7834\u574f\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u65e0\u6cd5\u5229\u7528Mamba\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "method": "DM-SegNet\u91c7\u7528\u56db\u65b9\u54113D\u626b\u63cf\u7684Mamba\u6a21\u5757\u4fdd\u6301\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u95e8\u63a7\u7a7a\u95f4\u5377\u79ef\u5c42\u589e\u5f3a\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caMamba\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u72b6\u6001\u540c\u6b65\u3002", "result": "\u5728Synapse\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523085.44%\u7684DSC\uff08\u8179\u90e8\u5668\u5b98\u5206\u5272\uff09\uff0c\u5728BraTS2023\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523090.22%\u7684DSC\uff08\u8111\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u5272\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "DM-SegNet\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}
