However,\nseveral challenges remain for diffusion-based methods: 1) inefficient inference\nand visual artifacts, which arise from the implicit latent space of Variational\nAuto-Encoders (VAE), complicating the diffusion process; 2) authentic facial\nexpressions and head movements, resulting from insufficient multi-modal\ninformation interaction. In this paper, MoDA handle these challenges by 1)\ndefines a joint parameter space to bridge motion generation and neural\nrendering, and leverages flow matching to simplify the diffusion learning\nprocess; 2) introduces a multi-modal diffusion architecture to model the\ninteraction among noisy motion, audio, and auxiliary conditions, ultimately\nenhancing overall facial expressiveness. Subsequently, a coarse-to-fine fusion\nstrategy is adopted to progressively integrate different modalities, ensuring\neffective integration across feature spaces.

Additionally, VR devices\nsuch as head-mounted displays (HMDs) are intricately linked to human visual\nbehavior, leveraging knowledge from perception and cognition to improve user\nexperience.

Reliability is assessed through the accuracy of\ncorrect outputs under repetitive runs of the same problems, whereas robustness\nis evaluated via the performance across varying load and boundary conditions. A\nbenchmark dataset, comprising eight beam analysis problems, is created to test\nthe Llama-3.3 70B Instruct model.

To address this challenge, we introduce Temporal\nSearch, a training-free framework that enables MLLMs to explore temporal\nregions for improved long video understanding iteratively.

TS refines the focus of the\nmodel by iteratively shifting attention to more fine-grained temporal\nintervals, improving its understanding of long videos.

Specifically, we introduce a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) based\nmotion simulation method to model risks from three aspects: the ego-vehicle,\nother vehicles, and the environment. This allows us to synthesize\nplug-and-play, high-risk motion data suitable for VLM training, which we call\nDriveMRP-10K. Furthermore, we design a VLM-agnostic motion risk estimation\nframework, named DriveMRP-Agent. This framework incorporates a novel\ninformation injection strategy for global context, ego-vehicle perspective, and\ntrajectory projection, enabling VLMs to effectively reason about the spatial\nrelationships between motion waypoints and the environment. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that by fine-tuning with DriveMRP-10K, our\nDriveMRP-Agent framework can significantly improve the motion risk prediction\nperformance of multiple VLM baselines, with the accident recognition accuracy\nsoaring from 27.13% to 88.03%. Moreover, when tested via zero-shot evaluation\non an in-house real-world high-risk motion dataset, DriveMRP-Agent achieves a\nsignificant performance leap, boosting the accuracy from base_model's 29.42% to\n68.50%, which showcases the strong generalization capabilities of our method in\nreal-world scenarios."}

In this work, we introduce a psychological taxonomy, categorizing\nVLMs' hallucination behaviours, including sycophancy, logical inconsistency,\nand a newly identified VLMs behaviour: authority bias. To systematically\nanalyze these behaviours, we design AIpsych, a scalable benchmark that reveals\npsychological tendencies in model response patterns.

Objective: To develop and evaluate a\nprivacy-preserving, on-device medical transcription system using a fine-tuned\nLlama 3.2 1B model capable of generating structured medical notes from medical\ntranscriptions while maintaining complete data sovereignty entirely in the\nbrowser. Methods: We fine-tuned a Llama 3.2 1B model using Parameter-Efficient\nFine-Tuning (PEFT) with LoRA on 1,500 synthetic medical\ntranscription-to-structured note pairs. The model was evaluated against the\nbase Llama 3.2 1B on two datasets: 100 endocrinology transcripts and 140\nmodified ACI benchmark cases. Evaluation employed both statistical metrics\n(ROUGE, BERTScore, BLEURT) and LLM-as-judge assessments across multiple\nclinical quality dimensions. Results: The fine-tuned OnDevice model\ndemonstrated substantial improvements over the base model. On the ACI\nbenchmark, ROUGE-1 scores increased from 0.346 to 0.496, while BERTScore F1\nimproved from 0.832 to 0.866. Clinical quality assessments showed marked\nreduction in major hallucinations (from 85 to 35 cases) and enhanced factual\ncorrectness (2.81 to 3.54 on 5-point scale).

Nevertheless, such approach leads to inferior performance in various\nNLP tasks when the model is not certain about testing questions. To this end,\nwe propose a brand new training-free decoding strategy, dubbed as Cautious Next\nToken Prediction (CNTP). In the decoding process, if the model has\ncomparatively high prediction entropy at a certain step, we sample multiple\ntrials starting from the step independently and stop when encountering any\npunctuation.

As agents and their environments grow\nmore complex, identifying the error source becomes increasingly difficult but\ncritical for reliable deployment. We introduce AIProbe, a novel black-box\ntesting technique that applies differential testing to attribute undesirable\nagent behaviors either to agent deficiencies, such as modeling or training\nflaws, or due to environmental infeasibility. AIProbe first generates diverse\nenvironmental configurations and tasks for testing the agent, by modifying\nconfigurable parameters using Latin Hypercube sampling. It then solves each\ngenerated task using a search-based planner, independent of the agent. By\ncomparing the agent's performance to the planner's solution, AIProbe identifies\nwhether failures are due to errors in the agent's model or policy, or due to\nunsolvable task conditions.

However, existing\nLLM-based methods fail to sufficiently leverage the rich temporal information\ninherent in users' historical interaction sequences, stemming from fundamental\narchitectural constraints: LLMs process information through self-attention\nmechanisms that lack inherent sequence ordering and rely on position embeddings\ndesigned primarily for natural language rather than user interaction sequences.\nThis limitation significantly impairs their ability to capture the evolution of\nuser preferences over time and predict future interests accurately.\n  To address this critical gap, we propose Counterfactual Enhanced Temporal\nFramework for LLM-Based Recommendation (CETRec). CETRec is grounded in causal\ninference principles, which allow it to isolate and measure the specific impact\nof temporal information on recommendation outcomes. By conceptualizing temporal\norder as an independent causal factor distinct from item content, we can\nquantify its unique contribution through counterfactual reasoning--comparing\nwhat recommendations would be made with and without temporal information while\nkeeping all other factors constant.

Among\nthese methods, those that leverage hidden states to train probes have shown\nparticular promise, as these internal representations encode information\nrelevant to the factuality of responses, making this approach the focus of this\npaper. However, the probe trained on the hidden states of one dataset often\nstruggles to generalise to another dataset of a different task or domain. To\naddress this limitation, we explore combining data-agnostic features with\nhidden-state features and assess whether this hybrid feature set enhances\nout-of-domain performance. We further examine whether selecting only the most\ninformative hidden-state features, thereby discarding task-specific noise,\nenables the data-agnostic features to contribute more effectively. The\nexperiment results indicate that although introducing data-agnostic features\ngenerally enhances generalisation performance in most cases, in certain\nscenarios their inclusion degrades performance. A similar pattern emerges when\nretaining only the most important hidden-state features - adding data-agnostic\nfeatures does not consistently further enhance performance compared to using\nthe full set of hidden-state features. A closer analysis reveals that, in some\nspecific cases, the trained probe underweights the data-agnostic features\nrelative to the hidden-state features, which we believe is the main reason why\nthe results are inconclusive."}

To address this, we propose DESign, a\nnovel framework that incorporates Dynamic Context-Aware Convolution (DCAC) and\nSubnet Regularization Connectionist Temporal Classification (SR-CTC). DCAC\ndynamically captures the inter-frame motion cues that constitute signs and\nuniquely adapts convolutional weights in a fine-grained manner based on\ncontextual information, enabling the model to better generalize across diverse\nsigning behaviors and boost recognition accuracy. Furthermore, we observe that\nexisting methods still rely on only a limited number of frames for parameter\nupdates during training, indicating that CTC learning overfits to a dominant\npath.

A classifier-sharing strategy in SR-CTC\nfurther strengthens multi-scale consistency.

Distinguished from these direct evaluate-then-select\nschemes, this work investigates iterative approximate evaluation for arbitrary\nprompts and introduces Model Predictive Prompt Selection (MoPPS), a Bayesian\nrisk-predictive framework that online estimates prompt difficulty without\nrequiring costly LLM interactions. Technically, MoPPS models each prompt's\nsuccess rate as a latent variable, performs streaming Bayesian inference, and\nemploys posterior sampling in a constructed multi-armed bandit machine,\nenabling sample efficient and adaptive prompt selection. Extensive experiments\nacross mathematics, planning, and vision-based geometry tasks show that MoPPS\nreliably predicts prompt difficulty and accelerates training with significantly\nreduced LLM rollouts."}

Our Dual-task Autoregressive Imitation\nLearning (DARIL) baseline achieves 34.6% action triplet recognition mAP and\n33.6% next frame prediction mAP with smooth planning degradation to 29.2% at\n10-second horizons. We evaluated three RL variants: world model-based RL,\ndirect video RL, and inverse RL enhancement. Surprisingly, all RL approaches\nunderperformed DARIL i.e. world model RL dropped to 3.1% mAP at 10s while\ndirect video RL achieved only 15.9%. Our analysis reveals that distribution\nmatching on expert-annotated test sets systematically favors IL over\npotentially valid RL policies that differ from training demonstrations. This\nchallenges assumptions about RL superiority in sequential decision making and\nprovides crucial insights for surgical AI development."}

Advances in computer vision and image processing technologies\npresent significant potential to address this gap by enhancing radiologists'\ncapabilities and improving diagnostic accuracy. Large language models (LLMs),\nparticularly generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs), have become the\nprimary approach for understanding and generating textual data. In parallel,\nvision transformers (ViTs) have proven effective at converting visual data into\na format that LLMs can process efficiently. In this paper, we present ChestGPT,\na deep-learning framework that integrates the EVA ViT with the Llama 2 LLM to\nclassify diseases and localize regions of interest in chest X-ray images. The\nViT converts X-ray images into tokens, which are then fed, together with\nengineered prompts, into the LLM, enabling joint classification and\nlocalization of diseases. This approach incorporates transfer learning\ntechniques to enhance both explainability and performance. The proposed method\nachieved strong global disease classification performance on the VinDr-CXR\ndataset, with an F1 score of 0.76, and successfully localized pathologies by\ngenerating bounding boxes around the regions of interest. We also outline\nseveral task-specific prompts, in addition to general-purpose prompts, for\nscenarios radiologists might encounter.

To assess\nToM in a dynamic, goal-oriented, and collaborative environment, we introduce a\nnovel task, Instruction Inference, in which an agent assists a principal in\nreaching a goal by interpreting indirect or ambiguous instructions. We present\nTomcat, an LLM-based agent, designed to exhibit ToM reasoning in interpreting\nand responding to the principal's instructions. We implement two variants of\nTomcat. One, dubbed Fs-CoT, is based on a small number of examples (i.e.,\nfew-shot or Fs) demonstrating the requisite structured reasoning (i.e.,\nchain-of-thought or CoT). One, dubbed CP, relies on commonsense knowledge and\ninformation about the problem (i.e., commonsense prompt or CP). We realized\nboth variants of Tomcat on three leading large language models (LLMs), namely,\nGPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and Gemma-3-27B. To evaluate the effectiveness of Tomcat,\nwe conducted a study with 52 human participants in which we provided\nparticipants with the same information as the CP variant of Tomcat.

Near-infrared, with superior fog penetration, offers\ncritical complementary cues through multimodal fusion. However, existing\nmethods focus on content integration while often neglecting haze embedded in\nvisible images, leading to results with residual haze. In this work, we argue\nthat the infrared and visible modalities not only provide complementary\nlow-level visual features, but also share high-level semantic consistency.\nMotivated by this, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Fusion (HSVF)\nframework, comprising a semantic stream to reconstruct haze-free scenes and a\nvisual stream to incorporate structural details from the near-infrared\nmodality. The semantic stream first acquires haze-robust semantic prediction by\naligning modality-invariant intrinsic representations.

To this end,\nwe propose a brand new training-free decoding strategy, dubbed as Cautious Next\nToken Prediction (CNTP).

Then we select the trial with the lowest perplexity score viewed\nas the most probable and reliable trial path given the model's capacity. The\ntrial number is negatively correlated with the prediction confidence, i.e., the\nless confident the model is, the more trials it should sample. This is\nconsistent with human beings' behaviour: when feeling uncertain or unconfident,\none tends to think more creatively, exploring multiple thinking paths, to\ncautiously select the path one feels most confident about.

To address\nthese critical issues, we propose Generative DyTAG Benchmark (GDGB), which\ncomprises eight meticulously curated DyTAG datasets with high-quality textual\nfeatures for both nodes and edges, overcoming limitations of prior datasets.\nBuilding on GDGB, we define two novel DyTAG generation tasks: Transductive\nDynamic Graph Generation (TDGG) and Inductive Dynamic Graph Generation (IDGG).\nTDGG transductively generates a target DyTAG based on the given source and\ndestination node sets, while the more challenging IDGG introduces new node\ngeneration to inductively model the dynamic expansion of real-world graph data.\nTo enable holistic evaluation, we design multifaceted metrics that assess the\nstructural, temporal, and textual quality of the generated DyTAGs. We further\npropose GAG-General, an LLM-based multi-agent generative framework tailored for\nreproducible and robust benchmarking of DyTAG generation. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that GDGB enables rigorous evaluation of TDGG and IDGG, with key\ninsights revealing the critical interplay of structural and textual features in\nDyTAG generation. These findings establish GDGB as a foundational resource for\nadvancing generative DyTAG research and unlocking further practical\napplications in DyTAG generation.

Despite the large volume of research\nworks in the field, a structured and complete survey on VHGR is still missing,\nleaving researchers to navigate through hundreds of papers in order to find the\nright combination of data, model, and approach for each task. The current\nsurvey aims to fill this gap by presenting a comprehensive overview of this\naspect of computer vision. With a systematic research methodology that\nidentifies the state-of-the-art works and a structured presentation of the\nvarious methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics, this review aims to\nconstitute a useful guideline for researchers, helping them to choose the right\nstrategy for delving into a certain VHGR task. Starting with the methodology\nused for study selection, literature retrieval, and the analytical framing, the\nsurvey identifies and organizes key VHGR approaches using a taxonomy-based\nformat in various dimensions such as input modality and application domain. The\ncore of the survey provides an in-depth analysis of state-of-the-art techniques\nacross three primary VHGR tasks: static gesture recognition, isolated dynamic\ngestures and continuous gesture recognition. For each task, the architectural\ntrends and learning strategies are listed. Additionally, the study reviews\ncommonly used datasets - emphasizing on annotation schemes - and evaluates\nstandard performance metrics. It concludes by identifying major challenges in\nVHGR, including both general computer vision issues and domain-specific\nobstacles, and outlines promising directions for future research."}

In this paper, we first expand the relationship between the sink token\nand other tokens, moving beyond attention to explore their similarity in hidden\nstates, considering the layer depth. We observe that as the layers get deeper,\nthe cosine similarity between the normalized hidden states of the sink token\nand those of other tokens increases, and that the normalized hidden states of\nthe sink token exhibit negligible changes. These imply that other tokens\nconsistently are directed toward the sink token throughout the layers.

As distance increases, intensified scattering leads to severe\nhaze and signal loss, making it impractical to recover distant details solely\nfrom visible images. Near-infrared, with superior fog penetration, offers\ncritical complementary cues through multimodal fusion. However, existing\nmethods focus on content integration while often neglecting haze embedded in\nvisible images, leading to results with residual haze. In this work, we argue\nthat the infrared and visible modalities not only provide complementary\nlow-level visual features, but also share high-level semantic consistency.\nMotivated by this, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Fusion (HSVF)\nframework, comprising a semantic stream to reconstruct haze-free scenes and a\nvisual stream to incorporate structural details from the near-infrared\nmodality. The semantic stream first acquires haze-robust semantic prediction by\naligning modality-invariant intrinsic representations. Then the shared\nsemantics act as strong priors to restore clear and high-contrast distant\nscenes under severe haze degradation. In parallel, the visual stream focuses on\nrecovering lost structural details from near-infrared by fusing complementary\ncues from both visible and near-infrared images.

The core issue is the\ncurse of rarity. Over time, novel events occur infrequently, and standard\nlogging methods fail to capture them effectively. As a result, large volumes of\nredundant data are stored, while critical novel cases are diluted, leading to\nbiased datasets. This work presents a real-time data selection method focused\non object-level novelty detection to build more balanced and diverse datasets.\nThe method assigns a data-driven novelty score to image frames using a novel\ndynamic Mean Shift algorithm. It models normal content based on mean and\ncovariance statistics to identify frames with novel objects, discarding those\nwith redundant elements. The main findings show that reducing the training\ndataset size with this method can improve model performance, whereas higher\nredundancy tends to degrade it.

First, current methods often rely on only\none simple lan-guage prompt and basic cosine similarity, which fails to learn\nfine-grained associ-ations between multi-faceted linguistic information and\nvisual features within WSI, resulting in inadequate vision-language alignment.\nSecond, these methods primarily exploit patch-level information, overlooking\nthe intrinsic hierarchy of WSIs and their interactions, causing ineffective\nmodeling of hierarchical interac-tions. To tackle these problems, we propose a\nnovel Hierarchical vision-Language collaboration (HiLa) framework for improved\nsurvival prediction. Specifically, HiLa employs pretrained feature extractors\nto generate hierarchical visual features from WSIs at both patch and region\nlevels. At each level, a series of language prompts describing various\nsurvival-related attributes are constructed and aligned with visual features\nvia Optimal Prompt Learning (OPL). This ap-proach enables the comprehensive\nlearning of discriminative visual features cor-responding to different\nsurvival-related attributes from prompts, thereby improv-ing vision-language\nalignment. Furthermore, we introduce two modules, i.e., Cross-Level Propagation\n(CLP) and Mutual Contrastive Learning (MCL) to maximize hierarchical\ncooperation by promoting interactions and consistency be-tween patch and region\nlevels. Experiments on three TCGA datasets demonstrate our SOTA performance."}

This limitation of current datasets is due to the\nexpensive human manual annotation required and to the highly challenging task\nof explaining the language formation process from the perspective of the\nunderlying story, as a complex system of interconnected events in space and\ntime. Through a thorough analysis of recently published methods and available\ndatasets, we identify a general lack of published resources dedicated to the\nproblem of describing videos in complex language, beyond the level of\ndescriptions in the form of enumerations of simple captions. Furthermore, while\nstate-of-the-art methods produce impressive results on the task of generating\nshorter captions from videos by direct end-to-end learning between the videos\nand text, the problem of explaining the relationship between vision and\nlanguage is still beyond our reach. In this work, we propose a shared\nrepresentation between vision and language, based on graphs of events in space\nand time, which can be obtained in an explainable and analytical way, to\nintegrate and connect multiple vision tasks to produce the final natural\nlanguage description. Moreover, we also demonstrate how our automated and\nexplainable video description generation process can function as a fully\nautomatic teacher to effectively train direct, end-to-end neural student\npathways, within a self-supervised neuro-analytical system. We validate that\nour explainable neuro-analytical approach generates coherent, rich and relevant\ntextual descriptions on videos collected from multiple varied datasets, using\nboth standard evaluation metrics, human annotations and consensus from\nensembles of state-of-the-art VLMs."}

Our method is\ncompatible with any tokenizer, including a novel Unicode-centric tokenizer we\nintroduce to ensure universal text coverage.

These\nspurious correlations arise from two primary factors: (1) inherent biases in\nthe textual data, such as frequent co-occurrences of specific verbs or phrases,\nand (2) the model's tendency to overfit to salient or repetitive patterns in\nvideo content. Such biases mislead the model into associating textual cues with\nincorrect visual moments, resulting in unreliable predictions and poor\ngeneralization to out-of-distribution examples. To overcome these limitations,\nwe propose a novel TSG framework, causal intervention and counterfactual\nreasoning that utilizes causal inference to eliminate spurious correlations and\nenhance the model's robustness. Specifically, we first formulate the TSG task\nfrom a causal perspective with a structural causal model. Then, to address\nunobserved confounders reflecting textual biases toward specific verbs or\nphrases, a textual causal intervention is proposed, utilizing do-calculus to\nestimate the causal effects. Furthermore, visual counterfactual reasoning is\nperformed by constructing a counterfactual scenario that focuses solely on\nvideo features, excluding the query and fused multi-modal features.

To address this, we propose\nCVS-AdaptNet, a multi-label adaptation strategy that enhances fine-grained,\nbinary classification across multiple labels by aligning image embeddings with\ntextual descriptions of each CVS criterion using positive and negative prompts.\nBy adapting PeskaVLP, a state-of-the-art surgical foundation model, on the\nEndoscapes-CVS201 dataset, CVS-AdaptNet achieves 57.6 mAP, improving over the\nResNet50 image-only baseline (51.5 mAP) by 6 points. Our results show that\nCVS-AdaptNet's multi-label, multi-modal framework, enhanced by textual prompts,\nboosts CVS recognition over image-only methods. We also propose text-specific\ninference methods, that helps in analysing the image-text alignment. While\nfurther work is needed to match state-of-the-art spatial annotation-based\nmethods, this approach highlights the potential of adapting generalist models\nto specialized surgical tasks.

For the rendering algorithm, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting, a\nstate-of-the-art neural rendering technique. Evaluation results demonstrate\nthat A3FR can reduce end-to-end rendering latency by up to $2\\times$ while\nmaintaining visual quality."}

CLUDI is trained via a teacher-student paradigm: the\nteacher uses stochastic diffusion-based sampling to produce diverse cluster\nassignments, which the student refines into stable predictions. This\nstochasticity acts as a novel data augmentation strategy, enabling CLUDI to\nuncover intricate structures in high-dimensional data.

Neuroscience theory suggests\nthat mammals evolved flexible intelligence through the replication of a\nsemi-independent, sensorimotor module, a functional unit known as a cortical\ncolumn. To address the disparity between biological and artificial\nintelligence, thousand-brains systems were proposed as a means of mirroring the\narchitecture of cortical columns and their interactions.\n  In the current work, we evaluate the unique properties of Monty, the first\nimplementation of a thousand-brains system. We focus on 3D object perception,\nand in particular, the combined task of object recognition and pose estimation.\nUtilizing the YCB dataset of household objects, we first assess Monty's use of\nsensorimotor learning to build structured representations, finding that these\nenable robust generalization. These representations include an emphasis on\nclassifying objects by their global shape, as well as a natural ability to\ndetect object symmetries. We then explore Monty's use of model-free and\nmodel-based policies to enable rapid inference by supporting principled\nmovements. We find that such policies complement Monty's modular architecture,\na design that can accommodate communication between modules to further\naccelerate inference speed via a novel `voting' algorithm. Finally, we examine\nMonty's use of associative, Hebbian-like binding to enable rapid, continual,\nand computationally efficient learning, properties that compare favorably to\ncurrent deep learning architectures. While Monty is still in a nascent stage of\ndevelopment, these findings support thousand-brains systems as a powerful and\npromising new approach to AI."}

While teleoperated robotic surgery provides\nnatural expert demonstrations for imitation learning (IL), reinforcement\nlearning (RL) could potentially discover superior strategies through\nexploration. We present the first comprehensive comparison of IL versus RL for\nsurgical action planning on CholecT50. Our Dual-task Autoregressive Imitation\nLearning (DARIL) baseline achieves 34.6% action triplet recognition mAP and\n33.6% next frame prediction mAP with smooth planning degradation to 29.2% at\n10-second horizons. We evaluated three RL variants: world model-based RL,\ndirect video RL, and inverse RL enhancement. Surprisingly, all RL approaches\nunderperformed DARIL i.e. world model RL dropped to 3.1% mAP at 10s while\ndirect video RL achieved only 15.9%. Our analysis reveals that distribution\nmatching on expert-annotated test sets systematically favors IL over\npotentially valid RL policies that differ from training demonstrations.

The dynamic\nbehavior of hair, such as bouncing or swaying in response to character\nmovements like jumping or walking, plays a significant role in enhancing the\noverall realism and engagement of virtual experiences. Current methods for\nsimulating hair have been constrained by two primary approaches: highly\noptimized physics-based systems and neural methods. However, state-of-the-art\nneural techniques have been limited to quasi-static solutions, failing to\ncapture the dynamic behavior of hair. This paper introduces a novel neural\nmethod that breaks through these limitations, achieving efficient and stable\ndynamic hair simulation while outperforming existing approaches. We propose a\nfully self-supervised method which can be trained without any manual\nintervention or artist generated training data allowing the method to be\nintegrated with hair reconstruction methods to enable automatic end-to-end\nmethods for avatar reconstruction. Our approach harnesses the power of compact,\nmemory-efficient neural networks to simulate hair at the strand level, allowing\nfor the simulation of diverse hairstyles without excessive computational\nresources or memory requirements. We validate the effectiveness of our method\nthrough a variety of hairstyle examples, showcasing its potential for\nreal-world applications."}
