We propose a novel\nyet efficient method to compute Voronoi diagrams bounded by a given domain,\ni.e., the clipped or restricted Voronoi diagrams. The intersection of the\ndomain and a Voronoi cell (domain-cell intersection) is generated by removing\nthe part outside the cell from the domain, which can be accomplished by several\nclippings. Different from the existing methods, we present an edge-based search\nscheme to find clipping planes (bisectors). A test called point-in-cell is\nfirst set up to tell whether a space point is in a target Voronoi cell or not.\nThen, for each edge of the intermediate domain-cell intersection, we will\nlaunch a clipping only if its two endpoints are respectively inside and outside\nthe corresponding Voronoi cell, where the bisector for the clipping can be\nfound by using a few times of point-in-cell tests. Therefore, our method only\ninvolves the clippings that contribute to the final results, which is a great\nadvantage over the state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, because each\ndomain-cell intersection can be generated independently, we extend the proposed\nmethod to the GPUs for computing Voronoi diagrams in parallel.

Such\ndistributions concentrate radiative energy within a narrow lobe and are highly\nsensitive to changes in view direction. However, existing neural radiosity\nmethods, which primarily rely on positional feature encoding, exhibit notable\nlimitations in capturing these high-frequency, strongly view-dependent radiance\ndistributions. To address this, we propose a highly-efficient approach by\nreflectance-aware ray cone encoding based on the neural radiosity framework,\nnamed neural cone radiosity. The core idea is to employ a pre-filtered\nmulti-resolution hash grid to accurately approximate the glossy BSDF lobe,\nembedding view-dependent reflectance characteristics directly into the encoding\nprocess through continuous spatial aggregation. Our design not only\nsignificantly improves the network's ability to model high-frequency reflection\ndistributions but also effectively handles surfaces with a wide range of\nglossiness levels, from highly glossy to low-gloss finishes. Meanwhile, our\nmethod reduces the network's burden in fitting complex radiance distributions,\nallowing the overall architecture to remain compact and efficient.\nComprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently\nproduces high-quality, noise-free renderings in real time under various\nglossiness conditions, and delivers superior fidelity and realism compared to\nbaseline approaches."}

However,\nmodels tuned using FPT are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, leading to\nmisclassification in downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce Federated\nAdversarial Prompt Tuning (\\textbf{FedAPT}), a novel method designed to enhance\nthe adversarial robustness of FPT. We identify a key issue in FedAPT under\nnon-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) settings: a \\textit{class\ninformation gap} between clients and the global model. Clients rely solely on\nlimited local label information to generate adversarial samples for training,\nwhile the global model must defend against adversarial attacks from global\nlabels. To address this issue, we propose a \\textbf{class-aware prompt\ngenerator} that generates visual prompts from text prompts. This generator is\nguided by a \\emph{Global Label Embedding} (serving as a ``beacon\") which\nencodes cross-client label information to create more globally-aligned visual\nprompts. Additionally, we propose a \\textbf{cross-layer generator sharing}\nstrategy to enhance prompt coupling across different layers of the model,\nfurther boosting adversarial robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple\nimage classification datasets demonstrate the superiority of FedAPT in\nimproving adversarial robustness, outperforming existing methods by a large\nmargin. FedAPT also exhibits exceptional generalization in cross-domain and\ncross-dataset scenarios, indicating its effectiveness in real-world\napplications."}

Its\ndysregulation is associated with a wide range of conditions, from\ncardiovascular disease to anxiety disorders. Skin nerve activity (SKNA)\nextracted from high-frequency electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings provides a\nnoninvasive window into SNS dynamics, but its measurement is highly susceptible\nto electromyographic (EMG) contamination. Traditional preprocessing based on\nbandpass filtering within a fixed range (e.g., 500--1000 Hz) is susceptible to\noverlapping EMG and SKNA spectral components, especially during sustained\nmuscle activity. We present a denoising approach using a lightweight\none-dimensional convolutional autoencoder with a long short-term memory (LSTM)\nbottleneck to reconstruct clean SKNA from EMG-contaminated recordings. Using\nclean ECG-derived SKNA data from cognitive stress experiments and EMG noise\nfrom chaotic muscle stimulation recordings, we simulated contamination at\nrealistic noise levels (--4 dB, --8 dB signal-to-noise ratio) and trained the\nmodel in the leave-one-subject-out cross-validation framework.

A prevailing assumption in the community has been to\nanthropomorphize these tokens as \"thinking\", treating longer traces as evidence\nof higher problem-adaptive computation. In this work, we critically examine\nwhether intermediate token sequence length reflects or correlates with problem\ndifficulty. To do so, we train transformer models from scratch on derivational\ntraces of the A* search algorithm, where the number of operations required to\nsolve a maze problem provides a precise and verifiable measure of problem\ncomplexity.

Concretely, RecA conditions a UMM on its own visual understanding\nembeddings and optimizes it to reconstruct the input image with a\nself-supervised reconstruction loss, thereby realigning understanding and\ngeneration. Despite its simplicity, RecA is broadly applicable: across\nautoregressive, masked-autoregressive, and diffusion-based UMMs, it\nconsistently improves generation and editing fidelity. With only 27 GPU-hours,\npost-training with RecA substantially improves image generation performance on\nGenEval (0.73$\\rightarrow$0.90) and DPGBench (80.93$\\rightarrow$88.15), while\nalso boosting editing benchmarks (ImgEdit 3.38$\\rightarrow$3.75, GEdit\n6.94$\\rightarrow$7.25).

Simply\nincreasing the volume of data does not guarantee performance improvements,\nwhile preprocessing, sampling, and validation require substantial time and\ncost.\n  To address this issue, a variety of data selection methods have been\nproposed.

At the input stage, dense point patches require heavy\npre-alignment, weakening object-level semantics and confusing similar\ndistractors.

Nevertheless, previous optimization methods\noften struggle to achieve physically plausible reconstruction results due to\nthe lack of prior knowledge about human-object interactions. In this paper, we\nintroduce ScoreHOI, an effective diffusion-based optimizer that introduces\ndiffusion priors for the precise recovery of human-object interactions. By\nharnessing the controllability within score-guided sampling, the diffusion\nmodel can reconstruct a conditional distribution of human and object pose given\nthe image observation and object feature. During inference, the ScoreHOI\neffectively improves the reconstruction results by guiding the denoising\nprocess with specific physical constraints. Furthermore, we propose a\ncontact-driven iterative refinement approach to enhance the contact\nplausibility and improve the reconstruction accuracy. Extensive evaluations on\nstandard benchmarks demonstrate ScoreHOI's superior performance over\nstate-of-the-art methods, highlighting its ability to achieve a precise and\nrobust improvement in joint human-object interaction reconstruction."}
