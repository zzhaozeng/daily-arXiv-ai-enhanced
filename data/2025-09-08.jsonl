In this work, we introduce\nDISPATCH, the first diffusion-based defense framework for object detection.\nUnlike previous works that aim to \"detect and remove\" adversarial patches,\nDISPATCH adopts a \"regenerate and rectify\" strategy, leveraging generative\nmodels to disarm attack effects while preserving the integrity of the input\nimage.

While recent progress has\nfocused on scaling Language and Agent models, the development of sophisticated,\nexplicit World Models remains a key bottleneck, particularly for complex,\nlong-horizon multi-agent tasks. In domains such as robotic soccer, agents\ntrained via standard reinforcement learning in high-fidelity but\nstructurally-flat simulators often fail due to intractable exploration spaces\nand sparse rewards. This position paper argues that the next frontier in\ndeveloping capable agents lies in creating environments that possess an\nexplicit, hierarchical World Model.

While many recent studies\nfocus on quantifying model uncertainty, relatively little work has been devoted\nto \\textit{diagnosing the source of uncertainty}. In this study, we show that,\nwhen an LLM is uncertain, the patterns of disagreement among its multiple\ngenerated responses contain rich clues about the underlying cause of\nuncertainty. To illustrate this point, we collect multiple responses from a\ntarget LLM and employ an auxiliary LLM to analyze their patterns of\ndisagreement. The auxiliary model is tasked to reason about the likely source\nof uncertainty, such as whether it stems from ambiguity in the input question,\na lack of relevant knowledge, or both. In cases involving knowledge gaps, the\nauxiliary model also identifies the specific missing facts or concepts\ncontributing to the uncertainty. In our experiment, we validate our framework\non AmbigQA, OpenBookQA, and MMLU-Pro, confirming its generality in diagnosing\ndistinct uncertainty sources. Such diagnosis shows the potential for relevant\nmanual interventions that improve LLM performance and reliability."}

While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at\nfeature extraction, they often process information at a fixed scale,\npotentially overlooking the critical inter-dependencies between features at\ndifferent levels of granularity. To address this limitation, we introduce the\nScale-Interaction Transformer (SIT), a novel hybrid deep learning architecture\nthat synergizes the feature extraction power of CNNs with the relational\nmodeling capabilities of Transformers. The SIT first employs a multi-scale\nmodule with parallel convolutions to capture facial characteristics at varying\nreceptive fields. These multi-scale representations are then framed as a\nsequence and processed by a Transformer encoder, which explicitly models their\ninteractions and contextual relationships via a self-attention mechanism. We\nconduct extensive experiments on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark\ndataset, where the proposed SIT model establishes a new state-of-the-art. It\nachieves a Pearson Correlation of 0.9187, outperforming previous methods.

To address the above issues, we propose\nSparkUI-Parser, a novel end-to-end framework where higher localization\nprecision and fine-grained parsing capability of the entire interface are\nsimultaneously achieved. Specifically, instead of using probability-based\ndiscrete modeling, we perform continuous modeling of coordinates based on a\npre-trained Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with an additional token\nrouter and coordinate decoder. This effectively mitigates the limitations\ninherent in the discrete output characteristics and the token-by-token\ngeneration process of MLLMs, consequently boosting both the accuracy and the\ninference speed. To further enhance robustness, a rejection mechanism based on\na modified Hungarian matching algorithm is introduced, which empowers the model\nto identify and reject non-existent elements, thereby reducing false positives.\nMoreover, we present ScreenParse, a rigorously constructed benchmark to\nsystematically assess structural perception capabilities of GUI models across\ndiverse scenarios.

In this paper, we introduce a method for\nsample-efficient modality integration (SEMI) into Large Language Models (LLMs).\nTo this end, we devise a hypernetwork that can adapt a shared projector --\nplaced between modality-specific encoders and an LLM -- to any modality. The\nhypernetwork, trained on high-resource modalities (i.e., text, speech, audio,\nvideo), is conditioned on a few samples from any arbitrary modality at\ninference time to generate a suitable adapter. To increase the diversity of\ntraining modalities, we artificially multiply the number of encoders through\nisometric transformations. We find that SEMI achieves a significant boost in\nsample efficiency during few-shot integration of new modalities (i.e.,\nsatellite images, astronomical images, inertial measurements, and molecules)\nwith encoders of arbitrary embedding dimensionality.

However, current multi-directional scanning strategies lead to\ninefficient and redundant feature extraction when applied to complex LF data.\nTo overcome this challenge, we propose a Subspace Simple Scanning (Sub-SS)\nstrategy, based on which we design the Subspace Simple Mamba Block (SSMB) to\nachieve more efficient and precise feature extraction. Furthermore, we propose\na dual-stage modeling strategy to address the limitation of state space in\npreserving spatial-angular and disparity information, thereby enabling a more\ncomprehensive exploration of non-local spatial-angular correlations.\nSpecifically, in stage I, we introduce the Spatial-Angular Residual Subspace\nMamba Block (SA-RSMB) for shallow spatial-angular feature extraction; in stage\nII, we use a dual-branch parallel structure combining the Epipolar Plane Mamba\nBlock (EPMB) and Epipolar Plane Transformer Block (EPTB) for deep epipolar\nfeature refinement. Building upon meticulously designed modules and strategies,\nwe introduce a hybrid Mamba-Transformer framework, termed LFMT. LFMT integrates\nthe strengths of Mamba and Transformer models for LFSR, enabling comprehensive\ninformation exploration across spatial, angular, and epipolar-plane domains.\nExperimental results demonstrate that LFMT significantly outperforms current\nstate-of-the-art methods in LFSR, achieving substantial improvements in\nperformance while maintaining low computational complexity on both real-word\nand synthetic LF datasets."}

In response to\nthis challenge, we introduce L1RA, a novel technique aimed at dynamically\ndistributing the rank of low-rank adapters during fine-tuning using LoRA. Given\na rank budget (i.e., total sum of adapters rank), L1RA leverages L1\nregularisation to prune redundant ranks and redistribute them across adapters,\nthereby optimising resource utilisation. Through a series of comprehensive\nexperiments, we empirically demonstrate that L1RA maintains comparable or even\nreduced computational overhead compared to other LoRA variants, including the\nvanilla approach, while achieving same or better performances. Moreover, the\npost-training analysis of rank distribution unveiled insights into the specific\nmodel components requiring the most adaptation to align with the task\nobjective: the feed-forward layers and the attention output projection.

To overcome this limitation, we\npropose Sticker-TTS, a novel test-time scaling framework that coordinates three\ncollaborative LRMs to iteratively explore and refine solutions guided by\nhistorical attempts. At the core of our framework are distilled key\nconditions-termed stickers-which drive the extraction, refinement, and reuse of\ncritical information across multiple rounds of reasoning. To further enhance\nthe efficiency and performance of our framework, we introduce a two-stage\noptimization strategy that combines imitation learning with self-improvement,\nenabling progressive refinement. Extensive evaluations on three challenging\nmathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME-24, AIME-25, and OlymMATH,\ndemonstrate that Sticker-TTS consistently surpasses strong baselines, including\nself-consistency and advanced reinforcement learning approaches, under\ncomparable inference budgets. These results highlight the effectiveness of\nsticker-guided historical experience utilization. Our code and data are\navailable at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/Sticker-TTS."}

This paper introduces a\nmethodology for constructing Functional Concept Graphs (FCGs), interconnected\nrepresentations of functional elements that support abstraction, problem\nreframing, and analogical inspiration. Our approach yields large-scale,\nhigh-quality FCGs with explicit abstraction relations, overcoming limitations\nof prior work. We further present MUSE, an algorithm leveraging FCGs to\ngenerate creative inspirations for a given problem. We demonstrate our method\nby computing an FCG on 500K patents, which we release for further research."}
