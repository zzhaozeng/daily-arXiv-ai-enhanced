However,\nthese approaches often struggle with loose-fitting garments due to two key\nlimitations: (1) They rely on human body semantic maps to align garments with\nthe body, but these maps become unreliable when body contours are obscured by\nloose-fitting garments, resulting in degraded outcomes; (2) They train garment\nsynthesis networks on a per-frame basis without utilizing temporal information,\nleading to noticeable jittering artifacts. To address these challenges, we\npropose a two-stage approach for robust semantic map estimation. First, we\nextract a garment-invariant representation from the raw input image. This\nrepresentation is then passed through an auxiliary network to estimate the\nsemantic map. This enhances the robustness of semantic map estimation under\nloose-fitting garments during garment-specific dataset generation. Furthermore,\nwe introduce a recurrent garment synthesis framework that incorporates temporal\ndependencies to improve frame-to-frame coherence while maintaining real-time\nperformance. We conducted qualitative and quantitative evaluations to\ndemonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both image\nquality and temporal coherence. Ablation studies further validate the\neffectiveness of the garment-invariant representation and the recurrent\nsynthesis framework."}

However, realistic Hand-Object Interaction (HOI) - the complex\ndynamics between human hands and objects - continues to pose challenges.\nGenerating natural and believable HOI reenactments is difficult due to issues\nsuch as occlusion between hands and objects, variations in object shapes and\norientations, and the necessity for precise physical interactions, and\nimportantly, the ability to generalize to unseen humans and objects. This paper\npresents a novel framework iDiT-HOI that enables in-the-wild HOI reenactment\ngeneration. Specifically, we propose a unified inpainting-based token process\nmethod, called Inp-TPU, with a two-stage video diffusion transformer (DiT)\nmodel. The first stage generates a key frame by inserting the designated object\ninto the hand region, providing a reference for subsequent frames. The second\nstage ensures temporal coherence and fluidity in hand-object interactions.

A key challenge is effectively leveraging all previous text-image\npairs, referred to as history text-image pairs, which provide contextual\ninformation for maintaining consistency across frames. Existing auto-regressive\nmethods condition on all past image-text pairs but require extensive training,\nwhile training-free subject-specific approaches ensure consistency but lack\nadaptability to narrative prompts. To address these limitations, we propose a\nmulti-modal history adapter for text-to-image diffusion models, \\textbf{ViSTA}.\nIt consists of (1) a multi-modal history fusion module to extract relevant\nhistory features and (2) a history adapter to condition the generation on the\nextracted relevant features.

Such scenarios can be handled by assessing the reliability and the\npolitical bias of the source of the claim, i.e., characterizing entire news\noutlets rather than individual claims or articles. This is an important but\nunderstudied research direction. While prior work has looked into linguistic\nand social contexts, we do not analyze individual articles or information in\nsocial media. Instead, we propose a novel methodology that emulates the\ncriteria that professional fact-checkers use to assess the factuality and\npolitical bias of an entire outlet. Specifically, we design a variety of\nprompts based on these criteria and elicit responses from large language models\n(LLMs), which we aggregate to make predictions. In addition to demonstrating\nsizable improvements over strong baselines via extensive experiments with\nmultiple LLMs, we provide an in-depth error analysis of the effect of media\npopularity and region on model performance.

Through systematic analysis, we identify three key pathological\nattention behaviors in LVLMs: (1) weak visual grounding, where attention to\nvisual tokens is insufficient or misallocated, over-focusing on uninformative\nregions; (2) language prior dominance, where excessive attention to prior\nresponse tokens reinforces autoregressive patterns and impairs multimodal\nalignment; (3) prompt redundancy, where many attention heads fixate on system\nprompt tokens, disrupting the integration of image, instruction, and response\ncontent. To address these issues, we introduce two inference-time\ninterventions: token-level attention intervention (TAI), which enhances focus\non salient visual content, and head-level attention intervention (HAI), which\nsuppresses over-attention to prompt and nearby text tokens. VisFlow operates\nwithout additional training or model modifications. Extensive experiments\nacross models and benchmarks show that VisFlow effectively reduces\nhallucinations and improves visual factuality, with negligible computational\ncost."}

However, it still faces some problems, such as\nthe lack of prior knowledge, which seriously affects detection accuracy. In\norder to solve this problem, we propose a scene-aware SAR ship detection method\nbased on unsupervised sea-land segmentation. This method follows a classical\ntwo-stage framework and is enhanced by two models: the unsupervised land and\nsea segmentation module (ULSM) and the land attention suppression module\n(LASM). ULSM and LASM can adaptively guide the network to reduce attention on\nland according to the type of scenes (inshore scene and offshore scene) and add\nprior knowledge (sea land segmentation information) to the network, thereby\nreducing the network's attention to land directly and enhancing offshore\ndetection performance relatively. This increases the accuracy of ship detection\nand enhances the interpretability of the model. Specifically, in consideration\nof the lack of land sea segmentation labels in existing deep learning-based SAR\nship detection datasets, ULSM uses an unsupervised approach to classify the\ninput data scene into inshore and offshore types and performs sea-land\nsegmentation for inshore scenes. LASM uses the sea-land segmentation\ninformation as prior knowledge to reduce the network's attention to land. We\nconducted our experiments using the publicly available SSDD dataset, which\ndemonstrated the effectiveness of our network."}

Our dataset yields high-variability synthetic\nsequences with rich body contact and occlusion, and includes SMPL-X\nground-truth annotations with dense 2D landmarks. The result is a system\ncapable of capturing human motion without the need for markers. Our approach\noffers competitive reconstruction quality compared to commercial marker-based\nmotion-capture solutions, without the extensive manual cleanup. Finally, we\naddress the absence of common benchmarks for dense-landmark prediction and\nmarkerless motion capture by introducing two evaluation settings built from\nreal multi-view sequences. We will release our dataset, benchmark, method,\ntraining code, and pre-trained model weights for research purposes."}

This work\naims to address these challenges by proposing a novel multi-view X-ray/CT\nregistration method for intraoperative bone registration. Methods: The proposed\nregistration method consists of a multi-view, contour-based iterative closest\npoint (ICP) optimization. Unlike previous methods, which attempt to match bone\ncontours across the entire silhouette in both imaging modalities, we focus on\nmatching specific subcategories of contours corresponding to bone\nsubstructures.

To\nachieve scalability, we further propose a large-scale scene promotion strategy,\nwhich optimally assigns camera views to scene partitions by maximizing their\ncontributions to Gaussian points, achieving consistent and high-quality\nreconstructions even in expansive environments. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that SMW-GS significantly outperforms existing methods in both\nreconstruction quality and scalability, particularly excelling in large-scale\nurban environments with challenging illumination variations.

Using image triplets\n($I_1,I_2,I_3$), Test3R generates reconstructions from pairs ($I_1,I_2$) and\n($I_1,I_3$). The core idea is to optimize the network at test time via a\nself-supervised objective: maximizing the geometric consistency between these\ntwo reconstructions relative to the common image $I_1$. This ensures the model\nproduces cross-pair consistent outputs, regardless of the inputs. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our technique significantly outperforms previous\nstate-of-the-art methods on the 3D reconstruction and multi-view depth\nestimation tasks. Moreover, it is universally applicable and nearly cost-free,\nmaking it easily applied to other models and implemented with minimal test-time\ntraining overhead and parameter footprint.

In this paper, we propose AutoVLA, a novel VLA model that unifies\nreasoning and action generation within a single autoregressive generation model\nfor end-to-end autonomous driving. AutoVLA performs semantic reasoning and\ntrajectory planning directly from raw visual inputs and language instructions.\nWe tokenize continuous trajectories into discrete, feasible actions, enabling\ndirect integration into the language model. For training, we employ supervised\nfine-tuning to equip the model with dual thinking modes: fast thinking\n(trajectory-only) and slow thinking (enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning).\nTo further enhance planning performance and efficiency, we introduce a\nreinforcement fine-tuning method based on Group Relative Policy Optimization\n(GRPO), reducing unnecessary reasoning in straightforward scenarios. Extensive\nexperiments across real-world and simulated datasets and benchmarks, including\nnuPlan, nuScenes, Waymo, and CARLA, demonstrate the competitive performance of\nAutoVLA in both open-loop and closed-loop settings.

Recent feed-forward approaches enable efficient\nsingle-image reconstruction but struggle to effectively leverage multiple input\nimages to reduce ambiguity and improve reconstruction accuracy.

However,\nthese approaches often struggle with loose-fitting garments due to two key\nlimitations: (1) They rely on human body semantic maps to align garments with\nthe body, but these maps become unreliable when body contours are obscured by\nloose-fitting garments, resulting in degraded outcomes; (2) They train garment\nsynthesis networks on a per-frame basis without utilizing temporal information,\nleading to noticeable jittering artifacts. To address these challenges, we\npropose a two-stage approach for robust semantic map estimation. First, we\nextract a garment-invariant representation from the raw input image. This\nrepresentation is then passed through an auxiliary network to estimate the\nsemantic map. This enhances the robustness of semantic map estimation under\nloose-fitting garments during garment-specific dataset generation. Furthermore,\nwe introduce a recurrent garment synthesis framework that incorporates temporal\ndependencies to improve frame-to-frame coherence while maintaining real-time\nperformance. We conducted qualitative and quantitative evaluations to\ndemonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both image\nquality and temporal coherence.

However, realistic Hand-Object Interaction (HOI) - the complex\ndynamics between human hands and objects - continues to pose challenges.\nGenerating natural and believable HOI reenactments is difficult due to issues\nsuch as occlusion between hands and objects, variations in object shapes and\norientations, and the necessity for precise physical interactions, and\nimportantly, the ability to generalize to unseen humans and objects. This paper\npresents a novel framework iDiT-HOI that enables in-the-wild HOI reenactment\ngeneration. Specifically, we propose a unified inpainting-based token process\nmethod, called Inp-TPU, with a two-stage video diffusion transformer (DiT)\nmodel. The first stage generates a key frame by inserting the designated object\ninto the hand region, providing a reference for subsequent frames. The second\nstage ensures temporal coherence and fluidity in hand-object interactions. The\nkey contribution of our method is to reuse the pretrained model's context\nperception capabilities without introducing additional parameters, enabling\nstrong generalization to unseen objects and scenarios, and our proposed\nparadigm naturally supports long video generation.

However, directly modeling the shape of a neural implicit surface,\nespecially as the zero-level set of a neural signed distance function (SDF),\nwith sparse geometric control is still a challenging task. Sparse input shape\ncontrol typically includes 3D curve networks or, more generally, 3D curve\nsketches, which are unstructured and cannot be connected to form a curve\nnetwork, and therefore more difficult to deal with. While 3D curve networks or\ncurve sketches provide intuitive shape control, their sparsity and varied\ntopology pose challenges in generating high-quality surfaces to meet such curve\nconstraints. In this paper, we propose NeuVAS, a variational approach to shape\nmodeling using neural implicit surfaces constrained under sparse input shape\ncontrol, including unstructured 3D curve sketches as well as connected 3D curve\nnetworks. Specifically, we introduce a smoothness term based on a functional of\nsurface curvatures to minimize shape variation of the zero-level set surface of\na neural SDF.
