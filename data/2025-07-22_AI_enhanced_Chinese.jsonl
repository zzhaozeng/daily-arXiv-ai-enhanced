To address these challenges, we\nintroduce DeepWriter, a customizable, multimodal, long-form writing assistant\nthat operates on a curated, offline knowledge base. DeepWriter leverages a\nnovel pipeline that involves task decomposition, outline generation, multimodal\nretrieval, and section-by-section composition with reflection. By deeply mining\ninformation from a structured corpus and incorporating both textual and visual\nelements, DeepWriter generates coherent, factually grounded, and\nprofessional-grade documents.

Submitted as an arXiv preprint. All code and\n  experiment details included in appendix", "summary": "Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) research traditionally focuses on\nalgorithms that optimize for specific goals under deterministic rules. Yet,\nhuman-like intelligence exhibits adaptive spontaneity - an ability to make\nunexpected choices or free decisions not strictly dictated by past data or\nimmediate reward. This trait, often dubbed \"free will\" in a loose sense, might\nbe crucial for creativity, robust adaptation, and avoiding ruts in\nproblem-solving. This paper proposes a theoretical framework, called the Free\nWill Equation, that draws analogies from quantum field theory to endow AGI\nagents with a form of adaptive, controlled stochasticity in their\ndecision-making process. The core idea is to treat an AI agent's cognitive\nstate as a superposition of potential actions or thoughts, which collapses\nprobabilistically into a concrete action when a decision is made - much like a\nquantum wavefunction collapsing upon measurement.

In this way, our method avoids\nexplicitly relying on scene geometry, significantly reducing the computational\ncost of maintaining large 3D data.

Probe data hold highly accurate depth\ninformation of dense data points, enabling the reconstruction of highly complex\nscenes. By reconstructing the scene using probe data, the rendering cost is\nindependent of the complexity of the scene. As such, our approach combines\ngeometry reconstruction and novel view synthesis.

To\novercome these limitations, we propose a novel three-stage framework for 3D\nscene generation with explicit geometric representations and high-quality\ntextural details via single image-guided model generation and spatial layout\noptimization. Our method begins with an image instance segmentation and\ninpainting phase, which recovers missing details of occluded objects in the\ninput images, thereby achieving complete generation of foreground 3D assets.\nSubsequently, our approach captures the spatial geometry of reference image by\nconstructing pseudo-stereo viewpoint for camera parameter estimation and scene\ndepth inference, while employing a model selection strategy to ensure optimal\nalignment between the 3D assets generated in the previous step and the input.\nFinally, through model parameterization and minimization of the Chamfer\ndistance between point clouds in 3D and 2D space, our approach optimizes layout\nparameters to produce an explicit 3D scene representation that maintains\nprecise alignment with input guidance image.

As a result, platforms that host models and\ndatasets are widely used. For example, Hugging Face, one of the most popular\nplatforms, hosted 1.8 million models and 450K datasets by June 2025, with no\nsign of slowing down. Since many LLMs are built from base models, pre-trained\nmodels, and external datasets, they can inherit vulnerabilities, biases, or\nmalicious components from earlier models or datasets. Therefore, it is critical\nto understand the origin and development of these components to better detect\npotential risks, improve model fairness, and ensure compliance. Motivated by\nthis, our project aims to study the relationships between models and datasets,\nwhich are core components of the LLM supply chain.

Our coordinate\nblending algorithm seamlessly blends the original shape with its edited\nversion, enabling a fine-grained editing of 3D shapes, all while circumventing\nthe need for computationally expensive and often inaccurate inversion.\nExtensive experiments show that our method outperforms alternative techniques\nacross a wide range of metrics that evaluate both fidelity to the original\nshape and also adherence to the textual description.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc73D\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5750\u6807\u6df7\u5408\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b03D\u70b9\u4e91\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5f62\u72b6\u8eab\u4efd\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4e3a3D\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7f16\u8f91\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u76f4\u89c2\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u4fee\u6539\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u54083D\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u6761\u4ef6\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5750\u6807\u6df7\u5408\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u4fee\u590d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u76843D\u5f62\u72b6\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u53cd\u8f6c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

The\napplication to inverse rendering still faces several challenges, as the\ndiscrete nature of Gaussian primitives makes it difficult to apply geometry\nconstraints. Recent works introduce the signed distance field (SDF) as an extra\ncontinuous representation to regularize the geometry defined by Gaussian\nprimitives. It improves the decomposition quality, at the cost of increasing\nmemory usage and complicating training. Unlike these works, we introduce a\ndiscretized SDF to represent the continuous SDF in a discrete manner by\nencoding it within each Gaussian using a sampled value. This approach allows us\nto link the SDF with the Gaussian opacity through an SDF-to-opacity\ntransformation, enabling rendering the SDF via splatting and avoiding the\ncomputational cost of ray marching.The key challenge is to regularize the\ndiscrete samples to be consistent with the underlying SDF, as the discrete\nrepresentation can hardly apply the gradient-based constraints (\\eg Eikonal\nloss). For this, we project Gaussians onto the zero-level set of SDF and\nenforce alignment with the surface from splatting, namely a projection-based\nconsistency loss. Thanks to the discretized SDF, our method achieves higher\nrelighting quality, while requiring no extra memory beyond GS and avoiding\ncomplex manually designed optimization.

However, adopting AI models in risk-sensitive\ndomains often requires error rates near 0%. To address this gap, we propose\ncollaboration between a reasoning model and a human expert who resolves queries\nthe model cannot confidently answer. We find that quantifying the uncertainty\nof a reasoning model through the length of its reasoning trace yields an\neffective basis for deferral to a human, e.g., cutting the error rate of Qwen3\n235B-A22B on difficult MATH problems from 3% to less than 1% when deferring\n7.5% of queries. However, the high latency of reasoning models still makes them\nchallenging to deploy on use cases with high query volume. To address this\nchallenge, we explore fronting a reasoning model with a large non-reasoning\nmodel. We call this modified human-in-the-loop system \"Fail Fast, or Ask\",\nsince the non-reasoning model may defer difficult queries to the human expert\ndirectly (\"failing fast\"), without incurring the reasoning model's higher\nlatency. We show that this approach yields around 40% latency reduction and\nabout 50% cost savings for DeepSeek R1 while maintaining 90+% area under the\naccuracy-rejection curve. However, we observe that latency savings are lower\nthan expected because of \"latency drag\", the phenomenon that processing easier\nqueries with a non-reasoning model pushes the reasoning model's latency\ndistribution towards longer latencies.

In DFQ, the quantization model must be\ncalibrated using synthetic samples, making the quality of these synthetic\nsamples crucial. Existing methods fail to fully capture and balance the global\nand local features within the samples, resulting in limited synthetic data\nquality. Moreover, we have found that during inference, there is a significant\ndifference in the distributions of intermediate layer activations between the\nquantized and full-precision models. These issues lead to a severe performance\ndegradation of the quantized model. To address these problems, we propose a\npipeline for Data-Free Quantization for Vision Transformers (DFQ-ViT).\nSpecifically, we synthesize samples in order of increasing difficulty,\neffectively enhancing the quality of synthetic data. During the calibration and\ninference stage, we introduce the activation correction matrix for the\nquantized model to align the intermediate layer activations with those of the\nfull-precision model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DFQ-ViT achieves\nremarkable superiority over existing DFQ methods and its performance is on par\nwith models quantized through real data. For example, the performance of DeiT-T\nwith 3-bit weights quantization is 4.29% higher than the state-of-the-art. Our\nmethod eliminates the need for fine-tuning, which not only reduces\ncomputational overhead but also lowers the deployment barriers for edge\ndevices.

Recent studies have explored the use of Bidirectional Encoder\nRepresentations from Transformers (BERT) models on transcription data to\nreliably detect meaningful CPS indicators. A notable advancement involved the\nmultimodal BERT variant, AudiBERT, which integrates speech and\nacoustic-prosodic audio features to enhance CPS diagnosis. Although initial\nresults demonstrated multimodal improvements, the statistical significance of\nthese enhancements remained unclear, and there was insufficient guidance on\nleveraging human-AI complementarity for CPS diagnosis tasks. This workshop\npaper extends the previous research by highlighting that the AudiBERT model not\nonly improved the classification of classes that were sparse in the dataset,\nbut it also had statistically significant class-wise improvements over the BERT\nmodel for classifications in the social-cognitive dimension. However, similar\nsignificant class-wise improvements over the BERT model were not observed for\nclassifications in the affective dimension. A correlation analysis highlighted\nthat larger training data was significantly associated with higher recall\nperformance for both the AudiBERT and BERT models.

Traditionally, developers estimate story points\ncollaboratively using planning poker or other manual techniques. While the\ninitial calibrating of the estimates to each project is helpful, once a team\nhas converged on a set of precedents, story point estimation can become tedious\nand labor-intensive. Machine learning can reduce this burden, but only with\nenough context from the historical decisions made by the project team.

The\ngoal of this work is to streamline story point estimation by evaluating a\ncomparative learning-based framework for calibrating project-specific story\npoint prediction models. Instead of assigning a specific story point value to\nevery backlog item, developers are presented with pairs of items, and indicate\nwhich item requires more effort. Using these comparative judgments, a machine\nlearning model is trained to predict the story point estimates. We empirically\nevaluated our technique using data with 23,313 manual estimates in 16 projects.\nThe model learned from comparative judgments can achieve on average 0.34\nSpearman's rank correlation coefficient between its predictions and the ground\ntruth story points.

With the rise of\nautonomous AI systems, there is growing concern that AI-driven groups could\nalso cause similar harm. While most AI safety research focuses on individual AI\nsystems, the risks posed by multi-agent systems (MAS) in complex real-world\nsituations are still underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a\nproof-of-concept to simulate the risks of malicious MAS collusion, using a\nflexible framework that supports both centralized and decentralized\ncoordination structures. We apply this framework to two high-risk fields:\nmisinformation spread and e-commerce fraud. Our findings show that\ndecentralized systems are more effective at carrying out malicious actions than\ncentralized ones. The increased autonomy of decentralized systems allows them\nto adapt their strategies and cause more damage. Even when traditional\ninterventions, like content flagging, are applied, decentralized groups can\nadjust their tactics to avoid detection.

To address\nthese shortcomings, this paper proposes InsightX Agent, a novel LMM-based\nagentic framework designed to deliver reliable, interpretable, and interactive\nX-ray NDT analysis.

The SDMSD generates dense defect\nregion proposals for multi-scale feature maps and sparsifies them through\nNon-Maximum Suppression (NMS), optimizing detection of small, dense targets in\nX-ray images while maintaining computational efficiency. The EGR tool guides\nthe LMM agent through a chain-of-thought-inspired review process, incorporating\ncontext assessment, individual defect analysis, false positive elimination,\nconfidence recalibration and quality assurance to validate and refine the\nSDMSD's initial proposals. By strategically employing and intelligently using\ntools, InsightX Agent moves beyond passive data processing to active reasoning,\nenhancing diagnostic reliability and providing interpretations that integrate\ndiverse information sources.

Among these domains, mathematical reasoning serves as a representative\nbenchmark as it requires precise multi-step logic and abstract reasoning, which\ncan be generalized to other tasks. While closed-source RLMs such as GPT-o3\ndemonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities, their proprietary nature limits\ntransparency and reproducibility. Although many open-source projects aim to\nclose this gap, most of them lack sufficient openness by omitting critical\nresources such as datasets and detailed training configurations, which hinders\nreproducibility. To contribute toward greater transparency in RLM development,\nwe introduce the MiroMind-M1 series, a set of fully open-source RLMs built on\nthe Qwen-2.5 backbone that match or exceed the performance of existing\nopen-source RLMs. Specifically, our models are trained in two stages: SFT on a\ncarefully curated corpus of 719K math-reasoning problems with verified CoT\ntrajectories, followed by RLVR on 62K challenging and verifiable problems. To\nenhance the robustness and efficiency of the RLVR process, we introduce\nContext-Aware Multi-Stage Policy Optimization, an algorithm that integrates\nlength-progressive training with an adaptive repetition penalty to encourage\ncontext-aware RL training. Our model achieves state-of-the-art or competitive\nperformance and superior token efficiency among Qwen-2.5-based open-source 7B\nand 32B models on the AIME24, AIME25, and MATH benchmarks.

Most available datasets are in English, but\neven among these, high-quality, human-annotated data remains scarce. As a\nresult, many studies rely on available pre-labeled datasets without examining\ntheir annotation process or label reliability. The lack of datasets in other\nlanguages further limits the global realization of suicide prevention via\nartificial intelligence (AI). In this study, we address one of these gaps by\nconstructing a novel Turkish suicidal ideation corpus derived from social media\nposts and introducing a resource-efficient annotation framework involving three\nhuman annotators and two large language models (LLMs). We then address the\nremaining gaps by performing a bidirectional evaluation of label reliability\nand model consistency across this dataset and three popular English suicidal\nideation detection datasets, using transfer learning through eight pre-trained\nsentiment and emotion classifiers.

These\nrelational cues are incorporated into the model through a dual-level\nintegration: embedding fusion and prompt-level injection. This allows for\nunified reasoning across various tasks such as grounding, captioning, and\nquestion answering, all without the need for task-specific heads or additional\nsupervision.

This surge\npresents a significant challenge in efficiently choosing the most suitable\npre-trained models for downstream tasks. The critical aspect of this challenge\nlies in effectively predicting the model transferability by considering the\nunderlying fine-tuning dynamics. Existing methods often model fine-tuning\ndynamics in feature space with linear transformations, which do not precisely\nalign with the fine-tuning objective and fail to grasp the essential\nnonlinearity from optimization. To this end, we present LEAD, a\nfinetuning-aligned approach based on the network output of logits. LEAD\nproposes a theoretical framework to model the optimization process and derives\nan ordinary differential equation (ODE) to depict the nonlinear evolution\ntoward the final logit state.

CAIS quantifies an action's\ninfluence by measuring the 1-Wasserstein distance between the learned\ndistribution of sensory outcomes conditional on that action, $p(h|a)$, and the\nbaseline outcome distribution, $p(h)$. This divergence provides a robust reward\nthat isolates the agent's causal impact from confounding environmental noise.\nWe test our approach in a simulated infant-mobile environment where\ncorrelation-based perceptual rewards fail completely when the mobile is\nsubjected to external forces.

Addressing these\nissues, a novel Multispectral State-Space Feature Fusion framework, dubbed\nMS2Fusion, is proposed based on the state space model (SSM), achieving\nefficient and effective fusion through a dual-path parametric interaction\nmechanism. More specifically, the first cross-parameter interaction branch\ninherits the advantage of cross-attention in mining complementary information\nwith cross-modal hidden state decoding in SSM. The second shared-parameter\nbranch explores cross-modal alignment with joint embedding to obtain\ncross-modal similar semantic features and structures through parameter sharing\nin SSM. Finally, these two paths are jointly optimized with SSM for fusing\nmultispectral features in a unified framework, allowing our MS2Fusion to enjoy\nboth functional complementarity and shared semantic space. In our extensive\nexperiments on mainstream benchmarks including FLIR, M3FD and LLVIP, our\nMS2Fusion significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art multispectral object\ndetection methods, evidencing its superiority.

This study\npresents a cost-effective computer vision framework that estimates plate-level\nfood waste by utilizing semantic segmentation of RGB images taken before and\nafter meal consumption across five Iranian dishes. Four fully supervised models\n(U-Net, U-Net++, and their lightweight variants) were trained using a capped\ndynamic inverse-frequency loss and AdamW optimizer, then evaluated through a\ncomprehensive set of metrics, including Pixel Accuracy, Dice, IoU, and a\ncustom-defined Distributional Pixel Agreement (DPA) metric tailored to the\ntask. All models achieved satisfying performance, and for each food type, at\nleast one model approached or surpassed 90% DPA, demonstrating strong alignment\nin pixel-wise proportion estimates. Lighter models with reduced parameter\ncounts offered faster inference, achieving real-time throughput on an NVIDIA T4\nGPU.

Batching allows managers to trade off cost and\nprocessing effort against waiting time. Larger and less frequent batches may\nlower costs by reducing processing effort and amortizing fixed costs, but they\ncreate longer waiting times. In contrast, smaller and more frequent batches\nreduce waiting times but increase fixed costs and processing effort. A batching\npolicy defines how activity instances are grouped into batches and when each\nbatch is activated. This paper addresses the problem of discovering batching\npolicies that strike optimal trade-offs between waiting time, processing\neffort, and cost. The paper proposes a Pareto optimization approach that starts\nfrom a given set (possibly empty) of activity batching policies and generates\nalternative policies for each batched activity via intervention heuristics.\nEach heuristic identifies an opportunity to improve an activity's batching\npolicy with respect to a metric (waiting time, processing time, cost, or\nresource utilization) and an associated adjustment to the activity's batching\npolicy (the intervention). The impact of each intervention is evaluated via\nsimulation. The intervention heuristics are embedded in an optimization\nmeta-heuristic that triggers interventions to iteratively update the Pareto\nfront of the interventions identified so far. The paper considers three\nmeta-heuristics: hill-climbing, simulated annealing, and reinforcement\nlearning.

Previous R1-Style methods mainly focus on mathematical reasoning\nand code intelligence. It is of great research significance to verify their\nadvantages on more general multimodal data. Chart is an important multimodal\ndata type with rich information, which brings important research challenges in\ncomplex reasoning. In this work, we introduce Chart-R1, a chart-domain\nvision-language model with reinforcement learning fine-tuning to enable complex\nchart reasoning. To support Chart-R1, we first propose a novel programmatic\ndata synthesis technology to generate high-quality step-by-step chart reasoning\ndata covering single- and multi-subcharts, which makes up for the lack of\nreasoning data in the chart domain. Then we develop a two-stage training\nstrategy: Chart-COT with step-by-step chain-of-thought supervision, and\nChart-RFT with numerically sensitive reinforcement fine-tuning. Chart-COT aims\nto decompose complex chart reasoning tasks into fine-grained, understandable\nsubtasks through step-by-step supervision, which lays a good foundation for\nimproving the reasoning level of reinforcement learning.

However, interpreting Vision Transformers (ViTs) in\nthis setting remains largely unexplored due to two key challenges: (1) existing\nsaliency methods struggle to capture meaningful spectral cues, often collapsing\nattention onto the class token, and (2) full-spectrum ViTs are computationally\nprohibitive for interpretability, given the high-dimensional nature of HSI\ndata. We present FOCUS, the first framework that enables reliable and efficient\nspatial-spectral interpretability for frozen ViTs. FOCUS introduces two core\ncomponents: class-specific spectral prompts that guide attention toward\nsemantically meaningful wavelength groups, and a learnable [SINK] token trained\nwith an attraction loss to absorb noisy or redundant attention. Together, these\ndesigns make it possible to generate stable and interpretable 3D saliency maps\nand spectral importance curves in a single forward pass, without any gradient\nbackpropagation or backbone modification. FOCUS improves band-level IoU by 15\npercent, reduces attention collapse by over 40 percent, and produces saliency\nresults that align closely with expert annotations.

The\nresults show performance gains across different model scales, validating the\ndataset's effectiveness and applicability.", "AI": {"tldr": "ChiMed 2.0\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u4e2d\u6587\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4e4b\u524d\u7684ChiMed\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548cRLHF\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u6587\u533b\u7597LLM\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e2d\u6587\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u89c4\u6a21\u5c0f\u3001\u9886\u57df\u8986\u76d6\u7a84\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e14\u5927\u591a\u4e0d\u652f\u6301RLHF\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faChiMed 2.0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001SFT\u548cRLHF\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u901a\u7528LLM\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ChiMed 2.0\u4e3a\u4e2d\u6587\u533b\u7597LLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u8d44\u6e90\u3002"}}

However, real-world assurance of patient safety means that\nproviding individual diagnoses and treatment plans is considered a regulated\nactivity by licensed professionals. Furthermore, physicians commonly oversee\nother team members in such activities, including nurse practitioners (NPs) or\nphysician assistants/associates (PAs). Inspired by this, we propose a framework\nfor effective, asynchronous oversight of the Articulate Medical Intelligence\nExplorer (AMIE) AI system. We propose guardrailed-AMIE (g-AMIE), a multi-agent\nsystem that performs history taking within guardrails, abstaining from\nindividualized medical advice. Afterwards, g-AMIE conveys assessments to an\noverseeing primary care physician (PCP) in a clinician cockpit interface. The\nPCP provides oversight and retains accountability of the clinical decision.\nThis effectively decouples oversight from intake and can thus happen\nasynchronously. In a randomized, blinded virtual Objective Structured Clinical\nExamination (OSCE) of text consultations with asynchronous oversight, we\ncompared g-AMIE to NPs/PAs or a group of PCPs under the same guardrails. Across\n60 scenarios, g-AMIE outperformed both groups in performing high-quality\nintake, summarizing cases, and proposing diagnoses and management plans for the\noverseeing PCP to review. This resulted in higher quality composite decisions.\nPCP oversight of g-AMIE was also more time-efficient than standalone PCP\nconsultations in prior work.

This paper proposes a novel,\nefficient, and lightweight approach for robot action prediction, offering\nsignificantly reduced computational cost and inference latency compared to\nconventional video prediction models. Importantly, it pioneers the adaptation\nof the InstructPix2Pix model for forecasting future visual frames in robotic\ntasks, extending its utility beyond static image editing. We implement a deep\nlearning-based visual prediction framework that forecasts what a robot will\nobserve 100 frames (10 seconds) into the future, given a current image and a\ntextual instruction. We repurpose and fine-tune the InstructPix2Pix model to\naccept both visual and textual inputs, enabling multimodal future frame\nprediction.

The intricate interactions among\nintelligent agents make abnormal emergence analysis challenging, as traditional\ncausal methods focus on individual trajectories.

Although downstream tasks of\ninterest typically do not provide systems with explicit options among which to\nchoose, this approach is nevertheless widely used because it makes it makes\nautomatic grading straightforward and has tended to produce challenging\nbenchmarks that correlate sufficiently well with downstream performance. This\npaper investigates the extent to which this trend continues to hold for\nstate-of-the-art reasoning models, describing a systematic evaluation of $15$\ndifferent question-answering benchmarks (e.g., MMLU, HLE) and $25$ different\nLLMs (including small models such as Qwen 7B and relatively large models such\nas Llama 70B). For each model-benchmark pair, we considered $5$ ways of\npresenting the model with questions, including variations on whether multiple\nchoices were offered to the model at all; whether \"none of the above\" sometimes\nreplaced the right answer; and whether the model was permitted to perform\nchain-of-thought reasoning before and/or after the choices were presented. MCQA\nremained a good proxy for the downstream performance of models as long as they\nwere allowed to perform chain-of-thought reasoning only before being presented\nwith the options among which they had to select. On the other hand, large\nmodels that were able to perform reasoning after being given a set of options\ntended to significantly outperform their free-text performance due to\nexploiting the information in the options.

As a result, there\nis a lack of annotated data for model training. Diffusion models are commonly\nused for data augmentation, but the existing methods face two challenges.\nFirst, due to the high concealment of lesions, it is difficult for the model to\nlearn the features of the lesion area.

Second,\nexisting methods can only generate images and cannot generate corresponding\nannotations, which restricts the usability of the generated images in\nsupervised training.

Project page: https://d223302.github.io/STITCH/", "summary": "Spoken Language Models (SLMs) are designed to take speech inputs and produce\nspoken responses. However, current SLMs lack the ability to perform an\ninternal, unspoken thinking process before responding. In contrast, humans\ntypically engage in complex mental reasoning internally, enabling them to\ncommunicate ideas clearly and concisely. Thus, integrating an unspoken thought\nprocess into SLMs is highly desirable. While naively generating a complete\nchain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before starting to talk can enable thinking\nfor SLMs, this induces additional latency for the speech response, as the CoT\nreasoning can be arbitrarily long. To solve this issue, we propose Stitch, a\nnovel generation method that alternates between the generation of unspoken\nreasoning chunks and spoken response chunks. Since the audio duration of a\nchunk of spoken response is much longer than the time to generate the tokens in\na chunk of spoken response, we use the remaining free time to generate the\nunspoken reasoning tokens. When a chunk of audio is played to the user, the\nmodel continues to generate the next unspoken reasoning chunk, achieving\nsimultaneous thinking and talking. Remarkably, Stitch matches the latency of\nbaselines that cannot generate unspoken CoT by design while outperforming those\nbaselines by 15% on math reasoning datasets; Stitch also performs equally well\non non-reasoning datasets as those baseline models.

Conventional detectors rely on deterministic\nbounding box regression, ignoring uncertainty in predictions and limiting model\nrobustness. In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-aware enhancement\nframework for DETR-based object detectors. We model bounding boxes as\nmultivariate Gaussian distributions and incorporate the Gromov-Wasserstein\ndistance into the loss function to better align the predicted and ground-truth\ndistributions. Building on this, we derive a Bayes Risk formulation to filter\nhigh-risk information and improve detection reliability. We also propose a\nsimple algorithm to quantify localization uncertainty via confidence intervals.\nExperiments on the COCO benchmark show that our method can be effectively\nintegrated into existing DETR variants, enhancing their performance.

These models generate impressive depth predictions; however, their\noutputs are often in relative scale rather than metric scale. This limitation\nposes challenges for direct deployment in real-world applications. To address\nthis, several scale adaptation methods have been proposed to enable foundation\nmodels to produce metric depth. However, these methods are typically costly, as\nthey require additional training on new domains and datasets. Moreover,\nfine-tuning these models often compromises their original generalization\ncapabilities, limiting their adaptability across diverse scenes. In this paper,\nwe introduce a non-learning-based approach that leverages sparse depth\nmeasurements to adapt the relative-scale predictions of foundation models into\nmetric-scale depth. Our method requires neither retraining nor fine-tuning,\nthereby preserving the strong generalization ability of the original foundation\nmodels while enabling them to produce metric depth. Experimental results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, high-lighting its potential to\nbridge the gap between relative and metric depth without incurring additional\ncomputational costs or sacrificing generalization ability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u6df1\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u5c06\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6df1\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5ea6\u91cf\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u989d\u5916\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8f93\u51fa\u901a\u5e38\u4e3a\u76f8\u5bf9\u5c3a\u5ea6\u800c\u975e\u5ea6\u91cf\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u635f\u5bb3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u975e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u6df1\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u5c06\u76f8\u5bf9\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6df1\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5ea6\u91cf\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5ea6\u91cf\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6df1\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u76f8\u5bf9\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5ea6\u91cf\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u6216\u727a\u7272\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Existing 3D visual grounding methods typically rely on\nseparate encoders for different modalities (e.g., RGB images, text, and 3D\npoint clouds), resulting in large and complex models that are inefficient to\ntrain. While some approaches use pre-trained 2D multi-modal models like CLIP\nfor 3D tasks, they still struggle with aligning point cloud data to 2D\nencoders. As a result, these methods continue to depend on 3D encoders for\nfeature extraction, further increasing model complexity and training\ninefficiency. In this paper, we propose a unified 2D pre-trained multi-modal\nnetwork to process all three modalities (RGB images, text, and point clouds),\nsignificantly simplifying the architecture.

In this work, we show how the analysis of conflicting\nnarratives, i.e. conflicting interpretive lenses through which political\nreality is experienced and told, provides insight into the discursive\nmechanisms of polarization and issue alignment in the public sphere. Building\nupon previous work that has identified ideologically polarized issues in the\nGerman Twittersphere between 2021 and 2023, we analyze the discursive dimension\nof polarization by extracting textual signals of conflicting narratives from\ntweets of opposing opinion groups.

We present an approach for pose estimation in cryo-EM that\nleverages multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) techniques in a robust manner to\nestimate the 3D rotation matrix of each particle from pairs of dihedral angles.\nWe express the rotation matrix in the form of an axis of rotation and a unit\nvector in the plane perpendicular to the axis. The technique leverages the\nconcept of common lines in 3D reconstruction from projections. However, common\nline estimation is ridden with large errors due to the very low SNR of cryo-EM\nprojection images. To address this challenge, we introduce two complementary\ncomponents: (i) a robust joint optimization framework for pose estimation based\non an $\\ell_1$-norm objective or a similar robust norm, which simultaneously\nestimates rotation axes and in-plane vectors while exactly enforcing unit norm\nand orthogonality constraints via projected coordinate descent; and (ii) an\niterative shift correction algorithm that estimates consistent in-plane\ntranslations through a global least-squares formulation. While prior approaches\nhave leveraged such embeddings and common-line geometry for orientation\nrecovery, existing formulations typically rely on $\\ell_2$-based objectives\nthat are sensitive to noise, and enforce geometric constraints only\napproximately.

Although prompt learning methods have shown promise, they suffer\nfrom two fundamental bottlenecks that limit generalization: (a) modality\nisolation, and (b) hierarchical semantic decay. To address these limitations,\nwe propose HiCroPL, a Hierarchical Cross-modal Prompt Learning framework that\nestablishes bidirectional knowledge flow between text and vision modalities,\nenabling them to refine their semantics mutually. HiCroPL routes knowledge\nflows by leveraging the complementary strengths of text and vision. In early\nlayers, text prompts inject relatively clear semantics into visual prompts\nthrough a hierarchical knowledge mapper, enhancing the representation of\nlow-level visual semantics. In later layers, visual prompts encoding specific\ntask-relevant objects flow back to refine text prompts, enabling deeper\nalignment. Crucially, our hierarchical knowledge mapper allows representations\nat multi-scales to be fused, ensuring that deeper representations retain\ntransferable shallow semantics thereby enhancing generalization. We further\nintroduce a lightweight layer-specific knowledge proxy to enable efficient\ncross-modal interactions.

Conceived as a simple heuristic quantifying the extent to which a\ngiven term's occurrences are concentrated in any one given document out of\nmany, TF-IDF and its many variants are routinely used as term-weighting schemes\nin diverse text analysis applications. There is a growing body of scholarship\ndedicated to placing TF-IDF on a sound theoretical foundation. Building on that\ntradition, this paper justifies the use of TF-IDF to the statistics community\nby demonstrating how the famed expression can be understood from a significance\ntesting perspective. We show that the common TF-IDF variant TF-ICF is, under\nmild regularity conditions, closely related to the negative logarithm of the\n$p$-value from a one-tailed version of Fisher's exact test of statistical\nsignificance.

We propose OmniVTON, the first training-free universal VTON\nframework that decouples garment and pose conditioning to achieve both texture\nfidelity and pose consistency across diverse settings. To preserve garment\ndetails, we introduce a garment prior generation mechanism that aligns clothing\nwith the body, followed by continuous boundary stitching technique to achieve\nfine-grained texture retention. For precise pose alignment, we utilize DDIM\ninversion to capture structural cues while suppressing texture interference,\nensuring accurate body alignment independent of the original image textures. By\ndisentangling garment and pose constraints, OmniVTON eliminates the bias\ninherent in diffusion models when handling multiple conditions simultaneously.\nExperimental results demonstrate that OmniVTON achieves superior performance\nacross diverse datasets, garment types, and application scenarios. Notably, it\nis the first framework capable of multi-human VTON, enabling realistic garment\ntransfer across multiple individuals in a single scene.

Our experiments show that this unified training strategy not only\nsimplifies deployment but also significantly boosts generalization on\nfull-resolution data.

Our PanTiny\nmodel, benefiting from these innovations, achieves a superior\nperformance-to-efficiency balance, outperforming most larger, specialized\nmodels. Through extensive ablation studies, we validate that principled\nengineering in model design, training paradigms, and loss functions can surpass\nbrute-force scaling.

We introduce\nStableAnimator++, the first ID-preserving video diffusion framework with\nlearnable pose alignment, capable of generating high-quality videos conditioned\non a reference image and a pose sequence without any post-processing. Building\nupon a video diffusion model, StableAnimator++ contains carefully designed\nmodules for both training and inference, striving for identity consistency. In\nparticular, StableAnimator++ first uses learnable layers to predict the\nsimilarity transformation matrices between the reference image and the driven\nposes via injecting guidance from Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). These\nmatrices align the driven poses with the reference image, mitigating\nmisalignment to a great extent. StableAnimator++ then computes image and face\nembeddings using off-the-shelf encoders, refining the face embeddings via a\nglobal content-aware Face Encoder.

Despite significant advancements, aerial vPR faces unique\nchallenges due to the limited availability of large-scale, high-altitude\ndatasets, which limits model generalization, along with the inherent rotational\nambiguity in UAV imagery. To address these challenges, we introduce LASED, a\nlarge-scale aerial dataset with approximately one million images,\nsystematically sampled from 170,000 unique locations throughout Estonia over a\ndecade, offering extensive geographic and temporal diversity. Its structured\ndesign ensures clear place separation significantly enhancing model training\nfor aerial scenarios. Furthermore, we propose the integration of steerable\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to explicitly handle rotational variance,\nleveraging their inherent rotational equivariance to produce robust,\norientation-invariant feature representations.

Recent advances in\nvision-language models have enabled strong multimodal reasoning capabilities,\nbut their computational cost remains prohibitive for long, redundant video\ninputs.

To address this, we propose EgoPrune, a\ntraining-free token pruning method tailored for egomotion video reasoning.\nEgoPrune comprises three components: a keyframe selector adapted from EmbodiedR\nfor temporally efficient sampling; Perspective-Aware Redundancy Filtering\n(PARF), which aligns visual tokens using perspective transformations and\nremoves redundant tokens; and a Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)-based token\nselector that jointly considers visual-text relevance and intra-frame\ndiversity. Experiments on two egomotion video benchmarks show that EgoPrune\nconsistently outperforms prior training-free methods across various pruning\nratios while significantly reducing FLOPs, memory usage, and latency.

Extensive experiments on multiple\nbenchmarks validate UMIVR's effectiveness, achieving notable gains in Recall@1\n(69.2\\% after 10 interactive rounds) on the MSR-VTT-1k dataset, thereby\nestablishing an uncertainty-minimizing foundation for interactive TVR.", "AI": {"tldr": "UMIVR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6587\u672c-\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u3001\u6620\u5c04\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5e27\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u67e5\u8be2\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6587\u672c-\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u3001\u6620\u5c04\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "UMIVR\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u71b5\uff08TAS\uff09\u3001Jensen-Shannon\u6563\u5ea6\uff08MUS\uff09\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u8d28\u91cf\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff08TQFS\uff09\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "result": "\u5728MSR-VTT-1k\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cUMIVR\u572810\u8f6e\u4ea4\u4e92\u540eRecall@1\u8fbe\u523069.2%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "UMIVR\u4e3a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6587\u672c-\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u7d22\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Existing methods address\nthis challenge by tapping Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to access knowledge\nbeyond the training data.

In this paper, we introduce HOLa (Zero-Shot HOI Detection with\nLow-Rank Decomposed VLM Feature Adaptation), a novel approach that both\nenhances generalization to unseen classes and improves action distinction. In\ntraining, HOLa decomposes VLM text features for given HOI classes via low-rank\nfactorization, producing class-shared basis features and adaptable weights.\nThese features and weights form a compact HOI representation that preserves\nshared information across classes, enhancing generalization to unseen classes.\nSubsequently, we refine action distinction by adapting weights for each HOI\nclass and introducing human-object tokens to enrich visual interaction\nrepresentations. To further distinguish unseen actions, we guide the weight\nadaptation with LLM-derived action regularization.

Traditional approaches treat spatial and temporal information\nseparately. Due to issues like motion blur, it is challenging to accurately\nrepresent the spatial information of rapidly moving objects. This can lead to\ntemporally important regions being underemphasized during spatial feature\nextraction, which in turn hinders accurate spatio-temporal interaction and\nvideo understanding. To address this limitation, we propose an innovative video\nrepresentation method called Dynamic-Image (DynImg). Specifically, we introduce\na set of non-key frames as temporal prompts to highlight the spatial areas\ncontaining fast-moving objects. During the process of visual feature\nextraction, these prompts guide the model to pay additional attention to the\nfine-grained spatial features corresponding to these regions.

In this paper, we propose CylinderPlane, a novel implicit\nrepresentation based on Cylindrical Coordinate System, to eliminate the feature\nambiguity issue and ensure multi-view consistency in 360$^\\circ$. Different\nfrom the inevitable feature entanglement in Cartesian coordinate-based\nTri-plane representation, the cylindrical coordinate system explicitly\nseparates features at different angles, allowing our cylindrical representation\npossible to achieve high-quality, artifacts-free 360$^\\circ$ image synthesis.\nWe further introduce the nested cylinder representation that composites\nmultiple cylinders at different scales, thereby enabling the model more\nadaptable to complex geometry and varying resolutions.

Semi-supervised\nsemantic segmentation (SSSS) has emerged as a solution to alleviate the\nlabeling burden by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data through\nself-training techniques. Meanwhile, the advent of foundational segmentation\nmodels pre-trained on massive data, has shown the potential to generalize\nacross domains effectively. This work explores whether a foundational\nsegmentation model can address label scarcity in the pixel-level vision task as\nan annotator for unlabeled images. Specifically, we investigate the efficacy of\nusing SEEM, a Segment Anything Model (SAM) variant fine-tuned for textual\ninput, to generate predictive masks for unlabeled data. To address the\nshortcomings of using SEEM-generated masks as supervision, we propose\nConformalSAM, a novel SSSS framework which first calibrates the foundation\nmodel using the target domain's labeled data and then filters out unreliable\npixel labels of unlabeled data so that only high-confidence labels are used as\nsupervision. By leveraging conformal prediction (CP) to adapt foundation models\nto target data through uncertainty calibration, ConformalSAM exploits the\nstrong capability of the foundational segmentation model reliably which\nbenefits the early-stage learning, while a subsequent self-reliance training\nstrategy mitigates overfitting to SEEM-generated masks in the later training\nstage.

Recent work has revealed that the prior knowledge in MLLMs significantly\nsuppresses visual information in deep layers, causing hallucinatory outputs.\nHowever, how these priors suppress visual information at the intermediate layer\nstage in MLLMs remains unclear.

Despite notable\nadvances with recent efforts, current techniques still lag behind human\ncapabilities in handling drastic visual variations, occlusions, and complex\nscene changes. This limitation arises from their reliance on appearance\nmatching, neglecting the human-like conceptual understanding of objects that\nenables robust identification across temporal dynamics. Motivated by this gap,\nwe propose Segment Concept (SeC), a concept-driven segmentation framework that\nshifts from conventional feature matching to the progressive construction and\nutilization of high-level, object-centric representations. SeC employs Large\nVision-Language Models (LVLMs) to integrate visual cues across diverse frames,\nconstructing robust conceptual priors. During inference, SeC forms a\ncomprehensive semantic representation of the target based on processed frames,\nrealizing robust segmentation of follow-up frames. Furthermore, SeC adaptively\nbalances LVLM-based semantic reasoning with enhanced feature matching,\ndynamically adjusting computational efforts based on scene complexity. To\nrigorously assess VOS methods in scenarios demanding high-level conceptual\nreasoning and robust semantic understanding, we introduce the Semantic Complex\nScenarios Video Object Segmentation benchmark (SeCVOS). SeCVOS comprises 160\nmanually annotated multi-scenario videos designed to challenge models with\nsubstantial appearance variations and dynamic scene transformations.

Although this task\nhas seen impressive improvements in recent times, a focus on rapidly producing\nstronger models has come at the cost of detailed and fair scientific\ncomparison. Differing training data, model architectures and generation\nparadigms make it difficult to disentangle the factors contributing to\nperformance. Meanwhile, the motivations and nuances of certain approaches\nbecome lost in the literature. In this work, we aim to provide clear takeaways\nacross generation paradigms for practitioners wishing to develop\ntransformer-based systems for spatially-controlled generation, clarifying the\nliterature and addressing knowledge gaps. We perform controlled experiments on\nImageNet across diffusion-based/flow-based and autoregressive (AR) models.\nFirst, we establish control token prefilling as a simple, general and\nperformant baseline approach for transformers.

In this paper, we propose TokensGen, a novel two-stage\nframework that leverages condensed tokens to address these issues. Our method\ndecomposes long video generation into three core tasks: (1) inner-clip semantic\ncontrol, (2) long-term consistency control, and (3) inter-clip smooth\ntransition. First, we train To2V (Token-to-Video), a short video diffusion\nmodel guided by text and video tokens, with a Video Tokenizer that condenses\nshort clips into semantically rich tokens. Second, we introduce T2To\n(Text-to-Token), a video token diffusion transformer that generates all tokens\nat once, ensuring global consistency across clips. Finally, during inference,\nan adaptive FIFO-Diffusion strategy seamlessly connects adjacent clips,\nreducing boundary artifacts and enhancing smooth transitions.

Among these methods, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)\nis a notable approach based on the assumption that the adaptation inherently\noccurs in a low-dimensional subspace. While it has shown good performance, its\nimplementation requires a fixed and unalterable rank, which might be\nchallenging to select given the unique complexities and requirements of each\nmedical imaging downstream task. Inspired by advancements in natural image\nprocessing, we introduce a novel approach for medical image segmentation that\ndynamically adjusts the intrinsic rank during adaptation. Viewing the low-rank\nrepresentation of the trainable weight matrices as a singular value\ndecomposition, we introduce an l_1 sparsity regularizer to the loss function,\nand tackle it with a proximal optimizer. The regularizer could be viewed as a\npenalty on the decomposition rank. Hence, its minimization enables to find\ntask-adapted ranks automatically.
