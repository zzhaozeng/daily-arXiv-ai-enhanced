While feature caching offers a\npromising acceleration strategy by reusing intermediate outputs across\ntimesteps, naive reuse often incurs noticeable quality degradation. In this\nwork, we formally analyze the cumulative error introduced by caching and\ndecompose it into two principal components: feature shift error, caused by\ninaccuracies in cached outputs, and step amplification error, which arises from\nerror propagation under fixed timestep schedules. To address these issues, we\npropose ERTACache, a principled caching framework that jointly rectifies both\nerror types.

Extensive experiments across standard image and video\ngeneration benchmarks show that ERTACache achieves up to 2x inference speedup\nwhile consistently preserving or even improving visual quality.

This paper investigates\nthe anchoring effect in LLM-driven price negotiations. To this end, we\ninstructed seller LLM agents to apply the anchoring effect and evaluated\nnegotiations using not only an objective metric but also a subjective metric.\nExperimental results show that LLMs are influenced by the anchoring effect like\nhumans. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between the anchoring\neffect and factors such as reasoning and personality. It was shown that\nreasoning models are less prone to the anchoring effect, suggesting that the\nlong chain of thought mitigates the effect. However, we found no significant\ncorrelation between personality traits and susceptibility to the anchoring\neffect.

This discrepancy highlights a\ncritical gap between declarative knowledge (knowing about something) and\nprocedural knowledge (knowing how to do something). Although traditional\nreinforcement learning (RL) agents can acquire procedural knowledge through\nenvironmental interaction, they often operate as black boxes and require\nsubstantial training data. In contrast, LLMs possess extensive world knowledge\nand reasoning capabilities, but are unable to effectively convert this static\nknowledge into dynamic decision-making in interactive settings. To address this\nchallenge, we propose Think in Games (TiG), a novel framework that empowers\nLLMs to develop procedural understanding through direct interaction with game\nenvironments, while retaining their inherent reasoning and explanatory\nabilities. Specifically, TiG reformulates RL-based decision-making as a\nlanguage modeling task: LLMs generate language-guided policies, which are\nrefined iteratively through online reinforcement learning based on\nenvironmental feedback. Our experimental results show that TiG successfully\nbridges the gap between declarative and procedural knowledge, achieving\ncompetitive performance with dramatically lower data and computational demands\ncompared to conventional RL methods. Moreover, TiG provides step-by-step\nnatural language explanations for its decisions, greatly improving transparency\nand interpretability in complex interactive tasks."}

Using Print2Volume, we generated a large-scale\nsynthetic dataset of 420,000 samples. Quantitative experiments demonstrate the\nhigh quality of our synthetic data and its significant impact on recognition\nperformance. By pre-training a recognition model on our synthetic data and\nfine-tuning it on a small real-world dataset, we achieved a remarkable\nreduction in the Equal Error Rate (EER) from 15.62% to 2.50% on the ZJUT-EIFD\nbenchmark, proving the effectiveness of our approach in overcoming data\nscarcity."}

Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the\nnormal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense\nof the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two\nways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather\nthan exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test\nrequires building machines that \"make mistakes\" and display imperfect behavior\njust like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a\nstatistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a\nsingle \"average\" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As\nsuch, the notion of \"average human interrogator\" that Turing talks about in his\noriginal paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical\nabstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of\nmultiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of\nnormal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average\njudgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First,\nit argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the\nTuring test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than\nnormal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it\nproposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per\nse. Second, it argues that the core question of whether the Turing test can\ncontribute anything to the understanding of human cognition is that of whether\nthe human mind is really reducible to the normal/average mind--a question which\nlargely extends beyond the Turing test itself and questions the conceptual\nunderpinnings of the normalist paradigm it belongs to."}

However, they remain vulnerable to\nhallucination-producing content inconsistent with or unrelated to video inputs.\nPrevious video hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on short-videos. They\nattribute hallucinations to factors such as strong language priors, missing\nframes, or vision-language biases introduced by the visual encoder. While these\ncauses indeed account for most hallucinations in short videos, they still\noversimplify the cause of hallucinations. Sometimes, models generate incorrect\noutputs but with correct frame-level semantics. We refer to this type of\nhallucination as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), which arises during\nthe process of aggregating frame-level semantics into event-level semantic\ngroups. Given that SAH becomes particularly critical in long videos due to\nincreased semantic complexity across multiple events, it is essential to\nseparate and thoroughly investigate the causes of this type of hallucination.\nTo address the above issues, we introduce ELV-Halluc, the first benchmark\ndedicated to long-video hallucination, enabling a systematic investigation of\nSAH. Our experiments confirm the existence of SAH and show that it increases\nwith semantic complexity. Additionally, we find that models are more prone to\nSAH on rapidly changing semantics. Moreover, we discuss potential approaches to\nmitigate SAH. We demonstrate that positional encoding strategy contributes to\nalleviating SAH, and further adopt DPO strategy to enhance the model's ability\nto distinguish semantics within and across events. To support this, we curate a\ndataset of 8K adversarial data pairs and achieve improvements on both\nELV-Halluc and Video-MME, including a substantial 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio."}

To address this, we propose the\nHierarchical Cross-Granularity Contrastive and Matching learning (HCCM)\nframework with two components: (1) Region-Global Image-Text Contrastive\nLearning (RG-ITC), which avoids precise scene partitioning and captures\nhierarchical local-to-global semantics by contrasting local visual regions with\nglobal text and vice versa; (2) Region-Global Image-Text Matching (RG-ITM),\nwhich dispenses with rigid constraints and instead evaluates local semantic\nconsistency within global cross-modal representations, enhancing compositional\nreasoning.

Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the\nnormal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense\nof the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two\nways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather\nthan exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test\nrequires building machines that \"make mistakes\" and display imperfect behavior\njust like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a\nstatistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a\nsingle \"average\" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As\nsuch, the notion of \"average human interrogator\" that Turing talks about in his\noriginal paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical\nabstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of\nmultiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of\nnormal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average\njudgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First,\nit argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the\nTuring test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than\nnormal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it\nproposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per\nse. Second, it argues that the core question of whether the Turing test can\ncontribute anything to the understanding of human cognition is that of whether\nthe human mind is really reducible to the normal/average mind--a question which\nlargely extends beyond the Turing test itself and questions the conceptual\nunderpinnings of the normalist paradigm it belongs to."}

This dramatically reduces\ncomputational requirements, enabling synthetic dataset generation with a\nconsumer-grade GPU (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090). We empirically evaluate our\napproach on seven diverse object detection datasets. Our results demonstrate\nthat training object detectors with just 500 synthetic images generated by our\napproach yields superior detection performance compared to models trained on\n5000 synthetic images from the ODGEN baseline, achieving improvements of up to\n21.3% in mAP@.50:.95. This work demonstrates that it is possible to surpass\nstate-of-the-art performance with far greater efficiency, as FLORA achieves\nsuperior results using only 10% of the data and a fraction of the computational\ncost. This work demonstrates that a quality and efficiency-focused approach is\nmore effective than brute-force generation, making advanced synthetic data\ncreation more practical and accessible for real-world scenarios."}

While these\ncauses indeed account for most hallucinations in short videos, they still\noversimplify the cause of hallucinations. Sometimes, models generate incorrect\noutputs but with correct frame-level semantics. We refer to this type of\nhallucination as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), which arises during\nthe process of aggregating frame-level semantics into event-level semantic\ngroups.

The joint log-likelihood of the reasoning and final\nanswer naturally decomposes into reasoning confidence and answer confidence.\nPiCSAR achieves substantial gains across diverse benchmarks (+10.18 on MATH500,\n+9.81 on AIME2025), outperforming baselines with at least 2x fewer samples in\n16 out of 20 comparisons. Our analysis reveals that correct reasoning chains\nexhibit significantly higher reasoning and answer confidence, justifying the\neffectiveness of PiCSAR."}

Specifically, we propose a Three-Memory framework for Unified\nstructural and logical Anomaly Detection (TMUAD). First, we build a class-level\ntext memory bank for logical anomaly detection by the proposed logic-aware text\nextractor, which can capture rich logical descriptions of objects from input\nimages. Second, we construct an object-level image memory bank that preserves\ncomplete object contours by extracting features from segmented objects. Third,\nwe employ visual encoders to extract patch-level image features for\nconstructing a patch-level memory bank for structural anomaly detection. These\nthree complementary memory banks are used to retrieve and compare normal images\nthat are most similar to the query image, compute anomaly scores at multiple\nlevels, and fuse them into a final anomaly score. By unifying structural and\nlogical anomaly detection through collaborative memory banks, TMUAD achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across seven publicly available datasets involving\nindustrial and medical domains.

Specifically, given an input image, the model\nmust first classify the main visual events (verb classification), then identify\nthe participating entities and their semantic roles (semantic role labeling),\nand finally localize these entities in the image (semantic role localization).\nExisting methods treat verb classification as a single-label problem, but we\nshow through a comprehensive analysis that this formulation fails to address\nthe inherent ambiguity in visual event recognition, as multiple verb categories\nmay reasonably describe the same image. This paper makes three key\ncontributions: First, we reveal through empirical analysis that verb\nclassification is inherently a multi-label problem due to the ubiquitous\nsemantic overlap between verb categories. Second, given the impracticality of\nfully annotating large-scale datasets with multiple labels, we propose to\nreformulate verb classification as a single positive multi-label learning\n(SPMLL) problem - a novel perspective in SR research. Third, we design a\ncomprehensive multi-label evaluation benchmark for SR that is carefully\ndesigned to fairly evaluate model performance in a multi-label setting. To\naddress the challenges of SPMLL, we futher develop the Graph Enhanced Verb\nMultilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP), which combines graph neural networks to\ncapture label correlations and adversarial training to optimize decision\nboundaries. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach\nachieves more than 3\\% MAP improvement while remaining competitive on\ntraditional top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics."}
