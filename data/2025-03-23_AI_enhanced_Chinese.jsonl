While judge models -- LLMs\nfinetuned to specialize in assessing and critiquing model outputs -- have been\ntouted as general purpose evaluators, they are typically evaluated only on\nnon-contextual scenarios, such as instruction following. The omission of\ncontextual settings -- those where external information is used as context to\ngenerate an output -- is surprising given the increasing prevalence of\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and summarization use cases. Contextual\nassessment is uniquely challenging, as evaluation often depends on practitioner\npriorities, leading to conditional evaluation criteria (e.g., comparing\nresponses based on factuality and then considering completeness if they are\nequally factual). To address the gap, we propose ContextualJudgeBench, a judge\nbenchmark with 2,000 challenging response pairs across eight splits inspired by\nreal-world contextual evaluation scenarios. We build our benchmark with a\nmulti-pronged data construction pipeline that leverages both existing human\nannotations and model-based perturbations. Our comprehensive study across 11\njudge models and 9 general purpose models, reveals that the contextual\ninformation and its assessment criteria present a significant challenge to even\nstate-of-the-art models.

However, since the comparator\nLLM differed from NotebookLM's internal model, it remained unclear whether its\nadvantage stemmed from RAG or inherent model differences. To better isolate\nRAG's impact and assess its utility across different cancers, we compared\nNotebookLM with its internal LLM, Gemini 2.0 Flash, in a pancreatic cancer\nstaging experiment.\n  Materials and Methods: A summary of Japan's pancreatic cancer staging\nguidelines was used as REK. We compared three groups - REK+/RAG+ (NotebookLM\nwith REK), REK+/RAG- (Gemini 2.0 Flash with REK), and REK-/RAG- (Gemini 2.0\nFlash without REK) - in staging 100 fictional pancreatic cancer cases based on\nCT findings.

Through extensive evaluation of\nstate-of-the-art LLMs, we reveal significant performance gaps between\nunderstanding and generation tasks, with models achieving promising results in\ncomprehension but struggling considerably in generation tasks, particularly\nthose requiring deep cultural knowledge and adherence to classical formats.

Unlike factoid questions,\nnon-factoid questions (NFQs) lack definitive answers and require synthesizing\ninformation from multiple sources across various reasoning dimensions. To\naddress these limitations, we introduce Typed-RAG, a type-aware multi-aspect\ndecomposition framework within the RAG paradigm for NFQA.

In domain-specific contexts, maintaining data quality\nand managing system constraints remain key challenges. To address these issues,\nwe propose an automated continual instruction tuning framework that dynamically\nfilters incoming data, which identify and reduce redundant data across\nsuccessive updates. Our approach utilizes a small proxy model for efficient\nperplexity-based filtering, and updates the proxy to ensure that the filtering\ncriteria remain aligned with the evolving state of the deployed model.

In Chapter 2 we\npresent a blueprint to build and scale feedforward scene flow estimators\nwithout requiring expensive human annotations via large scale distillation from\npseudolabels provided by strong unsupervised test-time optimization methods. In\nChapter 3 we introduce a benchmark to better measure estimate quality across\ndiverse object types, better bringing into focus what we care about and expect\nfrom scene flow estimators, and use this benchmark to host a public challenge\nthat produced significant progress. In Chapter 4 we present a state-of-the-art\nunsupervised scene flow estimator that introduces a new, full sequence problem\nformulation and exhibits great promise in adjacent domains like 3D point\ntracking.

Although existing monocular\nclothed human reconstruction solutions have shown promising results, they often\nrely on the assumption that the human subject is in an occlusion-free\nenvironment. Thus, when encountering in-the-wild occluded images, these\nalgorithms produce multiview inconsistent and fragmented reconstructions.\nAdditionally, most algorithms for monocular 3D human reconstruction leverage\ngeometric priors such as SMPL annotations for training and inference, which are\nextremely challenging to acquire in real-world applications. To address these\nlimitations, we propose CHROME: Clothed Human Reconstruction with\nOcclusion-Resilience and Multiview-ConsistEncy from a Single Image, a novel\npipeline designed to reconstruct occlusion-resilient 3D humans with multiview\nconsistency from a single occluded image, without requiring either ground-truth\ngeometric prior annotations or 3D supervision. Specifically, CHROME leverages a\nmultiview diffusion model to first synthesize occlusion-free human images from\nthe occluded input, compatible with off-the-shelf pose control to explicitly\nenforce cross-view consistency during synthesis. A 3D reconstruction model is\nthen trained to predict a set of 3D Gaussians conditioned on both the occluded\ninput and synthesized views, aligning cross-view details to produce a cohesive\nand accurate 3D representation.

In this direction, we propose a geometric and semantic self-supervised\npre-training method, GASP, that learns a unified representation by predicting,\nat any queried future point in spacetime, (1) general occupancy, capturing the\nevolving structure of the 3D scene; (2) ego occupancy, modeling the ego vehicle\npath through the environment; and (3) distilled high-level features from a\nvision foundation model. By modeling geometric and semantic 4D occupancy fields\ninstead of raw sensor measurements, the model learns a structured,\ngeneralizable representation of the environment and its evolution through time.\nWe validate GASP on multiple autonomous driving benchmarks, demonstrating\nsignificant improvements in semantic occupancy forecasting, online mapping, and\nego trajectory prediction.

Despite its effectiveness, ICL is prone to errors,\nespecially for challenging examples. With the goal of improving the performance\nof ICL, we propose corrective in-context learning (CICL), an approach that\nincorporates a model's incorrect predictions alongside ground truth corrections\ninto the prompt, aiming to enhance classification accuracy through\nself-correction. However, contrary to our hypothesis, extensive experiments on\ntext classification tasks demonstrate that CICL consistently underperforms\nstandard ICL, with performance degrading as the proportion of corrections in\nthe prompt increases.

To overcome this limitation, we introduce SPNeRF, a NeRF based\nzero-shot 3D segmentation approach that leverages geometric priors.

Additionally, we design a\nsemantic uncertainty quantification module that calculates the per-pixel\nentropy and yields uncertainty maps used to guide the refinement process from\nthe most confident pixels while discarding the remaining highly uncertain ones.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on real-world scene datasets, including\nin-domain RealEstate-10K and out-of-domain KITTI-v2, showing that our approach\ncan provide more realistic and high-fidelity novel view synthesis results\ncompared to existing state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"task": "\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa3D\u573a\u666f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u52303D\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4ece\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u6e32\u67d3\u573a\u666f\u65f6\uff0c\u5f80\u5f80\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u8fde\u8d2f\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u89c6\u56fe\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u76f8\u673a\u89c6\u91ce\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u533a\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u7c97\u7cd9\u573a\u666f\u8fdb\u884c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5373\u65f6\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6bcf\u4e2a\u50cf\u7d20\u7684\u71b5\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u56fe\uff0c\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u4ece\u6700\u81ea\u4fe1\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728RealEstate-10K\u548cKITTI-v2\u7b49\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u751f\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u52303D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u89c6\u91ce\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u533a\u57df\u65f6\u3002"}}

While existing methods introduced elaborate spatial learning\nmethods, they still exhibit limited performance. To address this issue, a\nfrequency enhancement approach is proposed. Based on the frequency analysis of\ncolor filter array (CFA)/demosaicked/ground truth images, we propose Dual-path\nFrequency Enhancement Network (DFENet), which reconstructs RGB images in a\ndivide-and-conquer manner through fourier-domain frequency selection. In\nDFENet, two frequency selectors are employed, each selecting a set of frequency\ncomponents for processing along separate paths. One path focuses on generating\nmissing information through detail refinement in spatial domain, while the\nother aims at suppressing undesirable frequencies with the guidance of CFA\nimages in frequency domain. Multi-level frequency supervision with a stagewise\ntraining strategy is employed to further improve the reconstruction\nperformance. With these designs, the proposed DFENet outperforms other\nstate-of-the-art algorithms on different datasets and demonstrates significant\nadvantages on hard cases. Moreover, to better assess algorithms' ability to\nreconstruct high-frequency textures, a new dataset, LineSet37, is contributed,\nwhich consists of 37 artificially designed and generated images. These images\nfeature complex line patterns and are prone to severe visual artifacts like\ncolor moir\\'e after demosaicking.

However, the quality of reconstructions depends heavily on\nhigh-quality input images and precise camera poses, which are not that trivial\nto fulfill in real-world scenarios. Capturing dynamic scenes with handheld\nmonocular cameras, for instance, typically involves simultaneous movement of\nboth the camera and objects within a single exposure. This combined motion\nfrequently results in image blur that existing methods cannot adequately\nhandle. To address these challenges, we introduce BARD-GS, a novel approach for\nrobust dynamic scene reconstruction that effectively handles blurry inputs and\nimprecise camera poses. Our method comprises two main components: 1) camera\nmotion deblurring and 2) object motion deblurring. By explicitly decomposing\nmotion blur into camera motion blur and object motion blur and modeling them\nseparately, we achieve significantly improved rendering results in dynamic\nregions. In addition, we collect a real-world motion blur dataset of dynamic\nscenes to evaluate our approach.

To generate diverse camera poses and unbounded\nspatial extent of real-world scenes, while ensuring generalization to arbitrary\ntext prompts, previous methods fine-tune 2D generative models to jointly model\ncamera poses and multi-view images. However, these methods suffer from\ninstability when extending 2D generative models to joint modeling due to the\nmodality gap, which necessitates additional models to stabilize training and\ninference. In this work, we propose an architecture and a sampling strategy to\njointly model multi-view images and camera poses when fine-tuning a video\ngeneration model. Our core idea is a dual-stream architecture that attaches a\ndedicated pose generation model alongside a pre-trained video generation model\nvia communication blocks, generating multi-view images and camera poses through\nseparate streams.

Our findings reveal sharp domain-specific\neffects: in StarCraft II, explicitly labelling AI as superhuman, novice\npersonas who learned of it reported lower toxicity and higher\nfairness-attributing defeat to advanced skill rather than hidden\ncheating-whereas expert personas found the disclosure statements irksome but\nstill less deceptive than non-disclosure.

First, existing Video-LLMs intermingle spatial and temporal features\nby applying an attention operation across all tokens.

To\naddress these issues, we introduce MASH-VLM, Mitigating Action-Scene\nHallucination in Video-LLMs through disentangled spatial-temporal\nrepresentations. Our approach includes two key innovations: (1) DST-attention,\na novel attention mechanism that disentangles the spatial and temporal tokens\nwithin the LLM by using masked attention to restrict direct interactions\nbetween the spatial and temporal tokens; (2) Harmonic-RoPE, which extends the\ndimensionality of the positional IDs, allowing the spatial and temporal tokens\nto maintain balanced positions relative to the text tokens.

Unlike online benchmarks, UI-Vision provides: (i) dense,\nhigh-quality annotations of human demonstrations, including bounding boxes, UI\nlabels, and action trajectories (clicks, drags, and keyboard inputs) across 83\nsoftware applications, and (ii) three fine-to-coarse grained tasks-Element\nGrounding, Layout Grounding, and Action Prediction-with well-defined metrics to\nrigorously evaluate agents' performance in desktop environments. Our evaluation\nreveals critical limitations in state-of-the-art models like UI-TARS-72B,\nincluding issues with understanding professional software, spatial reasoning,\nand complex actions like drag-and-drop. These findings highlight the challenges\nin developing fully autonomous computer use agents. By releasing UI-Vision as\nopen-source, we aim to advance the development of more capable agents for\nreal-world desktop tasks.", "AI": {"task": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30UI-Vision\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u684c\u9762\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5728\u7ebf\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u800c\u684c\u9762\u73af\u5883\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8bb8\u591a\u4e13\u4e1a\u548c\u65e5\u5e38\u4efb\u52a1\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u6311\u6218\u548c\u8bb8\u53ef\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u684c\u9762\u73af\u5883\u4ecd\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165UI-Vision\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u6f14\u793a\u6ce8\u91ca\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u3001UI\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u4ece\u7ec6\u5230\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff1a\u5143\u7d20\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u5e03\u5c40\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982UI-TARS-72B\uff09\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u4e13\u4e1a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08\u5982\u62d6\u653e\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "UI-Vision\u7684\u53d1\u5e03\u65e8\u5728\u63a8\u52a8\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u684c\u9762\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

Utilizing on-policy samples, generated directly by the\npolicy model, typically results in better performance due to its distribution\nconsistency with the model compared to off-policy samples.

While the quality of on-policy data is inherently constrained by the\ncapabilities of the policy model, off-policy data, which can be derived from\ndiverse sources, offers greater potential for quality despite experiencing\ndistribution shifts.

To tackle this,\nwe propose the Hybrid-level Instruction Injection Strategy for Conditional\nToken Compression in MLLMs (HICom), utilizing the instruction as a condition to\nguide the compression from both local and global levels.

The challenge aims to generate semantically aligned sign language\npose sequences from text inputs. To this end, we propose a Text-driven\nDiffusion Model (TDM) framework. During the training phase, TDM utilizes an\nencoder to encode text sequences and incorporates them into the diffusion model\nas conditional input to generate sign pose sequences. To guarantee the high\nquality and accuracy of the generated pose sequences, we utilize two key loss\nfunctions. The joint loss function L_{joint} is used to precisely measure and\nminimize the differences between the joint positions of the generated pose\nsequences and those of the ground truth. Similarly, the bone orientation loss\nfunction L_{bone} is instrumental in ensuring that the orientation of the bones\nin the generated poses aligns with the actual, correct orientations.

In this work, we propose to transfer representations from\nCLIP, a large-scale pre-trained vision-language model, to better capture\ncross-modal semantics between images and texts.

To\nenable efficient adaptation, we introduce UniCrossAdapter, lightweight adapter\nmodules that are incorporated into CLIP and fine-tuned on the target task while\nkeeping base parameters fixed.

However, extending these capabilities to video tasks remains\nchallenging due to limited labeled video data and high training costs. Recent\nvideo prompting methods attempt to adapt CLIP for video tasks by introducing\nlearnable prompts, but they typically rely on a single static prompt for all\nvideo sequences, overlooking the diverse temporal dynamics and spatial\nvariations that exist across frames. This limitation significantly hinders the\nmodel's ability to capture essential temporal information for effective video\nunderstanding. To address this, we propose an integrated Spatial-TempOral\ndynamic Prompting (STOP) model which consists of two complementary modules, the\nintra-frame spatial prompting and inter-frame temporal prompting. Our\nintra-frame spatial prompts are designed to adaptively highlight discriminative\nregions within each frame by leveraging intra-frame attention and temporal\nvariation, allowing the model to focus on areas with substantial temporal\ndynamics and capture fine-grained spatial details. Additionally, to highlight\nthe varying importance of frames for video understanding, we further introduce\ninter-frame temporal prompts, dynamically inserting prompts between frames with\nhigh temporal variance as measured by frame similarity.

However, the demand for a\nthorough understanding of videos and high computational costs still limit the\nwidespread applications of VideoQA. To address it, we propose Agentic Keyframe\nSearch (AKeyS), a simple yet powerful algorithm for identifying keyframes in\nthe VideoQA task. It can effectively distinguish key information from\nredundant, irrelevant content by leveraging modern language agents to direct\nclassical search algorithms. Specifically, we first segment the video and\norganize it as a tree structure. Then, AKeyS uses a language agent to estimate\nheuristics and movement costs while dynamically expanding nodes. Finally, the\nagent determines if sufficient keyframes have been collected based on\ntermination conditions and provides answers. Extensive experiments on the\nEgoSchema and NExT-QA datasets show that AKeyS outperforms all previous methods\nwith the highest keyframe searching efficiency, which means it can accurately\nidentify key information and conduct effective visual reasoning with minimal\ncomputational overhead. For example, on the EgoSchema subset, it achieves 1.8%\nhigher accuracy while processing only 43.5% of the frames compared to\nVideoTree.

However, the visual content is not equally\ncontributed to user instructions, existing strategies (\\eg, average pool)\ninevitably lead to the loss of potentially useful information. To tackle this,\nwe propose the Hybrid-level Instruction Injection Strategy for Conditional\nToken Compression in MLLMs (HICom), utilizing the instruction as a condition to\nguide the compression from both local and global levels. This encourages the\ncompression to retain the maximum amount of user-focused information while\nreducing visual tokens to minimize computational burden.

However,\ntraining models for detecting multiple landmarks simultaneously often\nencounters the \"seesaw phenomenon\", where improvements in detecting certain\nlandmarks lead to declines in detecting others. Yet, training a separate model\nfor each landmark increases memory usage and computational overhead. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a novel approach based on the belief that\n\"landmarks are distinct\" by training models with pseudo-labels and template\ndata updated continuously during the training process, where each model is\ndedicated to detecting a single landmark to achieve high accuracy. Furthermore,\ngrounded on the belief that \"landmarks are also alike\", we introduce an\nadapter-based fusion model, combining shared weights with landmark-specific\nweights, to efficiently share model parameters while allowing flexible\nadaptation to individual landmarks.

Compared to outdoor 3D datasets, indoor datasets face significant\nchallenges, including fewer training samples per class, a greater number of\nclasses, more severe class imbalance, and more diverse scene types and\nintra-class variances. This paper presents the first study on active learning\nfor indoor 3D object detection, where we propose a novel framework tailored for\nthis task. Our method incorporates two key criteria - uncertainty and diversity\n- to actively select the most ambiguous and informative unlabeled samples for\nannotation. The uncertainty criterion accounts for both inaccurate detections\nand undetected objects, ensuring that the most ambiguous samples are\nprioritized. Meanwhile, the diversity criterion is formulated as a joint\noptimization problem that maximizes the diversity of both object class\ndistributions and scene types, using a new Class-aware Adaptive Prototype (CAP)\nbank. The CAP bank dynamically allocates representative prototypes to each\nclass, helping to capture varying intra-class diversity across different\ncategories.

We introduce Guardians of Generation, a\nmodel agnostic inference time framework for dynamic copyright shielding in AI\nimage generation. Our approach requires no retraining or modification of the\ngenerative model weights, instead integrating seamlessly with existing\ndiffusion pipelines. It augments the generation process with an adaptive\nguidance mechanism comprising three components: a detection module, a prompt\nrewriting module, and a guidance adjustment module. The detection module\nmonitors user prompts and intermediate generation steps to identify features\nindicative of copyrighted content before they manifest in the final output. If\nsuch content is detected, the prompt rewriting mechanism dynamically transforms\nthe user's prompt by sanitizing or replacing references that could trigger\ncopyrighted material while preserving the prompt's intended semantics. The\nadaptive guidance module adaptively steers the diffusion process away from\nflagged content by modulating the model's sampling trajectory. Together, these\ncomponents form a robust shield that enables a tunable balance between\npreserving creative fidelity and ensuring copyright compliance. We validate our\nmethod on a variety of generative models such as Stable Diffusion, SDXL, and\nFlux, demonstrating substantial reductions in copyrighted content generation\nwith negligible impact on output fidelity or alignment with user intent.

Recent research has shown\nthat although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are initially poor at\nimage classification, fine-tuning them with an adequate amount of data can\nsignificantly enhance their performance, making them comparable to SOTA\nclassification models. However, acquiring large-scale labeled data is\nexpensive. In this paper, we explore few-shot MLLM classification fine-tuning.\nWe found that SFT can cause severe overfitting issues and may even degrade\nperformance over the zero-shot approach. To address this challenge, inspired by\nthe recent successes in rule-based reinforcement learning, we propose CLS-RL,\nwhich uses verifiable signals as reward to fine-tune MLLMs. We discovered that\nCLS-RL outperforms SFT in most datasets and has a much higher average accuracy\non both base-to-new and few-shot learning setting. Moreover, we observed a\nfree-lunch phenomenon for CLS-RL; when models are fine-tuned on a particular\ndataset, their performance on other distinct datasets may also improve over\nzero-shot models, even if those datasets differ in distribution and class\nnames. This suggests that RL-based methods effectively teach models the\nfundamentals of classification. Lastly, inspired by recent works in inference\ntime thinking, we re-examine the `thinking process' during fine-tuning, a\ncritical aspect of RL-based methods, in the context of visual classification.\nWe question whether such tasks require extensive thinking process during\nfine-tuning, proposing that this may actually detract from performance. Based\non this premise, we introduce the No-Thinking-CLS-RL method, which minimizes\nthinking processes during training by setting an equality accuracy reward.

However,\napplying these approaches to images requires discretizing continuous pixel data\nthrough vector quantization methods like VQ-VAE. To alleviate the quantization\nerrors that existed in VQ-VAE, recent works tend to use larger codebooks.\nHowever, this will accordingly expand vocabulary size, complicating the\nautoregressive modeling task. This paper aims to find a way to enjoy the\nbenefits of large codebooks without making autoregressive modeling more\ndifficult. Through empirical investigation, we discover that tokens with\nsimilar codeword representations produce similar effects on the final generated\nimage, revealing significant redundancy in large codebooks. Based on this\ninsight, we propose to predict tokens from coarse to fine (CTF), realized by\nassigning the same coarse label for similar tokens.

However,\ndue to the thousands of visual tokens from the video frames, key-value (KV)\ncache can significantly increase memory requirements, becoming a bottleneck for\ninference speed and memory usage. KV cache quantization is a widely used\napproach to address this problem. In this paper, we find that 2-bit KV\nquantization of VideoLLMs can hardly hurt the model performance, while the\nlimit of KV cache quantization in even lower bits has not been investigated. To\nbridge this gap, we introduce VidKV, a plug-and-play KV cache quantization\nmethod to compress the KV cache to lower than 2 bits.

Unlike indoor scene generation, which has\nbeen a primary focus of prior work, outdoor scene generation presents unique\nchallenges, including wide variations in scene heights and the need for a\nmethod capable of rapidly producing large landscapes. To address this, we\npropose an efficient approach that encodes scene chunks as uniform vector sets,\noffering better compression and performance than the spatially structured\nlatents used in prior methods.

By integrating 3D Gaussian Splatting techniques\nwith foundation models, M3 builds a multimodal memory capable of rendering\nfeature representations across granularities, encompassing a wide range of\nknowledge. In our exploration, we identify two key challenges in previous works\non feature splatting: (1) computational constraints in storing high-dimensional\nfeatures for each Gaussian primitive, and (2) misalignment or information loss\nbetween distilled features and foundation model features. To address these\nchallenges, we propose M3 with key components of principal scene components and\nGaussian memory attention, enabling efficient training and inference. To\nvalidate M3, we conduct comprehensive quantitative evaluations of feature\nsimilarity and downstream tasks, as well as qualitative visualizations to\nhighlight the pixel trace of Gaussian memory attention.

However, the user cannot utilize the model to further their\nknowledge other than the GPS coordinate; the model lacks an understanding of\nthe location and the conversational ability to communicate with the user. In\nrecent days, with tremendous progress of large multimodal models (LMMs)\nproprietary and open-source researchers have attempted to geolocalize images\nvia LMMs. However, the issues remain unaddressed; beyond general tasks, for\nmore specialized downstream tasks, one of which is geolocalization, LMMs\nstruggle. In this work, we propose to solve this problem by introducing a\nconversational model GAEA that can provide information regarding the location\nof an image, as required by a user. No large-scale dataset enabling the\ntraining of such a model exists. Thus we propose a comprehensive dataset GAEA\nwith 800K images and around 1.6M question answer pairs constructed by\nleveraging OpenStreetMap (OSM) attributes and geographical context clues.

A fundamental\ndilemma exists in token representation: discrete tokens enable straightforward\nmodeling with standard cross-entropy loss, but suffer from information loss and\ntokenizer training instability; continuous tokens better preserve visual\ndetails, but require complex distribution modeling, complicating the generation\npipeline. In this paper, we propose TokenBridge, which bridges this gap by\nmaintaining the strong representation capacity of continuous tokens while\npreserving the modeling simplicity of discrete tokens. To achieve this, we\ndecouple discretization from the tokenizer training process through\npost-training quantization that directly obtains discrete tokens from\ncontinuous representations. Specifically, we introduce a dimension-wise\nquantization strategy that independently discretizes each feature dimension,\npaired with a lightweight autoregressive prediction mechanism that efficiently\nmodel the resulting large token space. Extensive experiments show that our\napproach achieves reconstruction and generation quality on par with continuous\nmethods while using standard categorical prediction. This work demonstrates\nthat bridging discrete and continuous paradigms can effectively harness the\nstrengths of both approaches, providing a promising direction for high-quality\nvisual generation with simple autoregressive modeling.

Deep Learning techniques\noffer a promising solution. BirdNET, a widely used model for bird\nidentification, has shown success in many study systems but is limited in some\nregions due to biases in its training data. A key challenge in bird species\ndetection is that many recordings either lack target species or contain\noverlapping vocalizations. To overcome these problems, we developed a\nmulti-stage pipeline for automatic bird vocalization identification in Do\\~nana\nNational Park (SW Spain), a region facing significant conservation threats. Our\napproach included a Bird Song Detector to isolate vocalizations and custom\nclassifiers trained with BirdNET embeddings. We manually annotated 461 minutes\nof audio from three habitats across nine locations, yielding 3,749 annotations\nfor 34 classes. Spectrograms facilitated the use of image processing\ntechniques. Applying the Bird Song Detector before classification improved\nspecies identification, as all classification models performed better when\nanalyzing only the segments where birds were detected. Specifically, the\ncombination of the Bird Song Detector and fine-tuned BirdNET compared to the\nbaseline without the Bird Song Detector. Our approach demonstrated the\neffectiveness of integrating a Bird Song Detector with fine-tuned\nclassification models for bird identification at local soundscapes. These\nfindings highlight the need to adapt general-purpose tools for specific\necological challenges, as demonstrated in Do\\~nana. Automatically detecting\nbird species serves for tracking the health status of this threatened\necosystem, given the sensitivity of birds to environmental changes, and helps\nin the design of conservation measures for reducing biodiversity loss", "AI": {"task": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728Do\u00f1ana\u56fd\u5bb6\u516c\u56ed\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u9e1f\u7c7b\u9e23\u53eb\u3002", "motivation": "\u88ab\u52a8\u58f0\u5b66\u76d1\u6d4b\u751f\u6210\u5927\u91cf\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u97f3\u9891\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u63d0\u53d6\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5982BirdNET\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u5730\u533a\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u62ec\u9e1f\u7c7b\u9e23\u53eb\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eBirdNET\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u7ba1\u9053\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u5408\u9e1f\u7c7b\u9e23\u53eb\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u7684BirdNET\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7269\u79cd\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u672c\u5730\u58f0\u666f\u4e2d\u6574\u5408\u9e1f\u7c7b\u9e23\u53eb\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u4e3a\u7279\u5b9a\u751f\u6001\u6311\u6218\u8c03\u6574\u901a\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

However, most of that success has built on\nhuman-specific body pose representations and extensive training with labeled\nreal videos. In this work, we extend the ability of such models to animate\nimages of characters with more diverse skeletal topologies. Given a small\nnumber (3-5) of example frames showing the character in different poses with\ncorresponding skeletal information, our model quickly infers a rig for that\ncharacter that can generate images corresponding to new skeleton poses. We\npropose a procedural data generation pipeline that efficiently samples training\ndata with diverse topologies on the fly. We use it, along with a novel skeleton\nrepresentation, to train our model on articulated shapes spanning a large space\nof textures and topologies. Then during fine-tuning, our model rapidly adapts\nto unseen target characters and generalizes well to rendering new poses, both\nfor realistic and more stylized cartoon appearances. To better evaluate\nperformance on this novel and challenging task, we create the first 2D video\ndataset that contains both humanoid and non-humanoid subjects with per-frame\nkeypoint annotations.

The resulting model\nis then fine-tuned on the downstream tasks. We organize the training curriculum\nin a hierarchical manner such that the agent is guided from coarse to fine\ntowards the target task.

We then\nemploy an underlying SMPL representation to animate the corresponding 3D mesh\naccording to the video-generated motion, based on our motion optimization.

Firstly, we propose a\nselective complementary feature fusion (SCFF) module, which adaptively fuses\nrich cross-modal feature information by complementary soft selection weights.\nSecondly, a modal feature compression interaction (MFCI) transformer is\nproposed to deal with the multi-mode fusion redundancy problem when the feature\ndimension surges. The MFCI transformer is composed of modal feature compression\n(MFC) and modal feature interaction (MFI) to realize redundancy feature\ncompression and multi-mode feature interactive learning. %In MFI, we propose a\nhierarchical interactive attention mechanism based on multi-head attention.\nEvaluations on the BraTS2019 and BraTS2020 datasets demonstrate that CFCI-Net\nachieves superior results compared to state-of-the-art models.

Yet, few metrics directly model human visual perception, and\nmost rely on hand-crafted formulas or training datasets to achieve alignment\nwith perceptual data. In this paper, we propose a set of tests for\nfull-reference quality metrics that examine their ability to model several\naspects of low-level human vision: contrast sensitivity, contrast masking, and\ncontrast matching. The tests are meant to provide additional scrutiny for newly\nproposed metrics.

Achieving this requires the rapid and precise alignment of 2D\nintraoperative images (e.g., X-ray) with 3D preoperative volumes (e.g., CT,\nMRI). However, current 2D/3D registration methods fail across the broad\nspectrum of procedures dependent on X-ray guidance: traditional optimization\ntechniques require custom parameter tuning for each subject, whereas neural\nnetworks trained on small datasets do not generalize to new patients or require\nlabor-intensive manual annotations, increasing clinical burden and precluding\napplication to new anatomical targets. To address these challenges, we present\nxvr, a fully automated framework for training patient-specific neural networks\nfor 2D/3D registration. xvr uses physics-based simulation to generate abundant\nhigh-quality training data from a patient's own preoperative volumetric\nimaging, thereby overcoming the inherently limited ability of supervised models\nto generalize to new patients and procedures. Furthermore, xvr requires only 5\nminutes of training per patient, making it suitable for emergency interventions\nas well as planned procedures. We perform the largest evaluation of a 2D/3D\nregistration algorithm on real X-ray data to date and find that xvr robustly\ngeneralizes across a diverse dataset comprising multiple anatomical structures,\nimaging modalities, and hospitals.

In this paper, we introduce\nXAttention, a plug-and-play framework that dramatically accelerates\nlong-context inference in Transformers models using sparse attention.\nXAttention's key innovation is the insight that the sum of antidiagonal values\n(i.e., from the lower-left to upper-right) in the attention matrix provides a\npowerful proxy for block importance. This allows for precise identification and\npruning of non-essential blocks, resulting in high sparsity and dramatically\naccelerated inference. Across comprehensive evaluations on demanding\nlong-context benchmarks-including RULER and LongBench for language, VideoMME\nfor video understanding, and VBench for video generation. XAttention achieves\naccuracy comparable to full attention while delivering substantial\ncomputational gains. We demonstrate up to 13.5x acceleration in attention\ncomputation.
