For most of these tasks, performance can be measured with\nobjective metrics, such as the number of correct answers. However, other\nlanguage features are not easily quantified. For example, arousal,\nconcreteness, or gender associated with a given word, as well as the extent to\nwhich we experience words with senses and relate them to a specific sense.\nThose features have been studied for many years by psycholinguistics,\nconducting large-scale experiments with humans to produce ratings for thousands\nof words. This opens an opportunity to evaluate how well LLMs align with human\nratings on these word features, taking advantage of existing studies that cover\nmany different language features in a large number of words. In this paper, we\nevaluate the alignment of a representative group of LLMs with human ratings on\ntwo psycholinguistic datasets: the Glasgow and Lancaster norms. These datasets\ncover thirteen features over thousands of words. The results show that\nalignment is \\textcolor{black}{generally} better in the Glasgow norms evaluated\n(arousal, valence, dominance, concreteness, imageability, familiarity, and\ngender) than on the Lancaster norms evaluated (introceptive, gustatory,\nolfactory, haptic, auditory, and visual). This suggests a potential limitation\nof current LLMs in aligning with human sensory associations for words, which\nmay be due to their lack of embodied cognition present in humans and\nillustrates the usefulness of evaluating LLMs with psycholinguistic datasets."}

A\ndrafter-based speculative decoding leverages one or more smaller language\nmodels, a.k.a. drafters or draft models, to sample a draft sequence or tree\nconsisting of multiple tokens, followed by verification by a base LLM, a target\nmodel, accepting a subset as its valid generation. As it is usually considered\nthat the speculative decoding requires one-to-one mapping between vocabularies\nof the target model and the draft model, it has been natural to share the\nvocabulary between them, or even share the LM head as in EAGLE or Medusa. We\nfirst identify that this draft token sampling scheme inherently contains an\nunnecessary inference overhead in drafting, especially for some target LLMs\nwith very large vocabularies.

In this work, we propose a\ntraining-free mechanism for DDP frameworks, endowing them with DA capabilities.\nOur motivation arises from the observation that the exposure bias (e.g., noise\nstatistics bias) in diffusion brings domain shift, and different domains in\nconditions of DDP models can also be effectively captured by the noise\nprediction statistics.

Our\ntwo-stage training pipeline first performs CLIP-style pretraining on over 2.9\nmillion biomedical image-text pairs from 26 image modalities, followed by\nfeature-level distillation using over 19.2 million feature pairs extracted from\nteacher models. We evaluate MMKD-CLIP on 58 diverse biomedical datasets,\nencompassing over 10.8 million biomedical images across nine image modalities.\nThe evaluation spans six core task types: zero-shot classification, linear\nprobing, cross-modal retrieval, visual question answering, survival prediction,\nand cancer diagnosis. MMKD-CLIP consistently outperforms all teacher models\nwhile demonstrating remarkable robustness and generalization across image\ndomains and task settings. These results underscore that multi-teacher\nknowledge distillation is a scalable and effective paradigm for building\nhigh-performing biomedical foundation models under the practical constraints of\nreal-world data availability."}

Recently, approaches based on retrieval augmented generation (RAG)\nand agent have emerged to improve the factual accuracy by enhancing the LLMs\nwith knowledge retrieved from external knowledge bases (KBs). This is mostly\nimplemented by prompting the LLMs with instructions, examples and the retrieved\nknowledge. However, LLMs may have difficulty using the retrieved knowledge\neffectively for response generation, because they are not well trained to do\nsuch generation for specific domains. To mitigate this problem, we propose to\nfinetune the LLMs in the RAG-based and agent-based systems with domain-specific\ndata, together with domain-specific external knowledge, which is called\nknowledge augmented finetuning (KAFT).

We then analyze\nthe corresponding security vulnerabilities across the agent stack, identifying\nfailure modes such as deferred decision hazards, irreversible tool chains, and\ndeceptive behaviors arising from internal state drift or value misalignment.\nThese risks are traced to architectural fragilities that emerge across\nperception, cognition, memory, and action modules. To address these challenges,\nwe systematically review recent defense strategies deployed at different\nautonomy layers, including input sanitization, memory lifecycle control,\nconstrained decision-making, structured tool invocation, and introspective\nreflection. We introduce the Reflective Risk-Aware Agent Architecture (R2A2), a\nunified cognitive framework grounded in Constrained Markov Decision Processes\n(CMDPs), which incorporates risk-aware world modeling, meta-policy adaptation,\nand joint reward-risk optimization to enable principled, proactive safety\nacross the agent's decision-making loop."}

NCAs display striking emergent behaviors including\nself-regeneration, generalization and robustness to unseen situations, and\nspontaneous motion. Despite their success in texture synthesis and\nmorphogenesis, NCAs remain largely confined to low-resolution grids. This\nlimitation stems from (1) training time and memory requirements that grow\nquadratically with grid size, (2) the strictly local propagation of information\nwhich impedes long-range cell communication, and (3) the heavy compute demands\nof real-time inference at high resolution. In this work, we overcome this\nlimitation by pairing NCA with a tiny, shared implicit decoder, inspired by\nrecent advances in implicit neural representations. Following NCA evolution on\na coarse grid, a lightweight decoder renders output images at arbitrary\nresolution. We also propose novel loss functions for both morphogenesis and\ntexture synthesis tasks, specifically tailored for high-resolution output with\nminimal memory and computation overhead. Combining our proposed architecture\nand loss functions brings substantial improvement in quality, efficiency, and\nperformance. NCAs equipped with our implicit decoder can generate full-HD\noutputs in real time while preserving their self-organizing, emergent\nproperties. Moreover, because each MLP processes cell states independently,\ninference remains highly parallelizable and efficient. We demonstrate the\napplicability of our approach across multiple NCA variants (on 2D, 3D grids,\nand 3D meshes) and multiple tasks, including texture generation and\nmorphogenesis (growing patterns from a seed), showing that with our proposed\nframework, NCAs seamlessly scale to high-resolution outputs with minimal\ncomputational overhead."}

While reinforcement learning (RL), specifically Group Relative\nPolicy Optimization (GRPO), improves generalization, we uncover a key failure\nmode: a significant drop in reasoning accuracy occurs when a model's reasoning\ntrace contradicts that of an independent, frozen vision-language model\n(\"listener\") evaluating the same output. To address this, we introduce a\nlistener-augmented GRPO framework. Here, the listener re-evaluates the\nreasoner's chain-of-thought to provide a dense, calibrated confidence score,\nshaping the RL reward signal. This encourages the reasoner not only to answer\ncorrectly, but to produce explanations that are persuasive to an independent\nmodel. Our listener-shaped reward scheme achieves best accuracy on the\nImageReward benchmark (67.4%), significantly improves out-of-distribution (OOD)\nperformance on a large-scale human preference dataset (1.2M votes, up to +6%\nover naive reasoner), and reduces reasoning contradictions compared to strong\nGRPO and SFT baselines.

Existing training paradigms,\nincluding Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with\nVerifiable Reward (RLVR), impose substantial demands on the base VLM, exceeding\nthe capabilities of SVLMs. Consequently, directly applying these paradigms to\nSVLMs often suffers from severe pseudo thinking traces and advantage collapse,\nultimately undermining both thinking reliability and task performance. A\nnatural solution is to combine SFT and RLVR, leveraging their complementarity\nto reduce the dependence on model capacity. However, the widely adopted\ntwo-stage training paradigm still performs poorly on SVLMs, as their tendency\ntoward sub-optimal convergence hinders the trade-off and limits the benefits of\nthe combination.

A Scoping Review from a Mathematics Education Perspective", "comment": null, "summary": "The progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT raises the question\nof how they can be integrated into education. One hope is that they can support\nmathematics learning, including word-problem solving. Since LLMs can handle\ntextual input with ease, they appear well-suited for solving mathematical word\nproblems. Yet their real competence, whether they can make sense of the\nreal-world context, and the implications for classrooms remain unclear. We\nconducted a scoping review from a mathematics-education perspective, including\nthree parts: a technical overview, a systematic review of word problems used in\nresearch, and a state-of-the-art empirical evaluation of LLMs on mathematical\nword problems. First, in the technical overview, we contrast the\nconceptualization of word problems and their solution processes between LLMs\nand students. In computer-science research this is typically labeled\nmathematical reasoning, a term that does not align with usage in mathematics\neducation. Second, our literature review of 213 studies shows that the most\npopular word-problem corpora are dominated by s-problems, which do not require\na consideration of realities of their real-world context. Finally, our\nevaluation of GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1, and o3 on 287 word problems\nshows that most recent LLMs solve these s-problems with near-perfect accuracy,\nincluding a perfect score on 20 problems from PISA. LLMs still showed\nweaknesses in tackling problems where the real-world context is problematic or\nnon-sensical. In sum, we argue based on all three aspects that LLMs have\nmastered a superficial solution process but do not make sense of word problems,\nwhich potentially limits their value as instructional tools in mathematics\nclassrooms."}

In this paper, we examine the challenge of\ncostly sanctioning in multi-agent LLM systems, where an agent must decide\nwhether to invest its own resources to incentivize cooperation or penalize\ndefection. To study this, we adapt a public goods game with institutional\nchoice from behavioral economics, allowing us to observe how different LLMs\nnavigate social dilemmas over repeated interactions. Our analysis reveals four\ndistinct behavioral patterns among models: some consistently establish and\nsustain high levels of cooperation, others fluctuate between engagement and\ndisengagement, some gradually decline in cooperative behavior over time, and\nothers rigidly follow fixed strategies regardless of outcomes. Surprisingly, we\nfind that reasoning LLMs, such as the o1 series, struggle significantly with\ncooperation, whereas some traditional LLMs consistently achieve high levels of\ncooperation.

This\nproblem is particularly pronounced in manufacturing domains, where obtaining\nhigh-quality labels is costly and time-consuming. This paper introduces\nVision-Language Sanitization and Refinement (VLSR), which is a\nvision-language-based framework for label sanitization and refinement in\nmulti-label manufacturing image datasets. This method embeds both images and\ntheir associated textual labels into a shared semantic space leveraging the\nCLIP vision-language model. Then two key tasks are addressed in this process by\ncomputing the cosine similarity between embeddings. First, label sanitization\nis performed to identify irrelevant, misspelled, or semantically weak labels,\nand surface the most semantically aligned label for each image by comparing\nimage-label pairs using cosine similarity between image and label embeddings.\nSecond, the method applies density-based clustering on text embeddings,\nfollowed by iterative cluster merging, to group semantically similar labels\ninto unified label groups. The Factorynet dataset, which includes noisy labels\nfrom both human annotations and web-scraped sources, is employed to evaluate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed framework. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat the VLSR framework successfully identifies problematic labels and improves\nlabel consistency. This method enables a significant reduction in label\nvocabulary through clustering, which ultimately enhances the dataset's quality\nfor training robust machine learning models in industrial applications with\nminimal human intervention."}

The Oneta network comprises Y-Net and C-Net to predict eigenTF and\nCCM parameters, respectively. To support $K$ styles, Oneta employs $K$\nlearnable tokens.

The fonts\ninclude Angkor, Battambang, Bayon, Bokor, Chenla, Dangrek, Freehand, Kh Kompong\nChhnang, Kh SN Kampongsom, Khmer, Khmer CN Stueng Songke, Khmer Savuth Pen,\nMetal, Moul, Odor MeanChey, Preah Vihear, Siemreap, Sithi Manuss, and iSeth\nFirst. Our comparison of OCR performance across these fonts reveals that Khmer,\nOdor MeanChey, Siemreap, Sithi Manuss, and Battambang achieve high accuracy,\nwhile iSeth First, Bayon, and Dangrek perform poorly. This study underscores\nthe critical importance of font selection in optimizing Khmer text recognition\nand provides valuable insights for developing more robust OCR systems."}

We propose masking the\nweights of the predicted INR during training to allow for variable, higher\nquality compression, resulting in 1.7% improvements to both PSNR and MS-SSIM at\n0.037 bpp on the UCF-101 dataset, and we increase hyper-network parameters by\n0.4% for 2.5%/2.7% improvements to PSNR/MS-SSIM with equal bpp and similar\nspeeds.

To this end, we\npropose VoteSplat, a novel 3D scene understanding framework that integrates\nHough voting with 3DGS. Specifically, Segment Anything Model (SAM) is utilized\nfor instance segmentation, extracting objects, and generating 2D vote maps. We\nthen embed spatial offset vectors into Gaussian primitives. These offsets\nconstruct 3D spatial votes by associating them with 2D image votes, while depth\ndistortion constraints refine localization along the depth axis. For\nopen-vocabulary object localization, VoteSplat maps 2D image semantics to 3D\npoint clouds via voting points, reducing training costs associated with\nhigh-dimensional CLIP features while preserving semantic unambiguity. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate effectiveness of VoteSplat in open-vocabulary 3D\ninstance localization, 3D point cloud understanding, click-based 3D object\nlocalization, hierarchical segmentation, and ablation studies.

However, existing reasoning benchmarks focus on text-only\nreasoning, or employ multimodal questions that can be answered by directly\nretrieving information from a non-text modality. Thus, complex reasoning\nremains poorly understood in multimodal domains. Here, we present MARBLE, a\nchallenging multimodal reasoning benchmark that is designed to scrutinize\nmultimodal language models (MLLMs) in their ability to carefully reason\nstep-by-step through complex multimodal problems and environments. MARBLE is\ncomposed of two highly challenging tasks, M-Portal and M-Cube, that require the\ncrafting and understanding of multistep plans under spatial, visual, and\nphysical constraints. We find that current MLLMs perform poorly on MARBLE --\nall the 12 advanced models obtain near-random performance on M-Portal and 0%\naccuracy on M-Cube. Only in simplified subtasks some models outperform the\nrandom baseline, indicating that complex reasoning is still a challenge for\nexisting MLLMs. Moreover, we show that perception remains a bottleneck, where\nMLLMs occasionally fail to extract information from the visual inputs. By\nshedding a light on the limitations of MLLMs, we hope that MARBLE will spur the\ndevelopment of the next generation of models with the ability to reason and\nplan across many, multimodal reasoning steps."}

This benchmark is based on\nrich multimodal interaction data generated by the interaction environment SoMi,\ncovering diverse crafting goals and social relationships. Our framework\nsupports multi-level evaluation: (1) first-person evaluation provides\nmultimodal (visual, dialogue, action, etc.) input from a first-person\nperspective during a task for real-time state inference, (2) third-person\nevaluation provides complete third-person perspective video and text records\nafter a task for goal and behavior inference. This evaluation method allows for\na more comprehensive examination of a model's ToM capabilities from both the\nsubjective immediate experience and the objective global observation. We\nconstructed a challenging dataset containing 35 third-person perspective\nvideos, 363 first-person perspective images, and 1225 expert-annotated\nmultiple-choice questions (three options).

To fill this gap, we\nintroduce MMReason, a new benchmark designed to precisely and comprehensively\nevaluate MLLM long-chain reasoning capability with diverse, open-ended,\nchallenging questions. First, we curate challenging questions requiring\nmulti-step reasoning from various fields (i.e., 6 disciplines) and multiple\ndifficulty levels (i.e., from pre-university to university, and from\nfoundational to competition tiers).
