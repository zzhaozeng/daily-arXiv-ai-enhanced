Using the Rabbit-Duck illusion, we illustrate how\nperspective-dependent readings of agent behavior can create epistemic\ninstability. To address this, we introduce the Misalignment Mosaic, a\ndiagnostic framework for diagnosing meaning-level misalignment in MAS. It\ncomprises four components: 1. Terminological Inconsistency, 2. Concept-to-Code\nDecay, 3. Morality as Cooperation, and 4. Interpretive Ambiguity. The Mosaic\nenables researchers to examine how misalignment arises not only through policy\nor reward structures but also through language, framing, and design\nassumptions. While this paper focuses on the specific ambiguity between\ncoordination and cooperation, the Mosaic generalizes to other overloaded\nconcepts in MAS, such as alignment, autonomy, and trust. Rather than define\ncooperation once and for all, we offer a framework to diagnose meaning itself\nas a source of misalignment."}

To analyze the variability of loss\nfunction performance across synthesizers, we implemented a mix of four novel\nand established differentiable loss functions, and paired them with\ndifferentiable subtractive, additive, and AM synthesizers.

A common limitation in\nexisting vision-based automatic pest counting research is that models are\ntypically evaluated on datasets with ground truth but deployed in real-world\nscenarios without assessing the reliability of counting results due to the lack\nof ground truth. To this end, this paper proposed a method for comprehensively\nevaluating pest counting confidence in the image, based on information related\nto counting results and external environmental conditions. First, a pest\ndetection network is used for pest detection and counting, extracting counting\nresult-related information. Then, the pest images undergo image quality\nassessment, image complexity assessment, and pest distribution uniformity\nassessment. And the changes in image clarity caused by stirring during image\nacquisition are quantified by calculating the average gradient magnitude.\nNotably, we designed a hypothesis-driven multi-factor sensitivity analysis\nmethod to select the optimal image quality assessment and image complexity\nassessment methods. And we proposed an adaptive DBSCAN clustering algorithm for\npest distribution uniformity assessment. Finally, the obtained information\nrelated to counting results and external environmental conditions is input into\na regression model for prediction, resulting in the final pest counting\nconfidence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study dedicated to\ncomprehensively evaluating counting confidence in counting tasks, and\nquantifying the relationship between influencing factors and counting\nconfidence through a model.

To address this limitation, this paper introduces MGPRL, a novel\ndistributed framework for multi-robot relative localization using convex-hull\nof multiple Wi-Fi access points (AP). To accomplish this, we employ\nco-regionalized multi-output Gaussian Processes for efficient Radio Signal\nStrength Indicator (RSSI) field prediction and perform uncertainty-aware\nmulti-AP localization, which is further coupled with weighted convex hull-based\nalignment for robust relative pose estimation. Each robot predicts the RSSI\nfield of the environment by an online scan of APs in its environment, which are\nutilized for position estimation of multiple APs. To perform relative\nlocalization, each robot aligns the convex hull of its predicted AP locations\nwith that of the neighbor robots.

In this work, we propose a\ntraining-free mechanism for DDP frameworks, endowing them with DA capabilities.\nOur motivation arises from the observation that the exposure bias (e.g., noise\nstatistics bias) in diffusion brings domain shift, and different domains in\nconditions of DDP models can also be effectively captured by the noise\nprediction statistics.

Traditional state-by-state\nassessment methods, such as state enumeration (SE) and Monte Carlo simulation\n(MCS) methods, have encountered performance bottlenecks in terms of efficiency\nand accuracy. In this paper, the Boolean lattice representation theory of the\nstate space was studied, and a dichotomy method was proposed to efficiently\npartition the state space into some disjoint sub-lattices with a relatively\nsmall number of optimal power flow (OPF) operations. Based on lattice\npartition, the reliability indices of the entire space can be calculated\nlattice-by-lattice. In addition, alone with the partitioning procedure, the\ncalculated loss of load probability (LOLP) monotonically increases and rapidly\ntends to the analytic value with the designated error bound. Moreover, we\ndesigned a customized Monte Carlo sampling method in lattices of interest to\ncompute expected energy not supply (EENS). The experiments are conducted on the\nRBTS and RTS-79 systems.

In a simulated P2P\nmicrogrid with multiple sellers and buyers, the LLM acts as a real-time\nfairness critic, evaluating each trading episode using two metrics:\nFairness-To-Buyer (FTB) and Fairness-Between-Sellers (FBS). These fairness\nscores are integrated into agent rewards through scheduled\n{\\lambda}-coefficients, forming an adaptive LLM-guided reward shaping loop that\nreplaces brittle, rule-based fairness constraints.

We formulate the LQ problem as a nonconvex\noptimization problem and conduct a rigorous analysis of its dual structure. By\nexploiting the inherent convexity of the dual problem and analyzing the KKT\nconditions, we derive an explicit relationship between the optimal dual\nsolution and the parameters of the associated Q-function in time-varying case.\nThis theoretical insight supports the development of a novel, sample-efficient,\nnon-iterative semidefinite programming (SDP) algorithm that directly computes\nthe optimal sequence of feedback gains from an ensemble of input-state data\nsequences without model identification. The resulting convex, data-dependent\nframework provides global optimality guarantees for completely unknown LTV\nsystems.

While the common time-varying Doppler shift can be compensated\nrelative to a reference point, the residual differential Doppler across users\nwithin the coverage cell remains a significant challenge, causing severe\nintercarrier interference. This paper presents a generalized analytical\nframework for characterizing both the Doppler shift magnitude and the\ndifferential Doppler in LEO systems. Unlike prior works limited by flat-Earth\nassumptions or specific orbital configurations, our model incorporates Earth's\ncurvature and supports arbitrary elevation angles. Using spherical geometry, we\nderive closed-form expressions for Doppler shift based on the central angle\nbetween the satellite and ground users.

Such scenarios occur when the\nobject undergoes major occlusions, or if the dataset is collected using\nmeasurements from multiple sensors asynchronously. In these scenarios, methods\nthat rely on tracking point correspondences are not appropriate. We present an\nalternative approach based on a compact but effective representation where we\nrepresent the object as a collection of simple building blocks modeled as 3D\nGaussians. We parameterize the Gaussians with time-dependent rotations,\ntranslations, and scales that are shared across all time steps. With our\nrepresentation, part segmentation can be achieved by building correspondences\nbetween the observed points and the Gaussians. Moreover, the transformation of\neach point across time can be obtained by following the poses of the assigned\nGaussian (even when the point is not observed). Experiments show that our\nmethod outperforms existing methods that solely rely on finding point\ncorrespondences. Additionally, we extend existing datasets to emulate\nreal-world scenarios by considering viewpoint occlusions. We further\ndemonstrate that our method is more robust to missing points as compared to\nexisting approaches on these challenging datasets, even when some parts are\ncompletely occluded in some time-steps. Notably, our part segmentation\nperformance outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 13% on point clouds with\nocclusions."}

Existing approaches for multi-robot\nrelative localization often depend on costly or short-range sensors like\ncameras and LiDARs. Consequently, these approaches face challenges such as high\ncomputational overhead (e.g., map merging) and difficulties in disjoint\nenvironments. To address this limitation, this paper introduces MGPRL, a novel\ndistributed framework for multi-robot relative localization using convex-hull\nof multiple Wi-Fi access points (AP). To accomplish this, we employ\nco-regionalized multi-output Gaussian Processes for efficient Radio Signal\nStrength Indicator (RSSI) field prediction and perform uncertainty-aware\nmulti-AP localization, which is further coupled with weighted convex hull-based\nalignment for robust relative pose estimation. Each robot predicts the RSSI\nfield of the environment by an online scan of APs in its environment, which are\nutilized for position estimation of multiple APs. To perform relative\nlocalization, each robot aligns the convex hull of its predicted AP locations\nwith that of the neighbor robots. This approach is well-suited for devices with\nlimited computational resources and operates solely on widely available Wi-Fi\nRSSI measurements without necessitating any dedicated pre-calibration or\noffline fingerprinting. We rigorously evaluate the performance of the proposed\nMGPRL in ROS simulations and demonstrate it with real-world experiments,\ncomparing it against multiple state-of-the-art approaches.

In crowded\nenvironments, this assumption often falls short, as individuals may struggle to\nkeep pace, become obstructed, get distracted, or need to stop unexpectedly. As\na result, conventional robotic systems are often unable to provide effective\nescorting services due to their limited understanding of human movement\ndynamics. To address these challenges, an effective escorting robot must\ncontinuously detect and interpret human actions during the escorting process\nand adjust its movement accordingly. However, there is currently no existing\ndataset designed specifically for human action detection in the context of\nescorting. Given that escorting often occurs in crowded environments, where\nother individuals may enter the robot's camera view, the robot also needs to\nidentify the specific human it is escorting (the subject) before predicting\ntheir actions.

We introduce the Barycentric Weight Layer (BWLer), which models\nthe PDE solution through barycentric polynomial interpolation. A BWLer can be\nadded on top of an existing MLP (a BWLer-hat) or replace it completely\n(explicit BWLer), cleanly separating how we represent the solution from how we\ntake derivatives for the PDE loss. Using BWLer, we identify fundamental\nprecision limitations within the MLP: on a simple 1-D interpolation task, even\nMLPs with O(1e5) parameters stall around 1e-8 RMSE -- about eight orders above\nfloat64 machine precision -- before any PDE terms are added. In PDE learning,\nadding a BWLer lifts this ceiling and exposes a tradeoff between achievable\naccuracy and the conditioning of the PDE loss. For linear PDEs we fully\ncharacterize this tradeoff with an explicit error decomposition and navigate it\nduring training with spectral derivatives and preconditioning. Across five\nbenchmark PDEs, adding a BWLer on top of an MLP improves RMSE by up to 30x for\nconvection, 10x for reaction, and 1800x for wave equations while remaining\ncompatible with first-order optimizers. Replacing the MLP entirely lets an\nexplicit BWLer reach near-machine-precision on convection, reaction, and wave\nproblems (up to 10 billion times better than prior results) and match the\nperformance of standard PINNs on stiff Burgers' and irregular-geometry Poisson\nproblems.

This brings about a problem that, when building a world\nmodel, even subtle shifts in policy or environment states can alter the very\nobserved causal mechanisms. In this work, we introduce the \\textbf{Meta-Causal\nGraph} as world models, a minimal unified representation that efficiently\nencodes the transformation rules governing how causal structures shift across\ndifferent latent world states.

NCAs display striking emergent behaviors including\nself-regeneration, generalization and robustness to unseen situations, and\nspontaneous motion. Despite their success in texture synthesis and\nmorphogenesis, NCAs remain largely confined to low-resolution grids. This\nlimitation stems from (1) training time and memory requirements that grow\nquadratically with grid size, (2) the strictly local propagation of information\nwhich impedes long-range cell communication, and (3) the heavy compute demands\nof real-time inference at high resolution. In this work, we overcome this\nlimitation by pairing NCA with a tiny, shared implicit decoder, inspired by\nrecent advances in implicit neural representations. Following NCA evolution on\na coarse grid, a lightweight decoder renders output images at arbitrary\nresolution. We also propose novel loss functions for both morphogenesis and\ntexture synthesis tasks, specifically tailored for high-resolution output with\nminimal memory and computation overhead. Combining our proposed architecture\nand loss functions brings substantial improvement in quality, efficiency, and\nperformance.

Second, we demonstrate that prior solutions for hidden\nmediation are brittle in finite sample settings, limiting their practical\nutility. To address these gaps, we propose Bivariate Denoising Diffusion (BiDD)\nfor causal discovery, a method designed to handle latent noise introduced by\nunmeasured mediators.

The second stage, Heterogeneous Contrastive\nFine-tuning, leverages diverse, semantically rich multimodal data beyond simple\nimage-caption pairs to enhance generalization and alignment. Our method\naddresses the stated limitations by introducing bidirectional attention through\ncontinual pre-training, scaling effectively with massive unlabeled datasets via\njoint reconstruction objectives, and utilizing diverse multimodal data for\nenhanced representation robustness. Experiments demonstrate that MoCa\nconsistently improves performance across MMEB and ViDoRe-v2 benchmarks,\nachieving new state-of-the-art results, and exhibits strong scalability with\nboth model size and training data on MMEB."}

To further enhance\ngeneralizability, we incorporate domain-adversarial training with a forgery\ndiscriminator.

SATs can explain any classifier for which a form of\nsaliency map can be produced, using segmentation maps that provide named\nsegments. SATs bridge the gap between oversimplified global summaries and\noverly detailed local explanations, offering a practical tool for analysing and\ndebugging image classifiers."}

However, such strategies achieve limited improvements due to\nthe poor understanding of the impact of learning directions among networks\nacross different iterations. In this paper, we propose a novel competitive\ndistillation strategy that allows each network in a group to potentially act as\na teacher based on its performance, enhancing the overall learning performance.\nCompetitive distillation organizes a group of networks to perform a shared task\nand engage in competition, where competitive optimization is proposed to\nimprove the parameter updating process.

Conventional object\ndetection approaches classify objects into known classes, which limits the AV's\nability to detect and appropriately respond to Out-of-Distribution (OOD)\nobjects. This problem is a significant safety concern since the AV may fail to\ndetect objects or misclassify them, which can potentially lead to hazardous\nsituations such as accidents. Consequently, we propose a novel object detection\napproach that shifts the emphasis from conventional class-based classification\nto object harmfulness determination. Instead of object detection by their\nspecific class, our method identifies them as either 'harmful' or 'harmless'\nbased on whether they pose a danger to the AV.

The aim of TAMP is to restore a damaged target image\nby leveraging the complementary information from a reference image, where both\nimages captured the same scene but with a significant time gap in between,\ni.e., time-variant images. Different from conventional reference-guided image\ninpainting, the reference image under TAMP setup presents significant content\ndistinction to the target image and potentially also suffers from damages. Such\nan application frequently happens in our daily lives to restore a damaged image\nby referring to another reference image, where there is no guarantee of the\nreference image's source and quality. In particular, our study finds that even\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) reference-guided image inpainting methods fail to\nachieve plausible results due to the chaotic image complementation.

However,\nmost current escorting robots primarily rely on navigation-focused strategies,\nassuming that the person being escorted will follow without issue. In crowded\nenvironments, this assumption often falls short, as individuals may struggle to\nkeep pace, become obstructed, get distracted, or need to stop unexpectedly. As\na result, conventional robotic systems are often unable to provide effective\nescorting services due to their limited understanding of human movement\ndynamics. To address these challenges, an effective escorting robot must\ncontinuously detect and interpret human actions during the escorting process\nand adjust its movement accordingly. However, there is currently no existing\ndataset designed specifically for human action detection in the context of\nescorting. Given that escorting often occurs in crowded environments, where\nother individuals may enter the robot's camera view, the robot also needs to\nidentify the specific human it is escorting (the subject) before predicting\ntheir actions. Since no existing model performs both person re-identification\nand action prediction in real-time, we propose a novel neural network\narchitecture that can accomplish both tasks.

Remarkably, CaPT can be\nused as a plugin to mitigate the BNT problem for existing unconditional PT\nschemes. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets show that CaPT consistently\nimproves the performance of five strong unconditional PT baselines with\nnegligible additional computational cost. Additionally, by integrating CaPT\nwith our recently proposed DePT framework, we devise a new conditional PT\napproach, termed DeCaPT, which outperforms the H ACC of the state-of-the-art\nconditional PT scheme by 3.49%, averaged over the 11 datasets.

The proposed method, which we call Simultaneously Guaranteed Kernel\nInterpolation (SGKI), is an extension and refinement of a recently developed\nkernel method. An advantage of SGKI is that it not only estimates the missing\npixels, but also builds non-asymptotic confidence bands for the unobserved\nvalues, which are simultaneously guaranteed for all missing pixels. We also\nshow how to compute these bands efficiently using Schur complements, we discuss\na generalization to vector-valued functions, and we present a series of\nnumerical experiments on various datasets containing synthetically generated\nand benchmark images, as well."}

However, with\nmore bits involved, the associated memory and computation demands escalate to\nthe point where the performance improvements become disproportionate. Based on\nthe insight that different layers demonstrate different importance and extra\nbits could be wasted and interfering, this paper presents an adaptive bit\nallocation strategy for direct-trained SNNs, achieving fine-grained layer-wise\nallocation of memory and computation resources. Thus, SNN's efficiency and\naccuracy can be improved. Specifically, we parametrize the temporal lengths and\nthe bit widths of weights and spikes, and make them learnable and controllable\nthrough gradients. To address the challenges caused by changeable bit widths\nand temporal lengths, we propose the refined spiking neuron, which can handle\ndifferent temporal lengths, enable the derivation of gradients for temporal\nlengths, and suit spike quantization better. In addition, we theoretically\nformulate the step-size mismatch problem of learnable bit widths, which may\nincur severe quantization errors to SNN, and accordingly propose the step-size\nrenewal mechanism to alleviate this issue. Experiments on various datasets,\nincluding the static CIFAR and ImageNet and the dynamic CIFAR-DVS and\nDVS-GESTURE, demonstrate that our methods can reduce the overall memory and\ncomputation cost while achieving higher accuracy.

However, when\nthese images are used to train a new model, watermarking can only enable\ndetection if the watermark persists through training and remains identifiable\nin the outputs of the newly trained model - a property known as radioactivity.\nWe analyze the radioactivity of watermarks in images generated by diffusion\nmodels (DMs) and image autoregressive models (IARs). We find that existing\nwatermarking methods for DMs fail to retain radioactivity, as watermarks are\neither erased during encoding into the latent space or lost in the\nnoising-denoising process (during the training in the latent space).

Unlike prior studies focused solely on\nCLIP, we extend the evaluation to SigLIP--a model trained with a Sigmoid\nloss--and include training-time tuning methods such as CoOp, MaPLe, and TeCoA\nto assess generality. Beyond classification accuracy, TTA-VLM incorporates\nvarious evaluation metrics, including robustness, calibration,\nout-of-distribution detection, and stability, enabling a more holistic\nassessment of TTA methods.
