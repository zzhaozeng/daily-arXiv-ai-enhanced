Recent neural methods have mainly relied on per-scene optimization,\nsometimes extended to handle changes in camera or geometry. Efforts toward\ncross-scene generalization have largely stayed in 2D screen space, such as\nneural denoising or G-buffer based GI prediction, which often suffer from view\ninconsistency and limited spatial understanding. We propose a generalizable 3D\nlight transport embedding that approximates global illumination directly from\n3D scene configurations, without using rasterized or path-traced cues. Each\nscene is represented as a point cloud with geometric and material features. A\nscalable transformer models global point-to-point interactions to encode these\nfeatures into neural primitives. At render time, each query point retrieves\nnearby primitives via nearest-neighbor search and aggregates their latent\nfeatures through cross-attention to predict the desired rendering quantity. We\ndemonstrate results on diffuse global illumination prediction across diverse\nindoor scenes with varying layouts, geometry, and materials. The embedding\ntrained for irradiance estimation can be quickly adapted to new rendering tasks\nwith limited fine-tuning. We also present preliminary results for\nspatial-directional radiance field estimation for glossy materials and show how\nthe normalized field can accelerate unbiased path guiding.

Recently, a\nsignificant amount of advances have been made on post-training and inference\ntechniques to mitigate these challenges. However, it is widely agreed that\nunsafe and hallucinations of LLMs intrinsically originate from pre-training,\ninvolving pre-training data and the next-token prediction learning mechanism.\nIn this paper, we focus on enhancing pre-training data to improve the\ntrustworthiness and safety of LLMs. Since the data is vast, it's almost\nimpossible to entirely purge the data of factual errors, logical\ninconsistencies, or distributional biases. Moreover, the pre-training data lack\ngrounding in real-world knowledge. Each piece of data is treated as a sequence\nof tokens rather than as a representation of a part of the world. To overcome\nthese issues, we propose approaches to enhancing our pre-training data with its\ncontext in the world and increasing a substantial amount of data reflecting\nindustrial scenarios. We argue that most source data are created by the authors\nfor specific purposes in a certain spatial-temporal context. They have played a\nrole in the real world. By incorporating related world context information, we\naim to better anchor pre-training data within real-world scenarios, thereby\nreducing uncertainty in model training and enhancing the model's safety and\ntrustworthiness. We refer to our Data with World Context as DWC. We continue\npre-training an earlier checkpoint of JT-35B-Base with 1.5 trillion of DWC\ntokens.

However, the low quality of pseudo-labels and the insufficient\nexploitation of 3D geometric priors jointly create significant technical\nbottlenecks in developing high-performance 3D WSSS models. In this paper, we\npropose a simple yet effective 3D weakly supervised semantic segmentation\nmethod that integrates 3D geometric priors into a class-aware guidance\nmechanism to generate high-fidelity pseudo labels. Concretely, our designed\nmethodology first employs Class-Aware Label Refinement module to generate more\nbalanced and accurate pseudo labels for semantic categrories. This initial\nrefinement stage focuses on enhancing label quality through category-specific\noptimization. Subsequently, the Geometry-Aware Label Refinement component is\ndeveloped, which strategically integrates implicit 3D geometric constraints to\neffectively filter out low-confidence pseudo labels that fail to comply with\ngeometric plausibility. Moreover, to address the challenge of extensive\nunlabeled regions, we propose a Label Update strategy that integrates\nSelf-Training to propagate labels into these areas. This iterative process\ncontinuously enhances pseudo-label quality while expanding label coverage,\nultimately fostering the development of high-performance 3D WSSS models.\nComprehensive experimental validation reveals that our proposed methodology\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on both ScanNet and S3DIS benchmarks\nwhile demonstrating remarkable generalization capability in unsupervised\nsettings, maintaining competitive accuracy through its robust design."}

We utilize a dataset\nincluding four demographic subgroups: black female, black male, white female,\nand white male.

Fairness is quantitatively measured using a metric designed to\nquantify fairness in segmentation performance. Additionally, linear mixed\nmodels analyze the impact of demographic variables on segmentation accuracy and\nderived volumes.

The leading paradigm is to express hidden states as a\nsparse linear combination of basis vectors, called features.

Specifically, we extract rule-based\ndescriptions of SAE features trained on the outputs of attention layers. While\nprior work treats the attention layers as an opaque box, we describe how it may\nnaturally be expressed in terms of interactions between input and output\nfeatures, of which we study three types: (1) skip-gram rules of the form\n\"[Canadian city]... speaks --> English\", (2) absence rules of the form\n\"[Montreal]... speaks -/-> English,\" and (3) counting rules that toggle only\nwhen the count of a word exceeds a certain value or the count of another word.\nAbsence and counting rules are not readily discovered by inspection of\nexemplars, where manual and automatic descriptions often identify misleading or\nincomplete explanations. We then describe a simple approach to extract these\ntypes of rules automatically from a transformer, and apply it to GPT-2 small.\nWe find that a majority of features may be described well with around 100\nskip-gram rules, though absence rules are abundant even as early as the first\nlayer (in over a fourth of features).

We\npresent Vision Language Safety Understanding (VLSU), a comprehensive framework\nto systematically evaluate multimodal safety through fine-grained severity\nclassification and combinatorial analysis across 17 distinct safety patterns.\nUsing a multi-stage pipeline with real-world images and human annotation, we\nconstruct a large-scale benchmark of 8,187 samples spanning 15 harm categories.\nOur evaluation of eleven state-of-the-art models reveals systematic joint\nunderstanding failures: while models achieve 90%-plus accuracy on clear\nunimodal safety signals, performance degrades substantially to 20-55% when\njoint image-text reasoning is required to determine the safety label. Most\ncritically, 34% of errors in joint image-text safety classification occur\ndespite correct classification of the individual modalities, further\ndemonstrating absent compositional reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we\nfind that models struggle to balance refusing unsafe content while still\nresponding to borderline cases that deserve engagement. For example, we find\nthat instruction framing can reduce the over-blocking rate on borderline\ncontent from 62.4% to 10.4% in Gemini-1.5, but only at the cost of\nunder-refusing on unsafe content with refusal rate dropping from 90.8% to\n53.9%. Overall, our framework exposes weaknesses in joint image-text\nunderstanding and alignment gaps in current models, and provides a critical\ntest bed to enable the next milestones in research on robust vision-language\nsafety."}

To address these\ndistinct challenges, we propose MENTOR, a framework that synergistically\ncombines RL with teacher-guided distillation. Instead of simple imitation,\nMENTOR employs an RL-based process to learn a more generalizable policy through\nexploration. In addition, to solve the problem of reward sparsity, it uses a\nteacher's reference trajectory to construct a dense, composite teacher-guided\nreward that provides fine-grained guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat MENTOR significantly improves the cross-domain generalization and\nstrategic competence of SLMs compared to both SFT and standard sparse-reward RL\nbaselines."}

In SLT, meaning depends on precise\ngrounding in video, and gloss-free models are especially vulnerable because\nthey map continuous signer movements directly into natural language without\nintermediate gloss supervision that serves as alignment. We argue that\nhallucinations arise when models rely on language priors rather than visual\ninput. To capture this, we propose a token-level reliability measure that\nquantifies how much the decoder uses visual information. Our method combines\nfeature-based sensitivity, which measures internal changes when video is\nmasked, with counterfactual signals, which capture probability differences\nbetween clean and altered video inputs. These signals are aggregated into a\nsentence-level reliability score, providing a compact and interpretable measure\nof visual grounding. We evaluate the proposed measure on two SLT benchmarks\n(PHOENIX-2014T and CSL-Daily) with both gloss-based and gloss-free models.

However, existing medical MLLMs rely\nsolely on internal knowledge during reasoning, leading to hallucinated\nreasoning and factual inaccuracies when encountering cases beyond their\ntraining scope. Although recent Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\nmethods elicit the medical model's proactive retrieval ability during\nreasoning, they are confined to unimodal LLMs, neglecting the crucial visual\ninformation during reasoning and retrieval. Consequently, we propose the first\nMultimodal Medical Reasoning-with-Retrieval framework, Med-RwR, which actively\nretrieves external knowledge by querying observed symptoms or domain-specific\nmedical concepts during reasoning. Specifically, we design a two-stage\nreinforcement learning strategy with tailored rewards that stimulate the model\nto leverage both visual diagnostic findings and textual clinical information\nfor effective retrieval. Building on this foundation, we further propose a\nConfidence-Driven Image Re-retrieval (CDIR) method for test-time scaling when\nlow prediction confidence is detected.

The feature vectors were used to train and evaluate a suite of\nclassifiers (e.g. XGBoost, MLP, Logistic Regression, etc.). Results:\nStatistical significance of performance differences between classifiers was\nevaluated using paired Welch's t-test. The method proved highly effective in\ndistinguishing AD patients from healthy controls. The Multi-Layer Perceptron\n(MLP) and Logistic Regression classifiers outperformed all others, achieving an\naccuracy and F$_1$ Score of 98.62%. Conclusions: This study confirms that the\nentropy of conformally-derived geometric features provides a powerful and\nrobust metric for cortical morphometry. The high classification accuracy\nunderscores the method's potential to enhance the study and diagnosis of\nAlzheimer's disease, offering a straightforward yet powerful tool for clinical\nresearch applications."}

In a\nlarge-scale comparison of 4,068 LLM agents with 1,159 adults across 796,100\ndecisions, LLMs used emotion to guide punishment, sometimes even more strongly\nthan humans did: Unfairness elicited stronger negative emotion that led to more\npunishment; punishing unfairness produced more positive emotion than accepting;\nand critically, prompting self-reports of emotion causally increased\npunishment. However, mechanisms diverged: LLMs prioritized emotion over cost,\nenforcing norms in an almost all-or-none manner with reduced cost sensitivity,\nwhereas humans balanced fairness and cost. Notably, reasoning models (o3-mini,\nDeepSeek-R1) were more cost-sensitive and closer to human behavior than\nfoundation models (GPT-3.5, DeepSeek-V3), yet remained heavily emotion-driven.\nThese findings provide the first causal evidence of emotion-guided moral\ndecisions in LLMs and reveal deficits in cost calibration and nuanced fairness\njudgements, reminiscent of early-stage human responses.

However, it is widely agreed that\nunsafe and hallucinations of LLMs intrinsically originate from pre-training,\ninvolving pre-training data and the next-token prediction learning mechanism.\nIn this paper, we focus on enhancing pre-training data to improve the\ntrustworthiness and safety of LLMs. Since the data is vast, it's almost\nimpossible to entirely purge the data of factual errors, logical\ninconsistencies, or distributional biases. Moreover, the pre-training data lack\ngrounding in real-world knowledge. Each piece of data is treated as a sequence\nof tokens rather than as a representation of a part of the world.

In this paper, we trace the intermediate representations\nof several open-weight models during inference and reveal a structured and\nnuanced use of depth. Specifically, we propose a \"Guess-then-Refine\" framework\nthat explains how LLMs internally structure their computations to make\npredictions. We first show that the top-ranked predictions in early LLM layers\nare composed primarily of high-frequency tokens, which act as statistical\nguesses proposed by the model early on due to the lack of appropriate\ncontextual information. As contextual information develops deeper into the\nmodel, these initial guesses get refined into contextually appropriate tokens.\nEven high-frequency token predictions from early layers get refined >70% of the\ntime, indicating that correct token prediction is not \"one-and-done\". We then\ngo beyond frequency-based prediction to examine the dynamic usage of layer\ndepth across three case studies. (i) Part-of-speech analysis shows that\nfunction words are, on average, the earliest to be predicted correctly. (ii)\nFact recall task analysis shows that, in a multi-token answer, the first token\nrequires more computational depth than the rest. (iii) Multiple-choice task\nanalysis shows that the model identifies the format of the response within the\nfirst half of the layers, but finalizes its response only toward the end.\nTogether, our results provide a detailed view of depth usage in LLMs, shedding\nlight on the layer-by-layer computations that underlie successful predictions\nand providing insights for future works to improve computational efficiency in\ntransformer-based models."}

We also perform in-context\nlearning to verify the quality of the generated knowledge and benchmark the\nperformance of fine-tuned SLMs with generated knowledge against widely used\nLLMs. The results show that the fine-tuned SLMs with CoT reasoning outperform\nthe base models by a significant margin, narrowing the gap to their LLM\ncounterparts.

Spatially and temporally\nsymmetric designs reduce biases and enable systematic evaluation of models'\nreasoning about self-motion and object motion. Our evaluation of 14 VLMs and\nexpert models reveals key limitations: models often conflate observer and\nobject motion, exhibit semantic biases, and fail to accurately infer relative\nrelationships in dynamic scenarios.

Efforts toward\ncross-scene generalization have largely stayed in 2D screen space, such as\nneural denoising or G-buffer based GI prediction, which often suffer from view\ninconsistency and limited spatial understanding. We propose a generalizable 3D\nlight transport embedding that approximates global illumination directly from\n3D scene configurations, without using rasterized or path-traced cues. Each\nscene is represented as a point cloud with geometric and material features. A\nscalable transformer models global point-to-point interactions to encode these\nfeatures into neural primitives.

Although\nthis randomness is sometimes seen as a limitation, it also introduces a wider\nperceptual quality range, which can be exploited to improve Real-ISR\nperformance. To this end, we introduce Direct Perceptual Preference\nOptimization for Real-ISR (DP$^2$O-SR), a framework that aligns generative\nmodels with perceptual preferences without requiring costly human annotations.\nWe construct a hybrid reward signal by combining full-reference and\nno-reference image quality assessment (IQA) models trained on large-scale human\npreference datasets. This reward encourages both structural fidelity and\nnatural appearance. To better utilize perceptual diversity, we move beyond the\nstandard best-vs-worst selection and construct multiple preference pairs from\noutputs of the same model. Our analysis reveals that the optimal selection\nratio depends on model capacity: smaller models benefit from broader coverage,\nwhile larger models respond better to stronger contrast in supervision.\nFurthermore, we propose hierarchical preference optimization, which adaptively\nweights training pairs based on intra-group reward gaps and inter-group\ndiversity, enabling more efficient and stable learning.

Specifically, we propose a \"Guess-then-Refine\" framework\nthat explains how LLMs internally structure their computations to make\npredictions. We first show that the top-ranked predictions in early LLM layers\nare composed primarily of high-frequency tokens, which act as statistical\nguesses proposed by the model early on due to the lack of appropriate\ncontextual information.
