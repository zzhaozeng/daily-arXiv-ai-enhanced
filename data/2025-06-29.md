### [1] [OTSurv: A Novel Multiple Instance Learning Framework for Survival Prediction with Heterogeneity-aware Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20741)
*Qin Ren,Yifan Wang,Ruogu Fang,Haibin Ling,Chenyu You*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OTSurv是一种基于最优传输的多实例学习框架，通过全局和局部约束改进WSI生存预测，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MIL方法未能明确捕捉WSI中的病理异质性，包括全局的长尾形态分布和局部的瓦片级预测不确定性。

Method: OTSurv将生存预测建模为带有全局长尾约束和局部不确定性约束的最优传输问题，并通过矩阵缩放算法高效求解。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，OTSurv平均C-index提升3.6%，并在对数秩检验中表现出统计显著性。

Conclusion: OTSurv是一种高效且可解释的生存预测工具，适用于数字病理学。

Abstract: Survival prediction using whole slide images (WSIs) can be formulated as a
multiple instance learning (MIL) problem. However, existing MIL methods often
fail to explicitly capture pathological heterogeneity within WSIs, both
globally -- through long-tailed morphological distributions, and locally
through -- tile-level prediction uncertainty. Optimal transport (OT) provides a
principled way of modeling such heterogeneity by incorporating marginal
distribution constraints. Building on this insight, we propose OTSurv, a novel
MIL framework from an optimal transport perspective. Specifically, OTSurv
formulates survival predictions as a heterogeneity-aware OT problem with two
constraints: (1) global long-tail constraint that models prior morphological
distributions to avert both mode collapse and excessive uniformity by
regulating transport mass allocation, and (2) local uncertainty-aware
constraint that prioritizes high-confidence patches while suppressing noise by
progressively raising the total transport mass. We then recast the initial OT
problem, augmented by these constraints, into an unbalanced OT formulation that
can be solved with an efficient, hardware-friendly matrix scaling algorithm.
Empirically, OTSurv sets new state-of-the-art results across six popular
benchmarks, achieving an absolute 3.6% improvement in average C-index. In
addition, OTSurv achieves statistical significance in log-rank tests and offers
high interpretability, making it a powerful tool for survival prediction in
digital pathology. Our codes are available at

### [2] [StereoDiff: Stereo-Diffusion Synergy for Video Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20756)
*Haodong Li,Chen Wang,Jiahui Lei,Kostas Daniilidis,Lingjie Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StereoDiff结合立体匹配和视频深度扩散，通过两阶段方法提升视频深度估计的一致性和准确性，特别针对静态和动态区域的不同需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频深度估计并非图像深度估计的简单扩展，静态和动态区域的时序一致性需求不同，需要不同的方法处理。

Method: 提出StereoDiff，第一阶段用立体匹配处理静态区域，第二阶段用视频深度扩散处理动态区域，两者互补。

Result: 在零样本、真实世界动态视频深度基准测试中，StereoDiff表现最优，一致性和准确性显著提升。

Conclusion: StereoDiff通过结合立体匹配和视频深度扩散，有效解决了视频深度估计中的静态和动态区域一致性问题。

Abstract: Recent video depth estimation methods achieve great performance by following
the paradigm of image depth estimation, i.e., typically fine-tuning pre-trained
video diffusion models with massive data. However, we argue that video depth
estimation is not a naive extension of image depth estimation. The temporal
consistency requirements for dynamic and static regions in videos are
fundamentally different. Consistent video depth in static regions, typically
backgrounds, can be more effectively achieved via stereo matching across all
frames, which provides much stronger global 3D cues. While the consistency for
dynamic regions still should be learned from large-scale video depth data to
ensure smooth transitions, due to the violation of triangulation constraints.
Based on these insights, we introduce StereoDiff, a two-stage video depth
estimator that synergizes stereo matching for mainly the static areas with
video depth diffusion for maintaining consistent depth transitions in dynamic
areas. We mathematically demonstrate how stereo matching and video depth
diffusion offer complementary strengths through frequency domain analysis,
highlighting the effectiveness of their synergy in capturing the advantages of
both. Experimental results on zero-shot, real-world, dynamic video depth
benchmarks, both indoor and outdoor, demonstrate StereoDiff's SoTA performance,
showcasing its superior consistency and accuracy in video depth estimation.

### [3] [ConViTac: Aligning Visual-Tactile Fusion with Contrastive Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20757)
*Zhiyuan Wu,Yongqiang Zhao,Shan Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ConViTac提出了一种视觉-触觉表示学习网络，通过对比表示增强特征融合的对齐性，显著提升了材料分类和抓取预测任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉和触觉是机器人感知和操作任务中的两种互补感官模态，但现有方法在模态融合时特征整合效果不佳。

Method: 提出ConViTac网络，采用对比嵌入条件（CEC）机制，通过自监督对比学习预训练的对比编码器，将视觉和触觉输入投影到统一的潜在嵌入中，并通过跨模态注意力进行特征融合。

Result: 实验表明，ConViTac在材料分类和抓取预测任务中比现有方法准确率提升高达12.0%。

Conclusion: ConViTac通过对比表示学习有效提升了视觉-触觉特征融合的性能，为机器人感知任务提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision and touch are two fundamental sensory modalities for robots, offering
complementary information that enhances perception and manipulation tasks.
Previous research has attempted to jointly learn visual-tactile representations
to extract more meaningful information. However, these approaches often rely on
direct combination, such as feature addition and concatenation, for modality
fusion, which tend to result in poor feature integration. In this paper, we
propose ConViTac, a visual-tactile representation learning network designed to
enhance the alignment of features during fusion using contrastive
representations. Our key contribution is a Contrastive Embedding Conditioning
(CEC) mechanism that leverages a contrastive encoder pretrained through
self-supervised contrastive learning to project visual and tactile inputs into
unified latent embeddings. These embeddings are used to couple visual-tactile
feature fusion through cross-modal attention, aiming at aligning the unified
representations and enhancing performance on downstream tasks. We conduct
extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of ConViTac in real world
over current state-of-the-art methods and the effectiveness of our proposed CEC
mechanism, which improves accuracy by up to 12.0% in material classification
and grasping prediction tasks.

### [4] [AI-Driven MRI-based Brain Tumour Segmentation Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20786)
*Connor Ludwig,Khashayar Namdar,Farzad Khalvati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文评估了多种可提示模型（如SAM、SAM 2、MedSAM、SAM-Med-3D和nnU-Net）在医学图像分割中的表现，发现SAM和SAM 2在精确边界框提示下表现优异，但nnU-Net仍是最佳选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏对不同可提示模型在医学数据集上的评估和比较，尤其是在不同提示质量下的表现。

Method: 使用多种模型（SAM、SAM 2、MedSAM、SAM-Med-3D和nnU-Net）在BraTS 2023数据集上进行零样本推理和微调，评估点和边界框提示的效果。

Result: SAM和SAM 2在精确边界框提示下Dice分数最高（0.894和0.893），但nnU-Net整体表现更优。微调后点提示性能显著提升，但仍不及边界框或nnU-Net。

Conclusion: nnU-Net仍是医学图像分割的最佳选择，但可提示模型在特定条件下表现优异，未来研究可进一步优化提示方法。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation has greatly aided medical diagnosis, with U-Net
based architectures and nnU-Net providing state-of-the-art performance. There
have been numerous general promptable models and medical variations introduced
in recent years, but there is currently a lack of evaluation and comparison of
these models across a variety of prompt qualities on a common medical dataset.
This research uses Segment Anything Model (SAM), Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM
2), MedSAM, SAM-Med-3D, and nnU-Net to obtain zero-shot inference on the BraTS
2023 adult glioma and pediatrics dataset across multiple prompt qualities for
both points and bounding boxes. Several of these models exhibit promising Dice
scores, particularly SAM and SAM 2 achieving scores of up to 0.894 and 0.893,
respectively when given extremely accurate bounding box prompts which exceeds
nnU-Net's segmentation performance. However, nnU-Net remains the dominant
medical image segmentation network due to the impracticality of providing
highly accurate prompts to the models. The model and prompt evaluation, as well
as the comparison, are extended through fine-tuning SAM, SAM 2, MedSAM, and
SAM-Med-3D on the pediatrics dataset. The improvements in point prompt
performance after fine-tuning are substantial and show promise for future
investigation, but are unable to achieve better segmentation than bounding
boxes or nnU-Net.

### [5] [How do Foundation Models Compare to Skeleton-Based Approaches for Gesture Recognition in Human-Robot Interaction?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20795)
*Stephanie Käs,Anton Burenko,Louis Markert,Onur Alp Culha,Dennis Mack,Timm Linder,Bastian Leibe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了如何利用视觉基础模型（VFMs）和视觉语言模型（VLMs）简化动态全身手势识别系统，比较了V-JEPA、Gemini Flash 2.0和HD-GCN的性能，并提出了NUGGET数据集用于评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在嘈杂环境中，手势是非人机通信的重要方式，传统深度学习依赖任务特定架构，而VFMs和VLMs的泛化能力可能简化系统。

Method: 比较V-JEPA、Gemini Flash 2.0和HD-GCN在动态全身手势识别中的表现，使用NUGGET数据集进行评估。

Result: HD-GCN表现最佳，V-JEPA接近，Gemini在零样本设置中表现不佳。

Conclusion: V-JEPA有望作为共享多任务模型简化系统，Gemini需进一步研究输入表示。

Abstract: Gestures enable non-verbal human-robot communication, especially in noisy
environments like agile production. Traditional deep learning-based gesture
recognition relies on task-specific architectures using images, videos, or
skeletal pose estimates as input. Meanwhile, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs)
and Vision Language Models (VLMs) with their strong generalization abilities
offer potential to reduce system complexity by replacing dedicated
task-specific modules. This study investigates adapting such models for
dynamic, full-body gesture recognition, comparing V-JEPA (a state-of-the-art
VFM), Gemini Flash 2.0 (a multimodal VLM), and HD-GCN (a top-performing
skeleton-based approach). We introduce NUGGET, a dataset tailored for
human-robot communication in intralogistics environments, to evaluate the
different gesture recognition approaches. In our experiments, HD-GCN achieves
best performance, but V-JEPA comes close with a simple, task-specific
classification head - thus paving a possible way towards reducing system
complexity, by using it as a shared multi-task model. In contrast, Gemini
struggles to differentiate gestures based solely on textual descriptions in the
zero-shot setting, highlighting the need of further research on suitable input
representations for gestures.

### [6] [Leveraging Vision-Language Models to Select Trustworthy Super-Resolution Samples Generated by Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20832)
*Cansu Korkmaz,Ahmet Murat Tekalp,Zafer Dogan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用视觉语言模型（VLM）从扩散模型生成的超分辨率（SR）图像中选择最可信样本的自动化框架，并通过混合指标（TWS）量化其可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决超分辨率问题中单一回归模型与多样性扩散模型之间的权衡问题，确保生成图像的语义正确性和视觉质量。

Method: 利用VLM（如BLIP-2、GPT-4o）进行结构化查询评估语义正确性、视觉质量和伪影，并设计TWS指标（结合CLIP嵌入、SSIM和小波分解）量化可靠性。

Result: TWS与人类偏好高度相关，VLM引导的选择能持续生成高TWS值的图像，优于传统指标（如PSNR、LPIPS）。

Conclusion: 该框架为生成SR领域提供了可扩展、通用的可信赖解决方案，设定了新的可信度基准。

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) is an ill-posed inverse problem with many feasible
solutions consistent with a given low-resolution image. On one hand, regressive
SR models aim to balance fidelity and perceptual quality to yield a single
solution, but this trade-off often introduces artifacts that create ambiguity
in information-critical applications such as recognizing digits or letters. On
the other hand, diffusion models generate a diverse set of SR images, but
selecting the most trustworthy solution from this set remains a challenge. This
paper introduces a robust, automated framework for identifying the most
trustworthy SR sample from a diffusion-generated set by leveraging the semantic
reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, VLMs
such as BLIP-2, GPT-4o, and their variants are prompted with structured queries
to assess semantic correctness, visual quality, and artifact presence. The
top-ranked SR candidates are then ensembled to yield a single trustworthy
output in a cost-effective manner. To rigorously assess the validity of
VLM-selected samples, we propose a novel Trustworthiness Score (TWS) a hybrid
metric that quantifies SR reliability based on three complementary components:
semantic similarity via CLIP embeddings, structural integrity using SSIM on
edge maps, and artifact sensitivity through multi-level wavelet decomposition.
We empirically show that TWS correlates strongly with human preference in both
ambiguous and natural images, and that VLM-guided selections consistently yield
high TWS values. Compared to conventional metrics like PSNR, LPIPS, which fail
to reflect information fidelity, our approach offers a principled, scalable,
and generalizable solution for navigating the uncertainty of the diffusion SR
space. By aligning outputs with human expectations and semantic correctness,
this work sets a new benchmark for trustworthiness in generative SR.

### [7] [FixCLR: Negative-Class Contrastive Learning for Semi-Supervised Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20841)
*Ha Min Son,Shahbaz Rezaei,Xin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FixCLR是一种半监督领域泛化方法，通过对比学习显式正则化领域不变表示，提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决半监督领域泛化中标签稀缺导致性能下降的问题，现有方法未显式正则化领域不变表示。

Method: 引入FixCLR，利用伪标签的类别信息和排斥项，适配对比学习以实现显式领域不变正则化。

Result: FixCLR显著提升性能，尤其在与其他半监督方法结合时，实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: FixCLR是一种高效的半监督领域泛化方法，适用于多领域数据集，并能与其他方法互补。

Abstract: Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) aims to solve the problem of
generalizing to out-of-distribution data when only a few labels are available.
Due to label scarcity, applying domain generalization methods often
underperform. Consequently, existing SSDG methods combine semi-supervised
learning methods with various regularization terms. However, these methods do
not explicitly regularize to learn domains invariant representations across all
domains, which is a key goal for domain generalization. To address this, we
introduce FixCLR. Inspired by success in self-supervised learning, we change
two crucial components to adapt contrastive learning for explicit domain
invariance regularization: utilization of class information from pseudo-labels
and using only a repelling term. FixCLR can also be added on top of most
existing SSDG and semi-supervised methods for complementary performance
improvements. Our research includes extensive experiments that have not been
previously explored in SSDG studies. These experiments include benchmarking
different improvements to semi-supervised methods, evaluating the performance
of pretrained versus non-pretrained models, and testing on datasets with many
domains. Overall, FixCLR proves to be an effective SSDG method, especially when
combined with other semi-supervised methods.

### [8] [Vector Contrastive Learning For Pixel-Wise Pretraining In Medical Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20850)
*Yuting He,Shuo Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为COVER的向量对比学习框架，解决了传统对比学习在像素级表示中的过分散问题，显著提升了医学视觉基础模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对比学习在像素级表示中因过度追求特征分散而导致过分散问题，破坏了像素级特征相关性。

Method: 提出向量对比学习（vector CL），将对比学习重新表述为向量回归问题，并通过COVER框架实现向量自学习、优化流一致性和粒度适应。

Result: 在8个任务、2个维度和4种模态的实验中，COVER显著提升了像素级自监督预训练性能。

Conclusion: COVER框架有效解决了像素级表示中的过分散问题，为医学视觉基础模型提供了更强的泛化能力。

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has become a cornerstone of self-supervised
pretraining (SSP) in foundation models, however, extending CL to pixel-wise
representation, crucial for medical vision, remains an open problem. Standard
CL formulates SSP as a binary optimization problem (binary CL) where the
excessive pursuit of feature dispersion leads to an over-dispersion problem,
breaking pixel-wise feature correlation thus disrupting the intra-class
distribution. Our vector CL reformulates CL as a vector regression problem,
enabling dispersion quantification in pixel-wise pretraining via modeling
feature distances in regressing displacement vectors. To implement this novel
paradigm, we propose the COntrast in VEctor Regression (COVER) framework. COVER
establishes an extendable vector-based self-learning, enforces a consistent
optimization flow from vector regression to distance modeling, and leverages a
vector pyramid architecture for granularity adaptation, thus preserving
pixel-wise feature correlations in SSP. Extensive experiments across 8 tasks,
spanning 2 dimensions and 4 modalities, show that COVER significantly improves
pixel-wise SSP, advancing generalizable medical visual foundation models.

### [9] [Enhancing Ambiguous Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition with Soft Label-based Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20867)
*Ryosuke Kawamura,Hideaki Hayashi,Shunsuke Otake,Noriko Takemura,Hajime Nagahara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIDAS是一种数据增强方法，通过软标签和视频帧的凸组合提升动态面部表情识别（DFER）性能，特别是在处理模糊表情时表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在实际应用中，准确识别模糊面部表情至关重要，但现有方法对此效果有限。

Method: MIDAS通过凸结合视频帧及其对应的软标签（多情感类别的概率）来增强训练数据，扩展了mixup方法。

Result: 在DFEW和FERV39k-Plus数据集上的实验表明，MIDAS训练模型优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MIDAS是一种简单高效的数据增强方法，显著提升了DFER任务中模糊表情的识别性能。

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) is a task that estimates
emotions from facial expression video sequences. For practical applications,
accurately recognizing ambiguous facial expressions -- frequently encountered
in in-the-wild data -- is essential. In this study, we propose MIDAS, a data
augmentation method designed to enhance DFER performance for ambiguous facial
expression data using soft labels representing probabilities of multiple
emotion classes. MIDAS augments training data by convexly combining pairs of
video frames and their corresponding emotion class labels. This approach
extends mixup to soft-labeled video data, offering a simple yet highly
effective method for handling ambiguity in DFER. To evaluate MIDAS, we
conducted experiments on both the DFEW dataset and FERV39k-Plus, a newly
constructed dataset that assigns soft labels to an existing DFER dataset. The
results demonstrate that models trained with MIDAS-augmented data achieve
superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art method trained on the
original dataset.

### [10] [THIRDEYE: Cue-Aware Monocular Depth Estimation via Brain-Inspired Multi-Stage Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20877)
*Calin Teodor Ioan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ThirdEye是一个利用预训练网络提供显式单目线索的深度估计方法，通过三阶段皮层层次结构融合线索，并生成高分辨率视差图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度估计方法忽略了人类视觉系统依赖的显式单目线索（如遮挡边界、阴影和透视），ThirdEye旨在通过专门网络提供这些线索以提高性能。

Method: 使用预训练且冻结的专家网络提供显式线索，通过三阶段皮层层次结构（V1->V2->V3）和键值工作记忆模块融合线索，最后用自适应分箱变换器生成视差图。

Result: ThirdEye继承了大量外部监督，仅需少量微调，但具体定量结果将在未来版本中提供。

Conclusion: ThirdEye通过显式利用单目线索，提供了一种高效且高性能的深度估计方法。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation methods traditionally train deep models to infer
depth directly from RGB pixels. This implicit learning often overlooks explicit
monocular cues that the human visual system relies on, such as occlusion
boundaries, shading, and perspective. Rather than expecting a network to
discover these cues unaided, we present ThirdEye, a cue-aware pipeline that
deliberately supplies each cue through specialised, pre-trained, and frozen
networks. These cues are fused in a three-stage cortical hierarchy (V1->V2->V3)
equipped with a key-value working-memory module that weights them by
reliability. An adaptive-bins transformer head then produces a high-resolution
disparity map. Because the cue experts are frozen, ThirdEye inherits large
amounts of external supervision while requiring only modest fine-tuning. This
extended version provides additional architectural detail, neuroscientific
motivation, and an expanded experimental protocol; quantitative results will
appear in a future revision.

Result: 通过实验验证了模型在生成多人生成图像中的表现，并提出了改进ID相似度的新技术。

Conclusion: MultiHuman-Testbench为多人生成图像研究提供了标准化工具和重要见解。

Abstract: Generation of images containing multiple humans, performing complex actions,
while preserving their facial identities, is a significant challenge. A major
factor contributing to this is the lack of a a dedicated benchmark. To address
this, we introduce MultiHuman-Testbench, a novel benchmark for rigorously
evaluating generative models for multi-human generation. The benchmark
comprises 1800 samples, including carefully curated text prompts, describing a
range of simple to complex human actions. These prompts are matched with a
total of 5,550 unique human face images, sampled uniformly to ensure diversity
across age, ethnic background, and gender. Alongside captions, we provide
human-selected pose conditioning images which accurately match the prompt. We
propose a multi-faceted evaluation suite employing four key metrics to quantify
face count, ID similarity, prompt alignment, and action detection. We conduct a
thorough evaluation of a diverse set of models, including zero-shot approaches
and training-based methods, with and without regional priors. We also propose
novel techniques to incorporate image and region isolation using human
segmentation and Hungarian matching, significantly improving ID similarity. Our
proposed benchmark and key findings provide valuable insights and a
standardized tool for advancing research in multi-human image generation.

Abstract: This work investigates the geometric foundations of modern stereo vision
systems, with a focus on how 3D structure and human-inspired perception
contribute to accurate depth reconstruction. We revisit the Cyclopean Eye model

discontinuities. Our analysis includes the evaluation of stereo feature
matching quality derived from deep learning models, as well as the role of
attention mechanisms in recovering meaningful 3D surfaces. Through both
theoretical insights and empirical studies on real datasets, we demonstrate
that combining strong geometric priors with learned features provides internal
abstractions for understanding stereo vision systems.

*Advait Gupta,Rishie Raj,Dang Nguyen,Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一种名为FaSTA$^*$的神经符号代理，通过结合大型语言模型（LLM）的高效规划和局部A$^*$搜索，实现多轮图像编辑任务的高效处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多轮图像编辑任务中高成本和低效率的问题，通过结合LLM的快速规划和A$^*$搜索的精确性，实现成本效益。

Method: 结合LLM的高层子任务规划和A$^*$搜索的局部工具调用，通过归纳推理提取常用子程序并复用，形成快速-慢速规划策略。

Result: FaSTA$^*$在计算效率上显著优于现有方法，同时保持与最先进基线相当的成功率。

Conclusion: FaSTA$^*$通过自适应快速-慢速规划和子程序复用，显著提高了多轮图像编辑任务的效率和成本效益。

Abstract: We develop a cost-efficient neurosymbolic agent to address challenging
multi-turn image editing tasks such as "Detect the bench in the image while
recoloring it to pink. Also, remove the cat for a clearer view and recolor the
wall to yellow.'' It combines the fast, high-level subtask planning by large
language models (LLMs) with the slow, accurate, tool-use, and local A$^*$
search per subtask to find a cost-efficient toolpath -- a sequence of calls to
AI tools. To save the cost of A$^*$ on similar subtasks, we perform inductive
reasoning on previously successful toolpaths via LLMs to continuously
extract/refine frequently used subroutines and reuse them as new tools for
future tasks in an adaptive fast-slow planning, where the higher-level
subroutines are explored first, and only when they fail, the low-level A$^*$
search is activated. The reusable symbolic subroutines considerably save
exploration cost on the same types of subtasks applied to similar images,
yielding a human-like fast-slow toolpath agent "FaSTA$^*$'': fast subtask
planning followed by rule-based subroutine selection per subtask is attempted
by LLMs at first, which is expected to cover most tasks, while slow A$^*$
search is only triggered for novel and challenging subtasks. By comparing with
recent image editing approaches, we demonstrate FaSTA$^*$ is significantly more
computationally efficient while remaining competitive with the state-of-the-art
baseline in terms of success rate.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M2SFormer是一种基于Transformer的框架，通过统一多频率和多尺度注意力机制，提升图像篡改定位的准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在像素级篡改定位中存在计算开销大和表示能力有限的问题，尤其是对细微或复杂篡改的处理不足。

Method: M2SFormer在跳跃连接中统一多频率和多尺度注意力机制，利用全局上下文捕捉篡改痕迹，并通过全局先验图和难度引导注意力模块保留细节。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，M2SFormer优于现有最先进模型，表现出更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: M2SFormer通过创新的注意力机制和细节保留方法，显著提升了图像篡改检测和定位的性能。

Abstract: Image editing techniques have rapidly advanced, facilitating both innovative
use cases and malicious manipulation of digital images. Deep learning-based
methods have recently achieved high accuracy in pixel-level forgery
localization, yet they frequently struggle with computational overhead and
limited representation power, particularly for subtle or complex tampering. In
this paper, we propose M2SFormer, a novel Transformer encoder-based framework
designed to overcome these challenges. Unlike approaches that process spatial
and frequency cues separately, M2SFormer unifies multi-frequency and
multi-scale attentions in the skip connection, harnessing global context to
better capture diverse forgery artifacts. Additionally, our framework addresses
the loss of fine detail during upsampling by utilizing a global prior map, a
curvature metric indicating the difficulty of forgery localization, which then
guides a difficulty-guided attention module to preserve subtle manipulations
more effectively. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that M2SFormer outperforms existing state-of-the-art models,
offering superior generalization in detecting and localizing forgeries across
unseen domains.

Abstract: Skinning and rigging are fundamental components in animation, articulated
object reconstruction, motion transfer, and 4D generation. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on Linear Blend Skinning (LBS), due to its simplicity and
differentiability. However, LBS introduces artifacts such as volume loss and
unnatural deformations, and it fails to model elastic materials like soft
tissues, fur, and flexible appendages (e.g., elephant trunks, ears, and fatty
tissues). In this work, we propose PhysRig: a differentiable physics-based
skinning and rigging framework that overcomes these limitations by embedding
the rigid skeleton into a volumetric representation (e.g., a tetrahedral mesh),
which is simulated as a deformable soft-body structure driven by the animated
skeleton. Our method leverages continuum mechanics and discretizes the object
as particles embedded in an Eulerian background grid to ensure
differentiability with respect to both material properties and skeletal motion.
Additionally, we introduce material prototypes, significantly reducing the
learning space while maintaining high expressiveness. To evaluate our
framework, we construct a comprehensive synthetic dataset using meshes from
Objaverse, The Amazing Animals Zoo, and MixaMo, covering diverse object
categories and motion patterns. Our method consistently outperforms traditional
LBS-based approaches, generating more realistic and physically plausible
results. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of our framework in the
pose transfer task highlighting its versatility for articulated object
modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏大规模数据集和精确标注，连续手语识别（CSLR）面临训练数据不足的问题，现有方法未能充分利用手语知识。

Method: 提出分层子动作树（HST），结合大型语言模型的手语知识，逐步对齐视觉和文本模态，并通过对比对齐增强减少计算复杂度。

Result: 在四个数据集（PHOENIX-2014、PHOENIX-2014T、CSL-Daily和Sign Language Gesture）上验证了HST-CSLR的有效性。

Conclusion: HST-CSLR通过更有效地利用手语知识，显著提升了连续手语识别的性能。

Abstract: Continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) aims to transcribe untrimmed
videos into glosses, which are typically textual words. Recent studies indicate
that the lack of large datasets and precise annotations has become a bottleneck
for CSLR due to insufficient training data. To address this, some works have
developed cross-modal solutions to align visual and textual modalities.
However, they typically extract textual features from glosses without fully
utilizing their knowledge. In this paper, we propose the Hierarchical
Sub-action Tree (HST), termed HST-CSLR, to efficiently combine gloss knowledge
with visual representation learning. By incorporating gloss-specific knowledge
from large language models, our approach leverages textual information more
effectively. Specifically, we construct an HST for textual information
representation, aligning visual and textual modalities step-by-step and
benefiting from the tree structure to reduce computational complexity.
Additionally, we impose a contrastive alignment enhancement to bridge the gap
between the two modalities. Experiments on four datasets (PHOENIX-2014,
PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, and Sign Language Gesture) demonstrate the
effectiveness of our HST-CSLR.

Abstract: Pathology is experiencing rapid digital transformation driven by whole-slide
imaging and artificial intelligence (AI). While deep learning-based
computational pathology has achieved notable success, traditional models
primarily focus on image analysis without integrating natural language
instruction or rich, text-based context. Current multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) in computational pathology face limitations, including
insufficient training data, inadequate support and evaluation for multi-image
understanding, and a lack of autonomous, diagnostic reasoning capabilities. To
address these limitations, we introduce PathChat+, a new MLLM specifically
designed for human pathology, trained on over 1 million diverse,
pathology-specific instruction samples and nearly 5.5 million question answer
turns. Extensive evaluations across diverse pathology benchmarks demonstrated
that PathChat+ substantially outperforms the prior PathChat copilot, as well as
both state-of-the-art (SOTA) general-purpose and other pathology-specific
models. Furthermore, we present SlideSeek, a reasoning-enabled multi-agent AI
system leveraging PathChat+ to autonomously evaluate gigapixel whole-slide

Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法在Video DiTs上应用时计算开销大，需要改进以提升效率。

Method: 提出DFVEdit，通过流变换统一编辑和采样过程，引入条件Delta流向量（CDFV）、隐式交叉注意力（ICA）指导和嵌入强化（ER）技术。

Result: DFVEdit在Video DiTs上实现了至少20倍推理加速和85%内存减少，编辑质量达到SOTA水平。

Conclusion: DFVEdit为Video DiTs提供了一种高效、高质量的零样本视频编辑解决方案。

Abstract: The advent of Video Diffusion Transformers (Video DiTs) marks a milestone in
video generation. However, directly applying existing video editing methods to
Video DiTs often incurs substantial computational overhead, due to
resource-intensive attention modification or finetuning. To alleviate this
problem, we present DFVEdit, an efficient zero-shot video editing method
tailored for Video DiTs. DFVEdit eliminates the need for both attention
modification and fine-tuning by directly operating on clean latents via flow
transformation. To be more specific, we observe that editing and sampling can
be unified under the continuous flow perspective. Building upon this
foundation, we propose the Conditional Delta Flow Vector (CDFV) -- a
theoretically unbiased estimation of DFV -- and integrate Implicit Cross
Attention (ICA) guidance as well as Embedding Reinforcement (ER) to further
enhance editing quality. DFVEdit excels in practical efficiency, offering at
least 20x inference speed-up and 85\% memory reduction on Video DiTs compared
to attention-engineering-based editing methods. Extensive quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate that DFVEdit can be seamlessly applied to
popular Video DiTs (e.g., CogVideoX and Wan2.1), attaining state-of-the-art
performance on structural fidelity, spatial-temporal consistency, and editing
quality.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Cradle2Cane的两阶段人脸老化框架，通过自适应噪声注入和身份感知嵌入，解决了年龄准确性与身份一致性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在实现真实且无缝的人脸老化时，难以平衡年龄准确性与身份一致性，尤其是在大年龄跨度或极端头部姿态的情况下。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：第一阶段通过自适应噪声注入（AdaNI）实现年龄准确性；第二阶段通过身份感知嵌入（IDEmb）增强身份一致性。

Result: 在CelebA-HQ测试数据集上，Cradle2Cane在年龄准确性和身份一致性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Cradle2Cane通过两阶段设计有效解决了Age-ID权衡问题，为人脸老化任务提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Face aging has become a crucial task in computer vision, with applications
ranging from entertainment to healthcare. However, existing methods struggle
with achieving a realistic and seamless transformation across the entire
lifespan, especially when handling large age gaps or extreme head poses. The
core challenge lies in balancing age accuracy and identity preservation--what
we refer to as the Age-ID trade-off. Most prior methods either prioritize age
transformation at the expense of identity consistency or vice versa. In this
work, we address this issue by proposing a two-pass face aging framework, named
Cradle2Cane, based on few-step text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. The first
pass focuses on solving age accuracy by introducing an adaptive noise injection
(AdaNI) mechanism. This mechanism is guided by including prompt descriptions of
age and gender for the given person as the textual condition. Also, by
adjusting the noise level, we can control the strength of aging while allowing
more flexibility in transforming the face. However, identity preservation is
weakly ensured here to facilitate stronger age transformations. In the second
pass, we enhance identity preservation while maintaining age-specific features
by conditioning the model on two identity-aware embeddings (IDEmb): SVR-ArcFace
and Rotate-CLIP. This pass allows for denoising the transformed image from the
first pass, ensuring stronger identity preservation without compromising the
aging accuracy. Both passes are jointly trained in an end-to-end way. Extensive
experiments on the CelebA-HQ test dataset, evaluated through Face++ and Qwen-VL
protocols, show that our Cradle2Cane outperforms existing face aging methods in
age accuracy and identity consistency.

Motivation: 相机成像中的光度失真会降低图像质量，进而影响3D场景表示的准确性。

Method: 引入内外光度模型，联合优化相机参数，并使用深度正则化防止场景无关信息的拟合。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在成像退化条件下仍能生成高质量的3D场景表示。

Conclusion: 通过联合优化相机模型和场景表示，有效解决了光度失真对3D重建的影响。

Abstract: Representing scenes from multi-view images is a crucial task in computer
vision with extensive applications. However, inherent photometric distortions
in the camera imaging can significantly degrade image quality. Without
accounting for these distortions, the 3D scene representation may inadvertently
incorporate erroneous information unrelated to the scene, diminishing the
quality of the representation. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D
scene-camera representation with joint camera photometric optimization. By
introducing internal and external photometric model, we propose a full
photometric model and corresponding camera representation. Based on
simultaneously optimizing the parameters of the camera representation, the
proposed method effectively separates scene-unrelated information from the 3D
scene representation. Additionally, during the optimization of the photometric
parameters, we introduce a depth regularization to prevent the 3D scene
representation from fitting scene-unrelated information. By incorporating the
camera model as part of the mapping process, the proposed method constructs a
complete map that includes both the scene radiance field and the camera
photometric model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
can achieve high-quality 3D scene representations, even under conditions of
imaging degradation, such as vignetting and dirt.

Motivation: 密集信号在姿态引导的图像生成中存在编辑困难和与文本提示不一致的问题，而稀疏信号的简单性和形状无关性尚未被充分探索。

Method: 扩展OpenPose为可学习的空间表示，并引入关键点概念学习，增强关键点嵌入的表达能力和姿态对齐。

Result: 实验表明，SP-Ctrl在稀疏姿态引导下优于现有方法，甚至与密集信号方法性能相当，并展示了跨物种生成的潜力。

Conclusion: 稀疏信号在姿态引导的图像生成中具有潜力，SP-Ctrl为这一方向提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent works favored dense signals (e.g., depth, DensePose), as an
alternative to sparse signals (e.g., OpenPose), to provide detailed spatial
guidance for pose-guided text-to-image generation. However, dense
representations raised new challenges, including editing difficulties and
potential inconsistencies with textual prompts. This fact motivates us to
revisit sparse signals for pose guidance, owing to their simplicity and
shape-agnostic nature, which remains underexplored. This paper proposes a novel
Spatial-Pose ControlNet(SP-Ctrl), equipping sparse signals with robust
controllability for pose-guided image generation. Specifically, we extend
OpenPose to a learnable spatial representation, making keypoint embeddings
discriminative and expressive. Additionally, we introduce keypoint concept
learning, which encourages keypoint tokens to attend to the spatial positions
of each keypoint, thus improving pose alignment. Experiments on animal- and
human-centric image generation tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms
recent spatially controllable T2I generation approaches under sparse-pose
guidance and even matches the performance of dense signal-based methods.
Moreover, SP-Ctrl shows promising capabilities in diverse and cross-species
generation through sparse signals. Codes will be available at

Motivation: 现有CZSL方法在原始特征提取和跨模态匹配上存在不足，限制了细粒度图像-组合对齐能力。

Method: 引入多专家域适应实现令牌感知学习，并提出语义变体对齐以选择语义相关表示。

Result: 在三个流行基准测试中，EVA在封闭和开放世界设置下均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EVA框架通过改进原始表示和匹配机制，有效提升了CZSL任务的性能。

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) investigates compositional
generalization capacity to recognize unknown state-object pairs based on
learned primitive concepts. Existing CZSL methods typically derive primitives
features through a simple composition-prototype mapping, which is suboptimal
for a set of individuals that can be divided into distinct semantic subsets.
Moreover, the all-to-one cross-modal primitives matching neglects compositional
divergence within identical states or objects, limiting fine-grained
image-composition alignment. In this study, we propose EVA, a
Mixture-of-Experts Semantic Variant Alignment framework for CZSL. Specifically,
we introduce domain-expert adaption, leveraging multiple experts to achieve
token-aware learning and model high-quality primitive representations. To
enable accurate compositional generalization, we further present semantic
variant alignment to select semantically relevant representation for
image-primitives matching. Our method significantly outperforms other
state-of-the-art CZSL methods on three popular benchmarks in both closed- and
open-world settings, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed insight.

Abstract: Pathology image segmentation is crucial in computational pathology for
analyzing histological features relevant to cancer diagnosis and prognosis.
However, current methods face major challenges in clinical applications due to
limited annotated data and restricted category definitions. To address these
limitations, we propose PathSegmentor, the first text-prompted segmentation
foundation model designed specifically for pathology images. We also introduce
PathSeg , the largest and most comprehensive dataset for pathology
segmentation, built from 17 public sources and containing 275k image-mask-label
triples across 160 diverse categories. With PathSegmentor, users can perform
semantic segmentation using natural language prompts, eliminating the need for
laborious spatial inputs such as points or boxes. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PathSegmentor outperforms specialized models with higher
accuracy and broader applicability, while maintaining a compact architecture.
It significantly surpasses existing spatial- and text-prompted models by 0.145
and 0.429 in overall Dice scores, respectively, showing strong robustness in
segmenting complex structures and generalizing to external datasets. Moreover,
PathSegmentor's outputs enhance the interpretability of diagnostic models
through feature importance estimation and imaging biomarker discovery, offering
pathologists evidence-based support for clinical decision-making. This work

Abstract: The rapid advancement of 3D vision-language models (VLMs) has spurred
significant interest in interactive point cloud processing tasks, particularly
for real-world applications. However, existing methods often underperform in
point-level tasks, such as segmentation, due to missing direct 3D-text
alignment, limiting their ability to link local 3D features with textual
context. To solve this problem, we propose TSDASeg, a Two-Stage model coupled
with a Direct cross-modal Alignment module and memory module for interactive
point cloud Segmentation. We introduce the direct cross-modal alignment module
to establish explicit alignment between 3D point clouds and textual/2D image
data. Within the memory module, we employ multiple dedicated memory banks to
separately store text features, visual features, and their cross-modal
correspondence mappings. These memory banks are dynamically leveraged through
self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms to update scene-specific features
based on prior stored data, effectively addressing inconsistencies in
interactive segmentation results across diverse scenarios. Experiments
conducted on multiple 3D instruction, reference, and semantic segmentation
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

Abstract: We propose a novel step-by-step video-to-audio generation method that

aiming to capture all sound events induced by a given video comprehensively.
Each generation step is formulated as a guided video-to-audio synthesis task,

training framework that leverages pre-trained video-to-audio models and

Result: 在动态模糊场景下实现了鲁棒的新视角合成性能，为模糊单目视频输入设定了新基准。

Conclusion: DBMovi-GS方法有效解决了动态模糊场景中的新视角合成问题，提升了视觉保真度。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis is a task of generating scenes from unseen perspectives;
however, synthesizing dynamic scenes from blurry monocular videos remains an
unresolved challenge that has yet to be effectively addressed. Existing novel
view synthesis methods are often constrained by their reliance on
high-resolution images or strong assumptions about static geometry and rigid
scene priors. Consequently, their approaches lack robustness in real-world
environments with dynamic object and camera motion, leading to instability and
degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we propose Motion-aware Dynamic View
Synthesis from Blurry Monocular Video via Sparse-Controlled Gaussian Splatting
(DBMovi-GS), a method designed for dynamic view synthesis from blurry monocular
videos. Our model generates dense 3D Gaussians, restoring sharpness from blurry
videos and reconstructing detailed 3D geometry of the scene affected by dynamic
motion variations. Our model achieves robust performance in novel view
synthesis under dynamic blurry scenes and sets a new benchmark in realistic
novel view synthesis for blurry monocular video inputs.

Motivation: 现有视觉-语言模型在面部表情识别中难以捕捉细粒度文本-视觉关系，影响对细微表情差异的区分。

Method: 提出MPA-FER框架，包括多粒度硬提示生成（利用LLM）、软提示与硬提示特征对齐、原型引导的视觉特征对齐，以及跨模态全局-局部对齐模块。

Result: 在三个FER基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，同时保留预训练模型的优势并降低计算成本。

Conclusion: MPA-FER通过细粒度语义指导和跨模态对齐，显著提升了面部表情识别的精度和可解释性。

Abstract: Prompt learning has been widely adopted to efficiently adapt vision-language
models (VLMs) like CLIP for various downstream tasks. Despite their success,
current VLM-based facial expression recognition (FER) methods struggle to
capture fine-grained textual-visual relationships, which are essential for
distinguishing subtle differences between facial expressions. To address this
challenge, we propose a multimodal prompt alignment framework for FER, called
MPA-FER, that provides fine-grained semantic guidance to the learning process
of prompted visual features, resulting in more precise and interpretable
representations. Specifically, we introduce a multi-granularity hard prompt
generation strategy that utilizes a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT to
generate detailed descriptions for each facial expression. The LLM-based
external knowledge is injected into the soft prompts by minimizing the feature
discrepancy between the soft prompts and the hard prompts. To preserve the
generalization abilities of the pretrained CLIP model, our approach
incorporates prototype-guided visual feature alignment, ensuring that the
prompted visual features from the frozen image encoder align closely with
class-specific prototypes. Additionally, we propose a cross-modal global-local
alignment module that focuses on expression-relevant facial features, further
improving the alignment between textual and visual features. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
three FER benchmark datasets, while retaining the benefits of the pretrained
model and minimizing computational costs.

Result: 实验表明，SAIC合成的图像显著提升了尾部类别和风格的检测性能及鲁棒性。

Abstract: Challenges such as the lack of high-quality annotations, long-tailed data
distributions, and inconsistent staining styles pose significant obstacles to
training neural networks to detect abnormal cells in cytopathology robustly.
This paper proposes a style-aligned image composition (SAIC) method that
composes high-fidelity and style-preserved pathological images to enhance the
effectiveness and robustness of detection models. Without additional training,
SAIC first selects an appropriate candidate from the abnormal cell bank based
on attribute guidance. Then, it employs a high-frequency feature reconstruction
to achieve a style-aligned and high-fidelity composition of abnormal cells and
pathological backgrounds. Finally, it introduces a large vision-language model
to filter high-quality synthesis images. Experimental results demonstrate that
incorporating SAIC-synthesized images effectively enhances the performance and
robustness of abnormal cell detection for tail categories and styles, thereby
improving overall detection performance. The comprehensive quality evaluation
further confirms the generalizability and practicality of SAIC in clinical
application scenarios. Our code will be released at

### [31] [Inverse Scene Text Removal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21002)
*Takumi Yoshimatsu,Shumpei Takezaki,Seiichi Uchida*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出逆向场景文本移除（ISTR），用于检测图像是否经过文本移除处理，并定位移除区域，同时尝试恢复被移除的文本内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 场景文本移除（STR）技术可能被滥用，因此需要逆向分析技术（ISTR）来检测和定位被移除的文本区域，以防范潜在风险。

Method: ISTR通过二元分类检测图像是否经过STR处理，并定位移除区域；同时训练文本识别器尝试恢复被移除的文本内容。

Result: 实验表明，ISTR在检测和定位任务上具有高准确率，但文本恢复任务较为困难。

Conclusion: ISTR为STR技术的滥用提供了检测手段，并为进一步改进STR技术提供了可能。

Abstract: Scene text removal (STR) aims to erase textual elements from images. It was
originally intended for removing privacy-sensitiveor undesired texts from
natural scene images, but is now also appliedto typographic images. STR
typically detects text regions and theninpaints them. Although STR has advanced
through neural networksand synthetic data, misuse risks have increased. This
paper investi-gates Inverse STR (ISTR), which analyzes STR-processed images
andfocuses on binary classification (detecting whether an image has un-dergone
STR) and localizing removed text regions. We demonstrate inexperiments that
these tasks are achievable with high accuracies, en-abling detection of
potential misuse and improving STR. We also at-tempt to recover the removed
text content by training a text recognizerto understand its difficulty.

*Hansam Cho,Seoung Bum Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为FGS的方法，通过忠实度引导和调度策略，在图像编辑中平衡可编辑性和忠实度，实现高质量的图像编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本引导扩散模型在图像编辑中可编辑性与忠实度之间的固有权衡问题。

Method: 引入忠实度引导以增强输入图像信息的保留，并提出调度策略解决可编辑性与忠实度的不对齐问题。

Result: 实验表明FGS在保持可编辑性的同时显著提升了忠实度，且适用于多种编辑任务。

Conclusion: FGS是一种有效的方法，能够在图像编辑中实现高质量的忠实度和可编辑性平衡。

Abstract: Text-guided diffusion models have become essential for high-quality image
synthesis, enabling dynamic image editing. In image editing, two crucial
aspects are editability, which determines the extent of modification, and
faithfulness, which reflects how well unaltered elements are preserved.
However, achieving optimal results is challenging because of the inherent
trade-off between editability and faithfulness. To address this, we propose
Faithfulness Guidance and Scheduling (FGS), which enhances faithfulness with
minimal impact on editability. FGS incorporates faithfulness guidance to
strengthen the preservation of input image information and introduces a
scheduling strategy to resolve misalignment between editability and
faithfulness. Experimental results demonstrate that FGS achieves superior
faithfulness while maintaining editability. Moreover, its compatibility with
various editing methods enables precise, high-quality image edits across
diverse tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 摩托车头盔违规检测面临环境多变性和数据不一致的挑战，需要一种更可靠的解决方案。

Method: 提出VisionGuard框架，包含自适应标签模块（通过跟踪算法修正分类）和上下文扩展模块（生成虚拟框解决数据不平衡）。

Result: 实验显示VisionGuard比基线检测器mAP提升3.1%，适用于交通监控系统。

Conclusion: VisionGuard有效提升了头盔违规检测的准确性和实用性，有望在实际交通监管中推广。

Abstract: Enforcing helmet regulations among motorcyclists is essential for enhancing
road safety and ensuring the effectiveness of traffic management systems.
However, automatic detection of helmet violations faces significant challenges
due to environmental variability, camera angles, and inconsistencies in the
data. These factors hinder reliable detection of motorcycles and riders and
disrupt consistent object classification. To address these challenges, we
propose VisionGuard, a synergistic multi-stage framework designed to overcome
the limitations of frame-wise detectors, especially in scenarios with class
imbalance and inconsistent annotations. VisionGuard integrates two key
components: Adaptive Labeling and Contextual Expander modules. The Adaptive
Labeling module is a tracking-based refinement technique that enhances
classification consistency by leveraging a tracking algorithm to assign
persistent labels across frames and correct misclassifications. The Contextual
Expander module improves recall for underrepresented classes by generating
virtual bounding boxes with appropriate confidence scores, effectively
addressing the impact of data imbalance. Experimental results show that
VisionGuard improves overall mAP by 3.1% compared to baseline detectors,
demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for real-world deployment in
traffic surveillance systems, ultimately promoting safety and regulatory
compliance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合Segment Anything Model (SAM)和Forward-Forward Contrastive Learning (FFCL)的深度学习框架，用于提高乳腺癌术中标本边缘评估的准确性和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前使用的2D标本放射成像（SR）在评估术中标本边缘状态时准确性有限，导致近四分之一的患者需要额外手术。

Method: 结合SAM和FFCL，通过预训练ResNet-18骨干网络分类边缘状态，并利用SAM细化肿瘤边缘分割。

Result: AUC为0.8455，Dice相似度比基线模型提高27.4%，推理时间缩短至47毫秒/图像。

Conclusion: FFCL-SAM显著提高了术中边缘评估的速度和准确性，有望降低再切除率并改善乳腺癌治疗效果。

Abstract: Complete removal of cancer tumors with a negative specimen margin during
lumpectomy is essential in reducing breast cancer recurrence. However, 2D
specimen radiography (SR), the current method used to assess intraoperative
specimen margin status, has limited accuracy, resulting in nearly a quarter of
patients requiring additional surgery. To address this, we propose a novel deep
learning framework combining the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with
Forward-Forward Contrastive Learning (FFCL), a pre-training strategy leveraging
both local and global contrastive learning for patch-level classification of SR
images. After annotating SR images with regions of known maligancy,
non-malignant tissue, and pathology-confirmed margins, we pre-train a ResNet-18
backbone with FFCL to classify margin status, then reconstruct coarse binary
masks to prompt SAM for refined tumor margin segmentation. Our approach
achieved an AUC of 0.8455 for margin classification and segmented margins with
a 27.4% improvement in Dice similarity over baseline models, while reducing
inference time to 47 milliseconds per image. These results demonstrate that
FFCL-SAM significantly enhances both the speed and accuracy of intraoperative
margin assessment, with strong potential to reduce re-excision rates and
improve surgical outcomes in breast cancer treatment. Our code is available at

Abstract: Modern perception models, particularly those designed for multisensory
egocentric tasks, have achieved remarkable performance but often come with
substantial computational costs. These high demands pose challenges for
real-world deployment, especially in resource-constrained environments. In this
paper, we introduce EgoAdapt, a framework that adaptively performs cross-modal
distillation and policy learning to enable efficient inference across different
egocentric perception tasks, including egocentric action recognition, active
speaker localization, and behavior anticipation. Our proposed policy module is
adaptable to task-specific action spaces, making it broadly applicable.
Experimental results on three challenging egocentric datasets EPIC-Kitchens,
EasyCom, and Aria Everyday Activities demonstrate that our method significantly
enhances efficiency, reducing GMACs by up to 89.09%, parameters up to 82.02%,
and energy up to 9.6x, while still on-par and in many cases outperforming, the
performance of corresponding state-of-the-art models.

Motivation: 现有方法通常将老化建模为单一确定性路径，无法反映多样化的未来。

Method: 采用无训练的扩散方法，结合注意力混合和模拟老化正则化策略。

Result: 在身份保持、老化真实性和条件对齐方面表现优异，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 将老化转化为多维、可控且可解释的过程，为数字叙事、健康教育等提供新可能。

Abstract: We introduce the Aging Multiverse, a framework for generating multiple
plausible facial aging trajectories from a single image, each conditioned on
external factors such as environment, health, and lifestyle. Unlike prior
methods that model aging as a single deterministic path, our approach creates
an aging tree that visualizes diverse futures. To enable this, we propose a
training-free diffusion-based method that balances identity preservation, age
accuracy, and condition control. Our key contributions include attention mixing
to modulate editing strength and a Simulated Aging Regularization strategy to
stabilize edits. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance across identity preservation, aging realism, and
conditional alignment, outperforming existing editing and age-progression
models, which often fail to account for one or more of the editing criteria. By
transforming aging into a multi-dimensional, controllable, and interpretable
process, our approach opens up new creative and practical avenues in digital
storytelling, health education, and personalized visualization.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于移动视角合成系统，还能支持更大场景的辐射场重建，如3D高斯泼溅。

Abstract: Augmented reality (AR) provides ways to visualize missing view samples for
novel view synthesis. Existing approaches present 3D annotations for new view
samples and task users with taking images by aligning the AR display. This data
collection task is known to be mentally demanding and limits capture areas to
pre-defined small areas due to the ideal but restrictive underlying sampling
theory. To free users from 3D annotations and limited scene exploration, we
propose using locally reconstructed light fields and visualizing errors to be
removed by inserting new views. Our results show that the error-peaking
visualization is less invasive, reduces disappointment in final results, and is
satisfactory with fewer view samples in our mobile view synthesis system. We
also show that our approach can contribute to recent radiance field
reconstruction for larger scenes, such as 3D Gaussian splatting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoLLMs struggle with multi-shot scenarios due to lack of annotated data. A new dataset (MultiClip-Bench) and model (IPFormer-VideoLLM) are introduced to address this, improving performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VideoLLMs fail in multi-shot scenarios (e.g., varying camera angles or scene changes), leading to issues like identity forgetting and key frame negligence.

Method: Introduce MultiClip-Bench dataset with dense descriptions and QA pairs for multi-shot scenarios. Propose IPFormer-VideoLLM, which injects instance-level features via an attention-based connector.

Result: The dataset boosts multi-shot performance, and IPFormer-VideoLLM significantly enhances multi-scene video understanding, outperforming benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and model effectively address multi-shot challenges, improving VideoLLMs' capabilities in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
understanding capabilities, but are found struggling to tackle multi-shot
scenarios,e.g., video clips with varying camera angles or scene changes. This
challenge can render failures such as instance identity forgetting and key
frame negligence. In this work, we first attribute the challenge to the lack of
multi-shot annotations among existing datasets and therefore we introduce a new
dataset termed MultiClip-Bench, featuring dense descriptions and
instruction-based question-answering pairs tailored for multi-shot scenarios.
We empirically find that the training set significantly boosts the multi-shot
performance, while the testing benchmark provides a reliable measure of the
model capability in multi-shot scenarios. By further analyzing and discovering
that current models only encode instance features in a discrete or lossy
manner, at the risk of missing identity information, we then contribute a new
model IPFormer-VideoLLM. Its key idea is the injection of instance-level
features as instance prompts through an efficient attention-based connector.
This allows for the aggregation of instance-specific information across scenes.
Experiments demonstrate that our proposed dataset and model not only enhance
the multi-scene video understanding significantly, but also offer distinct
advantages across various video benchmarks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于评分的指令生成（SIG）管道，用于视频质量评估（VQA），通过自动化生成指令数据，解决了传统方法依赖人工标注和专有系统的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VQA方法仅提供数值评分，无法全面描述视频质量的复杂维度，限制了其应用。

Method: 提出SIG管道，通过评分映射到文本级别，并结合分层链式思维（CoT）建模质量维度与整体质量的关系，自动化生成指令数据。

Result: 生成的Score2Instruct（S2I）数据集包含32万条指令-响应对，实验表明该方法显著提升了视频LMM的质量评分和解释能力。

Conclusion: SIG方法通过自动化数据生成和渐进式调优策略，有效提升了视频LMM在质量评估和解释方面的性能。

Abstract: Classical video quality assessment (VQA) methods generate a numerical score
to judge a video's perceived visual fidelity and clarity. Yet, a score fails to
describe the video's complex quality dimensions, restricting its applicability.
Benefiting from the linguistic output, adapting video large multimodal models
(LMMs) to VQA via instruction tuning has the potential to address this issue.
The core of the approach lies in the video quality-centric instruction data.
Previous explorations mainly focus on the image domain, and their data
generation processes heavily rely on human quality annotations and proprietary
systems, limiting data scalability and effectiveness. To address these
challenges, we propose the Score-based Instruction Generation (SIG) pipeline.
Specifically, SIG first scores multiple quality dimensions of an unlabeled
video and maps scores to text-defined levels. It then explicitly incorporates a
hierarchical Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to model the correlation between specific
dimensions and overall quality, mimicking the human visual system's reasoning
process. The automated pipeline eliminates the reliance on expert-written
quality descriptions and proprietary systems, ensuring data scalability and
generation efficiency. To this end, the resulting Score2Instruct (S2I) dataset
contains over 320K diverse instruction-response pairs, laying the basis for
instruction tuning. Moreover, to advance video LMMs' quality scoring and
justification abilities simultaneously, we devise a progressive tuning strategy
to fully unleash the power of S2I. Built upon SIG, we further curate a
benchmark termed S2I-Bench with 400 open-ended questions to better evaluate the
quality justification capacity of video LMMs. Experimental results on the
S2I-Bench and existing benchmarks indicate that our method consistently
improves quality scoring and justification capabilities across multiple video
LMMs.

Result: 实验证明FedSC在多种挑战性场景中有效，关键组件显著提升效率。

Conclusion: FedSC通过语义级协作解决了数据异构性问题，提供了理论保证和实际效果验证。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) aims to train models collaboratively across clients
without sharing data for privacy-preserving. However, one major challenge is
the data heterogeneity issue, which refers to the biased labeling preferences
at multiple clients. A number of existing FL methods attempt to tackle data
heterogeneity locally (e.g., regularizing local models) or globally (e.g.,
fine-tuning global model), often neglecting inherent semantic information
contained in each client. To explore the possibility of using intra-client
semantically meaningful knowledge in handling data heterogeneity, in this
paper, we propose Federated Learning with Semantic-Aware Collaboration (FedSC)
to capture client-specific and class-relevant knowledge across heterogeneous
clients. The core idea of FedSC is to construct relational prototypes and
consistent prototypes at semantic-level, aiming to provide fruitful class
underlying knowledge and stable convergence signals in a prototype-wise
collaborative way. On the one hand, FedSC introduces an inter-contrastive
learning strategy to bring instance-level embeddings closer to relational
prototypes with the same semantics and away from distinct classes. On the other
hand, FedSC devises consistent prototypes via a discrepancy aggregation manner,
as a regularization penalty to constrain the optimization region of the local
model. Moreover, a theoretical analysis for FedSC is provided to ensure a
convergence guarantee. Experimental results on various challenging scenarios
demonstrate the effectiveness of FedSC and the efficiency of crucial
components.

Abstract: The accurate segmentation of myocardial scars from cardiac MRI is essential
for clinical assessment and treatment planning. In this study, we propose a
robust deep-learning pipeline for fully automated myocardial scar detection and
segmentation by fine-tuning state-of-the-art models. The method explicitly
addresses challenges of label noise from semi-automatic annotations, data
heterogeneity, and class imbalance through the use of Kullback-Leibler loss and
extensive data augmentation. We evaluate the model's performance on both acute
and chronic cases and demonstrate its ability to produce accurate and smooth
segmentations despite noisy labels. In particular, our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models like nnU-Net and shows strong generalizability in an
out-of-distribution test set, highlighting its robustness across various
imaging conditions and clinical tasks. These results establish a reliable
foundation for automated myocardial scar quantification and support the broader
clinical adoption of deep learning in cardiac imaging.

Conclusion: 该技术为量子图像生成展示了广阔前景，尤其是在量子硬件进步后，并在真实IBM量子机器上验证了其鲁棒性。

Abstract: Machine learning-assisted diagnosis is gaining traction in skin disease
detection, but training effective models requires large amounts of high-quality
data. Skin disease datasets often suffer from class imbalance, privacy
concerns, and object bias, making data augmentation essential. While classical
generative models are widely used, they demand extensive computational
resources and lengthy training time. Quantum computing offers a promising
alternative, but existing quantum-based image generation methods can only yield
grayscale low-quality images. Through a novel classical-quantum latent space
fusion technique, our work overcomes this limitation and introduces the first
classical-quantum generative adversarial network (GAN) capable of generating
color medical images. Our model outperforms classical deep convolutional GANs
and existing hybrid classical-quantum GANs in both image generation quality and
classification performance boost when used as data augmentation. Moreover, the
performance boost is comparable with that achieved using state-of-the-art
classical generative models, yet with over 25 times fewer parameters and 10
times fewer training epochs. Such results suggest a promising future for
quantum image generation as quantum hardware advances. Finally, we demonstrate
the robust performance of our model on real IBM quantum machine with hardware
noise.

TL;DR: Video-X^2L通过双层KV压缩和选择性KV重加载，解决了长视频理解中的计算成本问题，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频理解（LVU）对多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的计算成本过高，现有KV压缩方法在高压缩比下信息损失严重。

Method: Video-X^2L采用双层KV压缩（低压缩KV和高压缩KV）和选择性KV重加载，灵活保留关键视频信息。

Result: 在多个LVU基准测试中，Video-X^2L显著优于现有KV压缩方法，同时大幅节省计算成本。

Conclusion: Video-X^2L无需额外训练，兼容现有MLLMs，是一种简单高效的长视频理解解决方案。

Abstract: Long-video understanding (LVU) remains a severe challenge for existing
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), primarily due to the prohibitive
computational cost. Recent approaches have explored KV compression to mitigate
this issue, but they often suffer from significant information loss at high
compression ratios. In this paper, we introduce Video-X^2L, which flexibly
preserves critical video information for each LVU task. Video-X^2L involves two
key operations. The first one is called bi-level KV compression. During the
MLLM's pre-filling stage, Video-X^2L generates two types of compressed KVs:
low-compression KVs (L-KVs) to capture fine-grained video details and
high-compression KVs (H-KVs) to offer compact video representations. The second
one is called selective KV re-loading. During the MLLM's decoding stage,
Video-X^2L selectively re-loads L-KVs for the most critical video chunks while
using H-KVs for other less important ones. This allows the MLLM to fully
utilize task-specific information while maintaining the overall compactness.
Video-X^2L is simple yet effective: it is free from additional training and
directly compatible with existing KV-compressible MLLMs. We evaluate Video-X^2L
with a variety of popular LVU benchmarks, including VideoMME, MLVU,
LongVideoBench, and VNBench. Our experiment result shows that Video-X^2L
outperforms existing KV-compression methods by a huge advantage while
substantially saving the computation cost.

Conclusion: LASFNet在效率和精度上取得了优越的平衡，代码将开源。

Abstract: Effective deep feature extraction via feature-level fusion is crucial for
multimodal object detection. However, previous studies often involve complex
training processes that integrate modality-specific features by stacking
multiple feature-level fusion units, leading to significant computational
overhead. To address this issue, we propose a new fusion detection baseline
that uses a single feature-level fusion unit to enable high-performance
detection, thereby simplifying the training process. Based on this approach, we
propose a lightweight attention-guided self-modulation feature fusion network
(LASFNet), which introduces a novel attention-guided self-modulation feature
fusion (ASFF) module that adaptively adjusts the responses of fusion features
at both global and local levels based on attention information from different
modalities, thereby promoting comprehensive and enriched feature generation.
Additionally, a lightweight feature attention transformation module (FATM) is
designed at the neck of LASFNet to enhance the focus on fused features and
minimize information loss. Extensive experiments on three representative
datasets demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, our approach
achieves a favorable efficiency-accuracy trade-off, reducing the number of
parameters and computational cost by as much as 90% and 85%, respectively,
while improving detection accuracy (mAP) by 1%-3%. The code will be

Result: BitMark的水印具有高放射性，即使生成的图像被用于训练其他模型，水印仍可被检测到，且对多种去除技术具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: BitMark为图像生成模型提供了一种防止模型崩溃的可靠方法，通过水印技术确保生成内容的可检测性。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models like Infinity generate photorealistic
images at an unprecedented speed. These models operate in a bitwise
autoregressive manner over a discrete set of tokens that is practically
infinite in size. However, their impressive generative power comes with a
growing risk: as their outputs increasingly populate the Internet, they are
likely to be scraped and reused as training data-potentially by the very same
models. This phenomenon has been shown to lead to model collapse, where
repeated training on generated content, especially from the models' own
previous versions, causes a gradual degradation in performance. A promising
mitigation strategy is watermarking, which embeds human-imperceptible yet
detectable signals into generated images-enabling the identification of
generated content. In this work, we introduce BitMark, a robust bitwise
watermarking framework for Infinity. Our method embeds a watermark directly at
the bit level of the token stream across multiple scales (also referred to as
resolutions) during Infinity's image generation process. Our bitwise watermark
subtly influences the bits to preserve visual fidelity and generation speed
while remaining robust against a spectrum of removal techniques. Furthermore,
it exhibits high radioactivity, i.e., when watermarked generated images are
used to train another image generative model, this second model's outputs will
also carry the watermark. The radioactive traces remain detectable even when
only fine-tuning diffusion or image autoregressive models on images watermarked
with our BitMark. Overall, our approach provides a principled step toward
preventing model collapse in image generative models by enabling reliable
detection of generated outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像tokenization方法计算量大，1D潜在空间虽减少了token数量，但仍需进一步优化。本文旨在通过1D二进制潜在表示，实现更紧凑的图像表示。

Method: 采用1D二进制向量序列表示图像，取代传统one-hot编码，结合简单模型架构，显著减少token数量。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在性能和效率上具有竞争力，为图像生成提供了一种高效且可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: Image tokenization plays a critical role in reducing the computational
demands of modeling high-resolution images, significantly improving the
efficiency of image and multimodal understanding and generation. Recent
advances in 1D latent spaces have reduced the number of tokens required by
eliminating the need for a 2D grid structure. In this paper, we further advance
compact discrete image representation by introducing 1D binary image latents.
By representing each image as a sequence of binary vectors, rather than using
traditional one-hot codebook tokens, our approach preserves high-resolution
details while maintaining the compactness of 1D latents. To the best of our
knowledge, our text-to-image models are the first to achieve competitive
performance in both diffusion and auto-regressive generation using just 128
discrete tokens for images up to 1024x1024, demonstrating up to a 32-fold
reduction in token numbers compared to standard VQ-VAEs. The proposed 1D binary
latent space, coupled with simple model architectures, achieves marked
improvements in speed training and inference speed. Our text-to-image models
allow for a global batch size of 4096 on a single GPU node with 8 AMD MI300X
GPUs, and the training can be completed within 200 GPU days. Our models achieve
competitive performance compared to modern image generation models without any
in-house private training data or post-training refinements, offering a
scalable and efficient alternative to conventional tokenization methods.

Conclusion: DidSee通过消除信号泄漏偏差和引入语义增强，显著提升了非朗伯物体深度补全的精度和泛化能力。

Abstract: Commercial RGB-D cameras often produce noisy, incomplete depth maps for
non-Lambertian objects. Traditional depth completion methods struggle to
generalize due to the limited diversity and scale of training data. Recent
advances exploit visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models
to enhance generalization in dense prediction tasks. However, we find that
biases arising from training-inference mismatches in the vanilla diffusion
framework significantly impair depth completion performance. Additionally, the
lack of distinct visual features in non-Lambertian regions further hinders
precise prediction. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{DidSee}, a
diffusion-based framework for depth completion on non-Lambertian objects.
First, we integrate a rescaled noise scheduler enforcing a zero terminal
signal-to-noise ratio to eliminate signal leakage bias. Second, we devise a
noise-agnostic single-step training formulation to alleviate error accumulation
caused by exposure bias and optimize the model with a task-specific loss.
Finally, we incorporate a semantic enhancer that enables joint depth completion
and semantic segmentation, distinguishing objects from backgrounds and yielding
precise, fine-grained depth maps. DidSee achieves state-of-the-art performance
on multiple benchmarks, demonstrates robust real-world generalization, and
effectively improves downstream tasks such as category-level pose estimation
and robotic grasping.Project page: https://wenzhoulyu.github.io/DidSee/

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of multimodal large language models, the capacity to
deeply understand and interpret human intentions has emerged as a critical
capability, which demands detailed and thoughtful reasoning. In recent studies,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Nonetheless, the
challenges associated with adapting RL to multimodal data and formats remain
largely unaddressed. In this paper, we identify two issues in existing
multimodal reasoning models: insufficient global context understanding and
shortcut problems. Insufficient context understanding can happen when a model
misinterprets multimodal context, resulting in incorrect answers. The shortcut
problem occurs when the model overlooks crucial clues in multimodal inputs,
directly addressing the query without considering the multimodal information.
To tackle these issues, we emphasize the necessity for the model to reason with
a clear understanding of the global context within multimodal inputs. This
global context understanding can effectively prevent the model from overlooking
key multimodal cues and ensure a thorough reasoning process. To ensure the
accurate interpretation of multimodal context information, we implement a
context reward judged by a large language model, alongside format and accuracy
rewards. Additionally, to improve complex reasoning capability, we employ the
LLM to assess the logical reward, determining whether the reasoning process
successfully integrates multimodal information with logical methods. We also
introduce a reasoning omni-modal benchmark, IntentBench, aimed at evaluating
models in understanding complex human intentions and emotions. Our proposed
method demonstrates advanced performance across multiple omni-modal benchmarks
compared to other open-source omni-modal models.

Abstract: Detectors often suffer from performance drop due to domain gap between
training and testing data. Recent methods explore diffusion models applied to
domain generalization (DG) and adaptation (DA) tasks, but still struggle with
large inference costs and have not yet fully leveraged the capabilities of
diffusion models. We propose to tackle these problems by extracting
intermediate features from a single-step diffusion process, improving feature
collection and fusion to reduce inference time by 75% while enhancing
performance on source domains (i.e., Fitness). Then, we construct an
object-centered auxiliary branch by applying box-masked images with class
prompts to extract robust and domain-invariant features that focus on object.
We also apply consistency loss to align the auxiliary and ordinary branch,
balancing fitness and generalization while preventing overfitting and improving
performance on target domains (i.e., Generalization). Furthermore, within a
unified framework, standard detectors are guided by diffusion detectors through
feature-level and object-level alignment on source domains (for DG) and
unlabeled target domains (for DA), thereby improving cross-domain detection
performance (i.e., Transferability). Our method achieves competitive results on
3 DA benchmarks and 5 DG benchmarks. Additionally, experiments on COCO
generalization benchmark demonstrate that our method maintains significant
advantages and show remarkable efficiency in large domain shifts and low-data
scenarios. Our work shows the superiority of applying diffusion models to
domain generalized and adaptive detection tasks and offers valuable insights
for visual perception tasks across diverse domains. The code is available at

Abstract: Surgical workflow analysis is essential in robot-assisted surgeries, yet the
long duration of such procedures poses significant challenges for comprehensive
video analysis. Recent approaches have predominantly relied on transformer
models; however, their quadratic attention mechanism restricts efficient
processing of lengthy surgical videos. In this paper, we propose a novel
hierarchical input-dependent state space model that leverages the linear
scaling property of state space models to enable decision making on full-length
videos while capturing both local and global dynamics. Our framework
incorporates a temporally consistent visual feature extractor, which appends a
state space model head to a visual feature extractor to propagate temporal
information. The proposed model consists of two key modules: a
local-aggregation state space model block that effectively captures intricate
local dynamics, and a global-relation state space model block that models
temporal dependencies across the entire video. The model is trained using a
hybrid discrete-continuous supervision strategy, where both signals of discrete
phase labels and continuous phase progresses are propagated through the
network. Experiments have shown that our method outperforms the current
state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (+2.8% on Cholec80, +4.3% on
MICCAI2016, and +12.9% on Heichole datasets). Code will be publicly available

Conclusion: 自监督ViT的双重特征攻击dSVA在黑盒攻击中表现出色，为对抗攻击提供了新思路。

Abstract: The ability of deep neural networks (DNNs) come from extracting and
interpreting features from the data provided. By exploiting intermediate
features in DNNs instead of relying on hard labels, we craft adversarial
perturbation that generalize more effectively, boosting black-box
transferability. These features ubiquitously come from supervised learning in
previous work. Inspired by the exceptional synergy between self-supervised
learning and the Transformer architecture, this paper explores whether
exploiting self-supervised Vision Transformer (ViT) representations can improve
adversarial transferability. We present dSVA -- a generative dual
self-supervised ViT features attack, that exploits both global structural
features from contrastive learning (CL) and local textural features from masked
image modeling (MIM), the self-supervised learning paradigm duo for ViTs. We
design a novel generative training framework that incorporates a generator to
create black-box adversarial examples, and strategies to train the generator by
exploiting joint features and the attention mechanism of self-supervised ViTs.
Our findings show that CL and MIM enable ViTs to attend to distinct feature
tendencies, which, when exploited in tandem, boast great adversarial
generalizability. By disrupting dual deep features distilled by self-supervised
ViTs, we are rewarded with remarkable black-box transferability to models of
various architectures that outperform state-of-the-arts. Code available at

Result: 在RGB-D Scenes V2和7-Scenes数据集上实现了最先进的配准性能。

Conclusion: CAA和GOS模块有效提升了图像到点云的配准精度。

Abstract: Detection-free methods typically follow a coarse-to-fine pipeline, extracting
image and point cloud features for patch-level matching and refining dense
pixel-to-point correspondences. However, differences in feature channel
attention between images and point clouds may lead to degraded matching
results, ultimately impairing registration accuracy. Furthermore, similar
structures in the scene could lead to redundant correspondences in cross-modal
matching. To address these issues, we propose Channel Adaptive Adjustment
Module (CAA) and Global Optimal Selection Module (GOS). CAA enhances
intra-modal features and suppresses cross-modal sensitivity, while GOS replaces
local selection with global optimization. Experiments on RGB-D Scenes V2 and
7-Scenes demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving state-of-the-art
performance in image-to-point cloud registration.

Abstract: Document understanding and analysis have received a lot of attention due to
their widespread application. However, existing document analysis solutions,
such as document layout analysis and key information extraction, are only
suitable for fixed category definitions and granularities, and cannot achieve
flexible applications customized by users. Therefore, this paper defines a new
task named ``Class-Agnostic Region-of-Interest Matching'' (``RoI-Matching'' for
short), which aims to match the customized regions in a flexible, efficient,
multi-granularity, and open-set manner. The visual prompt of the reference
document and target document images are fed into our model, while the output is
the corresponding bounding boxes in the target document images. To meet the
above requirements, we construct a benchmark RoI-Matching-Bench, which sets
three levels of difficulties following real-world conditions, and propose the
macro and micro metrics to evaluate. Furthermore, we also propose a new
framework RoI-Matcher, which employs a siamese network to extract multi-level
features both in the reference and target domains, and cross-attention layers
to integrate and align similar semantics in different domains. Experiments show
that our method with a simple procedure is effective on RoI-Matching-Bench, and
serves as the baseline for further research. The code is available at

Result: 实验表明视觉驱动幻觉比标签驱动更普遍，模型常持续错误分割，凸显反事实推理的必要性。

Conclusion: HalluSegBench为评估视觉基础中的幻觉提供了有效工具，揭示了模型在视觉推理中的不足。

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language segmentation has significantly advanced
grounded visual understanding. However, these models often exhibit
hallucinations by producing segmentation masks for objects not grounded in the
image content or by incorrectly labeling irrelevant regions. Existing
evaluation protocols for segmentation hallucination primarily focus on label or
textual hallucinations without manipulating the visual context, limiting their
capacity to diagnose critical failures. In response, we introduce
HalluSegBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
hallucinations in visual grounding through the lens of counterfactual visual
reasoning. Our benchmark consists of a novel dataset of 1340 counterfactual
instance pairs spanning 281 unique object classes, and a set of newly
introduced metrics that quantify hallucination sensitivity under visually
coherent scene edits. Experiments on HalluSegBench with state-of-the-art
vision-language segmentation models reveal that vision-driven hallucinations
are significantly more prevalent than label-driven ones, with models often
persisting in false segmentation, highlighting the need for counterfactual
reasoning to diagnose grounding fidelity.

Abstract: Retrieving 3D objects in complex indoor environments using only a masked 2D
image and a natural language description presents significant challenges. The
ROOMELSA challenge limits access to full 3D scene context, complicating
reasoning about object appearance, geometry, and semantics. These challenges
are intensified by distorted viewpoints, textureless masked regions, ambiguous
language prompts, and noisy segmentation masks. To address this, we propose
SAMURAI: Shape-Aware Multimodal Retrieval for 3D Object Identification. SAMURAI
integrates CLIP-based semantic matching with shape-guided re-ranking derived
from binary silhouettes of masked regions, alongside a robust majority voting
strategy. A dedicated preprocessing pipeline enhances mask quality by
extracting the largest connected component and removing background noise. Our
hybrid retrieval framework leverages both language and shape cues, achieving
competitive performance on the ROOMELSA private test set. These results
highlight the importance of combining shape priors with language understanding
for robust open-world 3D object retrieval.

Conclusion: PoseMaster通过统一框架和多条件训练，显著提升了3D角色生成的效率和质量。

Abstract: 3D characters play a crucial role in our daily entertainment. To improve the
efficiency of 3D character modeling, recent image-based methods use two
separate models to achieve pose standardization and 3D reconstruction of the
A-pose character. However, these methods are prone to generating distorted and
degraded images in the pose standardization stage due to self-occlusion and
viewpoints, which further affects the geometric quality of the subsequent
reconstruction process. To tackle these problems, we propose PoseMaster, an
end-to-end controllable 3D character generation framework. Specifically, we
unify pose transformation and 3D character generation into a flow-based 3D
native generation framework. To achieve accurate arbitrary-pose control, we
propose to leverage the 3D body bones existing in the skeleton of an animatable
character as the pose condition. Furthermore, considering the specificity of
multi-condition control, we randomly empty the pose condition and the image
condition during training to improve the effectiveness and generalizability of
pose control. Finally, we create a high-quality pose-control dataset derived
from realistic character animation data to make the model learning the implicit
relationships between skeleton and skinning weights. Extensive experiments show
that PoseMaster outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations for A-pose character generation while
demonstrating its powerful ability to achieve precise control for arbitrary
poses.

Abstract: We focus on the source-free domain adaptive object detection (SF-DAOD)
problem when source data is unavailable during adaptation and the model must
adapt to an unlabeled target domain. The majority of approaches for the problem
employ a self-supervised approach using a student-teacher (ST) framework where
pseudo-labels are generated via a source-pretrained model for further
fine-tuning. We observe that the performance of a student model often degrades
drastically, due to the collapse of the teacher model, primarily caused by high
noise in pseudo-labels, resulting from domain bias, discrepancies, and a
significant domain shift across domains. To obtain reliable pseudo-labels, we
propose a Target-based Iterative Query-Token Adversarial Network (TITAN), which
separates the target images into two subsets: those similar to the source
(easy) and those dissimilar (hard). We propose a strategy to estimate variance
to partition the target domain. This approach leverages the insight that higher
detection variances correspond to higher recall and greater similarity to the
source domain. Also, we incorporate query-token-based adversarial modules into
a student-teacher baseline framework to reduce the domain gaps between two
feature representations. Experiments conducted on four natural imaging datasets
and two challenging medical datasets have substantiated the superior
performance of TITAN compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methodologies. We report an mAP improvement of +22.7, +22.2, +21.1, and +3.7
percent over the current SOTA on C2F, C2B, S2C, and K2C benchmarks,
respectively.

autonomous systems. Developing deep learning-based stereo matching models that
deliver high accuracy while operating in real-time continues to be a major
challenge in computer vision. In the domain of cost-volume-based stereo
matching, accurate disparity estimation depends heavily on large-scale cost
volumes. However, such large volumes store substantial redundant information
and also require computationally intensive aggregation units for processing and
regression, making real-time performance unattainable. Conversely, small-scale
cost volumes followed by lightweight aggregation units provide a promising
route for real-time performance, but lack sufficient information to ensure
highly accurate disparity estimation. To address this challenge, we propose the
Enhanced Shuffle Mixer (ESM) to mitigate information loss associated with
small-scale cost volumes. ESM restores critical details by integrating primary
features into the disparity upsampling unit. It quickly extracts features from
the initial disparity estimation and fuses them with image features. These
features are mixed by shuffling and layer splitting then refined through a
compact feature-guided hourglass network to recover more detailed scene
geometry. The ESM focuses on local contextual connectivity with a large
receptive field and low computational cost, leading to the reconstruction of a
highly accurate disparity map at real-time. The compact version of ESMStereo
achieves an inference speed of 116 FPS on high-end GPUs and 91 FPS on the AGX
Orin.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 甲骨文作为古代语言之一，记录了丰富的文化信息，但仍有大量字符未解读。其复杂的结构和抽象意象为解读带来挑战。

Method: 提出两阶段框架OracleFusion：第一阶段使用增强空间感知推理的多模态大语言模型分析字形结构；第二阶段引入甲骨结构向量融合，结合字形约束生成语义丰富的矢量字体。

Result: 实验表明，OracleFusion在语义、视觉吸引力和字形保持方面优于现有基线模型，显著提升了可读性和美观性。

Conclusion: OracleFusion为甲骨文解读提供了专家级见解，是推动甲骨文研究的有力工具。

Abstract: As one of the earliest ancient languages, Oracle Bone Script (OBS)
encapsulates the cultural records and intellectual expressions of ancient
civilizations. Despite the discovery of approximately 4,500 OBS characters,
only about 1,600 have been deciphered. The remaining undeciphered ones, with
their complex structure and abstract imagery, pose significant challenges for
interpretation. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel
two-stage semantic typography framework, named OracleFusion. In the first
stage, this approach leverages the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with
enhanced Spatial Awareness Reasoning (SAR) to analyze the glyph structure of
the OBS character and perform visual localization of key components. In the
second stage, we introduce Oracle Structural Vector Fusion (OSVF),
incorporating glyph structure constraints and glyph maintenance constraints to
ensure the accurate generation of semantically enriched vector fonts. This
approach preserves the objective integrity of the glyph structure, offering
visually enhanced representations that assist experts in deciphering OBS.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that
OracleFusion outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models in terms of
semantics, visual appeal, and glyph maintenance, significantly enhancing both
readability and aesthetic quality. Furthermore, OracleFusion provides
expert-like insights on unseen oracle characters, making it a valuable tool for
advancing the decipherment of OBS.

TL;DR: FlickCD是一种轻量级遥感变化检测模型，通过增强差异模块和多尺度特征融合，显著降低计算资源消耗，同时保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代深度学习模型复杂度高但精度提升有限，而卫星处理需要高效轻量模型。

Method: 提出FlickCD，包含增强差异模块（EDM）和局部-全局融合块（SWSA和EGSA），优化特征差异和多尺度语义捕捉。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，FlickCD计算和存储开销降低一个数量级，性能达到或接近SOTA。

Conclusion: FlickCD在性能和资源消耗间取得平衡，适用于卫星实时处理。

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is essential for monitoring urban expansion,
disaster assessment, and resource management, offering timely, accurate, and
large-scale insights into dynamic landscape transformations. While deep
learning has revolutionized change detection, the increasing complexity and
computational demands of modern models have not necessarily translated into
significant accuracy gains. Instead of following this trend, this study
explores a more efficient approach, focusing on lightweight models that
maintain high accuracy while minimizing resource consumption, which is an
essential requirement for on-satellite processing. To this end, we propose
FlickCD, which means quick flick then get great results, pushing the boundaries
of the performance-resource trade-off. FlickCD introduces an Enhanced
Difference Module (EDM) to amplify critical feature differences between
temporal phases while suppressing irrelevant variations such as lighting and
weather changes, thereby reducing computational costs in the subsequent change
decoder. Additionally, the FlickCD decoder incorporates Local-Global Fusion
Blocks, leveraging Shifted Window Self-Attention (SWSA) and Enhanced Global
Self-Attention (EGSA) to efficiently capture semantic information at multiple
scales, preserving both coarse- and fine-grained changes. Extensive experiments
on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that FlickCD reduces computational and
storage overheads by more than an order of magnitude while achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance or incurring only a minor (<1\% F1)
accuracy trade-off. The implementation code is publicly available at

Abstract: We train models to Predict Ego-centric Video from human Actions (PEVA), given
the past video and an action represented by the relative 3D body pose. By
conditioning on kinematic pose trajectories, structured by the joint hierarchy
of the body, our model learns to simulate how physical human actions shape the
environment from a first-person point of view. We train an auto-regressive
conditional diffusion transformer on Nymeria, a large-scale dataset of
real-world egocentric video and body pose capture. We further design a
hierarchical evaluation protocol with increasingly challenging tasks, enabling
a comprehensive analysis of the model's embodied prediction and control
abilities. Our work represents an initial attempt to tackle the challenges of
modeling complex real-world environments and embodied agent behaviors with
video prediction from the perspective of a human.

Conclusion: CL-Splats为实时3D场景重建任务提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: In dynamic 3D environments, accurately updating scene representations over
time is crucial for applications in robotics, mixed reality, and embodied AI.
As scenes evolve, efficient methods to incorporate changes are needed to
maintain up-to-date, high-quality reconstructions without the computational
overhead of re-optimizing the entire scene. This paper introduces CL-Splats,
which incrementally updates Gaussian splatting-based 3D representations from
sparse scene captures. CL-Splats integrates a robust change-detection module
that segments updated and static components within the scene, enabling focused,
local optimization that avoids unnecessary re-computation. Moreover, CL-Splats
supports storing and recovering previous scene states, facilitating temporal
segmentation and new scene-analysis applications. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that CL-Splats achieves efficient updates with improved
reconstruction quality over the state-of-the-art. This establishes a robust
foundation for future real-time adaptation in 3D scene reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction for surrounding agents is a challenging task in
autonomous driving due to its inherent uncertainty and underlying
multimodality. Unlike prevailing data-driven methods that primarily rely on
supervised learning, in this paper, we introduce a novel Graph-oriented Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (GoIRL) framework, which is an IRL-based predictor
equipped with vectorized context representations. We develop a feature adaptor
to effectively aggregate lane-graph features into grid space, enabling seamless
integration with the maximum entropy IRL paradigm to infer the reward
distribution and obtain the policy that can be sampled to induce multiple
plausible plans. Furthermore, conditioned on the sampled plans, we implement a
hierarchical parameterized trajectory generator with a refinement module to
enhance prediction accuracy and a probability fusion strategy to boost
prediction confidence. Extensive experimental results showcase our approach not
only achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale Argoverse &
nuScenes motion forecasting benchmarks but also exhibits superior
generalization abilities compared to existing supervised models.

Abstract: Learning-based methods have made promising advances in low-light RAW image

environmental illuminance drops as low as 0.0001 lux remains to be explored due
to the lack of corresponding datasets. To this end, we propose a
paired-to-paired data synthesis pipeline capable of generating well-calibrated
extremely low-light RAW images at three precise illuminance ranges of 0.01-0.1
lux, 0.001-0.01 lux, and 0.0001-0.001 lux, together with high-quality sRGB
references to comprise a large-scale paired dataset named
See-in-the-Extremely-Dark (SIED) to benchmark low-light RAW image enhancement
approaches. Furthermore, we propose a diffusion-based framework that leverages
the generative ability and intrinsic denoising property of diffusion models to
restore visually pleasing results from extremely low-SNR RAW inputs, in which
an Adaptive Illumination Correction Module (AICM) and a color consistency loss
are introduced to ensure accurate exposure correction and color restoration.
Extensive experiments on the proposed SIED and publicly available benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code and dataset are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业表面缺陷检测因缺陷类型多样、形状不规则、细粒度要求和复杂纹理而具有挑战性，现有AI检测方法存在冗余特征、细节敏感度不足和多尺度鲁棒性弱的问题。

Method: YOLO-FDA采用BiFPN架构增强多级特征聚合，引入DDFM模块捕捉细粒度结构变化，并提出两种注意力融合策略（AC和CAF）优化上下文表示。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，YOLO-FDA在准确性和鲁棒性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: YOLO-FDA通过细节增强和注意力融合，显著提升了工业缺陷检测的性能。

Abstract: Surface defect detection in industrial scenarios is both crucial and
technically demanding due to the wide variability in defect types, irregular
shapes and sizes, fine-grained requirements, and complex material textures.
Although recent advances in AI-based detectors have improved performance,
existing methods often suffer from redundant features, limited detail
sensitivity, and weak robustness under multiscale conditions. To address these
challenges, we propose YOLO-FDA, a novel YOLO-based detection framework that
integrates fine-grained detail enhancement and attention-guided feature fusion.
Specifically, we adopt a BiFPN-style architecture to strengthen bidirectional
multilevel feature aggregation within the YOLOv5 backbone. To better capture
fine structural changes, we introduce a Detail-directional Fusion Module (DDFM)
that introduces a directional asymmetric convolution in the second-lowest layer
to enrich spatial details and fuses the second-lowest layer with low-level
features to enhance semantic consistency. Furthermore, we propose two novel
attention-based fusion strategies, Attention-weighted Concatenation (AC) and
Cross-layer Attention Fusion (CAF) to improve contextual representation and
reduce feature noise. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that YOLO-FDA consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
terms of both accuracy and robustness across diverse types of defects and
scales.

Result: 在107类HSI数据集上达到SOTA性能，同时有效检测OOD像素且不影响ID像素的分割。

Conclusion: 树状语义损失函数能有效利用标签层次结构，提升分割性能并支持OOD检测。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) shows great promise for surgical applications,
offering detailed insights into biological tissue differences beyond what the
naked eye can perceive. Refined labelling efforts are underway to train vision
systems to distinguish large numbers of subtly varying classes. However,
commonly used learning methods for biomedical segmentation tasks penalise all
errors equivalently and thus fail to exploit any inter-class semantics in the
label space. In this work, we introduce two tree-based semantic loss functions
which take advantage of a hierarchical organisation of the labels. We further
incorporate our losses in a recently proposed approach for training with
sparse, background-free annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed method reaches state-of-the-art performance on a sparsely annotated
HSI dataset comprising $107$ classes organised in a clinically-defined semantic
tree structure. Furthermore, our method enables effective detection of
out-of-distribution (OOD) pixels without compromising segmentation performance
on in-distribution (ID) pixels.

Conclusion: 该方法通过几何和感知先验的整合，实现了高质量的单图像3D重建。

Abstract: Generating realistic 3D objects from single-view images requires natural
appearance, 3D consistency, and the ability to capture multiple plausible
interpretations of unseen regions. Existing approaches often rely on
fine-tuning pretrained 2D diffusion models or directly generating 3D
information through fast network inference or 3D Gaussian Splatting, but their
results generally suffer from poor multiview consistency and lack geometric
detail. To takle these issues, we present a novel method that seamlessly
integrates geometry and perception priors without requiring additional model
training to reconstruct detailed 3D objects from a single image. Specifically,
we train three different Gaussian branches initialized from the geometry prior,
perception prior and Gaussian noise, respectively. The geometry prior captures
the rough 3D shapes, while the perception prior utilizes the 2D pretrained
diffusion model to enhance multiview information. Subsequently, we refine 3D
Gaussian branches through mutual interaction between geometry and perception
priors, further enhanced by a reprojection-based strategy that enforces depth
consistency. Experiments demonstrate the higher-fidelity reconstruction results
of our method, outperforming existing methods on novel view synthesis and 3D
reconstruction, demonstrating robust and consistent 3D object generation.

Result: 在三个公开的Sim2Real基准测试中，TAM框架表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TAM框架通过拓扑建模和自训练策略有效缩小了Sim2Real领域差距，提升了分类器的泛化性能。

Abstract: Learning semantic representations from point sets of 3D object shapes is
often challenged by significant geometric variations, primarily due to
differences in data acquisition methods. Typically, training data is generated
using point simulators, while testing data is collected with distinct 3D
sensors, leading to a simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) domain gap that limits
the generalization ability of point classifiers. Current unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) techniques struggle with this gap, as they often lack robust,
domain-insensitive descriptors capable of capturing global topological
information, resulting in overfitting to the limited semantic patterns of the
source domain. To address this issue, we introduce a novel Topology-Aware
Modeling (TAM) framework for Sim2Real UDA on object point clouds. Our approach
mitigates the domain gap by leveraging global spatial topology, characterized
by low-level, high-frequency 3D structures, and by modeling the topological
relations of local geometric features through a novel self-supervised learning
task. Additionally, we propose an advanced self-training strategy that combines
cross-domain contrastive learning with self-training, effectively reducing the
impact of noisy pseudo-labels and enhancing the robustness of the adaptation
process. Experimental results on three public Sim2Real benchmarks validate the
effectiveness of our TAM framework, showing consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated tasks. The source code of this
work will be available at https://github.com/zou-longkun/TAG.git.

Abstract: 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction is crucial for autonomous driving, providing
a dense, semantically rich environmental representation. However, existing
methods focus on in-distribution scenes, making them susceptible to
Out-of-Distribution (OoD) objects and long-tail distributions, which increases
the risk of undetected anomalies and misinterpretations, posing safety hazards.
To address these challenges, we introduce Out-of-Distribution Semantic
Occupancy Prediction, targeting OoD detection in 3D voxel space. To fill the
gaps in the dataset, we propose a Synthetic Anomaly Integration Pipeline that
injects synthetic anomalies while preserving realistic spatial and occlusion
patterns, enabling the creation of two datasets: VAA-KITTI and VAA-KITTI-360.
We introduce OccOoD, a novel framework integrating OoD detection into 3D

Motivation: 现有3D视觉定位方法无法有效处理多步骤文本指令中的代词和上下文信息，导致在SG3D任务中表现不佳。

Method: 提出GroundFlow模块，选择性提取短期和长期步骤信息，并结合当前指令进行时序推理。

Result: 在SG3D基准测试中，GroundFlow显著提升基线方法性能（+7.5%和+10.2%），并在五个数据集上达到最优表现。

Conclusion: GroundFlow为现有3D视觉定位模型引入时序推理能力，显著提升SG3D任务的性能。

Abstract: Sequential grounding in 3D point clouds (SG3D) refers to locating sequences
of objects by following text instructions for a daily activity with detailed
steps. Current 3D visual grounding (3DVG) methods treat text instructions with
multiple steps as a whole, without extracting useful temporal information from
each step. However, the instructions in SG3D often contain pronouns such as
"it", "here" and "the same" to make language expressions concise. This requires
grounding methods to understand the context and retrieve relevant information
from previous steps to correctly locate object sequences. Due to the lack of an
effective module for collecting related historical information,
state-of-the-art 3DVG methods face significant challenges in adapting to the
SG3D task. To fill this gap, we propose GroundFlow -- a plug-in module for
temporal reasoning on 3D point cloud sequential grounding. Firstly, we
demonstrate that integrating GroundFlow improves the task accuracy of 3DVG
baseline methods by a large margin (+7.5\% and +10.2\%) in the SG3D benchmark,
even outperforming a 3D large language model pre-trained on various datasets.
Furthermore, we selectively extract both short-term and long-term step
information based on its relevance to the current instruction, enabling
GroundFlow to take a comprehensive view of historical information and maintain
its temporal understanding advantage as step counts increase. Overall, our work
introduces temporal reasoning capabilities to existing 3DVG models and achieves
state-of-the-art performance in the SG3D benchmark across five datasets.

Motivation: 全景图像处理面临失真、遮挡和标注不足等问题，传统方法依赖源数据，限制了实用性。

Method: 提出UNLOCK框架，包含Omni Pseudo-Labeling Learning和Amodal-Driven Context Learning两个模块，无需源数据或目标标注。

Result: 在真实到真实和合成到真实的适应设置中，性能接近依赖源数据的方法，mAAP和mAP分别达到10.9和11.6，mAPQ提升+4.3。

Conclusion: UNLOCK为全景图像分割提供了一种更实用的解决方案，性能优越且无需源数据。

Abstract: Panoramic image processing is essential for omni-context perception, yet
faces constraints like distortions, perspective occlusions, and limited
annotations. Previous unsupervised domain adaptation methods transfer knowledge
from labeled pinhole data to unlabeled panoramic images, but they require
access to source pinhole data. To address these, we introduce a more practical
task, i.e., Source-Free Occlusion-Aware Seamless Segmentation (SFOASS), and
propose its first solution, called UNconstrained Learning Omni-Context
Knowledge (UNLOCK). Specifically, UNLOCK includes two key modules: Omni
Pseudo-Labeling Learning and Amodal-Driven Context Learning. While adapting
without relying on source data or target labels, this framework enhances models
to achieve segmentation with 360{\deg} viewpoint coverage and occlusion-aware
reasoning. Furthermore, we benchmark the proposed SFOASS task through both
real-to-real and synthetic-to-real adaptation settings. Experimental results
show that our source-free method achieves performance comparable to
source-dependent methods, yielding state-of-the-art scores of 10.9 in mAAP and
11.6 in mAP, along with an absolute improvement of +4.3 in mAPQ over the
source-only method. All data and code will be made publicly available at

Motivation: 解决当前医学图像分析系统任务特定、灵活性不足的问题。

Method: 使用LLM（Llama-4-17B）进行任务规划和权重路由，结合模块化CNN（DeepFusionLab）进行图像处理。

Result: 在19个数据集上表现优异，端到端正确率97%，推理延迟2.5秒，分割和分类性能强。

Conclusion: MedPrompt通过结合LLM和CNN，实现了可扩展、高效的医学图像分析。

Abstract: Current medical image analysis systems are typically task-specific, requiring
separate models for classification and segmentation, and lack the flexibility
to support user-defined workflows. To address these challenges, we introduce
MedPrompt, a unified framework that combines a few-shot prompted Large Language
Model (Llama-4-17B) for high-level task planning with a modular Convolutional
Neural Network (DeepFusionLab) for low-level image processing. The LLM
interprets user instructions and generates structured output to dynamically
route task-specific pretrained weights. This weight routing approach avoids
retraining the entire framework when adding new tasks-only task-specific
weights are required, enhancing scalability and deployment. We evaluated
MedPrompt across 19 public datasets, covering 12 tasks spanning 5 imaging
modalities. The system achieves a 97% end-to-end correctness in interpreting

*Xiwei Xuan,Ziquan Deng,Kwan-Liu Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需训练的开集词汇语义分割（OVS）方法，通过优化数据质量显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖预训练模型或合成数据，性能受限于模型能力或数据质量。本文关注数据质量问题，发现高质量参考集对无需训练的OVS至关重要。

Method: 提出一个数据质量导向的框架，包括构建高质量参考集的数据流程和基于相似性的检索方法。

Result: 在十个基准数据集上的广泛评估表明，该方法优于所有现有的无需训练OVS方法。

Conclusion: 数据为中心的设计对无需训练的OVS至关重要，本文方法显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS) aims to segment
images given a set of arbitrary textual categories without costly model
fine-tuning. Existing solutions often explore attention mechanisms of
pre-trained models, such as CLIP, or generate synthetic data and design complex
retrieval processes to perform OVS. However, their performance is limited by
the capability of reliant models or the suboptimal quality of reference sets.
In this work, we investigate the largely overlooked data quality problem for
this challenging dense scene understanding task, and identify that a
high-quality reference set can significantly benefit training-free OVS. With
this observation, we introduce a data-quality-oriented framework, comprising a
data pipeline to construct a reference set with well-paired segment-text
embeddings and a simple similarity-based retrieval to unveil the essential
effect of data. Remarkably, extensive evaluations on ten benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms all existing training-free OVS
approaches, highlighting the importance of data-centric design for advancing
OVS without training. Our code is available at https://github.com/xiweix/ReME .

TL;DR: DiMPLe提出了一种多模态提示学习方法，通过解耦视觉和语言模态中的不变和虚假特征，提升多模态学习的泛化能力和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉数据中虚假相关性对分布外性能的负面影响，传统方法仅关注图像特征，而DiMPLe通过跨模态解耦实现更好的泛化。

Method: 结合三个关键目标：不变与虚假特征的互信息最小化、虚假特征正则化、以及不变特征的对比学习。

Result: 在11个数据集上表现优于CoOp-OOD，基础类准确率提升15.27，新类准确率提升44.31。

Conclusion: DiMPLe在多模态学习中通过特征解耦显著提升了泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: We introduce DiMPLe (Disentangled Multi-Modal Prompt Learning), a novel
approach to disentangle invariant and spurious features across vision and
language modalities in multi-modal learning. Spurious correlations in visual
data often hinder out-of-distribution (OOD) performance. Unlike prior methods
focusing solely on image features, DiMPLe disentangles features within and
across modalities while maintaining consistent alignment, enabling better
generalization to novel classes and robustness to distribution shifts. Our
method combines three key objectives: (1) mutual information minimization
between invariant and spurious features, (2) spurious feature regularization,
and (3) contrastive learning on invariant features. Extensive experiments
demonstrate DiMPLe demonstrates superior performance compared to CoOp-OOD, when
averaged across 11 diverse datasets, and achieves absolute gains of 15.27 in
base class accuracy and 44.31 in novel class accuracy.

Abstract: Human Motion Segmentation (HMS), which aims to partition videos into
non-overlapping human motions, has attracted increasing research attention
recently. Existing approaches for HMS are mainly dominated by subspace
clustering methods, which are grounded on the assumption that high-dimensional
temporal data align with a Union-of-Subspaces (UoS) distribution. However, the
frames in video capturing complex human motions with cluttered backgrounds may
not align well with the UoS distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach for HMS, named Temporal Rate Reduction Clustering
($\text{TR}^2\text{C}$), which jointly learns structured representations and
affinity to segment the frame sequences in video. Specifically, the structured
representations learned by $\text{TR}^2\text{C}$ maintain temporally consistent
and align well with a UoS structure, which is favorable for the HMS task. We
conduct extensive experiments on five benchmark HMS datasets and achieve
state-of-the-art performances with different feature extractors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的目标检测系统需要同时学习新类别和适应环境变化，但现有方法（CIOD和DIOD）只能解决单一方面的问题，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出了DuET框架，基于任务算术模型合并，通过方向一致性损失解决符号冲突，支持多种检测器（如YOLO11和RT-DETR）进行实时增量学习。

Result: 在Pascal Series和Diverse Weather Series上的实验表明，DuET在RAI指标上分别提升了13.12%和11.39%，同时保持了较高的平均保留指数（Avg RI）。

Conclusion: DuIOD和DuET为同时处理类别和域增量学习提供了有效解决方案，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Real-world object detection systems, such as those in autonomous driving and
surveillance, must continuously learn new object categories and simultaneously
adapt to changing environmental conditions. Existing approaches, Class
Incremental Object Detection (CIOD) and Domain Incremental Object Detection
(DIOD) only address one aspect of this challenge. CIOD struggles in unseen
domains, while DIOD suffers from catastrophic forgetting when learning new
classes, limiting their real-world applicability. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce Dual Incremental Object Detection (DuIOD), a more
practical setting that simultaneously handles class and domain shifts in an
exemplar-free manner. We propose DuET, a Task Arithmetic-based model merging
framework that enables stable incremental learning while mitigating sign
conflicts through a novel Directional Consistency Loss. Unlike prior methods,
DuET is detector-agnostic, allowing models like YOLO11 and RT-DETR to function
as real-time incremental object detectors. To comprehensively evaluate both
retention and adaptation, we introduce the Retention-Adaptability Index (RAI),
which combines the Average Retention Index (Avg RI) for catastrophic forgetting
and the Average Generalization Index for domain adaptability into a common
ground. Extensive experiments on the Pascal Series and Diverse Weather Series
demonstrate DuET's effectiveness, achieving a +13.12% RAI improvement while
preserving 89.3% Avg RI on the Pascal Series (4 tasks), as well as a +11.39%
RAI improvement with 88.57% Avg RI on the Diverse Weather Series (3 tasks),
outperforming existing methods.

Method: 提出ViTI，将视频试穿视为条件视频修复任务，采用Diffusion Transformer框架和3D时空注意力，结合多阶段训练和掩码策略。

Result: 实验结果表明，ViTI在时空一致性和细节保留上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ViTI通过重新定义任务和引入3D时空注意力，有效解决了视频试穿中的一致性问题。

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to naturally fit a garment to a target person in
consecutive video frames. It is a challenging task, on the one hand, the output
video should be in good spatial-temporal consistency, on the other hand, the
details of the given garment need to be preserved well in all the frames.
Naively using image-based try-on methods frame by frame can get poor results
due to severe inconsistency. Recent diffusion-based video try-on methods,
though very few, happen to coincide with a similar solution: inserting temporal
attention into image-based try-on model to adapt it for video try-on task,
which have shown improvements but there still exist inconsistency problems. In
this paper, we propose ViTI (Video Try-on Inpainter), formulate and implement
video virtual try-on as a conditional video inpainting task, which is different
from previous methods. In this way, we start with a video generation problem
instead of an image-based try-on problem, which from the beginning has a better
spatial-temporal consistency. Specifically, at first we build a video
inpainting framework based on Diffusion Transformer with full 3D
spatial-temporal attention, and then we progressively adapt it for video
garment inpainting, with a collection of masking strategies and multi-stage
training. After these steps, the model can inpaint the masked garment area with
appropriate garment pixels according to the prompt with good spatial-temporal
consistency. Finally, as other try-on methods, garment condition is added to
the model to make sure the inpainted garment appearance and details are as
expected. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results show that ViTI
is superior to previous works.

Abstract: Achieving precise word-level typography control within generated images
remains a persistent challenge. To address it, we newly construct a word-level
controlled scene text dataset and introduce the Text-Image Alignment (TIA)
framework. This framework leverages cross-modal correspondence between text and
local image regions provided by grounding models to enhance the Text-to-Image
(T2I) model training. Furthermore, we propose WordCon, a hybrid
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. WordCon reparameterizes
selective key parameters, improving both efficiency and portability. This
allows seamless integration into diverse pipelines, including artistic text
rendering, text editing, and image-conditioned text rendering. To further
enhance controllability, the masked loss at the latent level is applied to
guide the model to concentrate on learning the text region in the image, and
the joint-attention loss provides feature-level supervision to promote
disentanglement between different words. Both qualitative and quantitative
results demonstrate the superiority of our method to the state of the art. The
datasets and source code will be available for academic use.

Motivation: 现有手术视频生成方法缺乏对手术动作和阶段的连贯性理解，无法实现事实模拟。

Method: HieraSurg采用两阶段模型：第一阶段预测粗粒度语义变化，第二阶段结合细粒度视觉特征生成视频。

Conclusion: HieraSurg展示了在多层次手术信息整合上的优势，具有实际手术应用的潜力。

Abstract: Surgical Video Synthesis has emerged as a promising research direction
following the success of diffusion models in general-domain video generation.
Although existing approaches achieve high-quality video generation, most are
unconditional and fail to maintain consistency with surgical actions and
phases, lacking the surgical understanding and fine-grained guidance necessary
for factual simulation. We address these challenges by proposing HieraSurg, a
hierarchy-aware surgical video generation framework consisting of two
specialized diffusion models. Given a surgical phase and an initial frame,
HieraSurg first predicts future coarse-grained semantic changes through a
segmentation prediction model. The final video is then generated by a
second-stage model that augments these temporal segmentation maps with
fine-grained visual features, leading to effective texture rendering and
integration of semantic information in the video space. Our approach leverages
surgical information at multiple levels of abstraction, including surgical
phase, action triplets, and panoptic segmentation maps. The experimental
results on Cholecystectomy Surgical Video Generation demonstrate that the model
significantly outperforms prior work both quantitatively and qualitatively,
showing strong generalization capabilities and the ability to generate higher
frame-rate videos. The model exhibits particularly fine-grained adherence when
provided with existing segmentation maps, suggesting its potential for
practical surgical applications.

Result: 实验显示CoSMAE比现有持续学习方法在MAE上提升高达4.94%。

Conclusion: CoSMAE通过数据和模型层面的混合策略有效减少灾难性遗忘，为遥感领域的持续学习提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The development of continual learning (CL) methods, which aim to learn new
tasks in a sequential manner from the training data acquired continuously, has
gained great attention in remote sensing (RS). The existing CL methods in RS,
while learning new tasks, enhance robustness towards catastrophic forgetting.
This is achieved by using a large number of labeled training samples, which is
costly and not always feasible to gather in RS. To address this problem, we
propose a novel continual self-supervised learning method in the context of
masked autoencoders (denoted as CoSMAE). The proposed CoSMAE consists of two
components: i) data mixup; and ii) model mixup knowledge distillation. Data
mixup is associated with retaining information on previous data distributions
by interpolating images from the current task with those from the previous
tasks. Model mixup knowledge distillation is associated with distilling
knowledge from past models and the current model simultaneously by
interpolating their model weights to form a teacher for the knowledge
distillation. The two components complement each other to regularize the MAE at
the data and model levels to facilitate better generalization across tasks and
reduce the risk of catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results show that
CoSMAE achieves significant improvements of up to 4.94% over state-of-the-art
CL methods applied to MAE. Our code is publicly available at:

spans at block, line, word, and point levels. We curate a new benchmark from
the CircularsVQA test set, providing fine-grained, human-verified annotations
across multiple granularities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our

Abstract: Current vision-language models (VLMs) are well-adapted for general visual
understanding tasks. However, they perform inadequately when handling complex
visual tasks related to human poses and actions due to the lack of specialized
vision-language instruction-following data. We introduce a method for
generating such data by integrating human keypoints with traditional visual
features such as captions and bounding boxes, enabling more precise
understanding of human-centric scenes. Our approach constructs a dataset
comprising 200,328 samples tailored to fine-tune models for human-centric
tasks, focusing on three areas: conversation, detailed description, and complex
reasoning. We establish an Extended Human Pose and Action Understanding
Benchmark (E-HPAUB) to assess model performance on human pose and action
understanding. We fine-tune the LLaVA-1.5-7B model using this dataset and
evaluate our resulting LLaVA-Pose model on the benchmark, achieving significant

compared to the original LLaVA-1.5-7B model. These findings highlight the

Result: PanSt3R在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，且速度显著快于现有方法。

Conclusion: PanSt3R是一种简单、快速且可扩展的方法，解决了3D场景全景分割的挑战。

Abstract: Panoptic segmentation of 3D scenes, involving the segmentation and
classification of object instances in a dense 3D reconstruction of a scene, is
a challenging problem, especially when relying solely on unposed 2D images.
Existing approaches typically leverage off-the-shelf models to extract
per-frame 2D panoptic segmentations, before optimizing an implicit geometric
representation (often based on NeRF) to integrate and fuse the 2D predictions.
We argue that relying on 2D panoptic segmentation for a problem inherently 3D
and multi-view is likely suboptimal as it fails to leverage the full potential
of spatial relationships across views. In addition to requiring camera
parameters, these approaches also necessitate computationally expensive
test-time optimization for each scene. Instead, in this work, we propose a
unified and integrated approach PanSt3R, which eliminates the need for
test-time optimization by jointly predicting 3D geometry and multi-view
panoptic segmentation in a single forward pass. Our approach builds upon recent
advances in 3D reconstruction, specifically upon MUSt3R, a scalable multi-view
version of DUSt3R, and enhances it with semantic awareness and multi-view
panoptic segmentation capabilities. We additionally revisit the standard
post-processing mask merging procedure and introduce a more principled approach
for multi-view segmentation. We also introduce a simple method for generating
novel-view predictions based on the predictions of PanSt3R and vanilla 3DGS.
Overall, the proposed PanSt3R is conceptually simple, yet fast and scalable,
and achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, while being
orders of magnitude faster than existing methods.

Abstract: Solving Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering Problems (EISP) is fundamental in
applications such as medical imaging, where the goal is to reconstruct the
relative permittivity from scattered electromagnetic field. This inverse
process is inherently ill-posed and highly nonlinear, making it particularly
challenging. A recent machine learning-based approach, Img-Interiors, shows
promising results by leveraging continuous implicit functions. However, it
requires case-specific optimization, lacks generalization to unseen data, and
fails under sparse transmitter setups (e.g., with only one transmitter). To
address these limitations, we revisit EISP from a physics-informed perspective,
reformulating it as a two stage inverse transmission-scattering process. This
formulation reveals the induced current as a generalizable intermediate
representation, effectively decoupling the nonlinear scattering process from
the ill-posed inverse problem. Built on this insight, we propose the first
generalizable physics-driven framework for EISP, comprising a current estimator
and a permittivity solver, working in an end-to-end manner. The current
estimator explicitly learns the induced current as a physical bridge between
the incident and scattered field, while the permittivity solver computes the
relative permittivity directly from the estimated induced current. This design
enables data-driven training and generalizable feed-forward prediction of
relative permittivity on unseen data while maintaining strong robustness to
transmitter sparsity. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in reconstruction accuracy, generalization, and
robustness. This work offers a fundamentally new perspective on electromagnetic
inverse scattering and represents a major step toward cost-effective practical
solutions for electromagnetic imaging.

Conclusion: ShotBench和ShotQA推动了AI在电影理解和生成领域的进步，相关资源已开源。

Abstract: Cinematography, the fundamental visual language of film, is essential for
conveying narrative, emotion, and aesthetic quality. While recent
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong general visual understanding,
their proficiency in comprehending the nuanced cinematic grammar embedded
within individual shots remains largely unexplored and lacks robust evaluation.
This critical gap limits both fine-grained visual comprehension and the
precision of AI-assisted video generation. To address this, we introduce
\textbf{ShotBench}, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for
cinematic language understanding. It features over 3.5k expert-annotated QA
pairs from images and video clips, meticulously curated from over 200 acclaimed
(predominantly Oscar-nominated) films and spanning eight key cinematography
dimensions. Our evaluation of 24 leading VLMs on ShotBench reveals their
substantial limitations: even the top-performing model achieves less than 60\%
average accuracy, particularly struggling with fine-grained visual cues and
complex spatial reasoning. To catalyze advancement in this domain, we construct
\textbf{ShotQA}, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising approximately 70k
cinematic QA pairs. Leveraging ShotQA, we develop \textbf{ShotVL} through
supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization. ShotVL
significantly outperforms all existing open-source and proprietary models on
ShotBench, establishing new \textbf{state-of-the-art} performance. We
open-source our models, data, and code to foster rapid progress in this crucial

Motivation: 解决当前场景图数据不足的问题，提供更精确和全面的关系标注。

Method: 提出CoPa-SG数据集，包含参数化关系和原型关系，用于场景图生成模型的性能比较。

Result: 展示了新关系类型如何增强下游应用的规划和推理能力。

Conclusion: CoPa-SG为场景理解提供了更丰富的数据和工具，推动了场景图技术的发展。

Abstract: 2D scene graphs provide a structural and explainable framework for scene
understanding. However, current work still struggles with the lack of accurate
scene graph data. To overcome this data bottleneck, we present CoPa-SG, a
synthetic scene graph dataset with highly precise ground truth and exhaustive
relation annotations between all objects. Moreover, we introduce parametric and
proto-relations, two new fundamental concepts for scene graphs. The former
provides a much more fine-grained representation than its traditional
counterpart by enriching relations with additional parameters such as angles or
distances. The latter encodes hypothetical relations in a scene graph and
describes how relations would form if new objects are placed in the scene.
Using CoPa-SG, we compare the performance of various scene graph generation
models. We demonstrate how our new relation types can be integrated in
downstream applications to enhance planning and reasoning capabilities.

Result: 在KITTI和Cityscapes3D数据集上验证，标注质量高且成本低。

Conclusion: ToosiCubix为高质量3D标注提供了一种经济且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Many existing methods for 3D cuboid annotation of vehicles rely on expensive
and carefully calibrated camera-LiDAR or stereo setups, limiting their
accessibility for large-scale data collection. We introduce ToosiCubix, a
simple yet powerful approach for annotating ground-truth cuboids using only
monocular images and intrinsic camera parameters. Our method requires only
about 10 user clicks per vehicle, making it highly practical for adding 3D
annotations to existing datasets originally collected without specialized
equipment. By annotating specific features (e.g., wheels, car badge,
symmetries) across different vehicle parts, we accurately estimate each
vehicle's position, orientation, and dimensions up to a scale ambiguity (8
DoF). The geometric constraints are formulated as an optimization problem,
which we solve using a coordinate descent strategy, alternating between
Perspective-n-Points (PnP) and least-squares subproblems. To handle common
ambiguities such as scale and unobserved dimensions, we incorporate
probabilistic size priors, enabling 9 DoF cuboid placements. We validate our
annotations against the KITTI and Cityscapes3D datasets, demonstrating that our
method offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for high-quality 3D cuboid
annotation.

Method: FastRef通过可优化变换矩阵实现查询特征到原型的特征转移，并通过原型对齐抑制异常。使用最优传输（OT）处理非高斯特征。

Result: 在MVTec、ViSA、MPDD和RealIAD四个基准数据集上，FastRef与多种FS-IAD方法结合，表现出高效性和有效性。

Conclusion: FastRef在少样本设置下显著提升了原型代表性和异常检测性能，计算效率高。

Abstract: Few-shot industrial anomaly detection (FS-IAD) presents a critical challenge
for practical automated inspection systems operating in data-scarce
environments. While existing approaches predominantly focus on deriving
prototypes from limited normal samples, they typically neglect to
systematically incorporate query image statistics to enhance prototype
representativeness. To address this issue, we propose FastRef, a novel and
efficient prototype refinement framework for FS-IAD. Our method operates
through an iterative two-stage process: (1) characteristic transfer from query
features to prototypes via an optimizable transformation matrix, and (2)
anomaly suppression through prototype alignment. The characteristic transfer is
achieved through linear reconstruction of query features from prototypes, while
the anomaly suppression addresses a key observation in FS-IAD that unlike
conventional IAD with abundant normal prototypes, the limited-sample setting
makes anomaly reconstruction more probable. Therefore, we employ optimal
transport (OT) for non-Gaussian sampled features to measure and minimize the
gap between prototypes and their refined counterparts for anomaly suppression.
For comprehensive evaluation, we integrate FastRef with three competitive
prototype-based FS-IAD methods: PatchCore, FastRecon, WinCLIP, and AnomalyDINO.
Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets of MVTec, ViSA, MPDD and
RealIAD demonstrate both the effectiveness and computational efficiency of our
approach under 1/2/4-shots.

Motivation: 现有方法采用两阶段流程（边缘点云重建和参数曲线拟合），存在优化间隙导致的误差累积问题。本文旨在通过一阶段方法直接优化3D参数曲线。

Method: 提出了一种双向耦合机制，将参数曲线与边缘导向的高斯组件结合，形成可微渲染的曲线感知高斯表示（CurveGaussian），并引入动态自适应拓扑优化框架。

Result: 在ABC数据集和真实场景基准测试中，该方法优于两阶段方法，重建结果更干净、更鲁棒，且训练参数更少。

Conclusion: 该方法通过直接优化参数曲线，实现了更高的效率和性能，为3D曲线重建提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end framework for reconstructing 3D parametric
curves directly from multi-view edge maps. Contrasting with existing two-stage
methods that follow a sequential ``edge point cloud reconstruction and
parametric curve fitting'' pipeline, our one-stage approach optimizes 3D
parametric curves directly from 2D edge maps, eliminating error accumulation
caused by the inherent optimization gap between disconnected stages. However,
parametric curves inherently lack suitability for rendering-based multi-view
optimization, necessitating a complementary representation that preserves their
geometric properties while enabling differentiable rendering. We propose a
novel bi-directional coupling mechanism between parametric curves and
edge-oriented Gaussian components. This tight correspondence formulates a
curve-aware Gaussian representation, \textbf{CurveGaussian}, that enables
differentiable rendering of 3D curves, allowing direct optimization guided by
multi-view evidence. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamically adaptive topology
optimization framework during training to refine curve structures through
linearization, merging, splitting, and pruning operations. Comprehensive
evaluations on the ABC dataset and real-world benchmarks demonstrate our
one-stage method's superiority over two-stage alternatives, particularly in
producing cleaner and more robust reconstructions. Additionally, by directly
optimizing parametric curves, our method significantly reduces the parameter
count during training, achieving both higher efficiency and superior
performance compared to existing approaches.

Result: XVerse实现了高保真、可编辑的多主题图像合成，并能独立控制每个主题的特征和语义属性。

Conclusion: XVerse显著提升了复杂场景和个性化图像生成的能力。

Abstract: Achieving fine-grained control over subject identity and semantic attributes
(pose, style, lighting) in text-to-image generation, particularly for multiple
subjects, often undermines the editability and coherence of Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs). Many approaches introduce artifacts or suffer from
attribute entanglement. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
multi-subject controlled generation model XVerse. By transforming reference
images into offsets for token-specific text-stream modulation, XVerse allows
for precise and independent control for specific subject without disrupting
image latents or features. Consequently, XVerse offers high-fidelity, editable
multi-subject image synthesis with robust control over individual subject
characteristics and semantic attributes. This advancement significantly
improves personalized and complex scene generation capabilities.

Conclusion: 结合几何约束和深度正则化的3DGS SLAM方法在内窥镜场景中表现出色，适用于静态和动态手术场景。

Abstract: Efficient three-dimensional reconstruction and real-time visualization are
critical in surgical scenarios such as endoscopy. In recent years, 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable performance in efficient 3D
reconstruction and rendering. Most 3DGS-based Simultaneous Localization and
Mapping (SLAM) methods only rely on the appearance constraints for optimizing
both 3DGS and camera poses. However, in endoscopic scenarios, the challenges
include photometric inconsistencies caused by non-Lambertian surfaces and
dynamic motion from breathing affects the performance of SLAM systems. To
address these issues, we additionally introduce optical flow loss as a
geometric constraint, which effectively constrains both the 3D structure of the
scene and the camera motion. Furthermore, we propose a depth regularisation
strategy to mitigate the problem of photometric inconsistencies and ensure the
validity of 3DGS depth rendering in endoscopic scenes. In addition, to improve
scene representation in the SLAM system, we improve the 3DGS refinement
strategy by focusing on viewpoints corresponding to Keyframes with suboptimal
rendering quality frames, achieving better rendering results. Extensive
experiments on the C3VD static dataset and the StereoMIS dynamic dataset
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
novel view synthesis and pose estimation, exhibiting high performance in both
static and dynamic surgical scenes. The source code will be publicly available
upon paper acceptance.

Conclusion: HyperSORT能够有效识别和表征医学影像数据集中的偏差，提升分割网络的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Medical imaging datasets often contain heterogeneous biases ranging from
erroneous labels to inconsistent labeling styles. Such biases can negatively
impact deep segmentation networks performance. Yet, the identification and
characterization of such biases is a particularly tedious and challenging task.
In this paper, we introduce HyperSORT, a framework using a hyper-network
predicting UNets' parameters from latent vectors representing both the image
and annotation variability. The hyper-network parameters and the latent vector
collection corresponding to each data sample from the training set are jointly
learned. Hence, instead of optimizing a single neural network to fit a dataset,
HyperSORT learns a complex distribution of UNet parameters where low density
areas can capture noise-specific patterns while larger modes robustly segment
organs in differentiated but meaningful manners. We validate our method on two
3D abdominal CT public datasets: first a synthetically perturbed version of the
AMOS dataset, and TotalSegmentator, a large scale dataset containing real
unknown biases and errors. Our experiments show that HyperSORT creates a
structured mapping of the dataset allowing the identification of relevant
systematic biases and erroneous samples. Latent space clusters yield UNet
parameters performing the segmentation task in accordance with the underlying
learned systematic bias. The code and our analysis of the TotalSegmentator
dataset are made available: https://github.com/ImFusionGmbH/HyperSORT

Abstract: Atypical mitoses mark a deviation in the cell division process that can be an
independent prognostically relevant marker for tumor malignancy. However, their
identification remains challenging due to low prevalence, at times subtle
morphological differences from normal mitoses, low inter-rater agreement among
pathologists, and class imbalance in datasets. Building on the Atypical Mitosis
dataset for Breast Cancer (AMi-Br), this study presents a comprehensive
benchmark comparing deep learning approaches for automated atypical mitotic
figure (AMF) classification, including baseline models, foundation models with
linear probing, and foundation models fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation
(LoRA). For rigorous evaluation, we further introduce two new hold-out AMF
datasets - AtNorM-Br, a dataset of mitoses from the The TCGA breast cancer
cohort, and AtNorM-MD, a multi-domain dataset of mitoses from the MIDOG++
training set. We found average balanced accuracy values of up to 0.8135,
0.7696, and 0.7705 on the in-domain AMi-Br and the out-of-domain AtNorm-Br and
AtNorM-MD datasets, respectively, with the results being particularly good for
LoRA-based adaptation of the Virchow-line of foundation models. Our work shows
that atypical mitosis classification, while being a challenging problem, can be
effectively addressed through the use of recent advances in transfer learning
and model fine-tuning techniques. We make available all code and data used in
this paper in this github repository:

Abstract: Image editing approaches have become more powerful and flexible with the
advent of powerful text-conditioned generative models. However, placing objects
in an environment with a precise location and orientation still remains a
challenge, as this typically requires carefully crafted inpainting masks or
prompts. In this work, we show that a carefully designed visual map, combined
with coarse object masks, is sufficient for high quality object placement. We
design a conditioning signal that resolves ambiguities, while being flexible
enough to allow for changing of shapes or object orientations. By building on
an inpainting model, we leave the background intact by design, in contrast to
methods that model objects and background jointly. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in the automotive setting, where we compare
different conditioning signals in novel object placement tasks. These tasks are
designed to measure edit quality not only in terms of appearance, but also in
terms of pose and location accuracy, including cases that require non-trivial
shape changes. Lastly, we show that fine location control can be combined with
appearance control to place existing objects in precise locations in a scene.

Abstract: Underground mining operations face significant safety challenges that make
emergency response capabilities crucial. While robots have shown promise in
assisting with search and rescue operations, their effectiveness depends on
reliable miner detection capabilities. Deep learning algorithms offer potential
solutions for automated miner detection, but require comprehensive training
datasets, which are currently lacking for underground mining environments. This
paper presents a novel thermal imaging dataset specifically designed to enable
the development and validation of miner detection systems for potential
emergency applications. We systematically captured thermal imagery of various
mining activities and scenarios to create a robust foundation for detection
algorithms. To establish baseline performance metrics, we evaluated several
state-of-the-art object detection algorithms including YOLOv8, YOLOv10, YOLO11,
and RT-DETR on our dataset. While not exhaustive of all possible emergency
situations, this dataset serves as a crucial first step toward developing
reliable thermal-based miner detection systems that could eventually be
deployed in real emergency scenarios. This work demonstrates the feasibility of
using thermal imaging for miner detection and establishes a foundation for
future research in this critical safety application.

Motivation: 高引导尺度在增强条件扩散模型性能的同时，常导致过饱和和不真实伪影，低频信号中的冗余信息积累是主要原因。

Method: 提出LF-CFG方法，通过自适应阈值定位冗余信息，并根据低频信息变化率确定合理阈值，采用降权策略减少冗余信息影响。

Result: 实验表明，LF-CFG在多种扩散模型（如Stable Diffusion-XL等）中有效缓解了过饱和和不真实伪影问题。

Conclusion: LF-CFG通过低频信号改进，显著提升了条件扩散模型的生成质量。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) succeeds in condition diffusion models that
use a guidance scale to balance the influence of conditional and unconditional
terms. A high guidance scale is used to enhance the performance of the
conditional term. However, the high guidance scale often results in
oversaturation and unrealistic artifacts. In this paper, we introduce a new
perspective based on low-frequency signals, identifying the accumulation of
redundant information in these signals as the key factor behind oversaturation
and unrealistic artifacts. Building on this insight, we propose low-frequency
improved classifier-free guidance (LF-CFG) to mitigate these issues.
Specifically, we introduce an adaptive threshold-based measurement to pinpoint
the locations of redundant information. We determine a reasonable threshold by
analyzing the change rate of low-frequency information between prior and
current steps. We then apply a down-weight strategy to reduce the impact of
redundant information in the low-frequency signals. Experimental results
demonstrate that LF-CFG effectively alleviates oversaturation and unrealistic
artifacts across various diffusion models, including Stable Diffusion-XL,
Stable Diffusion 2.1, 3.0, 3.5, and SiT-XL.

Conclusion: 混合信号方法能适应多样化的交通模式，尤其在区域交通分布不均时表现更佳。

Abstract: The turning movement count data is crucial for traffic signal design,
intersection geometry planning, traffic flow, and congestion analysis. This
work proposes three methods called dynamic, static, and hybrid configuration
for TMC-based traffic signals. A vision-based tracking system is developed to
estimate the TMC of six intersections in Las Vegas using traffic cameras. The
intersection design, route (e.g. vehicle movement directions), and signal
configuration files with compatible formats are synthesized and imported into
Simulation of Urban MObility for signal evaluation with realistic data. The
initial experimental results based on estimated waiting times indicate that the
cycle time of 90 and 120 seconds works best for all intersections. In addition,
four intersections show better performance for dynamic signal timing
configuration, and the other two with lower performance have a lower ratio of
total vehicle count to total lanes of the intersection leg. Since daily traffic
flow often exhibits a bimodal pattern, we propose a hybrid signal method that
switches between dynamic and static methods, adapting to peak and off-peak
traffic conditions for improved flow management. So, a built-in traffic
generator module creates vehicle routes for 4 hours, including peak hours, and
a signal design module produces signal schedule cycles according to static,
dynamic, and hybrid methods. Vehicle count distributions are weighted
differently for each zone (i.e., West, North, East, South) to generate diverse
traffic patterns. The extended experimental results for 6 intersections with 4
hours of simulation time imply that zone-based traffic pattern distributions
affect signal design selection. Although the static method works great for
evenly zone-based traffic distribution, the hybrid method works well for highly
weighted traffic at intersection pairs of the West-East and North-South zones.

Abstract: Learning the hierarchical structure of data in vision-language models is a
significant challenge. Previous works have attempted to address this challenge
by employing entailment learning. However, these approaches fail to model the
transitive nature of entailment explicitly, which establishes the relationship
between order and semantics within a representation space. In this work, we
introduce Radial Cross-Modal Embeddings (RCME), a framework that enables the
explicit modeling of transitivity-enforced entailment. Our proposed framework
optimizes for the partial order of concepts within vision-language models. By
leveraging our framework, we develop a hierarchical vision-language foundation
model capable of representing the hierarchy in the Tree of Life. Our
experiments on hierarchical species classification and hierarchical retrieval
tasks demonstrate the enhanced performance of our models compared to the
existing state-of-the-art models. Our code and models are open-sourced at

Abstract: Deep neural networks have set the state-of-the-art in computer vision tasks
such as bounding box detection and semantic segmentation. Object detectors and
segmentation models assign confidence scores to predictions, reflecting the
model's uncertainty in object detection or pixel-wise classification. However,
these confidence estimates are often miscalibrated, as their architectures and
loss functions are tailored to task performance rather than probabilistic
foundation. Even with well calibrated predictions, object detectors fail to
quantify uncertainty outside detected bounding boxes, i.e., the model does not
make a probability assessment of whether an area without detected objects is
truly free of obstacles. This poses a safety risk in applications such as
automated driving, where uncertainty in empty areas remains unexplored. In this
work, we propose an object detection model grounded in spatial statistics.
Bounding box data matches realizations of a marked point process, commonly used
to describe the probabilistic occurrence of spatial point events identified as
bounding box centers, where marks are used to describe the spatial extension of
bounding boxes and classes. Our statistical framework enables a
likelihood-based training and provides well-defined confidence estimates for
whether a region is drivable, i.e., free of objects. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method through calibration assessments and evaluation of
performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出动态对数校准（DLC）方法，通过动态调整生成文本与视觉证据的对齐，减少大视觉语言模型（LVLM）中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练无关的解码策略存在静态约束、效率低下和细节丢失等问题，无法有效解决LVLM中的幻觉问题。

Method: DLC在解码阶段利用CLIP评估图像与生成文本的语义对齐，并通过相对视觉优势（RVA）动态调整候选词的对数概率。

Result: 实验表明，DLC显著减少幻觉，优于现有方法，同时保持高效推理。

Conclusion: DLC是一种高效且有效的解码时解决方案，可提升LVLM的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated significant
advancements in multimodal understanding, yet they are frequently hampered by
hallucination-the generation of text that contradicts visual input. Existing
training-free decoding strategies exhibit critical limitations, including the
use of static constraints that do not adapt to semantic drift during
generation, inefficiency stemming from the need for multiple forward passes,
and degradation of detail due to overly rigid intervention rules. To overcome
these challenges, this paper introduces Dynamic Logits Calibration (DLC), a
novel training-free decoding framework designed to dynamically align text
generation with visual evidence at inference time. At the decoding phase, DLC
step-wise employs CLIP to assess the semantic alignment between the input image
and the generated text sequence. Then, the Relative Visual Advantage (RVA) of
candidate tokens is evaluated against a dynamically updated contextual
baseline, adaptively adjusting output logits to favor tokens that are visually
grounded. Furthermore, an adaptive weighting mechanism, informed by a real-time
context alignment score, carefully balances the visual guidance while ensuring
the overall quality of the textual output. Extensive experiments conducted
across diverse benchmarks and various LVLM architectures (such as LLaVA,
InstructBLIP, and MiniGPT-4) demonstrate that DLC significantly reduces
hallucinations, outperforming current methods while maintaining high inference
efficiency by avoiding multiple forward passes. Overall, we present an
effective and efficient decoding-time solution to mitigate hallucinations,
thereby enhancing the reliability of LVLMs for more practices. Code will be
released on Github.

Motivation: 现有方法在固定视角和小规模音频变化下表现良好，但难以处理大角度头部旋转和分布外音频，且需要耗时的身份特定训练。

Method: 采用两阶段先验适应训练策略，学习高斯头部先验并适应个体特征，包括音频-表情和表情-视觉先验，以及颜色MLP和身体修复器。

Result: GGTalker在渲染质量、3D一致性、唇同步准确性和训练效率上达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: GGTalker通过通用先验和身份适应，显著提升了语音驱动3D说话头的生成质量和泛化能力。

Abstract: Creating high-quality, generalizable speech-driven 3D talking heads remains a
persistent challenge. Previous methods achieve satisfactory results for fixed
viewpoints and small-scale audio variations, but they struggle with large head
rotations and out-of-distribution (OOD) audio. Moreover, they are constrained
by the need for time-consuming, identity-specific training. We believe the core
issue lies in the lack of sufficient 3D priors, which limits the extrapolation
capabilities of synthesized talking heads. To address this, we propose
GGTalker, which synthesizes talking heads through a combination of
generalizable priors and identity-specific adaptation. We introduce a two-stage
Prior-Adaptation training strategy to learn Gaussian head priors and adapt to
individual characteristics. We train Audio-Expression and Expression-Visual
priors to capture the universal patterns of lip movements and the general
distribution of head textures. During the Customized Adaptation, individual
speaking styles and texture details are precisely modeled. Additionally, we
introduce a color MLP to generate fine-grained, motion-aligned textures and a
Body Inpainter to blend rendered results with the background, producing
indistinguishable, photorealistic video frames. Comprehensive experiments show
that GGTalker achieves state-of-the-art performance in rendering quality, 3D
consistency, lip-sync accuracy, and training efficiency.

Conclusion: G²D有效解决模态不平衡，提升多模态学习性能。

Abstract: Multimodal learning aims to leverage information from diverse data modalities
to achieve more comprehensive performance. However, conventional multimodal
models often suffer from modality imbalance, where one or a few modalities
dominate model optimization, leading to suboptimal feature representation and
underutilization of weak modalities. To address this challenge, we introduce
Gradient-Guided Distillation (G$^{2}$D), a knowledge distillation framework
that optimizes the multimodal model with a custom-built loss function that
fuses both unimodal and multimodal objectives. G$^{2}$D further incorporates a
dynamic sequential modality prioritization (SMP) technique in the learning
process to ensure each modality leads the learning process, avoiding the
pitfall of stronger modalities overshadowing weaker ones. We validate G$^{2}$D
on multiple real-world datasets and show that G$^{2}$D amplifies the
significance of weak modalities while training and outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in classification and regression tasks. Our code is available at

Result: 实验表明，该方法能够提供完整的车辆多视角表示，支持显著改变配置的逼真合成。

Conclusion: MADrive通过记忆增强和3D资产替换，显著提升了场景重建的灵活性和逼真度。

Abstract: Recent advances in scene reconstruction have pushed toward highly realistic
modeling of autonomous driving (AD) environments using 3D Gaussian splatting.
However, the resulting reconstructions remain closely tied to the original
observations and struggle to support photorealistic synthesis of significantly
altered or novel driving scenarios. This work introduces MADrive, a
memory-augmented reconstruction framework designed to extend the capabilities
of existing scene reconstruction methods by replacing observed vehicles with
visually similar 3D assets retrieved from a large-scale external memory bank.
Specifically, we release MAD-Cars, a curated dataset of ${\sim}70$K 360{\deg}
car videos captured in the wild and present a retrieval module that finds the
most similar car instances in the memory bank, reconstructs the corresponding
3D assets from video, and integrates them into the target scene through
orientation alignment and relighting. The resulting replacements provide
complete multi-view representations of vehicles in the scene, enabling
photorealistic synthesis of substantially altered configurations, as
demonstrated in our experiments. Project page:

high-resolution warping, achieving better accuracy with lower memory cost. This
design challenges the conventional wisdom that constructing cost volumes is
necessary for strong performance. WAFT is a simple and flexible
meta-architecture with minimal inductive biases and reliance on custom designs.
Compared with existing methods, WAFT ranks 1st on Spring and KITTI benchmarks,
achieves the best zero-shot generalization on KITTI, while being up to 4.1x

Result: 在MS-COCO和Flickr30k数据集上实现了最先进的性能，且无需外部数据。

Conclusion: 新方法有效解决了集合表示中的问题，提升了跨模态检索性能。

Abstract: Cross-modal image-text retrieval is challenging because of the diverse
possible associations between content from different modalities. Traditional
methods learn a single-vector embedding to represent semantics of each sample,
but struggle to capture nuanced and diverse relationships that can exist across
modalities. Set-based approaches, which represent each sample with multiple
embeddings, offer a promising alternative, as they can capture richer and more
diverse relationships. In this paper, we show that, despite their promise,
these set-based representations continue to face issues including sparse
supervision and set collapse, which limits their effectiveness. To address
these challenges, we propose Maximal Pair Assignment Similarity to optimize
one-to-one matching between embedding sets which preserve semantic diversity
within the set. We also introduce two loss functions to further enhance the
representations: Global Discriminative Loss to enhance distinction among
embeddings, and Intra-Set Divergence Loss to prevent collapse within each set.
Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on MS-COCO and Flickr30k
without relying on external data.

Motivation: Mamba方法在点云表示学习中表现出色，但仍存在破坏3D点邻接关系和长序列记忆丢失的问题。

Method: 设计了空间状态代理保留空间依赖，增强SSM的状态更新策略，并引入轻量卷积和序列长度自适应策略。

Result: 在四个下游任务中表现优异，ModelNet40准确率达95.1%，ScanObjectNN达92.75%。

Conclusion: StruMamba3D通过改进空间依赖性和序列适应性，显著提升了点云表示学习的性能。

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based methods have demonstrated impressive performance in
point cloud representation learning by leveraging State Space Model (SSM) with
the efficient context modeling ability and linear complexity. However, these
methods still face two key issues that limit the potential of SSM: Destroying
the adjacency of 3D points during SSM processing and failing to retain
long-sequence memory as the input length increases in downstream tasks. To
address these issues, we propose StruMamba3D, a novel paradigm for
self-supervised point cloud representation learning. It enjoys several merits.
First, we design spatial states and use them as proxies to preserve spatial
dependencies among points. Second, we enhance the SSM with a state-wise update
strategy and incorporate a lightweight convolution to facilitate interactions
between spatial states for efficient structure modeling. Third, our method
reduces the sensitivity of pre-trained Mamba-based models to varying input
lengths by introducing a sequence length-adaptive strategy. Experimental
results across four downstream tasks showcase the superior performance of our
method. In addition, our method attains the SOTA 95.1% accuracy on ModelNet40
and 92.75% accuracy on the most challenging split of ScanObjectNN without
voting strategy.

Conclusion: 该方法在遮挡感知重建方面表现优异，并提供了首个标准化基准用于未来方法评估。

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D objects from a single image is a long-standing challenge,
especially under real-world occlusions. While recent diffusion-based view
synthesis models can generate consistent novel views from a single RGB image,
they generally assume fully visible inputs and fail when parts of the object
are occluded. This leads to inconsistent views and degraded 3D reconstruction
quality. To overcome this limitation, we propose an end-to-end framework for
occlusion-aware multi-view generation. Our method directly synthesizes six
structurally consistent novel views from a single partially occluded image,
enabling downstream 3D reconstruction without requiring prior inpainting or
manual annotations. We construct a self-supervised training pipeline using the
Pix2Gestalt dataset, leveraging occluded-unoccluded image pairs and
pseudo-ground-truth views to teach the model structure-aware completion and
view consistency. Without modifying the original architecture, we fully
fine-tune the view synthesis model to jointly learn completion and multi-view
generation. Additionally, we introduce the first benchmark for occlusion-aware
reconstruction, encompassing diverse occlusion levels, object categories, and
mask patterns. This benchmark provides a standardized protocol for evaluating
future methods under partial occlusions. Our code is available at

Abstract: We present SAM4D, a multi-modal and temporal foundation model designed for
promptable segmentation across camera and LiDAR streams. Unified Multi-modal
Positional Encoding (UMPE) is introduced to align camera and LiDAR features in
a shared 3D space, enabling seamless cross-modal prompting and interaction.
Additionally, we propose Motion-aware Cross-modal Memory Attention (MCMA),
which leverages ego-motion compensation to enhance temporal consistency and
long-horizon feature retrieval, ensuring robust segmentation across dynamically
changing autonomous driving scenes. To avoid annotation bottlenecks, we develop
a multi-modal automated data engine that synergizes VFM-driven video masklets,
spatiotemporal 4D reconstruction, and cross-modal masklet fusion. This
framework generates camera-LiDAR aligned pseudo-labels at a speed orders of
magnitude faster than human annotation while preserving VFM-derived semantic
fidelity in point cloud representations. We conduct extensive experiments on
the constructed Waymo-4DSeg, which demonstrate the powerful cross-modal
segmentation ability and great potential in data annotation of proposed SAM4D.

Abstract: We propose SiM3D, the first benchmark considering the integration of
multiview and multimodal information for comprehensive 3D anomaly detection and
segmentation (ADS), where the task is to produce a voxel-based Anomaly Volume.
Moreover, SiM3D focuses on a scenario of high interest in manufacturing:
single-instance anomaly detection, where only one object, either real or
synthetic, is available for training. In this respect, SiM3D stands out as the
first ADS benchmark that addresses the challenge of generalising from synthetic
training data to real test data. SiM3D includes a novel multimodal multiview
dataset acquired using top-tier industrial sensors and robots. The dataset
features multiview high-resolution images (12 Mpx) and point clouds (7M points)
for 333 instances of eight types of objects, alongside a CAD model for each
type. We also provide manually annotated 3D segmentation GTs for anomalous test
samples. To establish reference baselines for the proposed multiview 3D ADS
task, we adapt prominent singleview methods and assess their performance using
novel metrics that operate on Anomaly Volumes.

Method: 将场景表示为3D凸基元的组合，支持不同数量的基元表示同一场景；编辑后，基于深度和纹理提示的流式方法生成图像。

Result: 在视觉保真度、可编辑性和组合泛化性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在场景编辑和图像生成方面表现出色，为交互式图像生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: We describe Generative Blocks World to interact with the scene of a generated
image by manipulating simple geometric abstractions. Our method represents
scenes as assemblies of convex 3D primitives, and the same scene can be
represented by different numbers of primitives, allowing an editor to move
either whole structures or small details. Once the scene geometry has been
edited, the image is generated by a flow-based method which is conditioned on
depth and a texture hint. Our texture hint takes into account the modified 3D
primitives, exceeding texture-consistency provided by existing key-value
caching techniques. These texture hints (a) allow accurate object and camera
moves and (b) largely preserve the identity of objects depicted. Quantitative
and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior
works in visual fidelity, editability, and compositional generalization.

Abstract: We present 3DGH, an unconditional generative model for 3D human heads with

modeling of hair and face, we propose to separate them using a novel data
representation with template-based 3D Gaussian Splatting, in which deformable
hair geometry is introduced to capture the geometric variations across
different hairstyles. Based on this data representation, we design a 3D
GAN-based architecture with dual generators and employ a cross-attention
mechanism to model the inherent correlation between hair and face. The model is
trained on synthetic renderings using carefully designed objectives to
stabilize training and facilitate hair-face separation. We conduct extensive
experiments to validate the design choice of 3DGH, and evaluate it both
qualitatively and quantitatively by comparing with several state-of-the-art 3D
GAN methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in unconditional full-head image

Abstract: Current texture synthesis methods, which generate textures from fixed

geometry-aware conditions, enabling precise utilization of 3D mesh structures.
Additionally, we propose a structure-wise UV diffusion strategy, which enhances
the generation of occluded areas by preserving semantic information, resulting
in smoother and more coherent textures. VideoTex not only achieves smoother
transitions across UV boundaries but also ensures high-quality, temporally
stable textures across video frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
VideoTex outperforms existing methods in texture fidelity, seam blending, and
stability, paving the way for dynamic real-time applications that demand both

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注角色一致性和基本动作，缺乏对风格化背景和电影化叙事的支持。FairyGen旨在填补这一空白，实现更具表现力和连贯性的故事动画。

Method: 系统通过MLLM生成结构化故事板，风格传播适配器确保视觉一致性，镜头设计模块增强多样性，3D代理角色生成物理合理动作，两阶段运动定制适配器优化动画。

Result: 实验表明，FairyGen生成的动画风格忠实、叙事结构化且动作自然，适用于个性化故事动画。

Conclusion: FairyGen在保持艺术风格的同时实现了高质量的故事动画生成，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: We propose FairyGen, an automatic system for generating story-driven cartoon
videos from a single child's drawing, while faithfully preserving its unique
artistic style. Unlike previous storytelling methods that primarily focus on
character consistency and basic motion, FairyGen explicitly disentangles
character modeling from stylized background generation and incorporates
cinematic shot design to support expressive and coherent storytelling. Given a
single character sketch, we first employ an MLLM to generate a structured
storyboard with shot-level descriptions that specify environment settings,
character actions, and camera perspectives. To ensure visual consistency, we
introduce a style propagation adapter that captures the character's visual
style and applies it to the background, faithfully retaining the character's
full visual identity while synthesizing style-consistent scenes. A shot design
module further enhances visual diversity and cinematic quality through frame
cropping and multi-view synthesis based on the storyboard. To animate the
story, we reconstruct a 3D proxy of the character to derive physically
plausible motion sequences, which are then used to fine-tune an MMDiT-based
image-to-video diffusion model. We further propose a two-stage motion
customization adapter: the first stage learns appearance features from
temporally unordered frames, disentangling identity from motion; the second

*Pin Ren,Yan Gao,Zhichun Li,Yan Chen,Benjamin Watson*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: IDGraphs是一种交互式可视化系统，用于检测和分析网络流量中的异常和攻击，解决了现有IDS系统的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有IDS系统在交互式检查入侵、分析蠕虫传播模式和发现相关攻击方面支持有限，而高速路由器流量增长使这些问题更加突出。

Method: IDGraphs通过流级跟踪和时间轴可视化，结合Histographs技术汇总数据，用户可交互查询和分析。

Result: 应用于1.16TB的真实网络数据集，成功检测端口扫描、蠕虫爆发、TCP SYN洪水等多种攻击。

Conclusion: IDGraphs提供了一种高效的方法来检测和分析复杂网络攻击，弥补了传统统计分析的不足。

Abstract: Traffic anomalies and attacks are commonplace in today's networks and
identifying them rapidly and accurately is critical for large network
operators. For a statistical intrusion detection system (IDS), it is crucial to
detect at the flow-level for accurate detection and mitigation. However,
existing IDS systems offer only limited support for 1) interactively examining
detected intrusions and anomalies, 2) analyzing worm propagation patterns, 3)
and discovering correlated attacks. These problems are becoming even more acute
as the traffic on today's high-speed routers continues to grow.
  IDGraphs is an interactive visualization system for intrusion detection that
addresses these challenges. The central visualization in the system is a
flow-level trace plotted with time on the horizontal axis and aggregated number
of unsuccessful connections on the vertical axis. We then summarize a stack of
tens or hundreds of thousands of these traces using the Histographs [RW05]
technique, which maps data frequency at each pixel to brightness. Users may
then interactively query the summary view, performing analysis by highlighting
subsets of the traces. For example, brushing a linked correlation matrix view
highlights traces with similar patterns, revealing distributed attacks that are
difficult to detect using standard statistical analysis.
  We apply IDGraphs system to a real network router data-set with 179M
flow-level records representing a total traffic of 1.16TB. The system
successfully detects and analyzes a variety of attacks and anomalies, including
port scanning, worm outbreaks, stealthy TCP SYN floodings, and some distributed
attacks.

### [119] [Towards Probabilistic Question Answering Over Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20747)
*Chen Shen,Sajjadur Rahman,Estevam Hruschka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了LUCARIO基准和框架，用于处理表格数据上的概率性问答问题，结合贝叶斯网络和大型语言模型，显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有QA系统（如NL2SQL）在处理事实性问题时表现良好，但在需要不确定性推理的概率性问题上表现不足。

Method: 通过从表格中构建贝叶斯网络，将自然语言查询转化为概率查询，并利用大型语言模型生成最终答案。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在基准测试中显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 混合符号-神经推理方法在处理概率性问答问题上具有显著优势。

Abstract: Current approaches for question answering (QA) over tabular data, such as
NL2SQL systems, perform well for factual questions where answers are directly
retrieved from tables. However, they fall short on probabilistic questions
requiring reasoning under uncertainty. In this paper, we introduce a new
benchmark LUCARIO and a framework for probabilistic QA over large tabular data.
Our method induces Bayesian Networks from tables, translates natural language
queries into probabilistic queries, and uses large language models (LLMs) to
generate final answers. Empirical results demonstrate significant improvements
over baselines, highlighting the benefits of hybrid symbolic-neural reasoning.

### [120] [Multi-lingual Functional Evaluation for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20793)
*Victor Ojewale,Inioluwa Deborah Raji,Suresh Venkatasubramanian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出多语言功能基准测试CL-GSM Symbolic和CL-IFEval，以补充静态基准测试的不足，揭示模型在多语言环境中的实际表现和鲁棒性差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态多语言基准测试（如Belebele、M-MMLU、M-GSM）未能充分评估模型在多语言环境中的实际性能和鲁棒性，因此需要更贴近实际的功能性基准测试。

Method: 通过将现有的功能性基准测试模板从英语翻译为五种语言（法语、西班牙语、印地语、阿拉伯语和约鲁巴语），创建了CL-GSM Symbolic和CL-IFEval。

Result: 结果显示，某些静态基准测试（如M-MMLU）与功能性基准测试的性能差异较小（0.5%-3%），而其他（如M-GSM和Belebele）差异较大（15%-24%）。此外，模型在不同语言中的鲁棒性差异显著，英语和阿拉伯语表现最稳定。

Conclusion: 功能性基准测试能更准确地评估多语言模型的性能，且不同语言间的鲁棒性差异显著，需进一步优化模型设计。

Abstract: Multi-lingual competence in large language models is often evaluated via
static data benchmarks such as Belebele, M-MMLU and M-GSM. However, these
evaluations often fail to provide an adequate understanding of the practical
performance and robustness of models across multi-lingual settings. In
response, we create multi-lingual functional benchmarks -- Cross-Lingual Grade
School Math Symbolic (CL-GSM Symbolic) and Cross-Lingual Instruction-Following
Eval (CL-IFEval)-- by translating existing functional benchmark templates from
English to five additional languages that span the range of resources available
for NLP: French, Spanish, Hindi, Arabic and Yoruba. Our results reveal that
some static multi-lingual benchmarks capture functional performance much more
closely than others (i.e. across models, there is a 24%, 17% and 18% decrease
in performance between M-GSM and CL-GSM Symbolic in English, French and Spanish
respectively; similarly there's a 15 - 24% performance drop across languages
between Belebele and CL-IFEval, and only a 0.5% to 3% performance drop between
M-MMLU and CL-IFEval). Similarly, we find that model robustness across
languages varies significantly, with certain languages (eg. Arabic, English)
being the most consistently well performing across evaluation iterations.

### [121] [The Ideation-Execution Gap: Execution Outcomes of LLM-Generated versus Human Research Ideas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20803)
*Chenglei Si,Tatsunori Hashimoto,Diyi Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，虽然LLM生成的研究想法在初始阶段被认为更具新颖性，但在实际执行后，其评分显著下降，表明LLM生成的想法在执行效果上不如人类专家。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI生成的研究想法是否能在实际执行后产生更好的研究成果。

Method: 招募43位专家研究人员，随机分配执行LLM生成或人类专家提出的研究想法，并撰写短论文。所有项目由NLP专家盲审。

Result: 执行后，LLM生成想法的评分显著下降，多项指标显示人类想法优于LLM生成想法。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在生成真正有效的研究想法上存在局限，且缺乏执行结果时难以准确评估研究想法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in accelerating the
scientific research pipeline. A key capability for this process is the ability
to generate novel research ideas, and prior studies have found settings in
which LLM-generated research ideas were judged as more novel than human-expert
ideas. However, a good idea should not simply appear to be novel, it should
also result in better research after being executed. To test whether
AI-generated ideas lead to better research outcomes, we conduct an execution
study by recruiting 43 expert researchers to execute randomly-assigned ideas,
either written by experts or generated by an LLM. Each expert spent over 100
hours implementing the idea and wrote a 4-page short paper to document the
experiments. All the executed projects are then reviewed blindly by expert NLP
researchers. Comparing the review scores of the same ideas before and after
execution, the scores of the LLM-generated ideas decrease significantly more
than expert-written ideas on all evaluation metrics (novelty, excitement,
effectiveness, and overall; p < 0.05), closing the gap between LLM and human
ideas observed at the ideation stage. When comparing the aggregated review
scores from the execution study, we even observe that for many metrics there is
a flip in rankings where human ideas score higher than LLM ideas. This
ideation-execution gap highlights the limitations of current LLMs in generating
truly effective research ideas and the challenge of evaluating research ideas
in the absence of execution outcomes.

*Chinmay Gondhalekar,Urjitkumar Patel,Fang-Chun Yeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MultiFinRAG是一个专为金融QA设计的检索增强生成框架，通过多模态提取和动态检索策略，显著提升了复杂金融文档问答的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融文档通常包含多种模态（文本、表格、图像），传统LLMs和RAG方法因令牌限制和跨模态上下文碎片化而难以处理。

Method: MultiFinRAG通过轻量级多模态LLM提取结构化JSON和文本摘要，结合模态感知检索和动态回退策略实现跨模态推理。

Result: 在复杂金融QA任务中，MultiFinRAG比ChatGPT-4o（免费版）准确率高出19个百分点。

Conclusion: MultiFinRAG在有限硬件条件下有效解决了金融多模态文档的问答挑战。

Abstract: Financial documents--such as 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and investor presentations--span
hundreds of pages and combine diverse modalities, including dense narrative
text, structured tables, and complex figures. Answering questions over such
content often requires joint reasoning across modalities, which strains
traditional large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) pipelines due to token limitations, layout loss, and fragmented
cross-modal context. We introduce MultiFinRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation
framework purpose-built for financial QA. MultiFinRAG first performs multimodal
extraction by grouping table and figure images into batches and sending them to
a lightweight, quantized open-source multimodal LLM, which produces both
structured JSON outputs and concise textual summaries. These outputs, along
with narrative text, are embedded and indexed with modality-aware similarity
thresholds for precise retrieval. A tiered fallback strategy then dynamically
escalates from text-only to text+table+image contexts when necessary, enabling
cross-modal reasoning while reducing irrelevant context. Despite running on
commodity hardware, MultiFinRAG achieves 19 percentage points higher accuracy
than ChatGPT-4o (free-tier) on complex financial QA tasks involving text,
tables, images, and combined multimodal reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在检测和应对暴力内容时的能力，尤其是在道德模糊的现实场景中的表现。

Method: 使用社会科学的暴力行为问卷（VBVQ）评估LLMs，并引入基于人设的提示以测试种族、年龄和地理身份的潜在偏见。

Result: LLMs的表面文本生成与内部暴力偏好不一致，且暴力倾向在不同人口统计特征中存在差异。

Conclusion: LLMs在暴力内容处理中存在潜在偏见，需进一步研究以改进其道德推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed for detecting and
responding to violent content online, yet their ability to reason about morally
ambiguous, real-world scenarios remains underexamined. We present the first
study to evaluate LLMs using a validated social science instrument designed to
measure human response to everyday conflict, namely the Violent Behavior
Vignette Questionnaire (VBVQ). To assess potential bias, we introduce
persona-based prompting that varies race, age, and geographic identity within
the United States. Six LLMs developed across different geopolitical and
organizational contexts are evaluated under a unified zero-shot setting. Our
study reveals two key findings: (1) LLMs surface-level text generation often
diverges from their internal preference for violent responses; (2) their
violent tendencies vary across demographics, frequently contradicting
established findings in criminology, social science, and psychology.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了自动事实核查系统在医学领域的应用挑战，指出当前系统未被广泛使用的原因，并建议将事实核查视为交互式沟通问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于医学决策的高风险性和医学文献的复杂性，公众对自动事实核查系统的需求增加，但现有系统未能满足实际需求。

Method: 通过研究临床专家如何验证社交媒体上的医学声明，揭示医学事实核查中的根本挑战。

Result: 发现医学事实核查存在三大挑战：声明与临床试验证据的关联困难、模糊声明与意图不匹配、主观真实性标签。

Conclusion: 建议将事实核查视为交互式沟通问题，而非端到端过程，以改进系统设计。

Abstract: Technological progress has led to concrete advancements in tasks that were
regarded as challenging, such as automatic fact-checking. Interest in adopting
these systems for public health and medicine has grown due to the high-stakes
nature of medical decisions and challenges in critically appraising a vast and
diverse medical literature. Evidence-based medicine connects to every
individual, and yet the nature of it is highly technical, rendering the medical
literacy of majority users inadequate to sufficiently navigate the domain. Such
problems with medical communication ripens the ground for end-to-end
fact-checking agents: check a claim against current medical literature and
return with an evidence-backed verdict. And yet, such systems remain largely
unused. To understand this, we present the first study examining how clinical
experts verify real claims from social media by synthesizing medical evidence.
In searching for this upper-bound, we reveal fundamental challenges in
end-to-end fact-checking when applied to medicine: Difficulties connecting
claims in the wild to scientific evidence in the form of clinical trials;
ambiguities in underspecified claims mixed with mismatched intentions; and
inherently subjective veracity labels. We argue that fact-checking should be
approached and evaluated as an interactive communication problem, rather than
an end-to-end process.

Motivation: 尽管语言模型在NLP中表现出色，但其适应特定任务时仍面临效率低、易过拟合和计算成本高等问题，限制了其在现实任务中的应用。

Method: 论文提出三种方法：1）从未标记数据中提取任务相关知识的持续预训练技术；2）参数高效微调方法，降低计算成本；3）改进的监督微调方法，提升模型在少标签数据下的表现。

Result: 实验表明，这些方法显著提升了语言模型的鲁棒性、效率和泛化能力，使其更适应多样化任务。

Conclusion: 这些进展为构建更鲁棒、高效的语言模型迈出了重要一步，推动了通用人工智能的发展。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in NLP, yet
adapting them efficiently and robustly to specific tasks remains challenging.
As their scale and complexity grow, fine-tuning LMs on labelled data often
underutilizes available unlabelled data, leads to overfitting on small
task-specific sets, and imposes significant computational costs. These
limitations hamper their application to the open-ended landscape of real-world
language tasks.
  This thesis proposes a series of methods to better adapt LMs to downstream
applications. First, we explore strategies for extracting task-relevant
knowledge from unlabelled data, introducing a novel continued pre-training
technique that outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches. Next,
we present a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that substantially reduces
memory and compute costs while maintaining competitive performance. We also
introduce improved supervised fine-tuning methods that enable LMs to better
follow instructions, especially when labelled data is scarce, enhancing their
performance across a range of NLP tasks, including open-ended generation.
Finally, we develop new evaluation methods and benchmarks, such as multi-hop
spatial reasoning tasks, to assess LM capabilities and adaptation more
comprehensively.
  Through extensive empirical studies across diverse NLP tasks, our results
demonstrate that these approaches substantially improve LM robustness,
efficiency, and generalization, making them more adaptable to a broad range of
applications. These advances mark a significant step towards more robust and
efficient LMs, bringing us closer to the goal of artificial general
intelligence.

Conclusion: 该管道为多语言预训练数据集的构建提供了高效解决方案，并开源了相关代码和数据集。

Abstract: Pre-training state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) requires vast
amounts of clean and diverse text data. While the open development of large
high-quality English pre-training datasets has seen substantial recent
progress, training performant multilingual LLMs remains a challenge, in large
part due to the inherent difficulty of tailoring filtering and deduplication
pipelines to a large number of languages. In this work, we introduce a new
pre-training dataset curation pipeline based on FineWeb that can be
automatically adapted to support any language. We extensively ablate our
pipeline design choices on a set of nine diverse languages, guided by a set of
meaningful and informative evaluation tasks that were chosen through a novel
selection process based on measurable criteria. Ultimately, we show that our
pipeline can be used to create non-English corpora that produce more performant
models than prior datasets. We additionally introduce a straightforward and
principled approach to rebalance datasets that takes into consideration both
duplication count and quality, providing an additional performance uplift.
Finally, we scale our pipeline to over 1000 languages using almost 100 Common
Crawl snapshots to produce FineWeb2, a new 20 terabyte (5 billion document)
multilingual dataset which we release along with our pipeline, training, and
evaluation codebases.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose KaLM-Embedding-V2, a versatile and compact
embedding model, which achieves impressive performance in general-purpose text
embedding tasks by leveraging superior training techniques and data. Our key
innovations include: (1) To better align the architecture with representation
learning, we remove the causal attention mask and adopt a fully bidirectional
transformer with simple yet effective mean-pooling to produce fixed-length
embeddings; (2) We employ a multi-stage training pipeline: (i) pre-training on
large-scale weakly supervised open-source corpora; (ii) fine-tuning on
high-quality retrieval and non-retrieval datasets; and (iii) model-soup
parameter averaging for robust generalization. Besides, we introduce a
focal-style reweighting mechanism that concentrates learning on difficult
samples and an online hard-negative mixing strategy to continuously enrich hard
negatives without expensive offline mining; (3) We collect over 20 categories
of data for pre-training and 100 categories of data for fine-tuning, to boost
both the performance and generalization of the embedding model. Extensive
evaluations on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) Chinese and English
show that our model significantly outperforms others of comparable size, and
competes with 3x, 14x, 18x, and 26x larger embedding models, setting a new

Conclusion: 结果表明梯度下降在适当初始化下具有强大表达能力，为长上下文建模和梯度学习泛化能力提供了新思路。

Abstract: There are two primary ways of incorporating new information into a language
model (LM): changing its prompt or changing its parameters, e.g. via
fine-tuning. Parameter updates incur no long-term storage cost for model
changes. However, for many model updates, prompting is significantly more
effective: prompted models can generalize robustly from single examples and
draw logical inferences that do not occur under standard fine-tuning. Can
models be modified so that fine-tuning does emulate prompting? This paper
describes a method for meta-training LMs such that gradient updates emulate the
effects of conditioning on new information. Our approach uses tools from
gradient-based meta-learning but uses an LM's own prompted predictions as
targets, eliminating the need for ground-truth labels. Subsequent gradient
descent training recovers some (and occasionally all) of prompted model
performance -- showing improvement on the ``reversal curse'' tasks, and
answering questions about text passages after a single gradient update. These
results suggest that, with appropriate initialization, gradient descent can be
surprisingly expressive. Our results suggest new avenues for long-context
modeling and offer insight into the generalization capabilities of
gradient-based learning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant traction across a wide
range of fields in recent years. There is also a growing expectation for them
to display human-like personalities during interactions. To meet this
expectation, numerous studies have proposed methods for modelling LLM
personalities through psychometric evaluations. However, most existing models
face two major limitations: they rely on the Big Five (OCEAN) framework, which
only provides coarse personality dimensions, and they lack mechanisms for
controlling trait intensity. In this paper, we address this gap by extending
the Machine Personality Inventory (MPI), which originally used the Big Five
model, to incorporate the 16 Personality Factor (16PF) model, allowing
expressive control over sixteen distinct traits. We also developed a structured
framework known as Specific Attribute Control (SAC) for evaluating and
dynamically inducing trait intensity in LLMs. Our method introduces
adjective-based semantic anchoring to guide trait intensity expression and
leverages behavioural questions across five intensity factors:
\textit{Frequency}, \textit{Depth}, \textit{Threshold}, \textit{Effort}, and
\textit{Willingness}. Through experimentation, we find that modelling intensity
as a continuous spectrum yields substantially more consistent and controllable
personality expression compared to binary trait toggling. Moreover, we observe
that changes in target trait intensity systematically influence closely related
traits in psychologically coherent directions, suggesting that LLMs internalize
multi-dimensional personality structures rather than treating traits in
isolation. Our work opens new pathways for controlled and nuanced human-machine
interactions in domains such as healthcare, education, and interviewing
processes, bringing us one step closer to truly human-like social machines.

Motivation: 当前LLMs在金融领域的应用效果不确定，特别是在印度金融背景下缺乏针对性评估工具。

Method: 使用CA-Ben基准（基于ICAI考试题库）评估六种LLMs的金融、法律和定量推理能力。

Result: Claude 3.5 Sonnet和GPT-4o表现最优，数值计算和法律解释是主要难点。

Conclusion: 未来需结合混合推理和检索增强生成方法，以提升LLMs在定量分析和法律解释中的表现。

Abstract: Advanced intelligent systems, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), are
significantly reshaping financial practices through advancements in Natural
Language Processing (NLP). However, the extent to which these models
effectively capture and apply domain-specific financial knowledge remains
uncertain. Addressing a critical gap in the expansive Indian financial context,
this paper introduces CA-Ben, a Chartered Accountancy benchmark specifically
designed to evaluate the financial, legal, and quantitative reasoning
capabilities of LLMs. CA-Ben comprises structured question-answer datasets
derived from the rigorous examinations conducted by the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of India (ICAI), spanning foundational, intermediate, and advanced
CA curriculum stages. Six prominent LLMs i.e. GPT 4o, LLAMA 3.3 70B, LLAMA 3.1
405B, MISTRAL Large, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Microsoft Phi 4 were evaluated
using standardized protocols. Results indicate variations in performance, with
Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o outperforming others, especially in conceptual and
legal reasoning. Notable challenges emerged in numerical computations and legal
interpretations. The findings emphasize the strengths and limitations of
current LLMs, suggesting future improvements through hybrid reasoning and
retrieval-augmented generation methods, particularly for quantitative analysis
and accurate legal interpretation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种半监督可扩展的统一框架（SSUF），用于解决电子商务查询分类中的信息不足和标签依赖问题，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子商务查询通常简短且缺乏上下文，现有方法依赖用户点击行为，导致信息不足和效率低下。

Method: SSUF包含知识增强、标签增强和结构增强模块，通过半监督学习和标签语义提升性能。

Result: 离线与在线A/B实验表明，SSUF显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: SSUF为查询分类任务提供了高效、统一的解决方案，解决了信息不足和标签依赖问题。

Abstract: Query classification, including multiple subtasks such as intent and category
prediction, is vital to e-commerce applications. E-commerce queries are usually
short and lack context, and the information between labels cannot be used,
resulting in insufficient prior information for modeling. Most existing
industrial query classification methods rely on users' posterior click behavior
to construct training samples, resulting in a Matthew vicious cycle.
Furthermore, the subtasks of query classification lack a unified framework,
leading to low efficiency for algorithm optimization.
  In this paper, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Scalable Unified Framework
(SSUF), containing multiple enhanced modules to unify the query classification
tasks. The knowledge-enhanced module uses world knowledge to enhance query
representations and solve the problem of insufficient query information. The
label-enhanced module uses label semantics and semi-supervised signals to
reduce the dependence on posterior labels. The structure-enhanced module
enhances the label representation based on the complex label relations. Each
module is highly pluggable, and input features can be added or removed as

experiments, and the results show that SSUF significantly outperforms the

*Papa Séga Wade,Mihai Andries,Ioannis Kanellos,Thierry Moudenc*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于分块的自动流畅度评估方法，结合多种自监督学习模型和分层CNN-BiLSTM框架，显著提升了评估性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非母语者的流畅度评估（AFA）在捕捉语音节奏、停顿和不流畅方面仍具挑战性，需要更精细的解决方案。

Method: 采用分块策略，结合Wav2Vec2、HuBERT和WavLM等自监督学习模型，通过Silero-VAD分割语音，并使用加权机制融合特征，结合CNN-BiLSTM捕捉长期依赖。

Result: 在Avalinguo和Speechocean762数据集上，F1分数和Pearson相关系数分别提升了2.8-4.2和6.2-4.0点，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 分块多模型融合方法在流畅度评估中表现优异，但未来需研究其对不规则韵律方言的泛化能力。

Abstract: Automatic fluency assessment (AFA) remains challenging, particularly in
capturing speech rhythm, pauses, and disfluencies in non-native speakers. We
introduce a chunk-based approach integrating self-supervised learning (SSL)
models (Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, and WavLM) selected for their complementary strengths
in phonetic, prosodic, and noisy speech modeling, with a hierarchical
CNN-BiLSTM framework. Speech is segmented into breath-group chunks using Silero
voice activity detection (Silero-VAD), enabling fine-grained temporal analysis
while mitigating over-segmentation artifacts. SSL embeddings are fused via a
learnable weighted mechanism, balancing acoustic and linguistic features, and
enriched with chunk-level fluency markers (e.g., speech rate, pause durations,
n-gram repetitions). The CNN-BiLSTM captures local and long-term dependencies
across chunks. Evaluated on Avalinguo and Speechocean762, our approach improves
F1-score by 2.8 and Pearson correlation by 6.2 points over single SSL baselines
on Speechocean762, with gains of 4.2 F1-score and 4.0 Pearson points on
Avalinguo, surpassing Pyannote.audio-based segmentation baselines. These
findings highlight chunk-based multi-SSL fusion for robust fluency evaluation,
though future work should explore generalization to dialects with irregular
prosody.

TL;DR: 论文提出MT2-CSD数据集和LLM-CRAN模型，用于多目标多轮对话立场检测，显著优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统立场检测研究局限于单实例分析，缺乏真实社交媒体互动动态的数据集，限制了多轮对话立场检测的发展。

Method: 引入MT2-CSD数据集（24,457标注实例）和LLM-CRAN模型，利用大语言模型提升对话理解能力。

Result: LLM-CRAN在MT2-CSD数据集上显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: MT2-CSD和LLM-CRAN为多轮对话立场检测提供了新工具和基准。

Abstract: In the realm of contemporary social media, automatic stance detection is
pivotal for opinion mining, as it synthesizes and examines user perspectives on
contentious topics to uncover prevailing trends and sentiments. Traditional
stance detection research often targets individual instances, thereby limiting
its capacity to model multi-party discussions typical in real social media
scenarios. This shortcoming largely stems from the scarcity of datasets that
authentically capture the dynamics of social media interactions, hindering
advancements in conversational stance detection. In this paper, we introduce
MT2-CSD, a comprehensive dataset for multi-target, multi-turn conversational
stance detection. To the best of our knowledge, MT2-CSD is the largest dataset
available for this purpose, comprising 24,457 annotated instances and
exhibiting the greatest conversational depth, thereby presenting new challenges
for stance detection. To address these challenges, we propose the Large
Language model enhanced Conversational Relational Attention Network (LLM-CRAN),
which exploits the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to improve conversational
understanding. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the efficacy of
LLM-CRAN on the MT2-CSD dataset. The experimental results indicate that
LLM-CRAN significantly outperforms strong baseline models in the task of
conversational stance detection.

Motivation: 现有方法在粗粒度上对齐图像和文本，存在跨模态偏差和模态内语义分歧问题，影响了句子表示质量。

Method: DALR采用一致性学习模块软化负样本，利用辅助任务的语义相似性实现细粒度跨模态对齐；同时结合排名蒸馏和全局模态内对齐学习，捕捉更复杂的句子关系。

Result: 在语义文本相似性（STS）和迁移（TR）任务上的实验表明，DALR优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: DALR通过双层次对齐学习有效提升了多模态句子表示的质量，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Previous multimodal sentence representation learning methods have achieved
impressive performance. However, most approaches focus on aligning images and
text at a coarse level, facing two critical challenges:cross-modal misalignment
bias and intra-modal semantic divergence, which significantly degrade sentence
representation quality. To address these challenges, we propose DALR
(Dual-level Alignment Learning for Multimodal Sentence Representation). For
cross-modal alignment, we propose a consistency learning module that softens
negative samples and utilizes semantic similarity from an auxiliary task to
achieve fine-grained cross-modal alignment. Additionally, we contend that
sentence relationships go beyond binary positive-negative labels, exhibiting a
more intricate ranking structure. To better capture these relationships and
enhance representation quality, we integrate ranking distillation with global
intra-modal alignment learning. Comprehensive experiments on semantic textual
similarity (STS) and transfer (TR) tasks validate the effectiveness of our
approach, consistently demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art
baselines.

Motivation: 社区问答平台是重要的知识库，但现有方法未能充分利用外部知识或动态历史问答上下文，且缺乏适合工业部署的记忆机制。

Method: 提出ComRAG框架，结合静态知识和动态历史问答对，采用基于质心的记忆机制，支持检索、生成和高效存储。

Result: 在三个工业CQA数据集上，ComRAG在向量相似度上提升25.9%，延迟降低8.7%至23.3%，存储增长从20.23%降至2.06%。

Conclusion: ComRAG通过整合静态和动态知识，显著提升了工业CQA的性能和效率。

Abstract: Community Question Answering (CQA) platforms can be deemed as important
knowledge bases in community, but effectively leveraging historical
interactions and domain knowledge in real-time remains a challenge. Existing
methods often underutilize external knowledge, fail to incorporate dynamic
historical QA context, or lack memory mechanisms suited for industrial
deployment. We propose ComRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework for
real-time industrial CQA that integrates static knowledge with dynamic
historical QA pairs via a centroid-based memory mechanism designed for
retrieval, generation, and efficient storage. Evaluated on three industrial CQA
datasets, ComRAG consistently outperforms all baselines--achieving up to 25.9%
improvement in vector similarity, reducing latency by 8.7% to 23.3%, and
lowering chunk growth from 20.23% to 2.06% over iterations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着模型规模增大，全参数微调成本高昂，现有参数高效微调方法仍存在资源分配不均的问题。

Method: 提出Progtuning框架，基于贡献逐步减少更新的Transformer块数量。

Result: 减少约25%的更新参数，保持竞争性能，并与其他参数高效微调方法兼容。

Conclusion: Progtuning在资源优化和性能表现上具有显著优势，适用于多种适应场景。

Abstract: Fine-tuning is a promising technique for leveraging Transformer-based
language models in downstream tasks. As model sizes continue to grow, updating
all model parameters becomes increasingly costly. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning methods effectively address this issue by selectively updating a
small subset of parameters. However, fine-tuning and most existing
parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods require updating the same number of
parameters as the initial size, ignoring the unequal contribution across
Transformer blocks and leading to extremely inefficient allocation of computing
resources. In this paper, we propose Progtuning, the novel fine-tuning
framework combined with progressive learning for Transformer-based language
models. Specifically, Progtuning progressively reduces the number of updated
transformer blocks based on the contribution. Remarkably, Progtuning optimizes
resource allocation and reduces the number of updated parameters by
approximately 25\%, while still maintaining competitive performance. And it
also exhibits high adaptability with parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods,
demonstrating excellent performance across various adaptation scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归语言模型在文本生成中存在解码速度慢和全局连贯性难以保持的问题，扩散模型虽能并行生成但受限于高维标记表示。

Method: 提出Cosmos方法，在压缩平滑潜在空间中进行扩散生成，利用自编码器同时学习标记级重建和与预训练语言编码器的对齐。

Result: 实验表明，Cosmos在压缩8倍标记表示的同时保持生成质量，且通过增加潜在序列长度超越基线模型。

Conclusion: Cosmos在多种生成任务中表现优异，生成质量相当或更好，推理速度提升2倍以上。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models dominate modern text generation, yet their
sequential nature introduces fundamental limitations: decoding is slow, and
maintaining global coherence remains challenging. Diffusion models offer a
promising alternative by enabling parallel generation and flexible control;
however, their application to text generation is hindered by the high
dimensionality of token-level representations. We introduce Cosmos, a novel
approach to text generation that operates entirely in a compressed, smooth
latent space tailored specifically for diffusion. This space is learned using
an autoencoder trained simultaneously for token-level reconstruction and
alignment with frozen activations from a pretrained language encoder, providing
robust semantic grounding and enabling effective perturbation-based
augmentations. Empirically, we demonstrate that text representations can be
compressed by $8\times$ while maintaining generation quality comparable to
token-level diffusion models. Furthermore, increasing the latent sequence
length allows Cosmos to surpass both diffusion-based and autoregressive
baselines. We evaluate Cosmos on four diverse generative tasks including story
generation, question generation, summarization, and detoxification and compare
it with various generative paradigms. Cosmos achieves comparable or superior
generation quality while offering more than $2\times$ faster inference.

Result: 实验证明模型提高了预测准确性，并能根据文本提示动态调整轮换时机。

Conclusion: 该模型为对话系统提供了更灵活和直观的轮换预测控制方式。

Abstract: Turn-taking prediction models are essential components in spoken dialogue
systems and conversational robots. Recent approaches leverage transformer-based
architectures to predict speech activity continuously and in real-time. In this
study, we propose a novel model that enables turn-taking prediction to be
dynamically controlled via textual prompts. This approach allows intuitive and
explicit control through instructions such as "faster" or "calmer" adapting
dynamically to conversational partners and contexts. The proposed model builds
upon a transformer-based voice activity projection (VAP) model, incorporating
textual prompt embeddings into both channel-wise transformers and a
cross-channel transformer. We evaluated the feasibility of our approach using
over 950 hours of human-human spoken dialogue data. Since textual prompt data
for the proposed approach was not available in existing datasets, we utilized a
large language model (LLM) to generate synthetic prompt sentences. Experimental
results demonstrated that the proposed model improved prediction accuracy and
effectively varied turn-taking timing behaviors according to the textual
prompts.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于检索的提示策略，利用句法相似性而非语义相似性选择示例，以改进自动术语提取（ATE）任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLM）在NLP任务中表现优异，但其在ATE任务中的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用基于句法相似性的检索方法，在少样本设置中选择示例，以更可靠地捕捉术语边界。

Result: 在三个专业ATE基准测试中，句法检索方法提高了F1分数。

Conclusion: 句法线索在适应LLM进行术语提取任务中具有重要性。

Abstract: Automatic Term Extraction (ATE) identifies domain-specific expressions that
are crucial for downstream tasks such as machine translation and information
retrieval. Although large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced
various NLP tasks, their potential for ATE has scarcely been examined. We
propose a retrieval-based prompting strategy that, in the few-shot setting,
selects demonstrations according to \emph{syntactic} rather than semantic
similarity. This syntactic retrieval method is domain-agnostic and provides
more reliable guidance for capturing term boundaries. We evaluate the approach
in both in-domain and cross-domain settings, analyzing how lexical overlap
between the query sentence and its retrieved examples affects performance.
Experiments on three specialized ATE benchmarks show that syntactic retrieval
improves F1-score. These findings highlight the importance of syntactic cues
when adapting LLMs to terminology-extraction tasks.

Method: 设计了Agent-RewardBench，包含多维度评估、步骤级奖励评估和高质量数据采样，覆盖感知、规划和安全等7个场景。

Result: 实验表明，即使是先进的多模态模型在奖励建模方面表现有限，需针对性训练。

Conclusion: Agent-RewardBench为代理奖励建模提供了有效的评估工具，推动了相关研究的进展。

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) advance, multimodal agents show
promise in real-world tasks like web navigation and embodied intelligence.
However, due to limitations in a lack of external feedback, these agents
struggle with self-correction and generalization. A promising approach is to
use reward models as external feedback, but there is no clear on how to select
reward models for agents. Thus, there is an urgent need to build a reward bench
targeted at agents. To address these challenges, we propose Agent-RewardBench,
a benchmark designed to evaluate reward modeling ability in MLLMs. The
benchmark is characterized by three key features: (1) Multiple dimensions and
real-world agent scenarios evaluation. It covers perception, planning, and
safety with 7 scenarios; (2) Step-level reward evaluation. It allows for the
assessment of agent capabilities at the individual steps of a task, providing a
more granular view of performance during the planning process; and (3)
Appropriately difficulty and high-quality. We carefully sample from 10 diverse
models, difficulty control to maintain task challenges, and manual verification
to ensure the integrity of the data. Experiments demonstrate that even
state-of-the-art multimodal models show limited performance, highlighting the
need for specialized training in agent reward modeling. Code is available at

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型生成的虚假文本是否能够被有效检测，避免无休止的技术竞赛。

Method: 使用统计分类器检测古典侦探小说风格的虚假文本，比较不同模型版本的生成能力。

Result: Gemini模型在生成欺骗性文本方面有所提升，而GPT模型未表现出明显变化。

Conclusion: 即使模型规模扩大，虚假文本的可靠检测仍然可行，但新模型架构可能提升欺骗性。

Abstract: Large language models can produce convincing "fake text" in domains such as
academic writing, product reviews, and political news. Many approaches have
been investigated for the detection of artificially generated text. While this
may seem to presage an endless "arms race", we note that newer LLMs use ever
more parameters, training data, and energy, while relatively simple classifiers
demonstrate a good level of detection accuracy with modest resources. To
approach the question of whether the models' ability to beat the detectors may
therefore reach a plateau, we examine the ability of statistical classifiers to
identify "fake text" in the style of classical detective fiction. Over a 0.5
version increase, we found that Gemini showed an increased ability to generate
deceptive text, while GPT did not. This suggests that reliable detection of
fake text may remain feasible even for ever-larger models, though new model
architectures may improve their deceptiveness

Motivation: 慢思考LLMs在生成批判性反馈和优化解决方案方面能力有限，需要一种方法增强其自我批判和迭代优化的能力。

Method: 提出Double-Checker框架，通过1,730个自我批判实例的微调，使LLMs能够在推理过程中迭代批判和优化输出。

Result: 在AIME基准测试中，pass@1性能从4.4%提升至18.2%。

Conclusion: Double-Checker为开发更具信任感和有效性的LLMs提供了一条有前景的路径。

Abstract: While slow-thinking large language models (LLMs) exhibit reflection-like
reasoning, commonly referred to as the "aha moment:, their ability to generate
informative critiques and refine prior solutions remains limited. In this
paper, we introduce Double-Checker, a principled framework designed to enhance
the reasoning capabilities of slow-thinking LLMs by fostering explicit
self-critique and iterative refinement of their previous solutions. By
fine-tuning on our curated 1,730 self-critical instances, Double-Checker
empowers long-CoT LLMs to iteratively critique and refine their outputs during
inference until they evaluate their solutions as correct under self-generated
critiques. We validate the efficacy of Double-Checker across a comprehensive
suite of reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating that iterative self-critique
significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of long-CoT LLMs. Notably,
our Double-Checker increases the pass@1 performance on challenging AIME
benchmarks from 4.4% to 18.2% compared to the original long-CoT LLMs. These
results highlight a promising direction for developing more trustworthy and
effective LLMs capable of structured self-critique.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在上下文信息不足时容易生成不可靠的回答，需要确保回答的groundedness（基于上下文）。

Method: 使用轻量级编码器模型（如RoBERTa和NomicBERT）在精选数据集上进行微调。

Result: 这些模型在groundedness检测上的准确性与先进LLMs（如Llama3 8B和GPT4o）相当，且推理延迟大幅降低。

Conclusion: 轻量级模型能高效检测groundedness，显著提升LLMs的效率和可靠性。

Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external context significantly
improves their performance in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However,
LLMs struggle to answer queries reliably when the provided context lacks
information, often resorting to ungrounded speculation or internal knowledge.
Groundedness - generating responses strictly supported by the context - is
essential for ensuring factual consistency and trustworthiness. This study
focuses on detecting whether a given query is grounded in a document provided
in context before the costly answer generation by LLMs. Such a detection
mechanism can significantly reduce both inference time and resource
consumption. We show that lightweight, task specific encoder models such as
RoBERTa and NomicBERT, fine-tuned on curated datasets, can achieve accuracy
comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Llama3 8B and GPT4o, in
groundedness detection while reducing inference latency by orders of magnitude.

Result: 即使使用中等规模LLM和小数据集，文本方法仍有效，表明语言上下文的重要性。

Conclusion: 任务本质为多模态，单模态方法存在根本限制。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the use of a text-only, autoregressive language
modeling approach for the extraction of referring expressions from visually
grounded dialogue. More specifically, the aim is to investigate the extent to
which the linguistic context alone can inform the detection of mentions that
have a (visually perceivable) referent in the visual context of the
conversation. To this end, we adapt a pretrained large language model (LLM) to
perform a relatively course-grained annotation of mention spans in unfolding
conversations by demarcating mention span boundaries in text via next-token
prediction. Our findings indicate that even when using a moderately sized LLM,
relatively small datasets, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, a text-only
approach can be effective, highlighting the relative importance of the
linguistic context for this task. Nevertheless, we argue that the task
represents an inherently multimodal problem and discuss limitations fundamental
to unimodal approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in understanding and generating text but
struggle with providing professional literary criticism for works with profound
thoughts and complex narratives. This paper proposes GLASS (Greimas Literary
Analysis via Semiotic Square), a structured analytical framework based on
Greimas Semiotic Square (GSS), to enhance LLMs' ability to conduct in-depth
literary analysis. GLASS facilitates the rapid dissection of narrative
structures and deep meanings in narrative works. We propose the first dataset
for GSS-based literary criticism, featuring detailed analyses of 48 works. Then
we propose quantitative metrics for GSS-based literary criticism using the
LLM-as-a-judge paradigm. Our framework's results, compared with expert
criticism across multiple works and LLMs, show high performance. Finally, we
applied GLASS to 39 classic works, producing original and high-quality analyses
that address existing research gaps. This research provides an AI-based tool
for literary research and education, offering insights into the cognitive

Abstract: Real-world live retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems face significant
challenges when processing user queries that are often noisy, ambiguous, and
contain multiple intents. While RAG enhances large language models (LLMs) with
external knowledge, current systems typically struggle with such complex
inputs, as they are often trained or evaluated on cleaner data. This paper
introduces Omni-RAG, a novel framework designed to improve the robustness and
effectiveness of RAG systems in live, open-domain settings. Omni-RAG employs
LLM-assisted query understanding to preprocess user inputs through three key
modules: (1) Deep Query Understanding and Decomposition, which utilizes LLMs
with tailored prompts to denoise queries (e.g., correcting spelling errors) and
decompose multi-intent queries into structured sub-queries; (2) Intent-Aware
Knowledge Retrieval, which performs retrieval for each sub-query from a corpus
(i.e., FineWeb using OpenSearch) and aggregates the results; and (3) Reranking
and Generation, where a reranker (i.e., BGE) refines document selection before
a final response is generated by an LLM (i.e., Falcon-10B) using a
chain-of-thought prompt. Omni-RAG aims to bridge the gap between current RAG
capabilities and the demands of real-world applications, such as those
highlighted by the SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG Challenge, by robustly handling complex
and noisy queries.

### [148] [Domain Knowledge-Enhanced LLMs for Fraud and Concept Drift Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21443)
*Ali Şenol,Garima Agrawal,Huan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合领域知识的LLM框架，用于检测动态平台上的欺诈对话和概念漂移，效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态平台上语言模式的变化和概念漂移（CD）使得欺诈对话检测变得困难，现有LLM在风险敏感场景中表现不佳。

Method: 提出了一个DK-Enhanced LLM框架，包含三个模块：DK-LLM检测欺诈对话、OCDD检测语义漂移、第二个DK-LLM分类漂移性质。

Result: 在SEConvo数据集上，系统实现了98%的分类准确率，显著优于零样本基线。

Conclusion: 结合领域知识和漂移检测显著提升了高风险NLP应用的性能、可解释性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Detecting deceptive conversations on dynamic platforms is increasingly
difficult due to evolving language patterns and Concept Drift (CD)-i.e.,
semantic or topical shifts that alter the context or intent of interactions
over time. These shifts can obscure malicious intent or mimic normal dialogue,
making accurate classification challenging. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
show strong performance in natural language tasks, they often struggle with
contextual ambiguity and hallucinations in risk-sensitive scenarios. To address
these challenges, we present a Domain Knowledge (DK)-Enhanced LLM framework
that integrates pretrained LLMs with structured, task-specific insights to
perform fraud and concept drift detection. The proposed architecture consists
of three main components: (1) a DK-LLM module to detect fake or deceptive
conversations; (2) a drift detection unit (OCDD) to determine whether a
semantic shift has occurred; and (3) a second DK-LLM module to classify the
drift as either benign or fraudulent. We first validate the value of domain
knowledge using a fake review dataset and then apply our full framework to
SEConvo, a multiturn dialogue dataset that includes various types of fraud and
spam attacks. Results show that our system detects fake conversations with high
accuracy and effectively classifies the nature of drift. Guided by structured
prompts, the LLaMA-based implementation achieves 98% classification accuracy.
Comparative studies against zero-shot baselines demonstrate that incorporating
domain knowledge and drift awareness significantly improves performance,
interpretability, and robustness in high-stakes NLP applications.

*Makbule Gulcin Ozsoy,William Tai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了基础大语言模型在多语言Text2Cypher任务中的表现，发现性能依次为英语最高、西班牙语次之、土耳其语最低，并探讨了提示翻译的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自然语言接口研究多集中于英语，缺乏对其他语言的评估，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过翻译英文问题创建多语言测试集，使用标准化提示和指标评估多个基础模型。

Result: 模型性能依次为英语>西班牙语>土耳其语，提示翻译对结果影响较小。

Conclusion: 需更多多语言查询生成的包容性评估与开发，未来工作包括模式本地化和多语言微调。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled natural language
interfaces that translate user questions into database queries, such as
Text2SQL, Text2SPARQL, and Text2Cypher. While these interfaces enhance database
accessibility, most research today focuses solely on English, with limited
evaluation in other languages. This paper investigates the performance of
foundational LLMs on the Text2Cypher task across multiple languages. We create
and release a multilingual test set by translating English questions into
Spanish and Turkish while preserving the original Cypher queries, enabling fair
cross-lingual comparison. We evaluate multiple foundational models using
standardized prompts and metrics. Our results show a consistent performance
pattern: highest on English, then Spanish, and lowest on Turkish. We attribute
this to differences in training data availability and linguistic
characteristics. Additionally, we explore the impact of translating task
prompts into Spanish and Turkish. Results show little to no change in
evaluation metrics, suggesting prompt translation has minor impact. Our
findings highlight the need for more inclusive evaluation and development in
multilingual query generation. Future work includes schema localization and
fine-tuning across diverse languages.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的偏好对齐框架，用于通过用户交互改进实时对话的语音模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好学习方法主要针对文本语言模型，不适用于实时语音交互的复杂性（如打断、插话等）。

Method: 构建了15万对偏好数据集，利用AI反馈标注，结合离线对齐方法微调全双工自回归语音模型。

Result: 实验表明，通用对话反馈能显著提升语音模型的准确性、安全性和上下文对齐。

Conclusion: 研究强调了动态平衡的重要性，对自然实时语音对话系统至关重要。

Abstract: We propose a novel preference alignment framework for improving spoken
dialogue models on real-time conversations from user interactions. Current
preference learning methods primarily focus on text-based language models, and
are not directly suited to the complexities of real-time speech interactions,
with richer dynamics (e.g. interruption, interjection) and no explicit
segmentation between speaker turns.We create a large-scale dataset of more than
150,000 preference pairs from raw multi-turn speech conversations, annotated
with AI feedback, to cover preferences over both linguistic content and
temporal context variations. We leverage offline alignment methods to finetune
a full-duplex autoregressive speech-to-speech model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that feedback on generic conversations can be consistently
effective in improving spoken dialogue models to produce more factual, safer
and more contextually aligned interactions. We deploy the finetuned model and
conduct holistic human evaluations to assess the impact beyond single-turn
conversations. Our findings shed light on the importance of a well-calibrated
balance among various dynamics, crucial for natural real-time speech dialogue
systems.

*Ryosuke Takahashi,Tatsuro Inaba,Kentaro Inui,Benjamin Heinzerling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的Transformer架构，通过引入TopK激活函数，解决了稀疏自编码器（SAE）在分析语言模型时的局限性，提升了模型的解释性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏自编码器（SAEs）在分析Transformer语言模型时存在局限性，如后训练导致的概念发现不确定性和特征不稳定性。

Method: 在Transformer架构中引入TopK激活函数，使隐藏状态等同于TopK SAE的潜在特征，无需后训练。

Result: TopK LMs在模型大小、计算效率和解释性之间取得平衡，保持了原始能力并提供了稳定的解释性。

Conclusion: TopK LMs为语言模型的学习和概念表示提供了稳定可靠的工具，推动了模型解释性和可控性的研究。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have become an important tool for analyzing and
interpreting the activation space of transformer-based language models (LMs).
However, SAEs suffer several shortcomings that diminish their utility and
internal validity. Since SAEs are trained post-hoc, it is unclear if the
failure to discover a particular concept is a failure on the SAE's side or due
to the underlying LM not representing this concept. This problem is exacerbated
by training conditions and architecture choices affecting which features an SAE
learns. When tracing how LMs learn concepts during training, the lack of
feature stability also makes it difficult to compare SAEs features across
different checkpoints. To address these limitations, we introduce a
modification to the transformer architecture that incorporates a TopK
activation function at chosen layers, making the model's hidden states
equivalent to the latent features of a TopK SAE. This approach eliminates the
need for post-hoc training while providing interpretability comparable to SAEs.
The resulting TopK LMs offer a favorable trade-off between model size,
computational efficiency, and interpretability. Despite this simple
architectural change, TopK LMs maintain their original capabilities while
providing robust interpretability benefits. Our experiments demonstrate that
the sparse representations learned by TopK LMs enable successful steering
through targeted neuron interventions and facilitate detailed analysis of
neuron formation processes across checkpoints and layers. These features make
TopK LMs stable and reliable tools for understanding how language models learn
and represent concepts, which we believe will significantly advance future
research on model interpretability and controllability.

Method: 比较了在线和半在线Direct Preference Optimization与Group Reward Policy Optimization目标，并分析了训练动态和超参数选择策略。

Result: 在线和半在线方法表现相似且优于离线方法，多任务学习能进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 在线和半在线强化学习方法在大语言模型微调中表现优异，多任务学习是有效的优化策略。

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of reinforcement learning methods for
finetuning large language models when transitioning from offline to semi-online
to fully online regimes for both verifiable and non-verifiable tasks. Our
experiments cover training on verifiable math as well as non-verifiable
instruction following with a set of benchmark evaluations for both. Across
these settings, we extensively compare online and semi-online Direct Preference
Optimization and Group Reward Policy Optimization objectives, and surprisingly
find similar performance and convergence between these variants, which all
strongly outperform offline methods. We provide a detailed analysis of the
training dynamics and hyperparameter selection strategies to achieve optimal
results. Finally, we show that multi-tasking with verifiable and non-verifiable
rewards jointly yields improved performance across both task types.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过未来对话信号优化交互式LLM，提升用户参与度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能直接关联用户参与度与知识或对话行为，需更直接的指标。

Method: 利用用户反应作为奖励信号，结合i×MCTS模拟交互，通过DPO优化模型。

Result: 在情感支持和说服对话中，显著提升用户参与度。

Conclusion: 直接优化用户反应信号能有效增强交互式LLM的用户参与度。

Abstract: Enhancing user engagement through interactions plays an essential role in
socially-driven dialogues. While prior works have optimized models to reason
over relevant knowledge or plan a dialogue act flow, the relationship between
user engagement and knowledge or dialogue acts is subtle and does not guarantee
user engagement in socially-driven dialogues. To this end, we enable
interactive LLMs to learn user engagement by leveraging signals from the future
development of conversations. Specifically, we adopt a more direct and relevant
indicator of user engagement, i.e., the user's reaction related to dialogue
intention after the interaction, as a reward to align interactive LLMs. To
achieve this, we develop a user simulator to interact with target interactive
LLMs and explore interactions between the user and the interactive LLM system
via \textit{i$\times$MCTS} (\textit{M}onte \textit{C}arlo \textit{T}ree
\textit{S}earch for \textit{i}nteraction). In this way, we collect a dataset
containing pairs of higher and lower-quality experiences using
\textit{i$\times$MCTS}, and align interactive LLMs for high-level user
engagement by direct preference optimization (DPO) accordingly. Experiments
conducted on two socially-driven dialogue scenarios (emotional support
conversations and persuasion for good) demonstrate that our method effectively
enhances user engagement in interactive LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了评估大型语言模型（LLM）能力的基准测试是否有效，提出了“Potemkin理解”的概念，即模型在测试中表现出的理解可能是虚假的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质疑当前基于基准测试评估LLM能力的合理性，因为这些测试可能无法反映模型的真实理解能力。

Method: 提出了两种量化Potemkin理解的方法：一种是通过专门设计的基准测试，另一种是提供其普遍性的下限估计。

Result: 研究发现Potemkin理解在模型、任务和领域中普遍存在，且反映了模型内部概念表征的不一致性。

Conclusion: 基准测试可能无法准确评估LLM的真实理解能力，需要更有效的评估方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are regularly evaluated using benchmark
datasets. But what justifies making inferences about an LLM's capabilities
based on its answers to a curated set of questions? This paper first introduces
a formal framework to address this question. The key is to note that the
benchmarks used to test LLMs -- such as AP exams -- are also those used to test
people. However, this raises an implication: these benchmarks are only valid
tests if LLMs misunderstand concepts in ways that mirror human
misunderstandings. Otherwise, success on benchmarks only demonstrates potemkin
understanding: the illusion of understanding driven by answers irreconcilable
with how any human would interpret a concept. We present two procedures for
quantifying the existence of potemkins: one using a specially designed
benchmark in three domains, the other using a general procedure that provides a
lower-bound on their prevalence. We find that potemkins are ubiquitous across
models, tasks, and domains. We also find that these failures reflect not just
incorrect understanding, but deeper internal incoherence in concept
representations.

Abstract: People are increasingly seeking healthcare information from large language
models (LLMs) via interactive chatbots, yet the nature and inherent risks of
these conversations remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we filter
large-scale conversational AI datasets to achieve HealthChat-11K, a curated
dataset of 11K real-world conversations composed of 25K user messages. We use
HealthChat-11K and a clinician-driven taxonomy for how users interact with LLMs
when seeking healthcare information in order to systematically study user
interactions across 21 distinct health specialties. Our analysis reveals
insights into the nature of how and why users seek health information, such as
common interactions, instances of incomplete context, affective behaviors, and
interactions (e.g., leading questions) that can induce sycophancy, underscoring
the need for improvements in the healthcare support capabilities of LLMs
deployed as conversational AI. Code and artifacts to retrieve our analyses and
combine them into a curated dataset can be found here:

TL;DR: 论文提出数据效能（Data Efficacy）概念，通过优化训练数据的组织而非仅选择数据来提升语言模型性能，并提出了DELT范式，包含数据评分、选择和排序三部分。实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究主要关注数据效率（如数据选择和过滤），而忽略了数据组织对语言模型训练的影响。本文提出数据效能，以填补这一空白。

Method: 提出DELT范式，包含数据评分（如LQS）、数据选择和排序（如FO）。LQS从梯度一致性角度评估数据的可学习性和质量，FO解决模型遗忘和数据分布偏差问题。

Result: 实验表明，DELT在不增加数据量和模型规模的情况下提升了语言模型性能，其中LQS和FO组合效果最佳。数据效能与数据效率可协同实现。

Conclusion: 数据效能是一个有前景的研究方向，可进一步提升语言模型训练效果。

Abstract: Data is fundamental to the training of language models (LM). Recent research
has been dedicated to data efficiency, which aims to maximize performance by
selecting a minimal or optimal subset of training data. Techniques such as data
filtering, sampling, and selection play a crucial role in this area. To
complement it, we define Data Efficacy, which focuses on maximizing performance
by optimizing the organization of training data and remains relatively
underexplored. This work introduces a general paradigm, DELT, for considering
data efficacy in LM training, which highlights the significance of training
data organization. DELT comprises three components: Data Scoring, Data
Selection, and Data Ordering. Among these components, we design
Learnability-Quality Scoring (LQS), as a new instance of Data Scoring, which
considers both the learnability and quality of each data sample from the
gradient consistency perspective. We also devise Folding Ordering (FO), as a
novel instance of Data Ordering, which addresses issues such as model
forgetting and data distribution bias. Comprehensive experiments validate the
data efficacy in LM training, which demonstrates the following: Firstly,
various instances of the proposed DELT enhance LM performance to varying
degrees without increasing the data scale and model size. Secondly, among these
instances, the combination of our proposed LQS for data scoring and Folding for
data ordering achieves the most significant improvement. Lastly, data efficacy
can be achieved together with data efficiency by applying data selection.
Therefore, we believe that data efficacy is a promising foundational area in LM
training.

is therefore essential -- it helps people embrace AI with confidence and gives
maximal space for innovation while avoiding backlash.
  The "2025 Singapore Conference on AI (SCAI): International Scientific
Exchange on AI Safety" aimed to support research in this space by bringing
together AI scientists across geographies to identify and synthesise research
priorities in AI safety. This resulting report builds on the International AI
Safety Report chaired by Yoshua Bengio and backed by 33 governments. By
adopting a defence-in-depth model, this report organises AI safety research
domains into three types: challenges with creating trustworthy AI systems
(Development), challenges with evaluating their risks (Assessment), and
challenges with monitoring and intervening after deployment (Control).

Motivation: 随着LLM代理的广泛应用，隐私保护成为关键问题，尤其是在多代理协作任务中。现有评估方法局限于简单任务，无法全面衡量隐私保护能力。

Method: 提出了MAGPIE基准，包含158个高风险场景，评估LLM代理对上下文隐私的理解和协作能力。测试了GPT-4o和Claude-2.7-Sonnet等模型。

Result: 当前模型对隐私数据的分类错误率高（25.2%和43.6%），在多轮对话中泄露隐私的比例达59.9%和50.5%，且71%的任务无法完成。

Conclusion: 现有模型在上下文隐私保护和协作任务完成方面表现不足，亟需改进。

Abstract: The proliferation of LLM-based agents has led to increasing deployment of
inter-agent collaboration for tasks like scheduling, negotiation, resource
allocation etc. In such systems, privacy is critical, as agents often access
proprietary tools and domain-specific databases requiring strict
confidentiality. This paper examines whether LLM-based agents demonstrate an
understanding of contextual privacy. And, if instructed, do these systems
preserve inference time user privacy in non-adversarial multi-turn
conversation. Existing benchmarks to evaluate contextual privacy in LLM-agents
primarily assess single-turn, low-complexity tasks where private information
can be easily excluded. We first present a benchmark - MAGPIE comprising 158
real-life high-stakes scenarios across 15 domains. These scenarios are designed
such that complete exclusion of private data impedes task completion yet
unrestricted information sharing could lead to substantial losses. We then
evaluate the current state-of-the-art LLMs on (a) their understanding of
contextually private data and (b) their ability to collaborate without
violating user privacy. Empirical experiments demonstrate that current models,
including GPT-4o and Claude-2.7-Sonnet, lack robust understanding of contextual
privacy, misclassifying private data as shareable 25.2\% and 43.6\% of the
time. In multi-turn conversations, these models disclose private information in
59.9\% and 50.5\% of cases even under explicit privacy instructions.
Furthermore, multi-agent systems fail to complete tasks in 71\% of scenarios.
These results underscore that current models are not aligned towards both
contextual privacy preservation and collaborative task-solving.

Abstract: Given the growing influence of language model-based agents on high-stakes

macroscopic scale over time, enabling more robust alignment. To assess the
long-term safety awareness of language models, we also introduce a dataset of
100 indirect harm scenarios, testing models' ability to foresee adverse,
non-obvious outcomes from seemingly harmless user prompts. Our approach
achieves not only over 20% improvement on the new dataset but also an average
win rate exceeding 70% against strong baselines on existing safety benchmarks

Motivation: 研究LLMs是否具备类似人类的真实因果推理能力，发现其仅能进行浅层推理，需改进以实现深层推理。

Method: 通过分析LLMs的自回归机制，提出新基准CausalProbe-2024，并设计G^2-Reasoner方法，结合通用知识和目标导向提示。

Result: LLMs在新基准上表现显著下降，G^2-Reasoner显著提升了其在新鲜和反事实情境中的推理能力。

Conclusion: G^2-Reasoner为LLMs实现深层因果推理提供了新路径，推动了其向强人工智能的发展。

Abstract: Causal reasoning capability is critical in advancing large language models
(LLMs) toward strong artificial intelligence. While versatile LLMs appear to
have demonstrated capabilities in understanding contextual causality and
providing responses that obey the laws of causality, it remains unclear whether
they perform genuine causal reasoning akin to humans. However, current evidence
indicates the contrary. Specifically, LLMs are only capable of performing
shallow (level-1) causal reasoning, primarily attributed to the causal
knowledge embedded in their parameters, but they lack the capacity for genuine
human-like (level-2) causal reasoning. To support this hypothesis,
methodologically, we delve into the autoregression mechanism of
transformer-based LLMs, revealing that it is not inherently causal.
Empirically, we introduce a new causal Q&A benchmark called CausalProbe-2024,
whose corpora are fresh and nearly unseen for the studied LLMs. The LLMs
exhibit a significant performance drop on CausalProbe-2024 compared to earlier
benchmarks, indicating the fact that they primarily engage in level-1 causal
reasoning. To bridge the gap towards level-2 causal reasoning, we draw
inspiration from the fact that human reasoning is usually facilitated by
general knowledge and intended goals. We propose G^2-Reasoner, a method that
incorporates general knowledge and goal-oriented prompts into LLMs' causal
reasoning processes. Experiments demonstrate that G^2-Reasoner significantly
enhances LLMs' causal reasoning capability, particularly in fresh and
counterfactual contexts. This work sheds light on a new path for LLMs to
advance towards genuine causal reasoning, going beyond level-1 and making
strides towards level-2.

TL;DR: WAP框架通过四种认知能力增强LVLMs的环境理解，显著提升了任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂场景中表现不佳，缺乏环境上下文理解。

Method: 提出WAP框架，结合视觉外观建模、空间推理等功能，通过课程学习训练模型。

Result: 在EB-ALFRED基准上，任务成功率提升60.7%，尤其在常识推理和长时规划方面表现突出。

Conclusion: WAP显著优于现有方法，甚至超越GPT-4o等专有系统。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) show promise for embodied planning tasks
but struggle with complex scenarios involving unfamiliar environments and
multi-step goals. Current approaches rely on environment-agnostic imitation
learning that disconnects instructions from environmental contexts, causing
models to struggle with context-sensitive instructions and rely on
supplementary cues rather than visual reasoning during long-horizon
interactions. In this work, we propose World-Aware Planning Narrative
Enhancement (WAP), a framework that infuses LVLMs with comprehensive
environmental understanding through four cognitive capabilities (visual
appearance modeling, spatial reasoning, functional abstraction, and syntactic
grounding) while developing and evaluating models using only raw visual
observations through curriculum learning. Evaluations on the EB-ALFRED
benchmark demonstrate substantial improvements, with Qwen2.5-VL achieving a
60.7 absolute improvement in task success rates, particularly in commonsense
reasoning (+60.0) and long-horizon planning (+70.0). Notably, our enhanced
open-source models outperform proprietary systems like GPT-4o and
Claude-3.5-Sonnet by a large margin.

TL;DR: IXAII是一个交互式可解释AI系统，整合了LIME、SHAP、Anchors和DiCE四种方法，为不同用户群体提供定制化解释，并通过专家和普通用户访谈验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释AI方法多为静态且忽视用户视角，限制了其实际效果。

Method: 开发IXAII系统，整合四种可解释AI方法，提供交互式解释和多种可视化选项。

Result: 用户认为IXAII能有效提升透明度，尤其在多解释方法和交互性方面。

Conclusion: IXAII通过结合可解释性、交互性和实际应用，为AI解释实践和人机交互提供了新视角。

Abstract: Although several post-hoc methods for explainable AI have been developed,
most are static and neglect the user perspective, limiting their effectiveness
for the target audience. In response, we developed the interactive explainable
intelligent system called IXAII that offers explanations from four explainable
AI methods: LIME, SHAP, Anchors, and DiCE. Our prototype provides tailored
views for five user groups and gives users agency over the explanations'
content and their format. We evaluated IXAII through interviews with experts
and lay users. Our results indicate that IXAII, which provides different
explanations with multiple visualization options, is perceived as helpful to
increase transparency. By bridging the gaps between explainable AI methods,
interactivity, and practical implementation, we provide a novel perspective on
AI explanation practices and human-AI interaction.

TL;DR: 论文提出AI驱动的科学发展需填补抽象、推理和现实三大差距，而非依赖模型规模或数据。通过主动推理AI系统，结合因果自监督模型、贝叶斯规划器和知识图谱，实现科学发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统在科学发现中存在架构局限，需解决抽象、推理和现实差距，以推动AI驱动的科学进步。

Method: 设计主动推理AI系统，包括因果自监督模型、符号或神经符号规划器、知识图谱构建，并通过闭环实验验证。

Result: 提出一种架构，通过内部模型与外部验证的交互实现科学发现，强调人类判断的不可或缺性。

Conclusion: 填补三大差距的主动推理AI系统是科学发现的关键，人类判断需作为永久组成部分。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence has led to expectations of
transformative scientific discovery, yet current systems remain fundamentally
limited by their operational architectures, brittle reasoning mechanisms, and
their separation from experimental reality. Building on earlier work, we
contend that progress in AI-driven science now depends on closing three
fundamental gaps -- the abstraction gap, the reasoning gap, and the reality gap
-- rather than on model size/data/test time compute. Scientific reasoning
demands internal representations that support simulation of actions and
response, causal structures that distinguish correlation from mechanism, and
continuous calibration. We define active inference AI systems for scientific
discovery as those that (i) maintain long-lived research memories grounded in
causal self-supervised foundation models, (ii) symbolic or neuro-symbolic
planners equipped with Bayesian guardrails, (iii) grow persistent knowledge
graphs where thinking generates novel conceptual nodes, reasoning establishes
causal edges, and real-world interaction prunes false connections while
strengthening verified pathways, and (iv) refine their internal representations
through closed-loop interaction with both high-fidelity simulators and
automated laboratories - an operational loop where mental simulation guides
action and empirical surprise reshapes understanding. In essence, we outline an
architecture where discovery arises from the interplay between internal models
that enable counterfactual reasoning and external validation that grounds
hypotheses in reality. It is also argued that the inherent ambiguity in
feedback from simulations and experiments, and underlying uncertainties makes
human judgment indispensable, not as a temporary scaffold but as a permanent
architectural component.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TableMoE提出了一种神经符号混合专家架构，用于处理多模态表格数据，显著优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型在复杂表格结构（如模糊、倾斜、嵌套布局等）下表现不佳，需要更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 采用神经符号路由机制，动态分配表格元素到专门专家（如Table-to-HTML），并结合大规模预训练数据集TableMoE-Align。

Result: 在四个WildStruct基准测试中表现优异，验证了神经符号路由和专家对齐的重要性。

Conclusion: TableMoE通过神经符号推理显著提升了多模态表格理解的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Abstract: Multimodal understanding of tables in real-world contexts is challenging due
to the complexity of structure, symbolic density, and visual degradation (blur,
skew, watermarking, incomplete structures or fonts, multi-span or
hierarchically nested layouts). Existing multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) struggle with such WildStruct conditions, resulting in limited
performance and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose
TableMoE, a neuro-symbolic Mixture-of-Connector-Experts (MoCE) architecture
specifically designed for robust, structured reasoning over multimodal table
data. TableMoE features an innovative Neuro-Symbolic Routing mechanism, which
predicts latent semantic token roles (e.g., header, data cell, axis, formula)
and dynamically routes table elements to specialized experts (Table-to-HTML,
Table-to-JSON, Table-to-Code) using a confidence-aware gating strategy informed
by symbolic reasoning graphs. To facilitate effective alignment-driven
pretraining, we introduce the large-scale TableMoE-Align dataset, consisting of
1.2M table-HTML-JSON-code quadruples across finance, science, biomedicine and
industry, utilized exclusively for model pretraining. For evaluation, we curate
and release four challenging WildStruct benchmarks: WMMFinQA, WMMTatQA,
WMMTabDialog, and WMMFinanceMath, designed specifically to stress-test models
under real-world multimodal degradation and structural complexity. Experimental
results demonstrate that TableMoE significantly surpasses existing
state-of-the-art models. Extensive ablation studies validate each core
component, emphasizing the critical role of Neuro-Symbolic Routing and
structured expert alignment. Through qualitative analyses, we further showcase
TableMoE's interpretability and enhanced robustness, underscoring the
effectiveness of integrating neuro-symbolic reasoning for multimodal table
understanding.

TL;DR: MindCube基准测试揭示了现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）在构建空间心理模型方面的不足，提出了一种结合认知地图和推理的协同方法，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究VLMs是否能像人类一样从少量视角构建完整的空间心理模型，以推理布局、视角和运动。

Method: 使用MindCube基准测试评估VLMs的空间心理模型能力，探索了三种方法（中间视角、自然语言推理链、认知地图），并提出“先地图后推理”的协同方法。

Result: 通过“先地图后推理”方法，准确率从37.8%提升至60.8%，结合强化学习后进一步提升至70.7%。

Conclusion: 构建和利用结构化空间表示的空间心理模型支架，显著提升了VLMs对不可见空间的理解能力。

Abstract: Can Vision Language Models (VLMs) imagine the full scene from just a few
views, like humans do? Humans form spatial mental models, internal
representations of unseen space, to reason about layout, perspective, and
motion. Our new MindCube benchmark with 21,154 questions across 3,268 images
exposes this critical gap, where existing VLMs exhibit near-random performance.
Using MindCube, we systematically evaluate how well VLMs build robust spatial
mental models through representing positions (cognitive mapping), orientations
(perspective-taking), and dynamics (mental simulation for "what-if" movements).
We then explore three approaches to help VLMs approximate spatial mental
models, including unseen intermediate views, natural language reasoning chains,
and cognitive maps. The significant improvement comes from a synergistic
approach, "map-then-reason", that jointly trains the model to first generate a
cognitive map and then reason upon it. By training models to reason over these
internal maps, we boosted accuracy from 37.8% to 60.8% (+23.0%). Adding
reinforcement learning pushed performance even further to 70.7% (+32.9%). Our
key insight is that such scaffolding of spatial mental models, actively
constructing and utilizing internal structured spatial representations with
flexible reasoning processes, significantly improves understanding of
unobservable space.

TL;DR: 论文提出了Ad-Hoc Human-AI Coordination Challenge (AH2AC2)，通过开发人类代理代理来解决人类评估的高成本和难以复现的问题，并开源了一个有限的人类游戏数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实现AI代理与人类的无缝协调是现实应用中的关键挑战，但人类评估的高成本和难以复现限制了Hanabi游戏作为测试平台的使用。

Method: 开发了人类代理代理作为廉价、可复现的人类评估伙伴，并开源了一个3,079局游戏的有限数据集。

Result: 提出了AH2AC2挑战，并在两玩家和三玩家的Hanabi场景中提供了基线结果。

Conclusion: 通过人类代理代理和有限数据集，AH2AC2为人类-AI协调研究提供了廉价、可复现的评估方法。

Abstract: Achieving seamless coordination between AI agents and humans is crucial for
real-world applications, yet it remains a significant open challenge. Hanabi is
a cooperative card game featuring imperfect information, constrained
communication, theory of mind requirements, and coordinated action -- making it
an ideal testbed for human-AI coordination. However, its use for human-AI
interaction has been limited by the challenges of human evaluation. In this
work, we introduce the Ad-Hoc Human-AI Coordination Challenge (AH2AC2) to
overcome the constraints of costly and difficult-to-reproduce human
evaluations. We develop \textit{human proxy agents} on a large-scale human
dataset that serve as robust, cheap, and reproducible human-like evaluation
partners in AH2AC2. To encourage the development of data-efficient methods, we
open-source a dataset of 3,079 games, deliberately limiting the amount of
available human gameplay data. We present baseline results for both two- and
three- player Hanabi scenarios. To ensure fair evaluation, we host the proxy
agents through a controlled evaluation system rather than releasing them
publicly. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法难以应对自主搜索系统的复杂性和开放性，需要新的基准和方法来评估长周期任务和动态答案。

Method: 构建Mind2Web 2基准测试，包含130个任务，提出Agent-as-a-Judge框架，基于树状评分标准设计评判代理。

Result: OpenAI Deep Research系统表现最佳，达到人类性能的50-70%，耗时仅为人类的一半。

Conclusion: Mind2Web 2为下一代自主搜索系统的开发和评估提供了严格的基础。

Abstract: Agentic search such as Deep Research systems, where large language models
autonomously browse the web, synthesize information, and return comprehensive
citation-backed answers, represents a major shift in how users interact with
web-scale information. While promising greater efficiency and cognitive
offloading, the growing complexity and open-endedness of agentic search have
outpaced existing evaluation benchmarks and methodologies, which largely assume
short search horizons and static answers. In this paper, we introduce Mind2Web
2, a benchmark of 130 realistic, high-quality, and long-horizon tasks that
require real-time web browsing and extensive information synthesis, constructed
with over 1,000 hours of human labor. To address the challenge of evaluating
time-varying and complex answers, we propose a novel Agent-as-a-Judge
framework. Our method constructs task-specific judge agents based on a
tree-structured rubric design to automatically assess both answer correctness
and source attribution. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of nine frontier
agentic search systems and human performance, along with a detailed error
analysis to draw insights for future development. The best-performing system,
OpenAI Deep Research, can already achieve 50-70% of human performance while
spending half the time, showing a great potential. Altogether, Mind2Web 2
provides a rigorous foundation for developing and benchmarking the next
generation of agentic search systems.

TL;DR: PsyLite是一个基于InternLM2.5-7B-chat的轻量级心理咨询大语言模型，通过两阶段训练策略提升推理能力、咨询能力和对话安全性，并在资源受限环境中实现低硬件部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI心理咨询模型在对话安全、场景处理和轻量化部署方面存在不足，PsyLite旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用混合蒸馏数据微调和ORPO偏好优化的两阶段训练策略，结合条件RAG引入幽默元素并拒绝危险请求。

Result: 在CEval、CPsyCounE和SafeDialBench评估中表现优于基线模型，心理咨询专业性提升47.6%，对话安全性提升2.4%。

Conclusion: PsyLite为资源受限环境提供了可行的心理咨询解决方案，兼具高性能和低硬件需求。

Abstract: With the rapid development of digital technology, AI-driven psychological
counseling has gradually become an important research direction in the field of
mental health. However, existing models still have deficiencies in dialogue
safety, detailed scenario handling, and lightweight deployment. To address
these issues, this study proposes PsyLite, a lightweight psychological
counseling large language model agent developed based on the base model
InternLM2.5-7B-chat. Through a two-stage training strategy (hybrid distillation
data fine-tuning and ORPO preference optimization), PsyLite enhances the
model's deep-reasoning ability, psychological counseling ability, and safe
dialogue ability. After deployment using Ollama and Open WebUI, a custom
workflow is created with Pipelines. An innovative conditional RAG is designed
to introduce crosstalk humor elements at appropriate times during psychological
counseling to enhance user experience and decline dangerous requests to
strengthen dialogue safety. Evaluations show that PsyLite outperforms the
baseline models in the Chinese general evaluation (CEval), psychological
counseling professional evaluation (CPsyCounE), and dialogue safety evaluation
(SafeDialBench), particularly in psychological counseling professionalism
(CPsyCounE score improvement of 47.6\%) and dialogue safety (\safe{} score
improvement of 2.4\%). Additionally, the model uses quantization technology
(GGUF q4\_k\_m) to achieve low hardware deployment (5GB memory is sufficient
for operation), providing a feasible solution for psychological counseling
applications in resource-constrained environments.
