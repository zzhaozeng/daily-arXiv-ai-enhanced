While\nrecent video generation models have shown strong potential in modeling dynamic\nscenes, generating videos that are both temporally coherent and geometrically\nconsistent across camera views remains a significant challenge. To address\nthis, we propose a 4D video generation model that enforces multi-view 3D\nconsistency of videos by supervising the model with cross-view pointmap\nalignment during training. This geometric supervision enables the model to\nlearn a shared 3D representation of the scene, allowing it to predict future\nvideo sequences from novel viewpoints based solely on the given RGB-D\nobservations, without requiring camera poses as inputs. Compared to existing\nbaselines, our method produces more visually stable and spatially aligned\npredictions across multiple simulated and real-world robotic datasets.

This challenge is complicated by hysteresis effects, and\nreal-world conditions such as current bias, voltage quantization errors, and\ntemperature that must be considered in the battery management system use. In\nthis paper, we proposed an adaptive estimation approach to overcome the\nchallenges of LFPSOC estimation. Specifically, the method uses an adaptive\nfisher information fusion strategy that adaptively combines the SOC estimation\nfrom two different models, which are Coulomb counting and equivalent circuit\nmodel-based parameter identification. The effectiveness of this strategy is\nrationalized by the information richness excited by external cycling signals. A\n3D OCV-H-SOC map that captures the relationship between OCV, hysteresis, and\nSOC was proposed as the backbone, and can be generalizable to other widely\nadopted parameter-identification methods.

However, the high cost of multi-omics profiling imposes a\nsignificant economic burden, with over reliance on full omics data potentially\nleading to unnecessary resource consumption. To address these issues, we\npropose an uncertainty-aware, multi-view dynamic decision framework for omics\ndata classification that aims to achieve high diagnostic accuracy while\nminimizing testing costs. Methodology: At the single-omics level, we refine the\nactivation functions of neural networks to generate Dirichlet distribution\nparameters, utilizing subjective logic to quantify both the belief masses and\nuncertainty mass of classification results. Belief mass reflects the support of\na specific omics modality for a disease class, while the uncertainty parameter\ncaptures limitations in data quality and model discriminability, providing a\nmore trustworthy basis for decision-making. At the multi omics level, we employ\na fusion strategy based on Dempster-Shafer theory to integrate heterogeneous\nmodalities, leveraging their complementarity to boost diagnostic accuracy and\nrobustness. A dynamic decision mechanism is then applied that omics data are\nincrementally introduced for each patient until either all data sources are\nutilized or the model confidence exceeds a predefined threshold, potentially\nbefore all data sources are utilized. Results and Conclusion: We evaluate our\napproach on four benchmark multi-omics datasets, ROSMAP, LGG, BRCA, and KIPAN.\nIn three datasets, over 50% of cases achieved accurate classification using a\nsingle omics modality, effectively reducing redundant testing. Meanwhile, our\nmethod maintains diagnostic performance comparable to full-omics models and\npreserves essential biological insights."}

To address\nthis, we propose JumpER (jump-start reinforcement learning via self-evolving\npriors), an RL training framework that structures policy learning into multiple\nstages of increasing complexity. By dynamically generating self-evolving priors\nthrough iterative bootstrapping of previously learned policies, JumpER\nprogressively refines and enhances guidance, thereby stabilizing exploration\nand policy optimization without relying on external expert priors or\nhandcrafted reward shaping. Specifically, when integrated with a structured\nthree-stage curriculum that incrementally evolves action modality, observation\nspace, and task objective, JumpER enables quadruped robots to achieve robust\nmonopedal hopping on unpredictable terrains for the first time.

Conventional deep learning approaches for analyzing\nthese signals typically rely on homogeneous datasets and static bespoke models,\nlimiting their robustness and generalizability across diverse clinical settings\nand acquisition protocols. In this study, we present a cardiac sensing\nfoundation model (CSFM) that leverages advanced transformer architectures and a\ngenerative, masked pretraining strategy to learn unified representations from\nvast, heterogeneous health records. Our model is pretrained on an innovative\nmulti-modal integration of data from multiple large-scale datasets (including\nMIMIC-III-WDB, MIMIC-IV-ECG, and CODE), comprising cardiac signals and the\ncorresponding clinical or machine-generated text reports from approximately 1.7\nmillion individuals.

Extensive evaluations across diagnostic\ntasks, demographic information recognition, vital sign measurement, clinical\noutcome prediction, and ECG question answering reveal that CSFM consistently\noutperforms traditional one-modal-one-task approaches.

Given\nthis challenge, we propose a new approach, CaptionSmiths, to acquire a single\ncaptioning model that can handle diverse language patterns. First, our approach\nquantifies three properties of each caption, length, descriptiveness, and\nuniqueness of a word, as continuous scalar values, without human annotation.\nGiven the values, we represent the conditioning via interpolation between two\nendpoint vectors corresponding to the extreme states, e.g., one for a very\nshort caption and one for a very long caption.

It utilises Grounded-SAM 2 to obtain object proposals with precise\nbounding boxes and their corresponding segmentation masks; while DINOv2's\nzero-shot capabilities are employed to generate the image embeddings. The\nquality of those masks, together with their embeddings, is of vital importance\nto our approach; as the proposal-object matching is realized by determining an\nobject matching score based on the similarity of the class embeddings and the\naverage maximum similarity of the patch embeddings. Differently to SAM-6D,\ncalculating the latter involves a prior patch filtering based on the distance\nbetween each patch and its corresponding cyclic/roundtrip patch in the image\ngrid.

However, existing\nmethods still face challenges in coordinating mobile base and manipulator,\nprimarily due to two limitations. On the one hand, they fail to explicitly\nmodel the influence of the mobile base on manipulator control, which easily\nleads to error accumulation under high degrees of freedom. On the other hand,\nthey treat the entire mobile manipulation process with the same visual\nobservation modality (e.g., either all 2D or all 3D), overlooking the distinct\nmultimodal perception requirements at different stages during mobile\nmanipulation. To address this, we propose the Adaptive Coordination Diffusion\nTransformer (AC-DiT), which enhances mobile base and manipulator coordination\nfor end-to-end mobile manipulation. First, since the motion of the mobile base\ndirectly influences the manipulator's actions, we introduce a mobility-to-body\nconditioning mechanism that guides the model to first extract base motion\nrepresentations, which are then used as context prior for predicting whole-body\nactions. This enables whole-body control that accounts for the potential impact\nof the mobile base's motion. Second, to meet the perception requirements at\ndifferent stages of mobile manipulation, we design a perception-aware\nmultimodal conditioning strategy that dynamically adjusts the fusion weights\nbetween various 2D visual images and 3D point clouds, yielding visual features\ntailored to the current perceptual needs.

To tackle this issue, a HOT\nframework, termed \\textbf{P3HOT}, is proposed, which blends \\textbf{P}rompt\nguidance and human \\textbf{P}roximal \\textbf{P}erception. To begin with, we\nutilize a semantic-driven prompt mechanism to direct the network's attention\ntowards the relevant regions based on the correlation between image and text.\nThen a human proximal perception mechanism is employed to dynamically perceive\nkey depth range around the human, using learnable parameters to effectively\neliminate regions where interactions are not expected. Calculating depth\nresolves the uncertainty of the overlap between humans and objects in a 2D\nperspective, providing a quasi-3D viewpoint.

Conversely, RFT can significantly enhance a model's\nperformance but is prone to learn unexpected behaviors, and its performance is\nhighly sensitive to the initial policy. In this paper, we propose a unified\nview of these methods and introduce Prefix-RFT, a hybrid approach that\nsynergizes learning from both demonstration and exploration. Using mathematical\nreasoning problems as a testbed, we empirically demonstrate that Prefix-RFT is\nboth simple and effective. It not only surpasses the performance of standalone\nSFT and RFT but also outperforms parallel mixed-policy RFT methods. A key\nadvantage is its seamless integration into existing open-source frameworks,\nrequiring only minimal modifications to the standard RFT pipeline. Our analysis\nhighlights the complementary nature of SFT and RFT, and validates that\nPrefix-RFT effectively harmonizes these two learning paradigms. Furthermore,\nablation studies confirm the method's robustness to variations in the quality\nand quantity of demonstration data. We hope this work offers a new perspective\non LLM post-training, suggesting that a unified paradigm that judiciously\nintegrates demonstration and exploration could be a promising direction for\nfuture research."}

The generated DTs were then used to assess six\ndifferent DIR methods using target registration error, Dice similarity\ncoefficient, and the 95th percentile Hausdorff distance using summary metrics\nand voxel-level granular visualizations. Finally, for a subset of T2w MRI scans\nfrom patients treated with MR-guided radiation therapy, dose distributions were\nwarped and accumulated to assess dose warping errors, including evaluations of\nDIR performance in both low- and high-dose regions for patient-specific error\nestimation. Main results: Our proposed pipeline synthesized DTs modeling\nrealistic GI motion, achieving mean and maximum motion amplitudes and a mean\nlog Jacobian determinant within 0.8 mm and 0.01, respectively, similar to\npublished real-patient gastric motion data. It also enables the extraction of\ndetailed quantitative DIR performance metrics and rigorous validation of dose\nmapping accuracy. Significance: The pipeline enables rigorously testing DIR\ntools for dynamic, anatomically complex regions enabling granular spatial and\ndosimetric accuracies."}

Despite recent advancements, the coherent\nonline construction of HD maps remains a challenging endeavor, as it\nnecessitates modeling the high complexity of road topologies in a unified and\nconsistent manner. To address this challenge, we propose a coherent approach to\npredict lane segments and their corresponding topology, as well as road\nboundaries, all by leveraging prior map information represented by commonly\navailable standard-definition (SD) maps. We propose a network architecture,\nwhich leverages hybrid lane segment encodings comprising prior information and\ndenoising techniques to enhance training stability and performance.\nFurthermore, we facilitate past frames for temporal consistency.

To systematically study this, we\ninvestigate the behavior of LLM agents acting as sellers in simulated\ncontinuous double auction markets. Through a series of controlled experiments,\nwe analyze how parameters such as the ability to communicate, choice of model,\nand presence of environmental pressures affect the stability and emergence of\nseller collusion. We find that direct seller communication increases collusive\ntendencies, the propensity to collude varies across models, and environmental\npressures, such as oversight and urgency from authority figures, influence\ncollusive behavior.

During inference on a model trained exclusively with\nIn-Distribution (ID) data, we observe a salient gradient phenomenon: around an\nID sample, the local gradient directions for \"enhancing\" that sample's\npredicted class remain relatively consistent, whereas OOD samples--unseen in\ntraining--exhibit disorganized or conflicting gradient directions in the same\nneighborhood. Motivated by this observation, we propose an inference-stage\ntechnique to short-circuit those feature coordinates that spurious gradients\nexploit to inflate OOD confidence, while leaving ID classification largely\nintact. To circumvent the expense of recomputing the logits after this gradient\nshort-circuit, we further introduce a local first-order approximation that\naccurately captures the post-modification outputs without a second forward\npass.

Meanwhile,\nmany existing missions operate in manual tasking regimes only, thus missing\npotential events of interest. To overcome slow downlink rates cost-effectively,\nonboard detection is a viable solution. However, traditional methane\nenhancement methods are too computationally demanding for resource-limited\nonboard hardware. This work accelerates methane detection by focusing on\nefficient, low-power algorithms. We test fast target detection methods (ACE,\nCEM) that have not been previously used for methane detection and propose a\nMag1c-SAS - a significantly faster variant of the current state-of-the-art\nalgorithm for methane detection: Mag1c. To explore their true detection\npotential, we integrate them with a machine learning model (U-Net, LinkNet).\nOur results identify two promising candidates (Mag1c-SAS and CEM), both\nacceptably accurate for the detection of strong plumes and computationally\nefficient enough for onboard deployment: one optimized more for accuracy, the\nother more for speed, achieving up to ~100x and ~230x faster computation than\noriginal Mag1c on resource-limited hardware. Additionally, we propose and\nevaluate three band selection strategies. One of them can outperform the method\ntraditionally used in the field while using fewer channels, leading to even\nfaster processing without compromising accuracy.

While existing encoder-decoder CNN and\ntransformer-based approaches have shown promising results, they struggle with\nstable segmentation performance on polyps with weak or blurry boundaries. These\nmethods exhibit limited abilities to distinguish between polyps and non-polyps\nand capture essential boundary cues. Moreover, their generalizability still\nfalls short of meeting the demands of real-time clinical applications. To\naddress these limitations, we propose SAM-MaGuP, a groundbreaking approach for\nrobust polyp segmentation.
