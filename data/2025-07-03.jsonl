To address\nthis, we propose a 4D video generation model that enforces multi-view 3D\nconsistency of videos by supervising the model with cross-view pointmap\nalignment during training.

To address these\nissues, we propose a novel frequency domain-based diffusion model, named \\ours,\nfor fully exploiting the beneficial knowledge in unpaired clear data. In\nparticular, inspired by the strong generative ability shown by Diffusion Models\n(DMs), we tackle the dehazing task from the perspective of frequency domain\nreconstruction and perform the DMs to yield the amplitude spectrum consistent\nwith the distribution of clear images. To implement it, we propose an Amplitude\nResidual Encoder (ARE) to extract the amplitude residuals, which effectively\ncompensates for the amplitude gap from the hazy to clear domains, as well as\nprovide supervision for the DMs training. In addition, we propose a Phase\nCorrection Module (PCM) to eliminate artifacts by further refining the phase\nspectrum during dehazing with a simple attention mechanism.

To address this, we first introduce DiffusionLight, which uses\niterative inpainting to compute a median chrome ball from multiple outputs to\nserve as a stable, low-frequency lighting prior that guides the generation of a\nhigh-quality final result.

Existing MoE\nframeworks for LVLMs focus on token-to-expert routing (TER), encouraging\ndifferent experts to specialize in processing distinct tokens. However, these\nframeworks often rely on the load balancing mechanism, overlooking the inherent\ndistributional differences between vision and language. To this end, we propose\na Long-Tailed Distribution-aware Router (LTDR) for vision-language TER,\ntackling two challenges: (1) Distribution-aware router for modality-specific\nrouting.

This article is a significantly extended version of a paper\n  presented by the authors at IJCAI-2022", "summary": "Non-monotonic logic programming is the basis for a declarative problem\nsolving paradigm known as answer set programming (ASP). Departing from the\nseminal definition by Gelfond and Lifschitz in 1988 for simple normal logic\nprograms, various answer set semantics have been proposed for extensions. We\nconsider two important questions: (1) Should the minimal model property,\nconstraint monotonicity and foundedness as defined in the literature be\nmandatory conditions for an answer set semantics in general? (2) If not, what\nother properties could be considered as general principles for answer set\nsemantics? We address the two questions. First, it seems that the three\naforementioned conditions may sometimes be too strong, and we illustrate with\nexamples that enforcing them may exclude expected answer sets. Second, we\nevolve the Gelfond answer set (GAS) principles for answer set construction by\nrefining the Gelfond's rationality principle to well-supportedness, minimality\nw.r.t. negation by default and minimality w.r.t. epistemic negation. The\nprinciple of well-supportedness guarantees that every answer set is\nconstructible from if-then rules obeying a level mapping and is thus free of\ncircular justification, while the two minimality principles ensure that the\nformalism minimizes knowledge both at the level of answer sets and of world\nviews. Third, to embody the refined GAS principles, we extend the notion of\nwell-supportedness substantially to answer sets and world views, respectively.\nFourth, we define new answer set semantics in terms of the refined GAS\nprinciples. Fifth, we use the refined GAS principles as an alternative baseline\nto intuitively assess the existing answer set semantics. Finally, we analyze\nthe computational complexity."}

However, most prior work relies\non mesh priors of the target object and virtual environments constructed by\nsimulators, which are time-consuming to obtain and inevitably differ from the\nreal world.

This paper investigates how pruning influences vision models across\nthree key dimensions: (i) interpretability, (ii) unsupervised object discovery,\nand (iii) alignment with human perception. We first analyze different vision\nnetwork architectures to examine how varying sparsity levels affect feature\nattribution interpretability methods. Additionally, we explore whether pruning\npromotes more succinct and structured representations, potentially improving\nunsupervised object discovery by discarding redundant information while\npreserving essential features. Finally, we assess whether pruning enhances the\nalignment between model representations and human perception, investigating\nwhether sparser models focus on more discriminative features similarly to\nhumans. Our findings also reveal the presence of sweet spots, where sparse\nmodels exhibit higher interpretability, downstream generalization and human\nalignment. However, these spots highly depend on the network architectures and\ntheir size in terms of trainable parameters.

In this work, we present an information fusion\nframework that integrates multi-seasonal structural data to support robotic and\nautomated crop load management during the entire growing season.

Segmentation outputs from YOLOv9-Seg were used to extract\ndepth-informed masks, which enabled accurate 3D point cloud reconstruction via\nKinect Fusion; these reconstructed models from each season were subsequently\naligned using Fast GICP to achieve spatially coherent multi-season fusion. The\nYOLOv9-Seg model, trained on manually annotated images, achieved a mean squared\nerror (MSE) of 0.0047 and segmentation mAP@50 scores up to 0.78 for trunks in\ndormant season dataset. Kinect Fusion enabled accurate reconstruction of tree\ngeometry, validated with field measurements resulting in root mean square\nerrors (RMSE) of 5.23 mm for trunk diameter, 4.50 mm for branch diameter, and\n13.72 mm for branch spacing. Fast GICP achieved precise cross-seasonal\nregistration with a minimum fitness score of 0.00197, allowing integrated,\ncomprehensive tree structure modeling despite heavy occlusions during the\ngrowing season.

To overcome these limitations, we propose IC-Custom, a unified\nframework that seamlessly integrates position-aware and position-free image\ncustomization through in-context learning.

To bridge the data gap, we carefully curated a\nhigh-quality dataset of 12k identity-consistent samples with 8k from real-world\nsources and 4k from high-quality synthetic data, avoiding the overly glossy and\nover-saturated synthetic appearance. IC-Custom supports various industrial\napplications, including try-on, accessory placement, furniture arrangement, and\ncreative IP customization.
