The inherent difficulty of modeling MILPs that accurately represent stochastic real world problems leads to suboptimal performance in the real world. Recently, machine learning methods have been applied to build MILP models for decision quality rather than how accurately they model the real world problem. However, these approaches typically rely on supervised learning, assume access to true optimal decisions, and use surrogates for the MILP gradients. In this work, we introduce a proof of concept CORL framework that end to end fine tunes an MILP scheme using reinforcement learning (RL) on real world data to maximize its operational performance. We enable this by casting an MILP solved by B&B as a differentiable stochastic policy compatible with RL. We validate the CORL method in a simple illustrative combinatorial sequential decision making example.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684CORL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\uff08MILP\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u968f\u673aMILP\u5efa\u6a21\u56f0\u96be\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u548cMILP\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCORL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06B&B\u6c42\u89e3\u7684MILP\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e0eRL\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u968f\u673a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u987a\u5e8f\u51b3\u7b56\u793a\u4f8b\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86CORL\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316MILP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u521d\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

Recent work demonstrates that techniques such as repeated sampling, self-verification, and self-reflection can significantly enhance task success by allocating more inference-time compute. However, applying these techniques across multiple agents in a multi-agent system is difficult: there does not exist principled mechanisms to allocate compute to foster collaboration among agents, to extend test-time scaling to collaborative interactions, or to distribute compute across agents under explicit budget constraints. To address this gap, we propose FutureWeaver, a framework for planning and optimizing test-time compute allocation in multi-agent systems under fixed budgets. FutureWeaver introduces modularized collaboration, formalized as callable functions that encapsulate reusable multi-agent workflows. These modules are automatically derived through self-play reflection by abstracting recurring interaction patterns from past trajectories. Building on these modules, FutureWeaver employs a dual-level planning architecture that optimizes compute allocation by reasoning over the current task state while also speculating on future steps. Experiments on complex agent benchmarks demonstrate that FutureWeaver consistently outperforms baselines across diverse budget settings, validating its effectiveness for multi-agent collaboration in inference-time optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faFutureWeaver\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u534f\u4f5c\u548c\u53cc\u7ea7\u89c4\u5212\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u914d\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u914d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u539f\u5219\u6027\u673a\u5236\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u534f\u4f5c\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6211\u5bf9\u5f08\u53cd\u601d\u81ea\u52a8\u62bd\u8c61\u51fa\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u7ea7\u89c4\u5212\u67b6\u6784\u4f18\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u590d\u6742\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cFutureWeaver\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9884\u7b97\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "FutureWeaver\u6709\u6548\u5730\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Large pre-trained systems such as Whisper, XLS-R, MMS, and W2v-BERT have expanded access to ASR technology, but their comparative behavior in African low-resource contexts has not been studied in a unified and systematic way. In this work, we benchmark four state-of-the-art ASR models across 13 African languages, fine-tuning them on progressively larger subsets of transcribed data ranging from 1 to 400 hours. Beyond reporting error rates, we provide new insights into why models behave differently under varying conditions. We show that MMS and W2v-BERT are more data efficient in very low-resource regimes, XLS-R scales more effectively as additional data becomes available, and Whisper demonstrates advantages in mid-resource conditions. We also analyze where external language model decoding yields improvements and identify cases where it plateaus or introduces additional errors, depending on the alignment between acoustic and text resources.

These metrics rely on a baseline function to alter the pixels of the input image that the attribution map deems most important. In this work, we highlight a critical problem with these metrics: the choice of a given baseline will inevitably favour certain attribution methods over others. More concerningly, even a simple linear model with commonly used baselines contradicts itself by designating different optimal methods. A question then arises: which baseline should we use? We propose to study this problem through two desirable properties of a baseline: (i) that it removes information and (ii) that it does not produce overly out-of-distribution (OOD) images. We first show that none of the tested baselines satisfy both criteria, and there appears to be a trade-off among current baselines: either they remove information or they produce a sequence of OOD images. Finally, we introduce a novel baseline by leveraging recent work in feature visualisation to artificially produce a model-dependent baseline that removes information without being overly OOD, thus improving on the trade-off when compared to other existing baselines.

Not published at any conference at this time", "summary": "Multi30k is frequently cited in the multimodal machine translation (MMT) literature, offering parallel text data for training and fine-tuning deep learning models. However, it is limited to four languages: Czech, English, French, and German. This restriction has led many researchers to focus their investigations only on these languages. As a result, MMT research on diverse languages has been stalled because the official Multi30k dataset only represents European languages in Latin scripts. Previous efforts to extend Multi30k exist, but the list of supported languages, represented language families, and scripts is still very short. To address these issues, we propose MultiScript30k, a new Multi30k dataset extension for global languages in various scripts, created by translating the English version of Multi30k (Multi30k-En) using NLLB200-3.3B. The dataset consists of over \\(30000\\) sentences and provides translations of all sentences in Multi30k-En into Ar, Es, Uk, Zh\\_Hans and Zh\\_Hant. Similarity analysis shows that Multi30k extension consistently achieves greater than \\(0.8\\) cosine similarity and symmetric KL divergence less than \\(0.000251\\) for all languages supported except Zh\\_Hant which is comparable to the previous Multi30k extensions ArEnMulti30k and Multi30k-Uk. COMETKiwi scores reveal mixed assessments of MultiScript30k as a translation of Multi30k-En in comparison to the related work.

This paper presents the first systematic comparison of classical optimization and AI approaches to this problem, evaluating their performance against traditional algorithms. We apply PatternBoost transformer learning and reinforcement learning (PPO) to this problem for the first time, comparing them against ILP. ILP achieves provably optimal solutions up to 19 by 19 grids, while PatternBoost matches optimal performance up to 14 by 14 grids with 96% test loss reduction. PPO achieves perfect solutions on 10 by 10 grids but fails at 11 by 11 grids, where constraint violations prevent valid configurations.

Feature attribution methods, such as Integrated Gradient, are a type of post-hoc explainer that can provide token-level insights. However, explanations on the same input may vary greatly due to underlying biases of different methods. Users may be aware of this issue and mistrust their utility, while unaware users may trust them inadequately. In this work, we delve beyond the superficial inconsistencies between attribution methods, structuring their biases through a model- and method-agnostic framework of three evaluation metrics. We systematically assess both the lexical and position bias (what and where in the input) for two transformers; first, in a controlled, pseudo-random classification task on artificial data; then, in a semi-controlled causal relation detection task on natural data. We find that lexical and position biases are structurally unbalanced in our model comparison, with models that score high on one type score low on the other.

As a result, DeepSeek reported 21.6% higher efficacy estimates, exhibited greater laboratory-to-field data consistency, and showed more realistic effects of pest identity and management tactics. However, both models hallucinated, i.e., fabricated fictitious agents or references, reported on implausible ecological interactions or outcomes, confused old and new scientific nomenclatures, and omitted data on key agents or solutions.

The dataset includes sentence completion, question-answering, and object-count prediction tasks in English, Italian, and Turkish. Using FIBER, we examine whether the prompt language induces inference bias in entity selection and how large language models perform on multi-entity versus single-entity questions. The results indicate that the language of the prompt can influence the model's generated output, particularly for entities associated with the country corresponding to that language. However, this effect varies across different topics such that 31% of the topics exhibit factual inference bias score greater than 0.5. Moreover, the level of bias differs across languages such that Turkish prompts show higher bias compared to Italian in 83% of the topics, suggesting a language-dependent pattern. Our findings also show that models face greater difficulty when handling multi-entity questions than the single-entity questions. Model performance differs across both languages and model sizes. The highest mean average precision is achieved in English, while Turkish and Italian lead to noticeably lower scores.

Prior research has uncovered isolated cases of bias, particularly against English Language Learners (ELLs) however, there is a lack of systematic evaluation of such systems across broader sociolinguistic factors. In this work, we propose BAID, a comprehensive evaluation framework for AI detectors across various types of biases. As a part of the framework, we introduce over 200k samples spanning 7 major categories: demographics, age, educational grade level, dialect, formality, political leaning, and topic. We also generated synthetic versions of each sample with carefully crafted prompts to preserve the original content while reflecting subgroup-specific writing styles. Using this, we evaluate four open-source state-of-the-art AI text detectors and find consistent disparities in detection performance, particularly low recall rates for texts from underrepresented groups.

We employed a cross-sectional analysis design based on standardized medical probes, selecting four mainstream LLMs as research subjects: GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5, DeepSeek 3.1, and Qwen3-Max. An evaluation system comprising twenty medical probes across five core dimensions was used to simulate a genuine clinical communication environment. All probes had gold-standard answers defined by clinical experts and were assessed via a double-blind, inverse rating scale by two independent clinicians. The results show that all tested models exhibited functional defects to varying degrees, with Qwen3-Max demonstrating the best overall performance and Gemini 2.5 the worst. Under conditions of extreme noise, most models experienced a functional collapse. Notably, GPT-4o made a severe misjudgment in the risk assessment for pulmonary embolism (PE) secondary to deep vein thrombosis (DVT). This research is the first to empirically confirm that LLMs exhibit features resembling metabolic dysfunction when processing clinical information, proposing the innovative concept of \"AI-Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (AI-MASLD)\".

However, with the rapid growth of research publications, conducting systematic reviews has become increasingly burdensome, with title and abstract screening being one of the most time-consuming and resource-intensive steps. To mitigate this issue, we designed a two-stage dynamic few-shot learning (DFSL) approach aimed at improving the efficiency and performance of large language models (LLMs) in the title and abstract screening task. Specifically, this approach first uses a low-cost LLM for initial screening, then re-evaluates low-confidence instances using a high-performance LLM, thereby enhancing screening performance while controlling computational costs. We evaluated this approach across 10 systematic reviews, and the results demonstrate its strong generalizability and cost-effectiveness, with potential to reduce manual screening burden and accelerate the systematic review process in practical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u52a8\u6001\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DFSL\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6807\u9898\u548c\u6458\u8981\u7b5b\u9009\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u7814\u7a76\u51fa\u7248\u7269\u7684\u8fc5\u901f\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7efc\u8ff0\u7684\u6807\u9898\u548c\u6458\u8981\u7b5b\u9009\u53d8\u5f97\u975e\u5e38\u8017\u65f6\u548c\u8017\u8d39\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u52a8\u6001\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5148\u7528\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u521d\u6b65\u7b5b\u9009\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u7528\u9ad8\u6027\u80fdLLM\u5bf9\u4f4e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5b9e\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u518d\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u572810\u9879\u7cfb\u7edf\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u671b\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u7b5b\u9009\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u901f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7efc\u8ff0\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose Adaptive Speculative Decoding (AdaSD), a hyperparameter-free decoding scheme that dynamically adjusts generation length and acceptance criteria during inference. AdaSD introduces two adaptive thresholds: one to determine when to stop candidate token generation and another to decide token acceptance, both updated in real time based on token entropy and Jensen-Shannon distance. This approach eliminates the need for pre-analysis or fine-tuning and is compatible with off-the-shelf models.

Tasks such as drug recommendation, treatment planning, and adverse-effect prediction demand robust, multi-step reasoning grounded in reliable biomedical knowledge. Agentic AI methods, exemplified by TxAgent, address these challenges through iterative retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). TxAgent employs a fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B model that dynamically generates and executes function calls to a unified biomedical tool suite (ToolUniverse), integrating FDA Drug API, OpenTargets, and Monarch resources to ensure access to current therapeutic information. In contrast to general-purpose RAG systems, medical applications impose stringent safety constraints, rendering the accuracy of both the reasoning trace and the sequence of tool invocations critical. These considerations motivate evaluation protocols treating token-level reasoning and tool-usage behaviors as explicit supervision signals. This work presents insights derived from our participation in the CURE-Bench NeurIPS 2025 Challenge, which benchmarks therapeutic-reasoning systems using metrics that assess correctness, tool utilization, and reasoning quality.

We propose CIP, a lightweight and plug-and-play causal prompting framework that mitigates hallucinations at the input stage. CIP constructs a causal relation sequence among entities, actions, and events and injects it into the prompt to guide reasoning toward causally relevant evidence. Through causal intervention and counterfactual reasoning, CIP suppresses non causal reasoning paths, improving factual grounding and interpretability. Experiments across seven mainstream language models, including GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Llama 3.1, show that CIP consistently enhances reasoning quality and reliability, achieving 2.6 points improvement in Attributable Rate, 0.38 improvement in Causal Consistency Score, and a fourfold increase in effective information density. API level profiling further shows that CIP accelerates contextual understanding and reduces end to end response latency by up to 55.1 percent.

We conducted both human and automated evaluations using leading LLMs, including GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Claude Opus 4.1.

However, effectively fusing these adapters to handle complex, multi-domain composite queries remains a critical challenge. Existing LoRA fusion approaches either use static weights, which assign equal relevance to each participating LoRA, or require data-intensive supervised training for every possible LoRA combination to obtain respective optimal fusion weights. We propose qa-FLoRA, a novel query-adaptive data-and-training-free method for LoRA fusion that dynamically computes layer-level fusion weights by measuring distributional divergence between the base model and respective adapters. Our approach eliminates the need for composite training data or domain-representative samples, making it readily applicable to existing adapter collections. Extensive experiments across nine multilingual composite tasks spanning mathematics, coding, and medical domains, show that qa-FLoRA outperforms static fusion by ~5% with LLaMA-2 and ~6% with LLaMA-3, and the training-free baselines by ~7% with LLaMA-2 and ~10% with LLaMA-3, while significantly closing the gap with supervised baselines. Further, layer-level analysis of our fusion weights reveals interpretable fusion patterns, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach for robust multi-domain adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u65e0\u9700\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5qa-FLoRA\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u8ba1\u7b97LoRA\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u878d\u5408\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709LoRA\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u591a\u9886\u57df\u590d\u5408\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u9759\u6001\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u6216\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "method": "qa-FLoRA\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5404\u9002\u914d\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8ba1\u7b97\u5c42\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u878d\u5408\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "qa-FLoRA\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u590d\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u878d\u5408\u548c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6216\u9886\u57df\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6837\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "qa-FLoRA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u591a\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684LoRA\u878d\u5408\u3002"}}

This study refutes claims about formalistic judging in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) by developing automated methods to detect and classify judicial reasoning in Czech Supreme Courts' decisions using state-of-the-art natural language processing methods. We create the MADON dataset of 272 decisions from two Czech Supreme Courts with expert annotations of 9,183 paragraphs with eight argument types and holistic formalism labels for supervised training and evaluation. Using a corpus of 300k Czech court decisions, we adapt transformer LLMs for Czech legal domain by continued pretraining and experiment with methods to address dataset imbalance including asymmetric loss and class weighting. The best models successfully detect argumentative paragraphs (82.6\\% macro-F1), classify traditional types of legal argument (77.5\\% macro-F1), and classify decisions as formalistic/non-formalistic (83.2\\% macro-F1). Our three-stage pipeline combining ModernBERT, Llama 3.1, and traditional feature-based machine learning achieves promising results for decision classification while reducing computational costs and increasing explainability.

Yet, important visual information is easily lost throughout the entire context and missed by VLMs. Also, it is important to design tools that enable cost-effective analysis of lengthy video content. In this paper, we propose a clip selection method that targets key video moments to be included in a multimodal summary. We divide the video into short clips and generate compact visual descriptions of each using a lightweight video captioning model. These are then passed to a large language model (LLM), which selects the K clips containing the most relevant visual information for a multimodal summary. We evaluate our approach on reference clips for the task, automatically derived from full human-annotated screenplays and summaries in the MovieSum dataset. We further show that these reference clips (less than 6% of the movie) are sufficient to build a complete multimodal summary of the movies in MovieSum. Using our clip selection method, we achieve a summarization performance close to that of these reference clips while capturing substantially more relevant video information than random clip selection. Importantly, we maintain low computational cost by relying on a lightweight captioning model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6458\u8981\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u5173\u952e\u7247\u6bb5\u6765\u4fdd\u7559\u91cd\u8981\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "VLMs\u5904\u7406\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u4e22\u5931\u91cd\u8981\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u9ad8\u7684\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u4e3a\u77ed\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u89c6\u9891\u5b57\u5e55\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u7247\u6bb5\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6458\u8981\u3002", "result": "\u5728MovieSum\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u91cd\u8981\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u7247\u6bb5\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u53c2\u8003\u7247\u6bb5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u5305\u542b\u4e30\u5bcc\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6458\u8981\u3002"}}

However, a critical barrier to their real-world adoption is the lack of reliable evaluation of their trustworthiness, especially in multilingual healthcare settings. Existing LMs are predominantly trained in high-resource languages, making them ill-equipped to handle the complexity and diversity of healthcare queries in mid- and low-resource languages, posing significant challenges for deploying them in global healthcare contexts where linguistic diversity is key. In this work, we present CLINIC, a Comprehensive Multilingual Benchmark to evaluate the trustworthiness of language models in healthcare. CLINIC systematically benchmarks LMs across five key dimensions of trustworthiness: truthfulness, fairness, safety, robustness, and privacy, operationalized through 18 diverse tasks, spanning 15 languages (covering all the major continents), and encompassing a wide array of critical healthcare topics like disease conditions, preventive actions, diagnostic tests, treatments, surgeries, and medications. Our extensive evaluation reveals that LMs struggle with factual correctness, demonstrate bias across demographic and linguistic groups, and are susceptible to privacy breaches and adversarial attacks. By highlighting these shortcomings, CLINIC lays the foundation for enhancing the global reach and safety of LMs in healthcare across diverse languages.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCLINIC\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u533b\u7597\u5065\u5eb7\u9886\u57df\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d615\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u4e94\u4e2a\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u7597\u5065\u5eb7\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u5de8\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u8f83\u5c11\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u533b\u7597\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5168\u7403\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "CLINIC\u57fa\u51c6\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u9690\u79c1\uff09\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc718\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u300115\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u6db5\u76d6\u5404\u79cd\u5173\u952e\u533b\u7597\u4e3b\u9898\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3001\u4eba\u53e3\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u7684\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "CLINIC\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u7597\u5065\u5eb7\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u5728\u5168\u7403\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u5e7f\u5ea6\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

As a result, LLMs answer without support, hallucinate under incomplete or misleading context, and rely on spurious evidence. We introduce a training framework that treats the entire RAG pipeline -- both the retriever and the generator -- as an interactive proof system via an adaptation of the Merlin-Arthur (M/A) protocol. Arthur (the generator LLM) trains on questions of unkown provenance: Merlin provides helpful evidence, while Morgana injects adversarial, misleading context. Both use a linear-time XAI method to identify and modify the evidence most influential to Arthur. Consequently, Arthur learns to (i) answer when the context support the answer, (ii) reject when evidence is insufficient, and (iii) rely on the specific context spans that truly ground the answer. We further introduce a rigorous evaluation framework to disentangle explanation fidelity from baseline predictive errors. This allows us to introduce and measure the Explained Information Fraction (EIF), which normalizes M/A certified mutual-information guarantees relative to model capacity and imperfect benchmarks. Across three RAG datasets and two model families of varying sizes, M/A-trained LLMs show improved groundedness, completeness, soundness, and reject behavior, as well as reduced hallucinations -- without needing manually annotated unanswerable questions. The retriever likewise improves recall and MRR through automatically generated M/A hard positives and negatives.

Traditional topic-modeling methods, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), often fall short in capturing the complexity and dynamic nature of discourse in historical texts. To address these limitations, we employ BERTopic. This neural topic-modeling approach leverages transformerbased embeddings to extract and classify topics, which, despite its growing popularity, still remains underused in historical research. Our study focuses on articles published between 1955 and 2018, specifically examining discourse on nuclear power and nuclear safety. We analyze various topic distributions across the corpus and trace their temporal evolution to uncover long-term trends and shifts in public discourse. This enables us to more accurately explore patterns in public discourse, including the co-occurrence of themes related to nuclear power and nuclear weapons and their shifts in topic importance over time. Our study demonstrates the scalability and contextual sensitivity of BERTopic as an alternative to traditional approaches, offering richer insights into historical discourses extracted from newspaper archives.

Existing approaches for LLM auditing often focus on isolated aspects of model behavior, such as detecting specific biases or evaluating fairness. We are interested in a more general question -- can we understand how the outputs of black-box LLMs depend on each input token? There is a critical need to have such tools in real-world applications that rely on inaccessible API endpoints to language models. However, this is a highly non-trivial problem, as LLMs are stochastic functions (i.e. two outputs will be different by chance), while computing prompt-level gradients to approximate input sensitivity is infeasible. To address this, we propose Distribution-Based Sensitivity Analysis (DBSA), a lightweight model-agnostic procedure to evaluate the sensitivity of the output of a language model for each input token, without making any distributional assumptions about the LLM. DBSA is developed as a practical tool for practitioners, enabling quick, plug-and-play visual exploration of LLMs reliance on specific input tokens.

However, the fundamental limits on the achievable speedup remain poorly understood. In this work, we establish the first ``tight'' lower bounds on the runtime of any deterministic speculative generation algorithm. This is achieved by drawing a parallel between the token generation process and branching random walks, which allows us to analyze the optimal draft tree selection problem. We prove, under basic assumptions, that the expected number of tokens successfully predicted per speculative iteration is bounded as $\\mathbb{E}[X] \\leq (\u03bc+ \u03bc_{(2)})\\log(P )/\u03bc^2 + O(1)$, where $P$ is the verifier's capacity, $\u03bc$ is the expected entropy of the verifier's output distribution, and $\u03bc_{(2)}$ is the expected second log-moment. This result provides new insights into the limits of parallel token generation, and could guide the design of future speculative decoding systems. Empirical evaluations on Llama models validate our theoretical predictions, confirming the tightness of our bounds in practical settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63a8\u6d4b\u751f\u6210\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5176\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5206\u652f\u968f\u673a\u6e38\u8d70\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u6bcf\u8f6e\u63a8\u6d4b\u8fed\u4ee3\u6210\u529f\u9884\u6d4btoken\u6570\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a8\u6d4b\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u5229\u7528\u5e76\u884c\u6027\u52a0\u901f\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u52a0\u901f\u6781\u9650\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "method": "\u5c06token\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7c7b\u6bd4\u4e3a\u5206\u652f\u968f\u673a\u6e38\u8d70\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6700\u4f18\u8349\u7a3f\u6811\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u672c\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u6210\u529f\u9884\u6d4btoken\u6570\u7684\u671f\u671b\u4e0a\u754c\u516c\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u671f\u671b\u9884\u6d4btoken\u6570E[X]\u2264(\u03bc+\u03bc_(2))log(P)/\u03bc^2+O(1)\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dP\u4e3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8005\u5bb9\u91cf\uff0c\u03bc\u4e3a\u71b5\u671f\u671b\uff0c\u03bc_(2)\u4e3a\u4e8c\u9636\u5bf9\u6570\u77e9\u671f\u671b\u3002Llama\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u754c\u7684\u7d27\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6210\u679c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5e76\u884ctoken\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Existing LLM-based summarizers remain generic and fail to account for individual preferences, limiting their practical utility. We propose SUMFORU, a steerable review summarization framework that aligns outputs with explicit user personas to support personalized purchase decisions. Our approach integrates a high-quality data pipeline built from the Amazon 2023 Review Dataset with a two-stage alignment procedure: (1) persona-aware Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) via asymmetric knowledge distillation, and (2) Reinforcement Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) using a preference estimator to capture fine-grained, persona-relevant signals. We evaluate the model across rule-based, LLM-based, and human-centered metrics, demonstrating consistent improvements in consistency, grounding, and preference alignment. Our framework achieves the highest performance across all evaluation settings and generalizes effectively to unseen product categories. Our results highlight the promise of steerable pluralistic alignment for building next-generation personalized decision-support systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "SUMFORU\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u64cd\u63a7\u7684\u8bc4\u8bba\u6458\u8981\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7528\u6237\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u8d2d\u7269\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ebf\u4ea7\u54c1\u8bc4\u8bba\u5305\u542b\u4e30\u5bcc\u4f46\u5608\u6742\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u6458\u8981\u5de5\u5177\u901a\u7528\u6027\u5f3a\uff0c\u5374\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u4e2a\u4eba\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u7ed3\u5408\u4e2a\u4eba\u504f\u597d\u7684\u6458\u8981\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "SUMFORU\u6574\u5408\u4e86Amazon 2023\u8bc4\u8bba\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff1a(1) \u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u8fdb\u884c\u89d2\u8272\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\uff0c(2) \u5229\u7528\u504f\u597d\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u53caAI\u53cd\u9988\uff08RLAIF\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u3001\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8bc4\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\u4e0b\uff0c\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5728\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u57fa\u7840\u6027\u548c\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u6d4b\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u7c7b\u522b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u53ef\u64cd\u63a7\u591a\u5143\u5bf9\u9f50\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}
