However, in addition to the hierarchical\nstructure, data attributes, such as co-occurring features or similarities,\nfrequently exist.

In this work, we introduce a\nVoronoi treemap algorithm that leverages data similarity to generate\nneighborhood-preserving treemaps. First, we extend the treemap layout pipeline\nto consider similarity during data preprocessing. We then use a Kuhn-Munkres\nmatching of similarities to centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) cells to\ncreate initial Voronoi diagrams with equal cell sizes for each level. Greedy\nswapping is used to improve the neighborhoods of cells to match the data's\nsimilarity further. During optimization, cell areas are iteratively adjusted to\ntheir respective sizes while preserving the existing neighborhoods.

Building upon the foundation of CycleGAN, our approach\nintegrates Local Neighborhood Encoding (LNE) and frequency-aware supervision to\ncapture fine-grained local pixel semantics while preserving structural\ncoherence from the source domain. We employ distribution-based loss metrics,\nincluding KL/JS divergence and log-based similarity measures, to explicitly\nquantify the alignment between real and generated image distributions in both\nspatial and frequency domains. To validate the efficacy of Fd-CycleGAN, we\nconduct experiments on diverse datasets -- Horse2Zebra, Monet2Photo, and a\nsynthetically augmented Strike-off dataset. Compared to baseline CycleGAN and\nother state-of-the-art methods, our approach demonstrates superior perceptual\nquality, faster convergence, and improved mode diversity, particularly in\nlow-data regimes. By effectively capturing local and global distribution\ncharacteristics, Fd-CycleGAN achieves more visually coherent and semantically\nconsistent translations. Our results suggest that frequency-guided latent\nlearning significantly improves generalization in image translation tasks, with\npromising applications in document restoration, artistic style transfer, and\nmedical image synthesis.

However, most existing end-to-end methods rely heavily on scarce\npaired garment-centric datasets and fail to effectively leverage priors of\nadvanced visual models and test-time inputs, making it challenging to\naccurately preserve fine-grained garment details and maintain temporal\nconsistency in unconstrained scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose\nDreamVVT, a carefully designed two-stage framework built upon Diffusion\nTransformers (DiTs), which is inherently capable of leveraging diverse unpaired\nhuman-centric data to enhance adaptability in real-world scenarios. To further\nleverage prior knowledge from pretrained models and test-time inputs, in the\nfirst stage, we sample representative frames from the input video and utilize a\nmulti-frame try-on model integrated with a vision-language model (VLM), to\nsynthesize high-fidelity and semantically consistent keyframe try-on images.\nThese images serve as complementary appearance guidance for subsequent video\ngeneration. \\textbf{In the second stage}, skeleton maps together with\nfine-grained motion and appearance descriptions are extracted from the input\ncontent, and these along with the keyframe try-on images are then fed into a\npretrained video generation model enhanced with LoRA adapters. This ensures\nlong-term temporal coherence for unseen regions and enables highly plausible\ndynamic motions. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate\nthat DreamVVT surpasses existing methods in preserving detailed garment content\nand temporal stability in real-world scenarios.

This\nstudy proposes a new solution, the Variable Selection Network-fused Insertion\nTransformer (VSNIT), integrating the Insertion Transformer's flexible sequence\nconstruction with the Variable Selection Network's dynamic covariate handling\ncapability, to recover missing segments in incomplete activity sequences while\npreserving existing data. The findings show that VSNIT inserts more diverse,\nrealistic activity patterns, more closely matching real-world variability, and\nrestores disrupted activity transitions more effectively aligning with the\ntarget. It also performs significantly better than the baseline model across\nall metrics.

For example, when interacting with a\nchatbot, malicious users can input specially crafted prompts to cause the LLM\nto generate undesirable content or perform a completely different task from its\nintended purpose. Existing mitigations for such attacks typically rely on\nhardening the LLM's system prompt or using a content classifier trained to\ndetect undesirable content or off-topic conversations. However, these\nprobabilistic approaches are relatively easy to bypass due to the very large\nspace of possible inputs and undesirable outputs. In this paper, we present and\nevaluate Highlight & Summarize (H&S), a new design pattern for\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that prevents these attacks by\ndesign. The core idea is to perform the same task as a standard RAG pipeline\n(i.e., to provide natural language answers to questions, based on relevant\nsources) without ever revealing the user's question to the generative LLM. This\nis achieved by splitting the pipeline into two components: a highlighter, which\ntakes the user's question and extracts relevant passages (\"highlights\") from\nthe retrieved documents, and a summarizer, which takes the highlighted passages\nand summarizes them into a cohesive answer. We describe several possible\ninstantiations of H&S and evaluate their generated responses in terms of\ncorrectness, relevance, and response quality.

NeRF achieves high-fidelity\nnovel view synthesis by learning volumetric representations through neural\nnetworks, but its implicit encoding makes editing and physical interaction\nchallenging. In contrast, GS represents scenes as explicit collections of\nGaussian primitives, enabling real-time rendering, faster training, and more\nintuitive manipulation. This explicit structure has made GS particularly\nwell-suited for interactive editing and integration with physics-based\nsimulation. In this paper, we introduce GENIE (Gaussian Encoding for Neural\nRadiance Fields Interactive Editing), a hybrid model that combines the\nphotorealistic rendering quality of NeRF with the editable and structured\nrepresentation of GS. Instead of using spherical harmonics for appearance\nmodeling, we assign each Gaussian a trainable feature embedding. These\nembeddings are used to condition a NeRF network based on the k nearest\nGaussians to each query point. To make this conditioning efficient, we\nintroduce Ray-Traced Gaussian Proximity Search (RT-GPS), a fast nearest\nGaussian search based on a modified ray-tracing pipeline. We also integrate a\nmulti-resolution hash grid to initialize and update Gaussian features.\nTogether, these components enable real-time, locality-aware editing: as\nGaussian primitives are repositioned or modified, their interpolated influence\nis immediately reflected in the rendered output. By combining the strengths of\nimplicit and explicit representations, GENIE supports intuitive scene\nmanipulation, dynamic interaction, and compatibility with physical simulation,\nbridging the gap between geometry-based editing and neural rendering.

We develop rubrics that use a tree\nstructure to hierarchically collapse the penetration testing task for a\nparticular environment into smaller, simpler, and more manageable sub-tasks and\ncriteria until each leaf node represents simple yes-or-no criteria for\nPentestJudge to evaluate. Task nodes are broken down into different categories\nrelated to operational objectives, operational security, and tradecraft.\nLLM-as-judge scores are compared to human domain experts as a ground-truth\nreference, allowing us to compare their relative performance with standard\nbinary classification metrics, such as F1 scores. We evaluate several frontier\nand open-source models acting as judge agents, with the best model reaching an\nF1 score of 0.83.

Accepted to the ICCV 2025 Workshop on\n  Vision-based Industrial InspectiON (VISION)", "summary": "Recent advancements in diffusion models have demonstrated significant success\nin unsupervised anomaly segmentation. For anomaly segmentation, these models\nare first trained on normal data; then, an anomalous image is noised to an\nintermediate step, and the normal image is reconstructed through backward\ndiffusion. Unlike traditional statistical methods, diffusion models do not rely\non specific assumptions about the data or target anomalies, making them\nversatile for use across different domains. However, diffusion models typically\nassume access to normal data for training, limiting their applicability in\nrealistic settings. In this paper, we propose novel robust denoising diffusion\nmodels for scenarios where only contaminated (i.e., a mix of normal and\nanomalous) unlabeled data is available. By casting maximum likelihood\nestimation of the data as a nonlinear regression problem, we reinterpret the\ndenoising diffusion probabilistic model through a regression lens. Using robust\nregression, we derive a robust version of denoising diffusion probabilistic\nmodels. Our novel framework offers flexibility in constructing various robust\ndiffusion models. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms current\nstate of the art diffusion models, for unsupervised anomaly segmentation when\nonly contaminated data is available. Our method outperforms existing\ndiffusion-based approaches, achieving up to 8.08\\% higher AUROC and 10.37\\%\nhigher AUPRC on MVTec datasets.

We propose Privacy-Aware Decoding (PAD), a\nlightweight, inference-time defense that adaptively injects calibrated Gaussian\nnoise into token logits during generation. PAD integrates confidence-based\nscreening to selectively protect high-risk tokens, efficient sensitivity\nestimation to minimize unnecessary noise, and context-aware noise calibration\nto balance privacy with generation quality. A \\renyi Differential Privacy (RDP)\naccountant rigorously tracks cumulative privacy loss, enabling explicit\nper-response $(\\varepsilon, \\delta)$-DP guarantees for sensitive outputs.\nUnlike prior approaches requiring retraining or corpus-level filtering, PAD is\nmodel-agnostic and operates entirely at decoding time with minimal\ncomputational overhead.

The estimated\nimage and blur filter are defined as the maximizer of the posterior\ndistribution.

In this paper, we revisit this result using diffusion-based\npriors, a class of models that capture realistic image distributions. Through\nan empirical examination of the prior's likelihood landscape, we uncover two\nkey properties: first, blurry images tend to have higher likelihoods; second,\nthe landscape contains numerous local minimizers that correspond to natural\nimages. Building on these insights, we provide a theoretical analysis of the\nblind deblurring posterior. This reveals that the MAP estimator tends to\nproduce sharp filters (close to the Dirac delta function) and blurry solutions.\nHowever local minimizers of the posterior, which can be obtained with gradient\ndescent, correspond to realistic, natural images, effectively solving the blind\ndeconvolution problem.

First, AFOG utilizes a learnable attention mechanism that\nfocuses perturbations on vulnerable image regions in multi-box detection tasks,\nincreasing performance over non-attention baselines by up to 30.6%. Second,\nAFOG's attack loss is formulated by integrating two types of feature loss\nthrough learnable attention updates with iterative injection of adversarial\nperturbations. Finally, AFOG is an efficient and stealthy adversarial\nperturbation method. It probes the weak spots of detection transformers by\nadding strategically generated and visually imperceptible perturbations which\ncan cause well-trained object detection models to fail.

Unlearnable Examples\n(UEs) have emerged as a promising countermeasure against unauthorized model\ntraining, employing carefully crafted unlearnable noise to disrupt the learning\nof meaningful representations from protected data. Current approaches typically\ngenerate UEs by jointly optimizing unlearnable noise for both images and their\nassociated text descriptions (or labels). However, this optimization process is\noften computationally prohibitive for on-device execution, forcing reliance on\nexternal third-party services.

To evaluate our\napproach, we develop CrossVideoQA, a comprehensive benchmark dataset\nspecifically designed for person-centric cross-video analysis. Experimental\nresults demonstrate VideoForest's superior performance in cross-video reasoning\ntasks, achieving 71.93% accuracy in person recognition, 83.75% in behavior\nanalysis, and 51.67% in summarization and reasoning, significantly\noutperforming existing methods.

Prior research has often probed gender bias using\nexplicit gender cues as counterfactual, or studied them in sentence completion\nand short question answering tasks. These formats might overlook more implicit\nforms of bias embedded in generative behavior of longer content. In this work,\nwe investigate gender bias in LLMs using gender stereotypes studied in\npsychology (e.g., aggressiveness or gossiping) in an open-ended task of\nnarrative generation. We introduce a novel dataset called StereoBias-Stories\ncontaining short stories either unconditioned or conditioned on (one, two, or\nsix) random attributes from 25 psychological stereotypes and three task-related\nstory endings. We analyze how the gender contribution in the overall story\nchanges in response to these attributes and present three key findings: (1)\nWhile models, on average, are highly biased towards male in unconditioned\nprompts, conditioning on attributes independent from gender stereotypes\nmitigates this bias.

However,\ntheir performance often degrades in the presence of occlusions, where objects\nlike hands, hair, or accessories obscure the face. To address this limitation,\nwe introduce the novel task of face matting, which estimates fine-grained alpha\nmattes to separate occluding elements from facial regions. We further present\nFaceMat, a trimap-free, uncertainty-aware framework that predicts high-quality\nalpha mattes under complex occlusions. Our approach leverages a two-stage\ntraining pipeline: a teacher model is trained to jointly estimate alpha mattes\nand per-pixel uncertainty using a negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss, and this\nuncertainty is then used to guide the student model through spatially adaptive\nknowledge distillation. This formulation enables the student to focus on\nambiguous or occluded regions, improving generalization and preserving semantic\nconsistency. Unlike previous approaches that rely on trimaps or segmentation\nmasks, our framework requires no auxiliary inputs making it well-suited for\nreal-time applications. In addition, we reformulate the matting objective by\nexplicitly treating skin as foreground and occlusions as background, enabling\nclearer compositing strategies.

Therefore, we\npropose Hierarchical Guard (Hi-Guard), a multimodal moderation framework that\nintroduces a new policy-aligned decision paradigm.

However, most existing approaches, e.g., Best-of-N and\nSelf-Consistency rely on a single agent interacting with a reward model\n(SA-SR), constrained by limited capabilities of a single test-time scaling\n(STTS) paradigm. On the other hand, recent works demonstrate that\ncollective-agent methods can break through the upper bound of single-agent\nsystems by orchestrating diverse models. Thus, in this paper, we take a first\nstep towards exploring Collective Test-Time Scaling (CTTS). Consider the\ndifferent interaction types of single and multiple models, we design three\nprimary paradigms to investigate the optimal paradigm of CTTS: (1) single agent\nto multiple reward models (SA-MR); (2) multiple agents to single reward model\n(MA-SR); and (3) multiple agents to multiple reward models (MA-MR). Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that MA-MR consistently achieves the best performance.\nBased on this, we propose a novel framework named CTTS-MM that effectively\nleverages both multi-agent and multi-reward-model collaboration for enhanced\ninference.

To address these\nchallenges, we propose a general and efficient multi-view feature enhancement\nmodule, RobustGS, which substantially improves the robustness of feedforward\n3DGS methods under various adverse imaging conditions, enabling high-quality 3D\nreconstruction. The RobustGS module can be seamlessly integrated into existing\npretrained pipelines in a plug-and-play manner to enhance reconstruction\nrobustness.

While prior research\nhas primarily focused on improving their training and inference strategies,\ntheir potential for in-context learning (ICL) remains largely underexplored. To\nfill this gap, we propose Thinking with Nothinking Calibration (JointThinking),\na new ICL paradigm that leverages the structured difference between two\nreasoning modes, i.e., Thinking and Nothinking, to improve reasoning accuracy.\nSpecifically, our method prompts the model to generate two answers in parallel:\none in Thinking mode and the other in Nothinking mode. A second round of\nThinking is triggered only when the two initial responses are inconsistent,\nusing a single prompt that incorporates the original question and both\ncandidate answers. Since such disagreement occurs infrequently (e.g., only 6\\%\nin GSM8K), our method performs just one round of reasoning in most cases,\nresulting in minimal latency overhead. Extensive experiments across multiple\nreasoning benchmarks demonstrate that JointThinking significantly outperforms\nfew-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) and majority voting with improved answer\nrobustness. Moreover, It achieves comparable in-distribution performance to\ntraining-based SOTA method, while substantially outperforming on\nout-of-distribution tasks. We further conduct a systematic analysis of the\ncalibration mechanism, showing that leveraging different reasoning modes\nconsistently lowers the error rate and highlights the value of structural\nthinking diversity. Additionally, we observe that the performance gap between\nactual and ideal reasoning narrows as model size increases in the second round\nof thinking, indicating the strong scalability of our approach.

The integration of\nmultimodal information can significantly enhance continual learning of image\nclasses. However, while existing approaches do utilize textual modality\ninformation, they solely rely on simplistic templates with a class name,\nthereby neglecting richer semantic information. To address these limitations,\nwe propose a novel framework that harnesses visual concepts generated by large\nlanguage models (LLMs) as discriminative semantic guidance.

However, most existing FSL methods rely on entangled\nrepresentations, requiring the model to implicitly recover the unmixing process\nto obtain disentangled representations using only limited supervision, which\nhinders effective adaptation. Recent theoretical studies show that multimodal\ncontrastive learning methods, such as CLIP, can disentangle latent\nrepresentations up to linear transformations. In light of this, we propose the\nCausal CLIP Adapter (CCA), a novel framework that explicitly disentangles\nvisual features extracted from CLIP using unsupervised Independent Component\nAnalysis (ICA). This removes the need to learn the unmixing process from the\nlabeled data, thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters and\nmitigating overfitting. Taking a step further, while ICA can obtain visual\ndisentangled representations, it may also disrupt CLIP's intra- and inter-modal\nalignment. To counteract this, CCA further leverages CLIP's inherent\ncross-modal alignment by enhancing it in two ways: unidirectionally, through\nfine-tuning a CLIP-based text classifier, and bidirectionally, via a\ncross-attention mechanism that enriches visual and textual representations\nthrough mutual interaction. Both unimodal and cross-modal classification\noutputs can be effectively combined linearly to improve classification\naccuracy. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate that our\nmethod consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of\nfew-shot performance and robustness to distributional shifts, while maintaining\ncomputational efficiency.

We present H3R, a hybrid framework that addresses this limitation\nby integrating volumetric latent fusion with attention-based feature\naggregation. Our framework consists of two complementary components: an\nefficient latent volume that enforces geometric consistency through epipolar\nconstraints, and a camera-aware Transformer that leverages Pl\\\"ucker\ncoordinates for adaptive correspondence refinement.

Current LLMs fail to reason deterministically and are not\ninterpretable. As such, there has been a recent surge in interest in\nneurosymbolic AI, which attempts to incorporate logic into neural networks. We\nfirst identify two main neurosymbolic approaches to improving logical\nreasoning: (i) the integrative approach comprising models where symbolic\nreasoning is contained within the neural network, and (ii) the hybrid approach\ncomprising models where a symbolic solver, separate from the neural network,\nperforms symbolic reasoning. Both contain AI systems with promising results on\ndomain-specific logical reasoning benchmarks. However, their performance on\ndomain-agnostic benchmarks is understudied. To the best of our knowledge, there\nhas not been a comparison of the contrasting approaches that answers the\nfollowing question: Which approach is more promising for developing general\nlogical reasoning? To analyze their potential, the following best-in-class\ndomain-agnostic models are introduced: Logic Neural Network (LNN), which uses\nthe integrative approach, and LLM-Symbolic Solver (LLM-SS), which uses the\nhybrid approach. Using both models as case studies and representatives of each\napproach, our analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach is more promising\nfor developing general logical reasoning because (i) its reasoning chain is\nmore interpretable, and (ii) it retains the capabilities and advantages of\nexisting LLMs. To support future works using the hybrid approach, we propose a\ngeneralizable framework based on LLM-SS that is modular by design,\nmodel-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and requires little to no human input.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7AI\u5728\u901a\u7528\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5177\u524d\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u901a\u7528\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7AI\u8bd5\u56fe\u5c06\u903b\u8f91\u878d\u5165\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982LNN\uff09\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982LLM-SS\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u901a\u7528\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u4fdd\u7559LLM\u4f18\u52bf\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u66f4\u5177\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eLLM-SS\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u672a\u6765\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Astronautical Congress (IAC-24), Milan, Italy,\n  Oct. 2024", "summary": "The accurate state estimation of unknown bodies in space is a critical\nchallenge with applications ranging from the tracking of space debris to the\nshape estimation of small bodies. A necessary enabler to this capability is to\nfind and track features on a continuous stream of images. Existing methods,\nsuch as SIFT, ORB and AKAZE, achieve real-time but inaccurate pose estimates,\nwhereas modern deep learning methods yield higher quality features at the cost\nof more demanding computational resources which might not be available on\nspace-qualified hardware. Additionally, both classical and data-driven methods\nare not robust to the highly opaque self-cast shadows on the object of\ninterest. We show that, as the target body rotates, these shadows may lead to\nlarge biases in the resulting pose estimates. For these objects, a bias in the\nreal-time pose estimation algorithm may mislead the spacecraft's state\nestimator and cause a mission failure, especially if the body undergoes a\nchaotic tumbling motion. We present COFFEE, the Celestial Occlusion Fast\nFEature Extractor, a real-time pose estimation framework for asteroids designed\nto leverage prior information on the sun phase angle given by sun-tracking\nsensors commonly available onboard spacecraft. By associating salient contours\nto their projected shadows, a sparse set of features are detected, invariant to\nthe motion of the shadows. A Sparse Neural Network followed by an\nattention-based Graph Neural Network feature matching model are then jointly\ntrained to provide a set of correspondences between successive frames. The\nresulting pose estimation pipeline is found to be bias-free, more accurate than\nclassical pose estimation pipelines and an order of magnitude faster than other\nstate-of-the-art deep learning pipelines on synthetic data as well as on\nrenderings of the tumbling asteroid Apophis.", "AI": {"tldr": "COFFEE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u65f6\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5c0f\u884c\u661f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u592a\u9633\u76f8\u4f4d\u89d2\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u9634\u5f71\u4e0d\u53d8\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u65e0\u504f\u3001\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e14\u5feb\u901f\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u672a\u77e5\u5929\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u81ea\u6295\u9634\u5f71\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u592a\u9633\u76f8\u4f4d\u89d2\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u9634\u5f71\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "COFFEE\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548cApophis\u5c0f\u884c\u661f\u6e32\u67d3\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb\u4e14\u65e0\u504f\u3002", "conclusion": "COFFEE\u4e3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u672a\u77e5\u5929\u4f53\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

DDI\nsystematically constructs an explicit data dependency graph prior to actual\ncode synthesis. To ensure reliability, we formalize DDI as a constrained\nmathematical reasoning task through novel prompting strategies, aligning with\nLLMs' excellent mathematical strengths.

The understanding step analyzes the\nsource image to create a source prompt through structured semantic analysis and\nmakes minimal word replacements to form the target prompt based on the editing\ninstruction. 2. The editing step introduces a time-adaptive offset, allowing\nfor coherent editing from coarse to fine throughout the denoising process. 3.\nThe verification step checks the alignment between the target prompt and the\nintermediate edited image, provides automatic consistency scores and corrective\nfeedback, and determines whether to stop early or continue the editing loop.\nThis understanding, editing, and verifying loop iterates until convergence,\ndelivering high-fidelity editing in a training-free manner. We implemented our\nmethod based on the latest BLIP3-o and achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nperformance on the GEdit-Bench benchmark.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aUniEdit-I\u7684\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e09\u4e2a\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u6dfb\u52a0\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7edf\u4e00VLM\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u8f7b\u677e\u5b9e\u73b0\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u80fd\u529b\u4ecd\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "UniEdit-I\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\u5b9e\u73b0\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\uff1a1. \u7406\u89e3\u6b65\u9aa4\u5206\u6790\u6e90\u56fe\u50cf\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u76ee\u6807\u63d0\u793a\uff1b2. \u7f16\u8f91\u6b65\u9aa4\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7684\u8fde\u8d2f\u7f16\u8f91\uff1b3. \u9a8c\u8bc1\u6b65\u9aa4\u68c0\u67e5\u76ee\u6807\u63d0\u793a\u4e0e\u7f16\u8f91\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5339\u914d\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53cd\u9988\u5e76\u51b3\u5b9a\u662f\u5426\u7ee7\u7eed\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8eBLIP3-o\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684UniEdit-I\u5728GEdit-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "UniEdit-I\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00VLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

This paper presents\nan approach to information extraction and automatic knowledge graph (KG)\ngeneration to identify and connect biomedical knowledge. Through a pipeline of\nlarge language model (LLM) agents, the system decomposes 44 PubMed abstracts\ninto semantically meaningful proposition sentences and extracts KG triples from\nthese sentences. The triples are enhanced using a combination of open domain\nand ontology-based information extraction methodologies to incorporate\nontological categories. On top of this, a context variable is included during\nextraction to allow the triple to stand on its own - thereby becoming\n`quadruples'. The extraction accuracy of the LLM is validated by comparing\nnatural language sentences generated from the enhanced triples to the original\npropositions, achieving an average cosine similarity of 0.874. The similarity\nfor generated sentences of enhanced triples were compared with generated\nsentences of ordinary triples showing an increase as a result of the context\nvariable.

In this framework, nodes represent individual\nbeliefs, edges encode epistemic relationships (e.g., support or contradiction),\nand two distinct functions assign each belief a credibility (reflecting source\ntrust) and a confidence (derived from internal structural support). Unlike\nclassical probabilistic models, our approach does not assume prior coherence or\nrequire belief updating. Unlike logical and argumentation-based frameworks, it\nsupports fine-grained structural representation without committing to binary\njustification status or deductive closure. The model is purely static and\ndeliberately excludes inference or revision procedures. Its aim is to provide a\nfoundational substrate for analyzing the internal organization of belief\nsystems, including coherence conditions, epistemic tensions, and\nrepresentational limits.

In this paper, we propose\nSmartGen, an LLM-based framework that synthesizes context-aware user behavior\ndata to support continual adaptation of downstream smart home models. SmartGen\nconsists of four key components. First, we design a Time and Semantic-aware\nSplit module to divide long behavior sequences into manageable, semantically\ncoherent subsequences under dual time-span constraints. Second, we propose\nSemantic-aware Sequence Compression to reduce input length while preserving\nrepresentative semantics by clustering behavior mapping in latent space. Third,\nwe introduce Graph-guided Sequence Synthesis, which constructs a behavior\nrelationship graph and encodes frequent transitions into prompts, guiding the\nLLM to generate data aligned with contextual changes while retaining core\nbehavior patterns. Finally, we design a Two-stage Outlier Filter to identify\nand remove implausible or semantically inconsistent outputs, aiming to improve\nthe factual coherence and behavioral validity of the generated sequences.\nExperiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that SmartGen\nsignificantly enhances model performance on anomaly detection and behavior\nprediction tasks under behavioral drift, with anomaly detection improving by\n85.43% and behavior prediction by 70.51% on average.

In clinical practice, optical coherence tomography\nangiography (OCTA) is commonly used for studying CNV-related pathological\nchanges, due to its micron-level resolution and non-invasive nature. Thus,\naccurate segmentation of CNV regions and vessels in OCTA images is crucial for\nclinical assessment of wet AMD. However, challenges existed due to irregular\nCNV shapes and imaging limitations like projection artifacts, noises and\nboundary blurring. Moreover, the lack of publicly available datasets\nconstraints the CNV analysis. To address these challenges, this paper\nconstructs the first publicly accessible CNV dataset (CNVSeg), and proposes a\nnovel multilateral graph convolutional interaction-enhanced CNV segmentation\nnetwork (MTG-Net). This network integrates both region and vessel morphological\ninformation, exploring semantic and geometric duality constraints within the\ngraph domain. Specifically, MTG-Net consists of a multi-task framework and two\ngraph-based cross-task modules: Multilateral Interaction Graph Reasoning (MIGR)\nand Multilateral Reinforcement Graph Reasoning (MRGR). The multi-task framework\nencodes rich geometric features of lesion shapes and surfaces, decoupling the\nimage into three task-specific feature maps.

To train the VNPNet,\nwe create a large-scale dataset consisting of pairs of text prompts, random\nnoise, and refined noise. Extensive experiments with various text-to-video\nmodels show that our method consistently improves the quality and temporal\nconsistency of the generated videos. FastInit not only provides a substantial\nimprovement in video generation but also offers a practical solution that can\nbe applied directly during inference. The code and dataset will be released.", "AI": {"tldr": "FastInit\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5feb\u901f\u566a\u58f0\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982FreeInit\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u566a\u58f0\u63d0\u9ad8\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002FastInit\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "FastInit\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u566a\u58f0\u9884\u6d4b\u7f51\u7edc\uff08VNPNet\uff09\uff0c\u8f93\u5165\u968f\u673a\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5355\u6b21\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8fed\u4ee3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFastInit\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "FastInit\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u3002"}}

While the challenges in\nhigh-level perception and planning are continually addressed along the progress\nof general large pre-trained models, the low precision of low-level action\nestimation has emerged as the key limiting factor in manipulation performance.\nTo this end, this paper introduces a novel robot manipulation framework, i.e.,\nActionSink, to pave the way toward precise action estimations in the field of\nlearning-based robot manipulation. As the name suggests, ActionSink\nreformulates the actions of robots as action-caused optical flows from videos,\ncalled \"action flow\", in a self-supervised manner, which are then used to be\nretrieved and integrated to enhance the action estimation. Specifically,\nActionSink incorporates two primary modules. The first module is a\ncoarse-to-fine action flow matcher, which continuously refines the accuracy of\naction flow via iterative retrieval and denoising process. The second module is\na dynamic action flow integrator, which employs a working memory pool that\ndynamically and efficiently manages the historical action flows that should be\nused to integrate to enhance the current action estimation.

In this work, we present FFHQ-Makeup, a high-quality\nsynthetic makeup dataset that pairs each identity with multiple makeup styles\nwhile preserving facial consistency in both identity and expression. Built upon\nthe diverse FFHQ dataset, our pipeline transfers real-world makeup styles from\nexisting datasets onto 18K identities by introducing an improved makeup\ntransfer method that disentangles identity and makeup.

In this paper, we identify a modality discrepancy (\\emph{i.e.},\nlimited text tokens \\emph{vs.} excessive and redundant vision tokens) of VLMs.\nHowever, existing Hessian-based LLM PTQ methods treat all tokens equally during\nquantization, resulting in severe performance drops when applied to VLMs.\nMotivated by this observation, we propose a novel importance-aware PTQ\nframework tailored for VLMs, dubbed VLMQ. Specifically, to address vision token\nredundancy, VLMQ 1) optimizes an importance-aware objective that yields an\nenhanced Hessian with token-level importance factors, while retaining\ncompatibility with parallelized weight updates, and 2) ensures efficiency and\neffectiveness by computing these factors via a single lightweight block-wise\nbackward pass, guided by a theoretical connection to token-level perturbations.\nExtensive evaluations on 8 benchmarks across 0.5B$\\sim$32B VLMs demonstrate the\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of our VLMQ, particularly under low-bit\nsettings. For example, it achieves a substantial \\textbf{16.45\\%} improvement\non MME-RealWorld under 2-bit quantization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6VLMQ\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316\u4e0b\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eHessian\u7684LLM\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eVLMs\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\uff08\u6587\u672c\u6807\u8bb0\u6709\u9650\u800c\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u5197\u4f59\uff09\u3002", "method": "VLMQ\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u76ee\u6807\u751f\u6210\u589e\u5f3a\u7684Hessian\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5355\u6b21\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5757\u7ea7\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u57288\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cVLMQ\u57280.5B~32B\u89c4\u6a21\u7684VLMs\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316\u4e0b\uff08\u59822\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316\u4e0bMME-RealWorld\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u534716.45%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "VLMQ\u4e3aVLMs\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

These engaging user-generated\ncontent are characterised by their reuse of visual elements also found in other\nmemes. Matching instances of memes via these shared visual elements, called\nMeme Matching, is the basis of a wealth of meme analysis approaches. However,\nmost existing methods assume that every meme consists of a shared visual\nbackground, called a Template, with some overlaid text, thereby limiting meme\nmatching to comparing the background image alone. Current approaches exclude\nthe many memes that are not template-based and limit the effectiveness of\nautomated meme analysis and would not be effective at linking memes to\ncontemporary web-based meme dictionaries. In this work, we introduce a broader\nformulation of meme matching that extends beyond template matching. We show\nthat conventional similarity measures, including a novel segment-wise\ncomputation of the similarity measures, excel at matching template-based memes\nbut fall short when applied to non-template-based meme formats.

In this paper, we present SDGPA (Synthetic Data Generation and\nProgressive Adaptation), a novel method that tackles zero-shot domain adaptive\nsemantic segmentation, in which no target images are available, but only a text\ndescription of the target domain's style is provided. To compensate for the\nlack of target domain training data, we utilize a pretrained off-the-shelf\ntext-to-image diffusion model, which generates training images by transferring\nsource domain images to target style. Directly editing source domain images\nintroduces noise that harms segmentation because the layout of source images\ncannot be precisely maintained. To address inaccurate layouts in synthetic\ndata, we propose a method that crops the source image, edits small patches\nindividually, and then merges them back together, which helps improve spatial\nprecision. Recognizing the large domain gap, SDGPA constructs an augmented\nintermediate domain, leveraging easier adaptation subtasks to enable more\nstable model adaptation to the target domain. Additionally, to mitigate the\nimpact of noise in synthetic data, we design a progressive adaptation strategy,\nensuring robust learning throughout the training process.

To\naddress these limitations, we propose CIVQLLIE, a novel framework that\nleverages the power of discrete representation learning through causal\nreasoning.

However, there is a risk that malicious individuals might misuse these\ncapabilities for misleading activities. Although existing research has\nattempted to shield photographic images from being manipulated by generative\nmodels, there remains a significant disparity in the protection offered to\nvideo content editing. To bridge the gap, we propose a protection method named\nVideoGuard, which can effectively protect videos from unauthorized malicious\nediting. This protection is achieved through the subtle introduction of nearly\nunnoticeable perturbations that interfere with the functioning of the intended\ngenerative diffusion models. Due to the redundancy between video frames, and\ninter-frame attention mechanism in video diffusion models, simply applying\nimage-based protection methods separately to every video frame can not shield\nvideo from unauthorized editing.

However, despite\ntheir practical success, little is known about how guidance interacts with\ndifferent stages of the sampling process-especially in the fast, low-step\nregimes typical of modern flow-based pipelines. In this work, we uncover and\nanalyze a fundamental instability: the earliest reverse steps are acutely\nsensitive to the guidance scale, owing to a pronounced spike in the relative\nstrength (RATIO) of conditional to unconditional predictions. Through rigorous\ntheoretical analysis and empirical validation, we show that this RATIO spike is\nintrinsic to the data distribution, independent of the model architecture, and\ncauses exponential error amplification when paired with strong guidance. To\naddress this, we propose a simple, theoretically grounded, RATIO-aware adaptive\nguidance schedule that automatically dampens the guidance scale at early steps\nbased on the evolving RATIO, using a closed-form exponential decay. Our method\nis lightweight, requires no additional inference overhead, and is compatible\nwith standard flow frameworks.

Existing demoireing methods primarily\nrely on single-camera image/video processing, which faces two critical\nchallenges: 1) distinguishing moire patterns from visually similar real\ntextures, and 2) preserving tonal consistency and temporal coherence while\nremoving moire artifacts. To address these issues, we propose a dual-camera\nframework that captures synchronized videos of the same scene: one in focus\n(retaining high-quality textures but may exhibit moire patterns) and one\ndefocused (with significantly reduced moire patterns but blurred textures). We\nuse the defocused video to help distinguish moire patterns from real texture,\nso as to guide the demoireing of the focused video.

Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution to reduce\nmemory usage and accelerate inference, but existing PTQ methods suffer from\nsevere performance degradation under extreme low-bit settings. We identify two\nkey obstacles to low-bit post-training quantization for DiT models: (1) model\nweights follow a Gaussian-like distribution with long tails, causing uniform\nquantization to poorly allocate intervals and leading to significant errors;\n(2) two types of activation outliers: (i) Mild Outliers with slightly elevated\nvalues, and (ii) Salient Outliers with large magnitudes concentrated in\nspecific channels, which disrupt activation quantization.

With the pre-trained DINOv2\nfeature encoder, MAUP achieves precise segmentation results across three\nmedical datasets without any additional training compared with several\nconventional CD-FSMIS models and training-free FSMIS model.

To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a novel distribution-aware knowledge unification and\nassociation (DKUA) framework where domain-style modeling is performed for each\ninstance to propagate domain-specific representations, enhancing\nanti-forgetting and generalization capacity. Specifically, we design a\ndistribution-aware model to transfer instance-level representations of the\ncurrent domain into the domain-specific representations with the different\ndomain styles, preserving learned knowledge without storing old samples. Next,\nwe propose adaptive knowledge consolidation (AKC) to dynamically generate the\nunified representation as a cross-domain representation center. To further\nmitigate forgetting, we develop a unified knowledge association (UKA)\nmechanism, which explores the unified representation as a bridge to explicitly\nmodel inter-domain associations, reducing inter-domain gaps. Finally,\ndistribution-based knowledge transfer (DKT) is proposed to prevent the current\ndomain distribution from deviating from the cross-domain distribution center,\nimproving adaptation capacity.
