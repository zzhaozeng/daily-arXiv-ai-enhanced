Diffusion models have emerged as a leading approach for such\ngenerative tasks, offering superior image quality and diversity.

Notably, VideoPASTA\nachieves these improvements without human annotation or captioning, relying on\njust 32-frame sampling, compared to the 96-frame, multi-GPU setups of prior\nwork. This efficiency makes our approach a scalable, plug-and-play solution\nthat seamlessly integrates with existing models while preserving their\ncapabilities."}

Additionally, diffusion models typically rely on global\nlearned distributions rather than localized features, leading to\ninconsistencies between the generated and existing image parts. In this work,\nwe propose ConFill, a novel framework that introduces a Context-Adaptive\nDiscrepancy (CAD) model to ensure that intermediate distributions of known and\nunknown regions are closely aligned throughout the diffusion process.

Using this dataset, we analyze BERT embeddings with various methods,\nincluding the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, mutual information, and recursive\nfeature elimination, to identify the most influential dimensions for each LP.\nWe introduce a new metric, the Embedding Dimension Impact (EDI) score, which\nquantifies the relevance of each embedding dimension to a LP. Our findings show\nthat certain properties, such as negation and polarity, are robustly encoded in\nspecific dimensions, while others, like synonymy, exhibit more complex\npatterns. This study provides insights into the interpretability of embeddings,\nwhich can guide the development of more transparent and optimized language\nmodels, with implications for model bias mitigation and the responsible\ndeployment of AI systems."}

It comprises\nkey modules such as the steering vector generator and the steering vector\napplier, which enable automatic generation and application of steering vectors\nto influence the model's behavior without modifying its parameters. One of the\nmain advantages of EasyEdit2 is its ease of use-users do not need extensive\ntechnical knowledge. With just a single example, they can effectively guide and\nadjust the model's responses, making precise control both accessible and\nefficient. Empirically, we report model steering performance across different\nLLMs, demonstrating the effectiveness of these techniques. We have released the\nsource code on GitHub at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit along with a\ndemonstration notebook. In addition, we provide a demo video at\nhttps://zjunlp.github.io/project/EasyEdit2/video for a quick introduction."}

In this work, we address this by\nintroducing MP-Mat, a novel 3D-and-instance-aware matting framework with\nmultiplane representation, where the multiplane concept is designed from two\ndifferent perspectives: scene geometry level and instance level. Specifically,\nwe first build feature-level multiplane representations to split the scene into\nmultiple planes based on depth differences. This approach makes the scene\nrepresentation 3D-aware, and can serve as an effective clue for splitting\ninstances in different 3D positions, thereby improving interpretability and\nboundary handling ability especially in occlusion areas. Then, we introduce\nanother multiplane representation that splits the scene in an instance-level\nperspective, and represents each instance with both matte and color. We also\ntreat background as a special instance, which is often overlooked by existing\nmethods. Such an instance-level representation facilitates both foreground and\nbackground content awareness, and is useful for other down-stream tasks like\nimage editing. Once built, the representation can be reused to realize\ncontrollable instance-level image editing with high efficiency. Extensive\nexperiments validate the clear advantage of MP-Mat in matting task.

To solve the above problems, this paper proposes the\nEmotion stimuli Segmentation and Explanation Model (EmoSEM) to endow the\nsegmentation model SAM with emotion comprehension capability. First, to enable\nthe model to perform segmentation under the guidance of emotional intent well,\nwe introduce an emotional prompt with a learnable mask token as the conditional\ninput for segmentation decoding. Then, we design an emotion projector to\nestablish the association between emotion and visual features. Next, more\nimportantly, to address emotion-visual stimuli alignment, we develop a\nlightweight prefix projector, a module that fuses the learned emotional mask\nwith the corresponding emotion into a unified representation compatible with\nthe language model.Finally, we input the joint visual, mask, and emotional\ntokens into the language model and output the emotional explanations.

They offer advantages over traditional optimization-based planning\nalgorithms. These advantages include fewer manually selected parameters and\nfaster development. Within ML-based planning, imitation learning (IL) is a\ncommon algorithm. It primarily learns driving policies directly from supervised\ntrajectory data. While IL has demonstrated strong performance on many open-loop\nbenchmarks, it remains challenging to determine if the learned policy truly\nunderstands fundamental driving principles, rather than simply extrapolating\nfrom the ego-vehicle's initial state.

A recent line of work proposes\nan abstract view, called language generation in the limit, where generation is\nseen as a game between an adversary and an algorithm: the adversary generates\nstrings from an unknown language $K$, chosen from a countable collection of\ncandidate languages, and after seeing a finite set of these strings, the\nalgorithm must generate new strings from $K$ that it has not seen before. This\nformalism highlights a key tension: the trade-off between validity (the\nalgorithm should only produce strings from the language) and breadth (it should\nbe able to produce many strings from the language). This trade-off is central\nin applied language generation as well, where it appears as a balance between\nhallucination (generating invalid utterances) and mode collapse (generating\nonly a restricted set of outputs). Despite its importance, this trade-off has\nbeen challenging to study quantitatively. We develop ways to quantify this\ntrade-off by formalizing breadth using measures of density. Existing algorithms\nfor language generation in the limit produce output sets that can have zero\ndensity in the true language, and this important failure of breadth might seem\nunavoidable.

Existing methods often\nstruggle to maintain accurate alignment, leading to noticeable discrepancies.\nTo address this issue, we propose \\name{}, a new framework that enhances\ncontrollable 3D generation by explicitly encouraging cyclic consistency between\nthe second-order 3D content, generated based on extracted signals from the\nfirst-order generation, and its original input controls. Specifically, we\nemploy an efficient feed-forward backbone that can generate a 3D object from an\ninput condition and a text prompt. Given an initial viewpoint and a control\nsignal, a novel view is rendered from the generated 3D content, from which the\nextracted condition is used to regenerate the 3D content. This re-generated\noutput is then rendered back to the initial viewpoint, followed by another\nround of control signal extraction, forming a cyclic process with two\nconsistency constraints. \\emph{View consistency} ensures coherence between the\ntwo generated 3D objects, measured by semantic similarity to accommodate\ngenerative diversity. \\emph{Condition consistency} aligns the final extracted\nsignal with the original input control, preserving structural or geometric\ndetails throughout the process.

To our knowledge, PAIA is the first\nscalable and practical solution for pre-deployment concept auditing of\ndiffusion models, providing a practical foundation for safer and more\ntransparent diffusion model sharing."}

Through stochastic differential\nequation analysis of optimization dynamics in an analytically tractable setup,\nwe demonstrate that the choice of optimization algorithm indeed influences\nfairness outcomes, particularly under severe imbalance. Furthermore, we show\nthat when comparing two categories of optimizers, adaptive methods and\nstochastic methods, RMSProp (from the adaptive category) has a higher\nlikelihood of converging to fairer minima than SGD (from the stochastic\ncategory). Building on this insight, we derive two new theoretical guarantees\nshowing that, under appropriate conditions, RMSProp exhibits fairer parameter\nupdates and improved fairness in a single optimization step compared to SGD. We\nthen validate these findings through extensive experiments on three publicly\navailable datasets, namely CelebA, FairFace, and MS-COCO, across different\ntasks as facial expression recognition, gender classification, and multi-label\nclassification, using various backbones. Considering multiple fairness\ndefinitions including equalized odds, equal opportunity, and demographic\nparity, adaptive optimizers like RMSProp and Adam consistently outperform SGD\nin terms of group fairness, while maintaining comparable predictive accuracy.\nOur results highlight the role of adaptive updates as a crucial yet overlooked\nmechanism for promoting fair outcomes."}

To\naddress this limitation, we introduce a novel task, 360V2SA, to generate\nspatial audio from 360-degree videos, specifically producing First-order\nAmbisonics (FOA) audio - a standard format for representing 3D spatial audio\nthat captures sound directionality and enables realistic 3D audio reproduction.\nWe first create Sphere360, a novel dataset tailored for this task that is\ncurated from real-world data.

Quadrotors operating in real-world\nenvironments by learning-based methods encounter several challenges: a large\namount of simulator generated data required for training, strict demands for\nreal-time processing onboard, and the sim-to-real gap caused by dynamic and\nnoisy conditions. Current works have made a great breakthrough in applying\nlearning-based methods to end-to-end control of quadrotors, but rarely mention\nthe infrastructure system training from scratch and deploying to reality, which\nmakes it difficult to reproduce methods and applications. To bridge this gap,\nwe propose a platform that enables the seamless transfer of end-to-end deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) policies. We integrate the training environment,\nflight dynamics control, DRL algorithms, the MAVROS middleware stack, and\nhardware into a comprehensive workflow and architecture that enables\nquadrotors' policies to be trained from scratch to real-world deployment in\nseveral minutes. Our platform provides rich types of environments including\nhovering, dynamic obstacle avoidance, trajectory tracking, balloon hitting, and\nplanning in unknown environments, as a physical experiment benchmark. Through\nextensive empirical validation, we demonstrate the efficiency of proposed\nsim-to-real platform, and robust outdoor flight performance under real-world\nperturbations.

EasyEdit2 supports a wide range of test-time interventions,\nincluding safety, sentiment, personality, reasoning patterns, factuality, and\nlanguage features. Unlike its predecessor, EasyEdit2 features a new\narchitecture specifically designed for seamless model steering. It comprises\nkey modules such as the steering vector generator and the steering vector\napplier, which enable automatic generation and application of steering vectors\nto influence the model's behavior without modifying its parameters. One of the\nmain advantages of EasyEdit2 is its ease of use-users do not need extensive\ntechnical knowledge. With just a single example, they can effectively guide and\nadjust the model's responses, making precise control both accessible and\nefficient. Empirically, we report model steering performance across different\nLLMs, demonstrating the effectiveness of these techniques.

Bouman"], "title": "Revealing the 3D Cosmic Web through Gravitationally Constrained Neural Fields", "categories": ["astro-ph.CO", "cs.CV"], "comment": null, "summary": "Weak gravitational lensing is the slight distortion of galaxy shapes caused\nprimarily by the gravitational effects of dark matter in the universe. In our\nwork, we seek to invert the weak lensing signal from 2D telescope images to\nreconstruct a 3D map of the universe's dark matter field. While inversion\ntypically yields a 2D projection of the dark matter field, accurate 3D maps of\nthe dark matter distribution are essential for localizing structures of\ninterest and testing theories of our universe. However, 3D inversion poses\nsignificant challenges. First, unlike standard 3D reconstruction that relies on\nmultiple viewpoints, in this case, images are only observed from a single\nviewpoint. This challenge can be partially addressed by observing how galaxy\nemitters throughout the volume are lensed. However, this leads to the second\nchallenge: the shapes and exact locations of unlensed galaxies are unknown, and\ncan only be estimated with a very large degree of uncertainty. This introduces\nan overwhelming amount of noise which nearly drowns out the lensing signal\ncompletely. Previous approaches tackle this by imposing strong assumptions\nabout the structures in the volume. We instead propose a methodology using a\ngravitationally-constrained neural field to flexibly model the continuous\nmatter distribution. We take an analysis-by-synthesis approach, optimizing the\nweights of the neural network through a fully differentiable physical forward\nmodel to reproduce the lensing signal present in image measurements. We\nshowcase our method on simulations, including realistic simulated measurements\nof dark matter distributions that mimic data from upcoming telescope surveys.\nOur results show that our method can not only outperform previous methods, but\nimportantly is also able to recover potentially surprising dark matter\nstructures."}
