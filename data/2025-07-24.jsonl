In particular,\nthe advancement of video generation foundation models has led to growing demand\nfor controllable video generation methods that can more accurately reflect user\nintent. Most existing foundation models are designed for text-to-video\ngeneration, where text prompts alone are often insufficient to express complex,\nmulti-modal, and fine-grained user requirements. This limitation makes it\nchallenging for users to generate videos with precise control using current\nmodels. To address this issue, recent research has explored the integration of\nadditional non-textual conditions, such as camera motion, depth maps, and human\npose, to extend pretrained video generation models and enable more controllable\nvideo synthesis. These approaches aim to enhance the flexibility and practical\napplicability of AIGC-driven video generation systems. In this survey, we\nprovide a systematic review of controllable video generation, covering both\ntheoretical foundations and recent advances in the field. We begin by\nintroducing the key concepts and commonly used open-source video generation\nmodels. We then focus on control mechanisms in video diffusion models,\nanalyzing how different types of conditions can be incorporated into the\ndenoising process to guide generation.

Its objective\nis to minimize the sum of path costs (SOC), where the path cost of each agent\nis defined as the travel time from its start location to its target location.\nExplicit Estimation Conflict-Based Search (EECBS) is the leading algorithm for\nbounded-suboptimal MAPF, with the SOC of the solution being at most a\nuser-specified factor $w$ away from optimal. EECBS maintains sets of paths and\na lower bound $LB$ on the optimal SOC. Then, it iteratively selects a set of\npaths whose SOC is at most $w \\cdot LB$ and introduces constraints to resolve\ncollisions. For each path in a set, EECBS maintains a lower bound on its\noptimal path that satisfies constraints. By finding an individually\nbounded-suboptimal path with cost at most a threshold of $w$ times its lower\nbound, EECBS guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution. To speed up\nEECBS, previous work uses flex distribution to increase the threshold.

While global modality\nalignment methods often overlook the connection between aspect terms and their\ncorresponding local visual regions, bridging the representation gap between\ntext and images remains a challenge. To address these limitations, this paper\nintroduces an end to end Contrastive Learning framework with Adaptive\nMulti-loss and Progressive Attention Fusion(CLAMP). The framework is composed\nof three novel modules: Progressive Attention Fusion network, Multi-task\nContrastive Learning, and Adaptive Multi-loss Aggregation. The Progressive\nAttention Fusion network enhances fine-grained alignment between textual\nfeatures and image regions via hierarchical, multi-stage cross modal\ninteractions, effectively suppressing irrelevant visual noise.

CausalStep segments videos into causally linked units and enforces a\nstrict stepwise question-answer (QA) protocol, requiring sequential answers and\npreventing shortcut solutions. Each question includes carefully constructed\ndistractors based on error type taxonomy to ensure diagnostic value. The\nbenchmark features 100 videos across six categories and 1,852 multiple-choice\nQA pairs. We introduce seven diagnostic metrics for comprehensive evaluation,\nenabling precise diagnosis of causal reasoning capabilities. Experiments with\nleading proprietary and open-source models, as well as human baselines, reveal\na significant gap between current models and human-level stepwise reasoning.\nCausalStep provides a rigorous benchmark to drive progress in robust and\ninterpretable video reasoning."}

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), serving as an\ninference-time scaling method, is notable for its low cost and minimal effort\nfor parameter tuning. However, due to heterogeneous training data and model\narchitecture, the variant embedding models used in RAG exhibit different\nbenefits across various areas, often leading to different similarity\ncalculation results and, consequently, varying response quality from LLMs. To\naddress this problem, we propose and examine two approaches to enhance RAG by\ncombining the benefits of multiple embedding models, named Mixture-Embedding\nRAG and Confident RAG. Mixture-Embedding RAG simply sorts and selects\nretrievals from multiple embedding models based on standardized similarity;\nhowever, it does not outperform vanilla RAG. In contrast, Confident RAG\ngenerates responses multiple times using different embedding models and then\nselects the responses with the highest confidence level, demonstrating average\nimprovements of approximately 10% and 5% over vanilla LLMs and RAG,\nrespectively. The consistent results across different LLMs and embedding models\nindicate that Confident RAG is an efficient plug-and-play approach for various\ndomains.

Using benchmark datasets\nin ten languages, we demonstrate that LLMs achieve performance on par with\nnative-speaking human coders and outperform conventional supervised machine\nlearning approaches. Second, we leverage this novel method to conduct the\nlargest cross-national study of negative campaigning to date, analyzing 18\nmillion tweets posted by parliamentarians in 19 European countries between 2017\nand 2022. The results reveal consistent cross-national patterns: governing\nparties are less likely to use negative messaging, while ideologically extreme\nand populist parties -- particularly those on the radical right -- engage in\nsignificantly higher levels of negativity.

To address\nthis gap, we introduce Efficiency Leverage (EL), a metric quantifying the\ncomputational advantage of an MoE model over a dense equivalent. We conduct a\nlarge-scale empirical study, training over 300 models up to 28B parameters, to\nsystematically investigate the relationship between MoE architectural\nconfigurations and EL.

Furthermore, our\napproach surpasses conventional methods by offering enhanced error detection\nand visuali-zation capabilities, providing real-time, actionable guidance to\noperators. This not only improves the accuracy and efficiency of assembly\nmonitoring but also re-duces dependency on expensive hardware solutions, making\nit a more practical choice for modern industrial applications."}

We treat this problem as a pluralistic distributional\nalignment task, comparing the distributions of LLM and human judgments across\ndilemmas. We find that models reproduce human judgments only under high\nconsensus; alignment deteriorates sharply when human disagreement increases. In\nparallel, using a 60-value taxonomy built from 3,783 value expressions\nextracted from rationales, we show that LLMs rely on a narrower set of moral\nvalues than humans. These findings reveal a pluralistic moral gap: a mismatch\nin both the distribution and diversity of values expressed.

This limitation prevents\nthe models from obtaining the abundant information provided by other relevant\ntasks, which can hinder their performance in downstream tasks, particularly in\ncomplex and diverse domains. In order to tackle this issue, we propose MMPT, a\nMulti-modal Multi-task Pre-training framework designed to enhance point cloud\nunderstanding. Specifically, three pre-training tasks are devised: (i)\nToken-level reconstruction (TLR) aims to recover masked point tokens, endowing\nthe model with representative learning abilities. (ii) Point-level\nreconstruction (PLR) is integrated to predict the masked point positions\ndirectly, and the reconstructed point cloud can be considered as a transformed\npoint cloud used in the subsequent task. (iii) Multi-modal contrastive learning\n(MCL) combines feature correspondences within and across modalities, thus\nassembling a rich learning signal from both 3D point cloud and 2D image\nmodalities in a self-supervised manner. Moreover, this framework operates\nwithout requiring any 3D annotations, making it scalable for use with large\ndatasets. The trained encoder can be effectively transferred to various\ndownstream tasks.

We\nintroduce RemixFusion, a novel residual-based mixed representation for scene\nreconstruction and camera pose estimation dedicated to high-quality and\nlarge-scale online RGB-D reconstruction. In particular, we propose a\nresidual-based map representation comprised of an explicit coarse TSDF grid and\nan implicit neural module that produces residuals representing fine-grained\ndetails to be added to the coarse grid. Such mixed representation allows for\ndetail-rich reconstruction with bounded time and memory budget, contrasting\nwith the overly-smoothed results by the purely implicit representations, thus\npaving the way for high-quality camera tracking. Furthermore, we extend the\nresidual-based representation to handle multi-frame joint pose optimization via\nbundle adjustment (BA). In contrast to the existing methods, which optimize\nposes directly, we opt to optimize pose changes.

In our work, we are systematically assessing the\nperformance of 3 state-of-the-art VLMs on a diverse subset of traffic\nsituations sampled from the Waymo Open Dataset to support safety guardrails for\ncapturing such hallucinations in VLM-supported perception systems. We observe\nthat both, proprietary and open VLMs exhibit remarkable image understanding\ncapabilities even paying thorough attention to fine details sometimes difficult\nto spot for us humans. However, they are also still prone to making up elements\nin their descriptions to date requiring hallucination detection strategies such\nas BetterCheck that we propose in our work."}

This framework\nincludes a controlled dataset of face images, a principled filter selection\nprocess that selects a representative range of filters for experimentation, and\na set of experiments to evaluate the filters' impact on recognition. We\ndemonstrate our framework with a case study of filters from the American\napplications Instagram and Snapchat and the Chinese applications Meitu and Pitu\nto uncover cross-cultural differences.

To achieve this high-fidelity\nand interactive video world generation, we introduce a well-designed framework,\nwhich consists of four main components, including camera motion quantization,\nvideo generation architecture, advanced sampler, and model acceleration.

Our method leverages the\ncompact VecSet representation to efficiently generate a coarse object layout in\nthe first stage, reducing token count and accelerating voxel coordinate\nprediction. To refine per-voxel latent features in the second stage, we\nintroduce Part Attention, a geometry-aware localized attention mechanism that\nrestricts attention computation within semantically consistent part regions.\nThis design preserves structural continuity while avoiding unnecessary global\nattention, achieving up to 6.7x speed-up in latent generation. To support this\nmechanism, we construct a scalable part annotation pipeline that converts raw\nmeshes into part-labeled sparse voxels.

In particular,\nthe advancement of video generation foundation models has led to growing demand\nfor controllable video generation methods that can more accurately reflect user\nintent. Most existing foundation models are designed for text-to-video\ngeneration, where text prompts alone are often insufficient to express complex,\nmulti-modal, and fine-grained user requirements. This limitation makes it\nchallenging for users to generate videos with precise control using current\nmodels. To address this issue, recent research has explored the integration of\nadditional non-textual conditions, such as camera motion, depth maps, and human\npose, to extend pretrained video generation models and enable more controllable\nvideo synthesis. These approaches aim to enhance the flexibility and practical\napplicability of AIGC-driven video generation systems. In this survey, we\nprovide a systematic review of controllable video generation, covering both\ntheoretical foundations and recent advances in the field. We begin by\nintroducing the key concepts and commonly used open-source video generation\nmodels. We then focus on control mechanisms in video diffusion models,\nanalyzing how different types of conditions can be incorporated into the\ndenoising process to guide generation. Finally, we categorize existing methods\nbased on the types of control signals they leverage, including single-condition\ngeneration, multi-condition generation, and universal controllable generation.\nFor a complete list of the literature on controllable video generation\nreviewed, please visit our curated repository at\nhttps://github.com/mayuelala/Awesome-Controllable-Video-Generation."}

The\nStreamME synchronously records and reconstructs a head avatar from live video\nstreams without any pre-cached data, enabling seamless integration of the\nreconstructed appearance into downstream applications. This exceptionally fast\ntraining strategy, which we refer to as on-the-fly training, is central to our\napproach.

To further\nensure high efficiency in on-the-fly training, we introduced a simplification\nstrategy based on primary points, which distributes the point clouds more\nsparsely across the facial surface, optimizing points number while maintaining\nrendering quality.

However, they face critical challenges in\nspecialized domains such as ophthalmology, particularly the fragmentation of\nannotation granularity and inconsistencies in clinical reasoning logic, which\nhinder precise cross-modal understanding. This paper introduces FundusExpert,\nan ophthalmology-specific MLLM with integrated positioning-diagnosis reasoning\ncapabilities, along with FundusGen, a dataset constructed through the\nintelligent Fundus-Engine system. Fundus-Engine automates localization and\nleverages MLLM-based semantic expansion to integrate global disease\nclassification, local object detection, and fine-grained feature analysis\nwithin a single fundus image. Additionally, by constructing a clinically\naligned cognitive chain, it guides the model to generate interpretable\nreasoning paths. FundusExpert, fine-tuned with instruction data from FundusGen,\nachieves the best performance in ophthalmic question-answering tasks,\nsurpassing the average accuracy of the 40B MedRegA by 26.6%. It also excels in\nzero-shot report generation tasks, achieving a clinical consistency of 77.0%,\nsignificantly outperforming GPT-4o's 47.6%. Furthermore, we reveal a scaling\nlaw between data quality and model capability ($L \\propto N^{0.068}$),\ndemonstrating that the cognitive alignment annotations in FundusGen enhance\ndata utilization efficiency. By integrating region-level localization with\ndiagnostic reasoning chains, our work develops a scalable, clinically-aligned\nMLLM and explores a pathway toward bridging the visual-language gap in specific\nMLLMs. Our project can be found at https://github.com/MeteorElf/FundusExpert."}
