### [1] [An Memory-Efficient Framework for Deformable Transformer with Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11549)
*Wendong Mao,Mingfan Zhao,Jianfeng Guan,Qiwei Dong,Zhongfeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种硬件友好的优化框架，用于解决可变形注意力变换器（DAT）在硬件部署中的内存访问问题，通过神经架构搜索和FPGA验证系统，实现了低精度损失和高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DAT在计算机视觉任务中表现出色，但其数据依赖的采样机制导致不规则内存访问模式，难以高效部署硬件。现有方法要么硬件开销高，要么牺牲模型精度。

Method: 1）提出基于神经架构搜索（NAS）的方法，通过新的切片策略自动划分输入特征为均匀块，避免内存冲突；2）设计FPGA验证系统测试边缘硬件性能。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K数据集上，精度仅下降0.2%；在Xilinx FPGA上，DRAM访问次数减少至现有方法的18%。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在保持高精度的同时显著提升了硬件效率，适用于边缘计算场景。

Abstract: Deformable Attention Transformers (DAT) have shown remarkable performance in
computer vision tasks by adaptively focusing on informative image regions.
However, their data-dependent sampling mechanism introduces irregular memory
access patterns, posing significant challenges for efficient hardware
deployment. Existing acceleration methods either incur high hardware overhead
or compromise model accuracy. To address these issues, this paper proposes a
hardware-friendly optimization framework for DAT. First, a neural architecture
search (NAS)-based method with a new slicing strategy is proposed to
automatically divide the input feature into uniform patches during the
inference process, avoiding memory conflicts without modifying model
architecture. The method explores the optimal slice configuration by jointly
optimizing hardware cost and inference accuracy. Secondly, an FPGA-based
verification system is designed to test the performance of this framework on
edge-side hardware. Algorithm experiments on the ImageNet-1K dataset
demonstrate that our hardware-friendly framework can maintain have only 0.2%
accuracy drop compared to the baseline DAT. Hardware experiments on Xilinx FPGA
show the proposed method reduces DRAM access times to 18% compared with
existing DAT acceleration methods.

### [2] [Deformable Dynamic Convolution for Accurate yet Efficient Spatio-Temporal Traffic Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11550)
*Hyeonseok Jin,Geonmin Kim,Kyungbaek Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DDCN的新型网络，用于高效且准确的时空交通预测，克服了传统方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在捕捉时空异质性和扩展性方面存在不足，尤其是GNN需要预定义邻接矩阵且难以处理大规模数据。

Method: DDCN采用动态可变形卷积，通过分解为编码器-解码器结构，并结合空间和时空注意力块来增强特征提取。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，DDCN性能优越，验证了CNN方法在时空交通预测中的潜力。

Conclusion: DDCN是一种高效且准确的时空交通预测方法，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal traffic prediction plays a key role in intelligent
transportation systems by enabling accurate prediction in complex urban areas.
Although not only accuracy but also efficiency for scalability is important,
some previous methods struggle to capture heterogeneity such as varying traffic
patterns across regions and time periods. Moreover, Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs), which are the mainstream of traffic prediction, not only require
predefined adjacency matrix, but also limit scalability to large-scale data
containing many nodes due to their inherent complexity. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Deformable Dynamic Convolution Network (DDCN) for
accurate yet efficient traffic prediction. Traditional Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) are limited in modeling non-Euclidean spatial structures and
spatio-temporal heterogeneity, DDCN overcomes these challenges by dynamically
applying deformable filters based on offset. Specifically, DDCN decomposes
transformer-style CNN to encoder-decoder structure, and applies proposed
approaches to the spatial and spatio-temporal attention blocks of the encoder
to emphasize important features. The decoder, composed of feed-forward module,
complements the output of the encoder. This novel structure make DDCN can
perform accurate yet efficient traffic prediction. In comprehensive experiments
on four real-world datasets, DDCN achieves competitive performance, emphasizing
the potential and effectiveness of CNN-based approaches for spatio-temporal
traffic prediction.

### [3] [Inversion-DPO: Precise and Efficient Post-Training for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11554)
*Zejian Li,Yize Li,Chenye Meng,Zhongni Liu,Yang Ling,Shengyuan Zhang,Guang Yang,Changyuan Yang,Zhiyuan Yang,Lingyun Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Inversion-DPO是一种新的对齐框架，通过DDIM反演优化扩散模型，避免奖励建模，提高训练效率和精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐方法计算成本高且可能影响模型精度，Inversion-DPO旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 利用DDIM反演重新定义DPO，直接在噪声空间中采样，无需辅助奖励模型。

Result: 在文本到图像生成和组合图像生成任务中表现优异，生成高保真且结构一致的图像。

Conclusion: Inversion-DPO为扩散模型提供了一种高效、高精度的对齐方法，适用于复杂生成任务。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models (DMs) have been propelled by
alignment methods that post-train models to better conform to human
preferences. However, these approaches typically require computation-intensive
training of a base model and a reward model, which not only incurs substantial
computational overhead but may also compromise model accuracy and training
efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose Inversion-DPO, a novel
alignment framework that circumvents reward modeling by reformulating Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) with DDIM inversion for DMs. Our method conducts
intractable posterior sampling in Diffusion-DPO with the deterministic
inversion from winning and losing samples to noise and thus derive a new
post-training paradigm. This paradigm eliminates the need for auxiliary reward
models or inaccurate appromixation, significantly enhancing both precision and
efficiency of training. We apply Inversion-DPO to a basic task of text-to-image
generation and a challenging task of compositional image generation. Extensive
experiments show substantial performance improvements achieved by Inversion-DPO
compared to existing post-training methods and highlight the ability of the
trained generative models to generate high-fidelity compositionally coherent
images. For the post-training of compostitional image geneation, we curate a
paired dataset consisting of 11,140 images with complex structural annotations
and comprehensive scores, designed to enhance the compositional capabilities of
generative models. Inversion-DPO explores a new avenue for efficient,
high-precision alignment in diffusion models, advancing their applicability to
complex realistic generation tasks. Our code is available at

### [4] [Reprogramming Vision Foundation Models for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11558)
*Changlu Chen,Yanbin Liu,Chaoxi Niu,Ling Chen,Tianqing Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ST-VFM是一个新颖的框架，通过重新编程视觉基础模型（VFMs）来解决时空预测任务中的挑战，包括缺乏时间建模能力和视觉与时空数据的模态差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基础模型（如LLMs）在时空预测中表现有限，主要因为其无法捕捉丰富的时空相关性。VFMs虽具有强大的空间先验，但缺乏时间建模能力。

Method: ST-VFM采用双分支架构，结合原始时空输入和辅助时空流输入，并通过预VFM和后VFM两个重新编程阶段处理这些输入。

Result: 在十个时空数据集上的实验表明，ST-VFM优于现有基线，展示了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ST-VFM是一个强大的通用框架，适用于时空预测任务，且适用于多种VFM主干。

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved remarkable success in natural language
processing and computer vision, demonstrating strong capabilities in modeling
complex patterns. While recent efforts have explored adapting large language
models (LLMs) for time-series forecasting, LLMs primarily capture
one-dimensional sequential dependencies and struggle to model the richer
spatio-temporal (ST) correlations essential for accurate ST forecasting. In
this paper, we present \textbf{ST-VFM}, a novel framework that systematically
reprograms Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for general-purpose spatio-temporal
forecasting. While VFMs offer powerful spatial priors, two key challenges arise
when applying them to ST tasks: (1) the lack of inherent temporal modeling
capacity and (2) the modality gap between visual and ST data. To address these,
ST-VFM adopts a \emph{dual-branch architecture} that integrates raw ST inputs
with auxiliary ST flow inputs, where the flow encodes lightweight temporal
difference signals interpretable as dynamic spatial cues. To effectively
process these dual-branch inputs, ST-VFM introduces two dedicated reprogramming
stages. The \emph{pre-VFM reprogramming} stage applies a Temporal-Aware Token
Adapter to embed temporal context and align both branches into VFM-compatible
feature spaces. The \emph{post-VFM reprogramming} stage introduces a Bilateral
Cross-Prompt Coordination module, enabling dynamic interaction between branches
through prompt-based conditioning, thus enriching joint representation learning
without modifying the frozen VFM backbone. Extensive experiments on ten
spatio-temporal datasets show that ST-VFM outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness across VFM backbones
(e.g., DINO, CLIP, DEIT) and ablation studies, establishing it as a strong
general framework for spatio-temporal forecasting.

### [5] [Expert Operational GANS: Towards Real-Color Underwater Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11562)
*Ozer Can Devecioglu,Serkan Kiranyaz,Mehmet Yamac,Moncef Gabbouj*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: xOp-GAN是一种新型GAN模型，通过多个专家生成器网络解决水下图像恢复问题，每个生成器专注于特定质量范围的图像恢复，判别器根据感知置信度选择最佳结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GAN方法因单一生成器难以捕捉水下图像的多样化退化问题，限制了恢复效果。

Method: 提出xOp-GAN，包含多个专家生成器，每个生成器针对特定质量范围的图像进行训练，判别器在推理阶段选择最佳恢复结果。

Result: 在LSUI数据集上，xOp-GAN的PSNR达到25.16 dB，显著优于单回归器模型。

Conclusion: xOp-GAN通过多生成器架构和判别器的动态选择机制，有效提升了水下图像恢复的性能。

Abstract: The wide range of deformation artifacts that arise from complex light
propagation, scattering, and depth-dependent attenuation makes the underwater
image restoration to remain a challenging problem. Like other single deep
regressor networks, conventional GAN-based restoration methods struggle to
perform well across this heterogeneous domain, since a single generator network
is typically insufficient to capture the full range of visual degradations. In
order to overcome this limitation, we propose xOp-GAN, a novel GAN model with
several expert generator networks, each trained solely on a particular subset
with a certain image quality. Thus, each generator can learn to maximize its
restoration performance for a particular quality range. Once a xOp-GAN is
trained, each generator can restore the input image and the best restored image
can then be selected by the discriminator based on its perceptual confidence
score. As a result, xOP-GAN is the first GAN model with multiple generators
where the discriminator is being used during the inference of the regression
task. Experimental results on benchmark Large Scale Underwater Image (LSUI)
dataset demonstrates that xOp-GAN achieves PSNR levels up to 25.16 dB,
surpassing all single-regressor models by a large margin even, with reduced
complexity.

### [6] [Data-Driven Meta-Analysis and Public-Dataset Evaluation for Sensor-Based Gait Age Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11571)
*Varun Velankar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文通过元分析和实验，评估了步态识别年龄的准确性，发现多传感器融合误差最低（3.4年），并分析了步态指标与年龄的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 步态识别年龄在医疗、安全和人机交互中有重要应用，需建立性能基准和实用指南。

Method: 结合元分析、大规模实验和可解释可视化，评估不同传感器和模型的性能。

Result: 多传感器融合误差最低（3.4年），深度网络准确率达96%，处理速度快。

Conclusion: 通过综合方法，为实际场景中步态年龄误差降至3年以下提供了基准和指南。

Abstract: Estimating a person's age from their gait has important applications in
healthcare, security and human-computer interaction. In this work, we review
fifty-nine studies involving over seventy-five thousand subjects recorded with
video, wearable and radar sensors. We observe that convolutional neural
networks produce an average error of about 4.2 years, inertial-sensor models
about 4.5 years and multi-sensor fusion as low as 3.4 years, with notable
differences between lab and real-world data. We then analyse sixty-three
thousand eight hundred forty-six gait cycles from the OU-ISIR Large-Population
dataset to quantify correlations between age and five key metrics: stride
length, walking speed, step cadence, step-time variability and joint-angle
entropy, with correlation coefficients of at least 0.27. Next, we fine-tune a
ResNet34 model and apply Grad-CAM to reveal that the network attends to the
knee and pelvic regions, consistent with known age-related gait changes.
Finally, on a one hundred thousand sample subset of the VersatileGait database,
we compare support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, multilayer
perceptrons and convolutional neural networks, finding that deep networks
achieve up to 96 percent accuracy while processing each sample in under 0.1
seconds. By combining a broad meta-analysis with new large-scale experiments
and interpretable visualizations, we establish solid performance baselines and
practical guidelines for reducing gait-age error below three years in
real-world scenarios.

### [7] [What cat is that? A re-id model for feral cats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11575)
*Victor Caquilpan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过改进PPGNet模型（PPGNet-Cat）来识别野猫个体，以减轻其对澳大利亚野生动物的危害。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 野猫对澳大利亚野生动物造成严重威胁，需通过图像识别技术加强监控。

Method: 改进PPGNet模型（PPGNet-Cat），结合对比学习方法（如ArcFace损失）进行实验。

Result: PPGNet-Cat表现优异，mAP达0.86，rank-1准确率达0.95。

Conclusion: PPGNet-Cat是一种高效的野猫再识别模型。

Abstract: Feral cats exert a substantial and detrimental impact on Australian wildlife,
placing them among the most dangerous invasive species worldwide. Therefore,
closely monitoring these cats is essential labour in minimising their effects.
In this context, the potential application of Re-Identification (re-ID) emerges
to enhance monitoring activities for these animals, utilising images captured
by camera traps. This project explores different CV approaches to create a
re-ID model able to identify individual feral cats in the wild. The main
approach consists of modifying a part-pose guided network (PPGNet) model,
initially used in the re-ID of Amur tigers, to be applicable for feral cats.
This adaptation, resulting in PPGNet-Cat, which incorporates specific
modifications to suit the characteristics of feral cats images. Additionally,
various experiments were conducted, particularly exploring contrastive learning
approaches such as ArcFace loss. The main results indicate that PPGNet-Cat
excels in identifying feral cats, achieving high performance with a mean
Average Precision (mAP) of 0.86 and a rank-1 accuracy of 0.95. These outcomes
establish PPGNet-Cat as a competitive model within the realm of re-ID.

*Sathvik Chereddy,John Femiani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SketchDNN提出了一种生成CAD草图的模型，通过统一的连续-离散扩散过程同时建模连续参数和离散类别标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CAD草图中原始参数化的异质性和原始元素的排列不变性问题。

Method: 采用高斯-Softmax扩散，通过高斯噪声扰动logits并通过softmax变换投影到概率单纯形上。

Result: 显著提高了生成质量，FID从16.04降至7.80，NLL从84.8降至81.33。

Conclusion: 在SketchGraphs数据集上实现了CAD草图生成的最新最优性能。

Abstract: We present SketchDNN, a generative model for synthesizing CAD sketches that
jointly models both continuous parameters and discrete class labels through a
unified continuous-discrete diffusion process. Our core innovation is
Gaussian-Softmax diffusion, where logits perturbed with Gaussian noise are
projected onto the probability simplex via a softmax transformation,
facilitating blended class labels for discrete variables. This formulation
addresses 2 key challenges, namely, the heterogeneity of primitive
parameterizations and the permutation invariance of primitives in CAD sketches.
Our approach significantly improves generation quality, reducing Fr\'echet
Inception Distance (FID) from 16.04 to 7.80 and negative log-likelihood (NLL)
from 84.8 to 81.33, establishing a new state-of-the-art in CAD sketch
generation on the SketchGraphs dataset.

### [9] [Interpretable Prediction of Lymph Node Metastasis in Rectal Cancer MRI Using Variational Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11638)
*Benjamin Keel,Aaron Quyn,David Jayne,Maryam Mohsin,Samuel D. Relton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用变分自编码器（VAE）替代传统卷积神经网络（CNN）进行直肠癌淋巴结转移（LNM）分期，VAE-MLP模型在MRI数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于淋巴结大小、形状和纹理的放射学标准诊断准确性有限，VAE因其生成模型特性可直接编码视觉特征，潜在空间更可解释。

Method: 采用VAE作为特征编码器，结合MLP，在168例未接受新辅助治疗的患者的MRI数据集上进行训练和验证。

Result: VAE-MLP模型在交叉验证中表现最佳，AUC为0.86，敏感性0.79，特异性0.85。

Conclusion: VAE-MLP模型在直肠癌LNM分期中优于现有方法，具有更高的诊断准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Effective treatment for rectal cancer relies on accurate lymph node
metastasis (LNM) staging. However, radiological criteria based on lymph node
(LN) size, shape and texture morphology have limited diagnostic accuracy. In
this work, we investigate applying a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) as a feature
encoder model to replace the large pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) used in existing approaches. The motivation for using a VAE is that the
generative model aims to reconstruct the images, so it directly encodes visual
features and meaningful patterns across the data. This leads to a disentangled
and structured latent space which can be more interpretable than a CNN. Models
are deployed on an in-house MRI dataset with 168 patients who did not undergo
neo-adjuvant treatment. The post-operative pathological N stage was used as the
ground truth to evaluate model predictions. Our proposed model 'VAE-MLP'
achieved state-of-the-art performance on the MRI dataset, with cross-validated
metrics of AUC 0.86 +/- 0.05, Sensitivity 0.79 +/- 0.06, and Specificity 0.85
+/- 0.05. Code is available at:

*Abhishek Jaiswal,Nisheeth Srivastava*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于姿势的心理状态推断方法，适用于体育领域，通过板球比赛验证其有效性，并利用弱监督解决数据标注问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过姿势推断心理状态在诊断疲劳、预防伤害和提升表现方面具有潜力，但面临数据敏感性问题，体育场景为数据积累提供了可行方案。

Method: 在板球比赛中，通过运动分析从活动视频中识别人类意图，利用现有数据统计作为弱监督验证结果。

Result: 方法在区分攻击性和防守性击球意图上达到75% F1分数和80% AUC-ROC。

Conclusion: 姿势为意图推断提供了强信号，弱监督方法可解决数据标注限制，研究为体育分析和行为分析提供了通用技术。

Abstract: Posture-based mental state inference has significant potential in diagnosing
fatigue, preventing injury, and enhancing performance across various domains.
Such tools must be research-validated with large datasets before being
translated into practice. Unfortunately, such vision diagnosis faces serious
challenges due to the sensitivity of human subject data. To address this, we
identify sports settings as a viable alternative for accumulating data from
human subjects experiencing diverse emotional states. We test our hypothesis in
the game of cricket and present a posture-based solution to identify human
intent from activity videos. Our method achieves over 75\% F1 score and over
80\% AUC-ROC in discriminating aggressive and defensive shot intent through
motion analysis. These findings indicate that posture leaks out strong signals
for intent inference, even with inherent noise in the data pipeline.
Furthermore, we utilize existing data statistics as weak supervision to
validate our findings, offering a potential solution for overcoming data
labelling limitations. This research contributes to generalizable techniques
for sports analytics and also opens possibilities for applying human behavior
analysis across various fields.

### [11] [VISTA: Monocular Segmentation-Based Mapping for Appearance and View-Invariant Global Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11653)
*Hannah Shafferman,Annika Thomas,Jouko Kinnari,Michael Ricard,Jose Nino,Jonathan How*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISTA是一种新颖的全局定位框架，通过对象分割和跟踪结合几何一致性，解决了视角变化和季节变化等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无结构环境中因视角变化、季节变化等因素导致的定位难题。

Method: 结合对象分割、跟踪和子图对应搜索，利用几何一致性对齐参考帧。

Result: 在季节和倾斜角度数据集上，召回率提升69%，地图大小仅为基准的0.6%。

Conclusion: VISTA无需领域特定训练，适用于资源受限平台，实现了高效全局定位。

Abstract: Global localization is critical for autonomous navigation, particularly in
scenarios where an agent must localize within a map generated in a different
session or by another agent, as agents often have no prior knowledge about the
correlation between reference frames. However, this task remains challenging in
unstructured environments due to appearance changes induced by viewpoint
variation, seasonal changes, spatial aliasing, and occlusions -- known failure
modes for traditional place recognition methods. To address these challenges,
we propose VISTA (View-Invariant Segmentation-Based Tracking for Frame
Alignment), a novel open-set, monocular global localization framework that
combines: 1) a front-end, object-based, segmentation and tracking pipeline,
followed by 2) a submap correspondence search, which exploits geometric
consistencies between environment maps to align vehicle reference frames. VISTA
enables consistent localization across diverse camera viewpoints and seasonal
changes, without requiring any domain-specific training or finetuning. We
evaluate VISTA on seasonal and oblique-angle aerial datasets, achieving up to a
69% improvement in recall over baseline methods. Furthermore, we maintain a
compact object-based map that is only 0.6% the size of the most
memory-conservative baseline, making our approach capable of real-time
implementation on resource-constrained platforms.

*Maciej Szankin,Vidhyananth Venkatasamy,Lihang Ying*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文比较了多模态视觉语言模型（VLMs）与传统CNN-based OCR在户外广告文本识别中的表现，发现VLMs在整体场景理解上更优，但轻量级CNN在裁剪文本识别上仍具竞争力且计算成本更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 户外广告文本识别在复杂场景中仍具挑战性，传统OCR方法在噪声和字体变化下表现不佳，而新兴VLMs可能提供更好的解决方案。

Method: 系统评估了Qwen 2.5 VL 3B、InternVL3和SmolVLM2等VLMs与PaddleOCRv4（CNN-based OCR）在两个公开数据集（ICDAR 2015和SVT）上的表现，并加入合成天气失真模拟真实场景。

Result: 部分VLMs在整体场景理解上表现优异，但轻量级CNN在裁剪文本识别上仍具竞争力且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: VLMs在复杂场景中表现更好，但CNN在特定任务中仍具优势；为促进研究，公开了天气增强的基准和评估代码。

Abstract: Outdoor advertisements remain a critical medium for modern marketing, yet
accurately verifying billboard text visibility under real-world conditions is
still challenging. Traditional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) pipelines
excel at cropped text recognition but often struggle with complex outdoor
scenes, varying fonts, and weather-induced visual noise. Recently, multimodal
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as promising alternatives, offering
end-to-end scene understanding with no explicit detection step. This work
systematically benchmarks representative VLMs - including Qwen 2.5 VL 3B,
InternVL3, and SmolVLM2 - against a compact CNN-based OCR baseline
(PaddleOCRv4) across two public datasets (ICDAR 2015 and SVT), augmented with
synthetic weather distortions to simulate realistic degradation. Our results
reveal that while selected VLMs excel at holistic scene reasoning, lightweight
CNN pipelines still achieve competitive accuracy for cropped text at a fraction
of the computational cost-an important consideration for edge deployment. To
foster future research, we release our weather-augmented benchmark and
evaluation code publicly.

### [13] [Beyond Task-Specific Reasoning: A Unified Conditional Generative Framework for Abstract Visual Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11761)
*Fan Shi,Bin Li,Xiangyang Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的条件生成求解器（UCGS），旨在通过单一框架解决多种抽象视觉推理（AVR）任务，避免了任务特定设计和重新训练的成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计具有人类抽象视觉推理能力的智能系统是AI领域的长期目标，但现有方法通常需要任务特定设计或重新训练，增加了成本。

Method: 将AVR任务重新表述为目标图像的可预测性问题，并通过训练一个条件生成模型统一解决多种任务。

Result: 实验表明，UCGS通过多任务训练一次，即可在多种AVR任务中展示抽象推理能力，并具备零样本推理能力。

Conclusion: UCGS提供了一种高效、统一的解决方案，能够在不重新训练的情况下处理新任务。

Abstract: Abstract visual reasoning (AVR) enables humans to quickly discover and
generalize abstract rules to new scenarios. Designing intelligent systems with
human-like AVR abilities has been a long-standing topic in the artificial
intelligence community. Deep AVR solvers have recently achieved remarkable
success in various AVR tasks. However, they usually use task-specific designs
or parameters in different tasks. In such a paradigm, solving new tasks often
means retraining the model, and sometimes retuning the model architectures,
which increases the cost of solving AVR problems. In contrast to task-specific
approaches, this paper proposes a novel Unified Conditional Generative Solver
(UCGS), aiming to address multiple AVR tasks in a unified framework. First, we
prove that some well-known AVR tasks can be reformulated as the problem of
estimating the predictability of target images in problem panels. Then, we
illustrate that, under the proposed framework, training one conditional
generative model can solve various AVR tasks. The experiments show that with a
single round of multi-task training, UCGS demonstrates abstract reasoning
ability across various AVR tasks. Especially, UCGS exhibits the ability of
zero-shot reasoning, enabling it to perform abstract reasoning on problems from
unseen AVR tasks in the testing phase.

TL;DR: CorrMoE是一种新颖的对应关系剪枝框架，通过去风格化双分支和双融合专家混合模块，提升了跨域和跨场景变化的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理密集对应关系时假设视觉域一致，忽视了多样场景结构带来的挑战。

Method: 提出De-stylization Dual Branch和Bi-Fusion Mixture of Experts模块，分别解决域偏移和场景多样性问题。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，具有更高的准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: CorrMoE为跨域和跨场景的对应关系剪枝提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Establishing reliable correspondences between image pairs is a fundamental
task in computer vision, underpinning applications such as 3D reconstruction
and visual localization. Although recent methods have made progress in pruning
outliers from dense correspondence sets, they often hypothesize consistent
visual domains and overlook the challenges posed by diverse scene structures.
In this paper, we propose CorrMoE, a novel correspondence pruning framework
that enhances robustness under cross-domain and cross-scene variations. To
address domain shift, we introduce a De-stylization Dual Branch, performing
style mixing on both implicit and explicit graph features to mitigate the
adverse influence of domain-specific representations. For scene diversity, we
design a Bi-Fusion Mixture of Experts module that adaptively integrates
multi-perspective features through linear-complexity attention and dynamic
expert routing. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
CorrMoE achieves superior accuracy and generalization compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The code and pre-trained models are available at
https://github.com/peiwenxia/CorrMoE.

confronted with unknown environments. Existing methods mainly use visual
information from a single image to learn class representations to distinguish
known from unknown categories. However, these methods often overlook the
benefits of integrating rich contextual information. To address this issue,
this paper proposes a prototypical augmentation and alignment method, termed
ProtoConNet, which incorporates background information from different samples
to enhance the diversity of the feature space, breaking the spurious
associations between context and image subjects in few-shot scenarios.
Specifically, it consists of three main modules: the clustering-based data
selection (CDS) module mines diverse data patterns while preserving core
features; the contextual-enhanced semantic refinement (CSR) module builds a
context dictionary to integrate into image representations, which boosts the
model's robustness in various scenarios; and the prototypical alignment (PA)
module reduces the gap between image representations and class prototypes,
amplifying feature distances for known and unknown classes. Experimental
results from two datasets verified that ProtoConNet enhances the effectiveness
of representation learning in few-shot scenarios and identifies open-set
samples, making it superior to existing methods.

Method: GRACE结合动态运动建模、语义文本细化（CATE模块）和基于熵正则化最优传输的跨模态对齐。

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) aims to identify human emotions
from temporally evolving facial movements and plays a critical role in
affective computing. While recent vision-language approaches have introduced
semantic textual descriptions to guide expression recognition, existing methods
still face two key limitations: they often underutilize the subtle emotional
cues embedded in generated text, and they have yet to incorporate sufficiently
effective mechanisms for filtering out facial dynamics that are irrelevant to
emotional expression. To address these gaps, We propose GRACE, Granular
Representation Alignment for Cross-modal Emotion recognition that integrates
dynamic motion modeling, semantic text refinement, and token-level cross-modal
alignment to facilitate the precise localization of emotionally salient
spatiotemporal features. Our method constructs emotion-aware textual
descriptions via a Coarse-to-fine Affective Text Enhancement (CATE) module and
highlights expression-relevant facial motion through a motion-difference
weighting mechanism. These refined semantic and visual signals are aligned at
the token level using entropy-regularized optimal transport. Experiments on
three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves
recognition performance, particularly in challenging settings with ambiguous or
imbalanced emotion classes, establishing new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in
terms of both UAR and WAR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种空间频率调制（SFM）方法，通过调制高频特征到低频以减轻下采样中的混叠问题，并通过解调恢复高频信息，提升语义分割的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高频信息在语义分割中至关重要，但传统下采样方法（如跨步卷积）会导致混叠或失真。

Method: 提出SFM方法，包括自适应重采样（ARS）调制高频特征，以及多尺度自适应上采样（MSAU）解调恢复高频信息。

Result: SFM有效减轻混叠并保留细节，适用于多种任务（如图像分类、对抗鲁棒性等）。

Conclusion: SFM是一种轻量级且通用的方法，可无缝集成到不同架构中，显著提升性能。

Abstract: High spatial frequency information, including fine details like textures,
significantly contributes to the accuracy of semantic segmentation. However,
according to the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem, high-frequency components
are vulnerable to aliasing or distortion when propagating through downsampling
layers such as strided-convolution. Here, we propose a novel Spatial Frequency
Modulation (SFM) that modulates high-frequency features to a lower frequency
before downsampling and then demodulates them back during upsampling.
Specifically, we implement modulation through adaptive resampling (ARS) and
design a lightweight add-on that can densely sample the high-frequency areas to
scale up the signal, thereby lowering its frequency in accordance with the
Frequency Scaling Property. We also propose Multi-Scale Adaptive Upsampling
(MSAU) to demodulate the modulated feature and recover high-frequency
information through non-uniform upsampling This module further improves
segmentation by explicitly exploiting information interaction between densely
and sparsely resampled areas at multiple scales. Both modules can seamlessly
integrate with various architectures, extending from convolutional neural
networks to transformers. Feature visualization and analysis confirm that our
method effectively alleviates aliasing while successfully retaining details
after demodulation. Finally, we validate the broad applicability and
effectiveness of SFM by extending it to image classification, adversarial
robustness, instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation tasks. The code is

Conclusion: SEPose为固定行人感知提供了全面的合成数据集，支持模型在复杂条件下的性能提升。

Abstract: Event-based sensors have emerged as a promising solution for addressing
challenging conditions in pedestrian and traffic monitoring systems. Their
low-latency and high dynamic range allow for improved response time in
safety-critical situations caused by distracted walking or other unusual
movements. However, the availability of data covering such scenarios remains
limited. To address this gap, we present SEPose -- a comprehensive synthetic
event-based human pose estimation dataset for fixed pedestrian perception
generated using dynamic vision sensors in the CARLA simulator. With nearly 350K
annotated pedestrians with body pose keypoints from the perspective of fixed
traffic cameras, SEPose is a comprehensive synthetic multi-person pose
estimation dataset that spans busy and light crowds and traffic across diverse
lighting and weather conditions in 4-way intersections in urban, suburban, and
rural environments. We train existing state-of-the-art models such as RVT and
YOLOv8 on our dataset and evaluate them on real event-based data to demonstrate
the sim-to-real generalization capabilities of the proposed dataset.

Motivation: 低光环境下传统相机动态范围有限且易产生运动模糊，事件相机和高斯溅射技术虽能缓解问题，但仍面临噪声、帧质量差和色调不一致的挑战。

Method: 提出Dark-EvGS框架，采用三重监督和色调匹配块，结合事件相机和3D高斯溅射技术，重建低光环境下的明亮多视角图像。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在低光条件下优于现有方法，成功重建辐射场并生成高质量图像。

Conclusion: Dark-EvGS框架有效解决了低光环境下的多视角图像重建问题，为相关领域提供了新思路和数据集。

Abstract: In low-light environments, conventional cameras often struggle to capture
clear multi-view images of objects due to dynamic range limitations and motion
blur caused by long exposure. Event cameras, with their high-dynamic range and
high-speed properties, have the potential to mitigate these issues.
Additionally, 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) enables radiance field reconstruction,
facilitating bright frame synthesis from multiple viewpoints in low-light
conditions. However, naively using an event-assisted 3D GS approach still faced
challenges because, in low light, events are noisy, frames lack quality, and
the color tone may be inconsistent. To address these issues, we propose
Dark-EvGS, the first event-assisted 3D GS framework that enables the
reconstruction of bright frames from arbitrary viewpoints along the camera
trajectory. Triplet-level supervision is proposed to gain holistic knowledge,
granular details, and sharp scene rendering. The color tone matching block is
proposed to guarantee the color consistency of the rendered frames.
Furthermore, we introduce the first real-captured dataset for the event-guided
bright frame synthesis task via 3D GS-based radiance field reconstruction.
Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves better results than existing
methods, conquering radiance field reconstruction under challenging low-light
conditions. The code and sample data are included in the supplementary

TL;DR: 论文提出了Hyperphantasia基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的心理可视化能力，发现当前模型与人类表现存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注被动视觉感知，而心理可视化作为人类认知核心能力，尚未在MLLMs中得到充分评估。

Method: 通过四个程序生成的谜题任务，分三个难度级别评估MLLMs的心理可视化能力，并探索强化学习的改进潜力。

Result: 当前MLLMs在心理可视化任务中表现不佳，与人类差距显著，部分模型仅能识别视觉模式。

Conclusion: 心理可视化仍是MLLMs的开放挑战，需进一步研究提升其能力。

Abstract: Mental visualization, the ability to construct and manipulate visual
representations internally, is a core component of human cognition and plays a
vital role in tasks involving reasoning, prediction, and abstraction. Despite
the rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), current
benchmarks primarily assess passive visual perception, offering limited insight
into the more active capability of internally constructing visual patterns to
support problem solving. Yet mental visualization is a critical cognitive skill
in humans, supporting abilities such as spatial navigation, predicting physical
trajectories, and solving complex visual problems through imaginative
simulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce Hyperphantasia, a synthetic
benchmark designed to evaluate the mental visualization abilities of MLLMs
through four carefully constructed puzzles. Each task is procedurally generated
and presented at three difficulty levels, enabling controlled analysis of model
performance across increasing complexity. Our comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art models reveals a substantial gap between the performance of
humans and MLLMs. Additionally, we explore the potential of reinforcement
learning to improve visual simulation capabilities. Our findings suggest that
while some models exhibit partial competence in recognizing visual patterns,
robust mental visualization remains an open challenge for current MLLMs.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法在多实例图像生成中难以处理实例间的关系差异和属性泄漏问题，因此需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: RaDL框架通过可学习参数增强实例特定属性，并利用关系注意力生成关系感知的图像特征。

Result: 在COCO-Position、COCO-MIG和DrawBench等基准测试中，RaDL在位置准确性、多属性考虑和实例关系方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RaDL是生成考虑实例关系和属性的多实例图像的有效解决方案。

Abstract: With recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) models, effectively
generating multiple instances within a single image prompt has become a crucial
challenge. Existing methods, while successful in generating positions of
individual instances, often struggle to account for relationship discrepancy
and multiple attributes leakage. To address these limitations, this paper
proposes the relation-aware disentangled learning (RaDL) framework. RaDL
enhances instance-specific attributes through learnable parameters and
generates relation-aware image features via Relation Attention, utilizing
action verbs extracted from the global prompt. Through extensive evaluations on
benchmarks such as COCO-Position, COCO-MIG, and DrawBench, we demonstrate that
RaDL outperforms existing methods, showing significant improvements in
positional accuracy, multiple attributes consideration, and the relationships
between instances. Our results present RaDL as the solution for generating
images that consider both the relationships and multiple attributes of each
instance within the multi-instance image.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在泛化语义分割中的三个挑战：粗粒度原型对齐、源数据过拟合以及忽略特征适应难度差异。

Method: 定义OTP和VTP原型，采用渐进式对齐策略和原型重加权机制，结合CLIP模型。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: PPAR有效提升了语义分割的泛化能力，验证了其理论和方法优势。

Abstract: Generalizable semantic segmentation aims to perform well on unseen target
domains, a critical challenge due to real-world applications requiring high
generalizability. Class-wise prototypes, representing class centroids, serve as
domain-invariant cues that benefit generalization due to their stability and
semantic consistency. However, this approach faces three challenges. First,
existing methods often adopt coarse prototypical alignment strategies, which
may hinder performance. Second, naive prototypes computed by averaging source
batch features are prone to overfitting and may be negatively affected by
unrelated source data. Third, most methods treat all source samples equally,
ignoring the fact that different features have varying adaptation difficulties.
To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework for generalizable
semantic segmentation: Prototypical Progressive Alignment and Reweighting
(PPAR), leveraging the strong generalization ability of the CLIP model.
Specifically, we define two prototypes: the Original Text Prototype (OTP) and
Visual Text Prototype (VTP), generated via CLIP to serve as a solid base for
alignment. We then introduce a progressive alignment strategy that aligns
features in an easy-to-difficult manner, reducing domain gaps gradually.
Furthermore, we propose a prototypical reweighting mechanism that estimates the
reliability of source data and adjusts its contribution, mitigating the effect
of irrelevant or harmful features (i.e., reducing negative transfer). We also
provide a theoretical analysis showing the alignment between our method and
domain generalization theory. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that PPAR achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its
effectiveness.

LG-CAV-MAE integrates a pretrained text encoder into contrastive audio-visual
masked autoencoders, enabling the model to learn across audio, visual and text
modalities. To train LG-CAV-MAE, we introduce an automatic method to generate
audio-visual-text triplets from unlabeled videos. We first generate frame-level
captions using an image captioning model and then apply CLAP-based filtering to
ensure strong alignment between audio and captions. This approach yields
high-quality audio-visual-text triplets without requiring manual annotations.
We evaluate LG-CAV-MAE on audio-visual retrieval tasks, as well as an
audio-visual classification task. Our method significantly outperforms existing
approaches, achieving up to a 5.6% improvement in recall@10 for retrieval tasks
and a 3.2% improvement for the classification task.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly used for content
moderation, yet their robustness in short-form video contexts remains
underexplored. Current safety evaluations often rely on unimodal attacks,
failing to address combined attack vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce
a comprehensive framework for evaluating the tri-modal safety of MLLMs. First,
we present the Short-Video Multimodal Adversarial (SVMA) dataset, comprising
diverse short-form videos with human-guided synthetic adversarial attacks.
Second, we propose ChimeraBreak, a novel tri-modal attack strategy that
simultaneously challenges visual, auditory, and semantic reasoning pathways.
Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal significant
vulnerabilities with high Attack Success Rates (ASR). Our findings uncover
distinct failure modes, showing model biases toward misclassifying benign or
policy-violating content. We assess results using LLM-as-a-judge, demonstrating
attack reasoning efficacy. Our dataset and findings provide crucial insights
for developing more robust and safe MLLMs.

Motivation: 现有TTA方法在性能和效率之间难以平衡，要么调整文本提示开销大，要么手工视觉特征增强效果不稳定。

Method: GS-Bias引入全局偏差和空间偏差，直接添加到预训练模型的输出中，避免全反向传播，提高效率。

Result: 在15个基准数据集上达到最优性能，例如在跨数据集和领域泛化中分别提升2.23%和2.72%，内存使用仅为TPT的6.5%。

Conclusion: GS-Bias在高效性和性能上均显著优于现有TTA方法，为视觉语言模型的测试时适应提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in test-time adaptation (TTA) for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have garnered increasing attention, particularly through the use of
multiple augmented views of a single image to boost zero-shot generalization.
Unfortunately, existing methods fail to strike a satisfactory balance between
performance and efficiency, either due to excessive overhead of tuning text
prompts or unstable benefits from handcrafted, training-free visual feature
enhancement. In this paper, we present Global-Spatial Bias Learner (GS-Bias),
an efficient and effective TTA paradigm that incorporates two learnable biases
during TTA, unfolded as the global bias and spatial bias. Particularly, the
global bias captures the global semantic features of a test image by learning
consistency across augmented views, while spatial bias learns the semantic
coherence between regions in the image's spatial visual representation. It is
worth highlighting that these two sets of biases are directly added to the
logits outputed by the pretrained VLMs, which circumvent the full
backpropagation through VLM that hinders the efficiency of existing TTA
methods. This endows GS-Bias with extremely high efficiency while achieving
state-of-the-art performance on 15 benchmark datasets. For example, it achieves
a 2.23% improvement over TPT in cross-dataset generalization and a 2.72%
improvement in domain generalization, while requiring only 6.5% of TPT's memory
usage on ImageNet.

Conclusion: EC-Diff在质量和效率上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Diffusion Models have shown remarkable proficiency in image and video
synthesis. As model size and latency increase limit user experience, hybrid
edge-cloud collaborative framework was recently proposed to realize fast
inference and high-quality generation, where the cloud model initiates
high-quality semantic planning and the edge model expedites later-stage
refinement. However, excessive cloud denoising prolongs inference time, while
insufficient steps cause semantic ambiguity, leading to inconsistency in edge
model output. To address these challenges, we propose EC-Diff that accelerates
cloud inference through gradient-based noise estimation while identifying the
optimal point for cloud-edge handoff to maintain generation quality.
Specifically, we design a K-step noise approximation strategy to reduce cloud
inference frequency by using noise gradients between steps and applying cloud
inference periodically to adjust errors. Then we design a two-stage greedy
search algorithm to efficiently find the optimal parameters for noise
approximation and edge model switching. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method significantly enhances generation quality compared to edge
inference, while achieving up to an average $2\times$ speedup in inference
compared to cloud inference. Video samples and source code are available at

Motivation: 现有无监督部件发现方法在跨类别和场景的鲁棒性不足，限制了应用范围，因此需要更有效的方法。

Method: MPAE通过掩码图像学习部件描述符和特征图，利用局部特征与描述符的相似性填充掩码区域，从而对齐部件形状。

Result: MPAE在多种类别和场景中稳健地发现了有意义的部件，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: MPAE为无监督部件发现提供了新范式，能够应对遮挡和跨类别部件相似性等挑战。

Abstract: Part-level features are crucial for image understanding, but few studies
focus on them because of the lack of fine-grained labels. Although unsupervised
part discovery can eliminate the reliance on labels, most of them cannot
maintain robustness across various categories and scenarios, which restricts
their application range. To overcome this limitation, we present a more
effective paradigm for unsupervised part discovery, named Masked Part
Autoencoder (MPAE). It first learns part descriptors as well as a feature map
from the inputs and produces patch features from a masked version of the
original images. Then, the masked regions are filled with the learned part
descriptors based on the similarity between the local features and descriptors.
By restoring these masked patches using the part descriptors, they become
better aligned with their part shapes, guided by appearance features from
unmasked patches. Finally, MPAE robustly discovers meaningful parts that
closely match the actual object shapes, even in complex scenarios. Moreover,
several looser yet more effective constraints are proposed to enable MPAE to
identify the presence of parts across various scenarios and categories in an
unsupervised manner. This provides the foundation for addressing challenges
posed by occlusion and for exploring part similarity across multiple
categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method robustly
discovers meaningful parts across various categories and scenarios. The code is
available at the project https://github.com/Jiahao-UTS/MPAE.

Result: 定性和定量实验表明，该方法能根据掩码成功实现区域化风格混合。

Conclusion: 该方法在保留各风格保真度的同时，实现了用户引导的区域化风格控制。

Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image models have achieved remarkable results in
synthesizing diverse images from text prompts and can capture specific artistic
styles via style personalization. However, their entangled latent space and
lack of smooth interpolation make it difficult to apply distinct painting
techniques in a controlled, regional manner, often causing one style to
dominate. To overcome this, we propose a zero-shot diffusion pipeline that
naturally blends multiple styles by performing style composition on the
denoised latents predicted during the flow-matching denoising process of
separately trained, style-specialized models. We leverage the fact that
lower-noise latents carry stronger stylistic information and fuse them across
heterogeneous diffusion pipelines using spatial masks, enabling precise,
region-specific style control. This mechanism preserves the fidelity of each
individual style while allowing user-guided mixing. Furthermore, to ensure
structural coherence across different models, we incorporate depth-map
conditioning via ControlNet into the diffusion framework. Qualitative and
quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method successfully achieves
region-specific style mixing according to the given masks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Textual Inversion方法在个性化肖像生成中难以保持面部身份一致性，主要因文本与视觉嵌入空间在身份上的语义不对齐。

Method: ID-EA包含ID-Enhancer（整合身份嵌入与文本ID锚点）和ID-Adapter（调整预训练UNet的交叉注意力模块以确保身份保留）。

Result: ID-EA在身份保留指标上显著优于现有方法，且计算效率高，生成速度比现有方法快约15倍。

Conclusion: ID-EA通过改进文本与视觉嵌入的对齐，有效解决了身份一致性问题，同时提升了生成效率。

Abstract: Recently, personalized portrait generation with a text-to-image diffusion
model has significantly advanced with Textual Inversion, emerging as a
promising approach for creating high-fidelity personalized images. Despite its
potential, current Textual Inversion methods struggle to maintain consistent
facial identity due to semantic misalignments between textual and visual
embedding spaces regarding identity. We introduce ID-EA, a novel framework that
guides text embeddings to align with visual identity embeddings, thereby
improving identity preservation in a personalized generation. ID-EA comprises
two key components: the ID-driven Enhancer (ID-Enhancer) and the ID-conditioned
Adapter (ID-Adapter). First, the ID-Enhancer integrates identity embeddings
with a textual ID anchor, refining visual identity embeddings derived from a
face recognition model using representative text embeddings. Then, the
ID-Adapter leverages the identity-enhanced embedding to adapt the text
condition, ensuring identity preservation by adjusting the cross-attention
module in the pre-trained UNet model. This process encourages the text features
to find the most related visual clues across the foreground snippets. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that ID-EA substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity preservation metrics while
achieving remarkable computational efficiency, generating personalized
portraits approximately 15 times faster than existing approaches.

Motivation: 公共遥感数据集因分辨率差异和地物类别定义不一致而缺乏普适性，需要利用大量未标注数据提升模型性能。

Method: SAMST结合监督模型自训练和基于SAM的伪标签优化器，包括阈值过滤、提示生成和标签细化模块。

Conclusion: SAMST通过结合大模型的泛化能力和小模型的训练效率，显著提升了伪标签准确性，为遥感语义分割提供了新思路。

Abstract: Public remote sensing datasets often face limitations in universality due to
resolution variability and inconsistent land cover category definitions. To
harness the vast pool of unlabeled remote sensing data, we propose SAMST, a
semi-supervised semantic segmentation method. SAMST leverages the strengths of
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in zero-shot generalization and boundary
detection. SAMST iteratively refines pseudo-labels through two main components:
supervised model self-training using both labeled and pseudo-labeled data, and
a SAM-based Pseudo-label Refiner. The Pseudo-label Refiner comprises three
modules: a Threshold Filter Module for preprocessing, a Prompt Generation
Module for extracting connected regions and generating prompts for SAM, and a
Label Refinement Module for final label stitching. By integrating the
generalization power of large models with the training efficiency of small
models, SAMST improves pseudo-label accuracy, thereby enhancing overall model
performance. Experiments on the Potsdam dataset validate the effectiveness and
feasibility of SAMST, demonstrating its potential to address the challenges
posed by limited labeled data in remote sensing semantic segmentation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏合适的数据集，实现细粒度的风格化3D面部表情操控存在挑战。

Method: 基于32种标准面部动作单元（AUs）构建AUBlendSet数据集，并提出AUBlendNet网络学习不同风格的AU-Blendshape基向量。

Result: 通过实验验证了AUBlendSet和AUBlendNet在风格化表情操控、语音驱动动画和情感识别数据增强中的有效性。

Conclusion: AUBlendSet和AUBlendNet在3D面部动画任务中具有重要潜力，是首个通过AUs实现连续表情操控的数据集和网络。

Abstract: While 3D facial animation has made impressive progress, challenges still
exist in realizing fine-grained stylized 3D facial expression manipulation due
to the lack of appropriate datasets. In this paper, we introduce the
AUBlendSet, a 3D facial dataset based on AU-Blendshape representation for
fine-grained facial expression manipulation across identities. AUBlendSet is a
blendshape data collection based on 32 standard facial action units (AUs)
across 500 identities, along with an additional set of facial postures
annotated with detailed AUs. Based on AUBlendSet, we propose AUBlendNet to
learn AU-Blendshape basis vectors for different character styles. AUBlendNet
predicts, in parallel, the AU-Blendshape basis vectors of the corresponding
style for a given identity mesh, thereby achieving stylized 3D emotional facial
manipulation. We comprehensively validate the effectiveness of AUBlendSet and
AUBlendNet through tasks such as stylized facial expression manipulation,
speech-driven emotional facial animation, and emotion recognition data
augmentation. Through a series of qualitative and quantitative experiments, we
demonstrate the potential and importance of AUBlendSet and AUBlendNet in 3D
facial animation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, AUBlendSet is the first
dataset, and AUBlendNet is the first network for continuous 3D facial
expression manipulation for any identity through facial AUs. Our source code is

### [32] [Frequency-Dynamic Attention Modulation for Dense Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12006)
*Linwei Chen,Lin Gu,Ying Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于电路理论的频率动态注意力调制（FDAM）方法，用于改进视觉Transformer的频率响应，避免细节丢失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉Transformer的注意力机制导致频率消失，丢失关键细节和纹理。

Method: FDAM包括注意力反转（AttInv）和频率动态缩放（FreqScale），动态调整频率响应。

Result: 在多种模型（如SegFormer、DeiT）和任务（如语义分割、目标检测）中表现提升，并在遥感检测中达到SOTA。

Conclusion: FDAM有效解决了频率消失问题，提升了视觉Transformer的性能。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have significantly advanced computer vision,
demonstrating strong performance across various tasks. However, the attention
mechanism in ViTs makes each layer function as a low-pass filter, and the
stacked-layer architecture in existing transformers suffers from frequency
vanishing. This leads to the loss of critical details and textures. We propose
a novel, circuit-theory-inspired strategy called Frequency-Dynamic Attention
Modulation (FDAM), which can be easily plugged into ViTs. FDAM directly
modulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two
techniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling
(FreqScale). Since circuit theory uses low-pass filters as fundamental
elements, we introduce AttInv, a method that generates complementary high-pass
filtering by inverting the low-pass filter in the attention matrix, and
dynamically combining the two. We further design FreqScale to weight different
frequency components for fine-grained adjustments to the target response
function. Through feature similarity analysis and effective rank evaluation, we
demonstrate that our approach avoids representation collapse, leading to
consistent performance improvements across various models, including SegFormer,
DeiT, and MaskDINO. These improvements are evident in tasks such as semantic
segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Additionally, we
apply our method to remote sensing detection, achieving state-of-the-art
results in single-scale settings. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文将掩码图像建模（MIM）与无监督域适应（UDA）中的一致性正则化关联，提出MaskTwins框架，通过互补掩码增强特征提取和表示学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅将掩码视为图像变形的特殊形式，缺乏理论分析，导致对掩码重建的浅层理解及其在特征提取中的潜力未充分挖掘。

Method: 将掩码重建重新定义为稀疏信号重建问题，理论证明互补掩码的双重形式在提取域无关特征上具有优势，并基于此提出MaskTwins框架。

Result: 实验表明MaskTwins在自然和生物图像分割中优于基线方法，无需单独预训练即可提取域不变特征。

Conclusion: MaskTwins为域自适应分割提供了新范式，展示了互补掩码在增强特征提取中的显著优势。

Abstract: Recent works have correlated Masked Image Modeling (MIM) with consistency
regularization in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). However, they merely
treat masking as a special form of deformation on the input images and neglect
the theoretical analysis, which leads to a superficial understanding of masked
reconstruction and insufficient exploitation of its potential in enhancing
feature extraction and representation learning. In this paper, we reframe
masked reconstruction as a sparse signal reconstruction problem and
theoretically prove that the dual form of complementary masks possesses
superior capabilities in extracting domain-agnostic image features. Based on
this compelling insight, we propose MaskTwins, a simple yet effective UDA
framework that integrates masked reconstruction directly into the main training
pipeline. MaskTwins uncovers intrinsic structural patterns that persist across
disparate domains by enforcing consistency between predictions of images masked
in complementary ways, enabling domain generalization in an end-to-end manner.
Extensive experiments verify the superiority of MaskTwins over baseline methods
in natural and biological image segmentation. These results demonstrate the
significant advantages of MaskTwins in extracting domain-invariant features
without the need for separate pre-training, offering a new paradigm for
domain-adaptive segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何利用fMRI数据解码大脑对自然电影刺激的反应，以填补自然刺激与fMRI采集之间的时间分辨率差距。

Method: 采用时间卷积层的编码-解码架构，预测视觉皮层及其周围体素的活动，并从神经活动中重建视觉输入。

Result: 模型成功重建了边缘、面部和对比度等视觉特征，贡献最大的脑区包括中枕区、梭状回和距状裂。

Conclusion: 该方法为通过深度学习模型探索视觉处理机制提供了可能性。

Abstract: We propose an end-to-end deep neural encoder-decoder model to encode and
decode brain activity in response to naturalistic stimuli using functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Leveraging temporally correlated input
from consecutive film frames, we employ temporal convolutional layers in our
architecture, which effectively allows to bridge the temporal resolution gap
between natural movie stimuli and fMRI acquisitions. Our model predicts
activity of voxels in and around the visual cortex and performs reconstruction
of corresponding visual inputs from neural activity. Finally, we investigate
brain regions contributing to visual decoding through saliency maps. We find
that the most contributing regions are the middle occipital area, the fusiform
area, and the calcarine, respectively employed in shape perception, complex
recognition (in particular face perception), and basic visual features such as
edges and contrasts. These functions being strongly solicited are in line with
the decoder's capability to reconstruct edges, faces, and contrasts. All in
all, this suggests the possibility to probe our understanding of visual
processing in films using as a proxy the behaviour of deep learning models such
as the one proposed in this paper.

Motivation: 现有方法将RGB域视为统一域，忽略了其内部多个子域（如白天、夜晚、雾天场景）的差异，解耦域不变和域特定特征有助于RGB-IR域适应。

Method: 设计了光谱自适应幂等解耦（SAID）模块，通过光谱分解解耦域不变和域特定特征；提出基于滤波器组的光谱处理范式和解耦损失；引入空间-光谱耦合方法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了基线性能，并在多个RGB-IR数据集上优于现有方法，包括基于FLIR-ADAS数据集的新实验协议。

Conclusion: 通过解耦-耦合策略，SS-DC框架有效提升了RGB-IR域自适应目标检测的性能，证明了多子域特征解耦的重要性。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptive object detection (UDAOD) from the visible domain
to the infrared (RGB-IR) domain is challenging. Existing methods regard the RGB
domain as a unified domain and neglect the multiple subdomains within it, such
as daytime, nighttime, and foggy scenes. We argue that decoupling the
domain-invariant (DI) and domain-specific (DS) features across these multiple
subdomains is beneficial for RGB-IR domain adaptation. To this end, this paper
proposes a new SS-DC framework based on a decoupling-coupling strategy. In
terms of decoupling, we design a Spectral Adaptive Idempotent Decoupling (SAID)
module in the aspect of spectral decomposition. Due to the style and content
information being highly embedded in different frequency bands, this module can
decouple DI and DS components more accurately and interpretably. A novel filter
bank-based spectral processing paradigm and a self-distillation-driven
decoupling loss are proposed to improve the spectral domain decoupling. In
terms of coupling, a new spatial-spectral coupling method is proposed, which
realizes joint coupling through spatial and spectral DI feature pyramids.
Meanwhile, this paper introduces DS from decoupling to reduce the domain bias.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the
baseline performance and outperform existing UDAOD methods on multiple RGB-IR
datasets, including a new experimental protocol proposed in this paper based on
the FLIR-ADAS dataset.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DOV4MM的新方法，用于验证无标签数据集在掩码模型中的所有权，解决了现有技术无法直接应用于掩码模型的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量开源数据集对深度学习发展至关重要，但面临被滥用的风险。现有所有权验证技术主要针对监督模型和对比预训练模型，无法适用于掩码模型。

Method: DOV4MM基于掩码信息在嵌入空间中的重建难度差异，判断可疑黑盒模型是否在目标数据集上预训练。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K和WikiText-103上的实验表明，DOV4MM显著优于现有方法，p值远低于0.05。

Conclusion: DOV4MM为掩码模型的数据集所有权验证提供了有效解决方案，有助于保护数据集所有者的权益。

Abstract: High-quality open-source datasets have emerged as a pivotal catalyst driving
the swift advancement of deep learning, while facing the looming threat of
potential exploitation. Protecting these datasets is of paramount importance
for the interests of their owners. The verification of dataset ownership has
evolved into a crucial approach in this domain; however, existing verification
techniques are predominantly tailored to supervised models and contrastive
pre-trained models, rendering them ill-suited for direct application to the
increasingly prevalent masked models. In this work, we introduce the inaugural
methodology addressing this critical, yet unresolved challenge, termed Dataset
Ownership Verification for Masked Modeling (DOV4MM). The central objective is
to ascertain whether a suspicious black-box model has been pre-trained on a
particular unlabeled dataset, thereby assisting dataset owners in safeguarding
their rights. DOV4MM is grounded in our empirical observation that when a model
is pre-trained on the target dataset, the difficulty of reconstructing masked
information within the embedding space exhibits a marked contrast to models not
pre-trained on that dataset. We validated the efficacy of DOV4MM through ten
masked image models on ImageNet-1K and four masked language models on
WikiText-103. The results demonstrate that DOV4MM rejects the null hypothesis,
with a $p$-value considerably below 0.05, surpassing all prior approaches. Code

Abstract: Air pollutants pose a significant threat to the environment and human health,
thus forecasting accurate pollutant concentrations is essential for pollution
warnings and policy-making. Existing studies predominantly focus on
single-pollutant forecasting, neglecting the interactions among different
pollutants and their diverse spatial responses. To address the practical needs
of forecasting multivariate air pollutants, we propose MultiVariate
AutoRegressive air pollutants forecasting model (MVAR), which reduces the
dependency on long-time-window inputs and boosts the data utilization
efficiency. We also design the Multivariate Autoregressive Training Paradigm,
enabling MVAR to achieve 120-hour long-term sequential forecasting.
Additionally, MVAR develops Meteorological Coupled Spatial Transformer block,
enabling the flexible coupling of AI-based meteorological forecasts while
learning the interactions among pollutants and their diverse spatial responses.
As for the lack of standardized datasets in air pollutants forecasting, we
construct a comprehensive dataset covering 6 major pollutants across 75 cities
in North China from 2018 to 2023, including ERA5 reanalysis data and FuXi-2.0
forecast data. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model
outperforms state-of-the-art methods and validate the effectiveness of the
proposed architecture.

Abstract: With the growing need for diverse and scalable data in indoor scene tasks,

paradigm designed to generate large-scale 3D-language datasets by leveraging
the strengths of foundational models. The framework integrates key components,

decoder, to process natural language instructions and 3D scene data. This
approach facilitates enhanced reasoning and response generation in complex 3D
environments. Using the ScanNet 3D scene dataset, along with text annotations
from ScanQA and ScanRefer, 3D-MoRe generates 62,000 question-answer (QA) pairs
and 73,000 object descriptions across 1,513 scenes. We also employ various data
augmentation techniques and implement semantic filtering to ensure high-quality
data. Experiments on ScanQA demonstrate that 3D-MoRe significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, with the CIDEr score improving by 2.15\%.
Similarly, on ScanRefer, our approach achieves a notable increase in CIDEr@0.5

Result: 在12scenes和7scenes数据集上表现优于基线方法，展示了出色的全局定位能力。

Conclusion: SGLoc通过结合语义信息和3DGS表示，实现了无需初始姿态先验的高效全局定位。

Abstract: We propose SGLoc, a novel localization system that directly regresses camera
poses from 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation by leveraging semantic
information. Our method utilizes the semantic relationship between 2D image and
3D scene representation to estimate the 6DoF pose without prior pose
information. In this system, we introduce a multi-level pose regression
strategy that progressively estimates and refines the pose of query image from
the global 3DGS map, without requiring initial pose priors. Moreover, we
introduce a semantic-based global retrieval algorithm that establishes
correspondences between 2D (image) and 3D (3DGS map). By matching the extracted
scene semantic descriptors of 2D query image and 3DGS semantic representation,
we align the image with the local region of the global 3DGS map, thereby
obtaining a coarse pose estimation. Subsequently, we refine the coarse pose by
iteratively optimizing the difference between the query image and the rendered
image from 3DGS. Our SGLoc demonstrates superior performance over baselines on
12scenes and 7scenes datasets, showing excellent capabilities in global
localization without initial pose prior. Code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有新类发现方法局限于单视图数据且伪标签质量不稳定，无法适应多视图数据（如多组学数据）的需求。

Method: 通过矩阵分解提取视图共享基矩阵和因子矩阵，利用已知类视图关系指导新类聚类，动态调整视图权重。

Result: 实验验证了IICMVNCD在多视图新类发现中的有效性。

Conclusion: IICMVNCD是首个针对多视图数据的新类发现框架，显著提升了性能稳定性。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of novel class discovery (NCD), which
aims to cluster novel classes by leveraging knowledge from disjoint known
classes. While recent advances have made significant progress in this area,
existing NCD methods face two major limitations. First, they primarily focus on
single-view data (e.g., images), overlooking the increasingly common multi-view
data, such as multi-omics datasets used in disease diagnosis. Second, their
reliance on pseudo-labels to supervise novel class clustering often results in
unstable performance, as pseudo-label quality is highly sensitive to factors
such as data noise and feature dimensionality. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel framework named Intra-view and Inter-view Correlation Guided
Multi-view Novel Class Discovery (IICMVNCD), which is the first attempt to
explore NCD in multi-view setting so far. Specifically, at the intra-view
level, leveraging the distributional similarity between known and novel
classes, we employ matrix factorization to decompose features into
view-specific shared base matrices and factor matrices. The base matrices
capture distributional consistency among the two datasets, while the factor
matrices model pairwise relationships between samples. At the inter-view level,
we utilize view relationships among known classes to guide the clustering of
novel classes. This includes generating predicted labels through the weighted
fusion of factor matrices and dynamically adjusting view weights of known
classes based on the supervision loss, which are then transferred to novel
class learning. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed
approach.

Result: 在FAS任务中表现优于现有方法，显著减少跨域训练冗余。

Conclusion: InstructFLIP通过文本指导和指令解耦，有效提升了FAS任务的泛化能力和效率。

Abstract: Face anti-spoofing (FAS) aims to construct a robust system that can withstand
diverse attacks. While recent efforts have concentrated mainly on cross-domain
generalization, two significant challenges persist: limited semantic
understanding of attack types and training redundancy across domains. We
address the first by integrating vision-language models (VLMs) to enhance the
perception of visual input. For the second challenge, we employ a meta-domain
strategy to learn a unified model that generalizes well across multiple
domains. Our proposed InstructFLIP is a novel instruction-tuned framework that
leverages VLMs to enhance generalization via textual guidance trained solely on
a single domain. At its core, InstructFLIP explicitly decouples instructions
into content and style components, where content-based instructions focus on
the essential semantics of spoofing, and style-based instructions consider
variations related to the environment and camera characteristics. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of InstructFLIP by outperforming SOTA
models in accuracy and substantially reducing training redundancy across
diverse domains in FAS. Project website is available at

Conclusion: MS-DETR通过联合学习运动与语义特征，有效解决了视频时刻检索和高光检测中的稀疏性问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Video Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection (HD) aim to pinpoint
specific moments and assess clip-wise relevance based on the text query. While
DETR-based joint frameworks have made significant strides, there remains
untapped potential in harnessing the intricate relationships between temporal
motion and spatial semantics within video content. In this paper, we propose
the Motion-Semantics DETR (MS-DETR), a framework that captures rich
motion-semantics features through unified learning for MR/HD tasks. The encoder
first explicitly models disentangled intra-modal correlations within motion and
semantics dimensions, guided by the given text queries. Subsequently, the
decoder utilizes the task-wise correlation across temporal motion and spatial
semantics dimensions to enable precise query-guided localization for MR and
refined highlight boundary delineation for HD. Furthermore, we observe the
inherent sparsity dilemma within the motion and semantics dimensions of MR/HD
datasets. To address this issue, we enrich the corpus from both dimensions by
generation strategies and propose contrastive denoising learning to ensure the
above components learn robustly and effectively. Extensive experiments on four
MR/HD benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
state-of-the-art models by a margin. Our code is available at

Abstract: Motion forecasting for on-road traffic agents presents both a significant
challenge and a critical necessity for ensuring safety in autonomous driving
systems. In contrast to most existing data-driven approaches that directly
predict future trajectories, we rethink this task from a planning perspective,
advocating a "First Reasoning, Then Forecasting" strategy that explicitly
incorporates behavior intentions as spatial guidance for trajectory prediction.
To achieve this, we introduce an interpretable, reward-driven intention
reasoner grounded in a novel query-centric Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL)
scheme. Our method first encodes traffic agents and scene elements into a
unified vectorized representation, then aggregates contextual features through
a query-centric paradigm. This enables the derivation of a reward distribution,
a compact yet informative representation of the target agent's behavior within
the given scene context via IRL. Guided by this reward heuristic, we perform
policy rollouts to reason about multiple plausible intentions, providing
valuable priors for subsequent trajectory generation. Finally, we develop a
hierarchical DETR-like decoder integrated with bidirectional selective state
space models to produce accurate future trajectories along with their
associated probabilities. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Argoverse
and nuScenes motion forecasting datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly enhances trajectory prediction confidence, achieving highly
competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对无人机视角下小型敏捷多目标（如鸟类）跟踪的冠军解决方案，通过创新的检测和关联方法，显著提升了跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无人机视角下小型多目标跟踪的三大挑战：目标外观特征稀缺、相机与目标动态复杂纠缠、频繁遮挡和身份模糊。

Method: 采用跟踪-检测范式，提出SliceTrain训练增强框架和基于运动方向维护与自适应相似度度量的鲁棒跟踪器。

Result: 在SMOT4SB测试集上达到SO-HOTA分数55.205，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂现实场景中表现出色，代码将开源。

Abstract: Tracking small, agile multi-objects (SMOT), such as birds, from an Unmanned
Aerial Vehicle (UAV) perspective is a highly challenging computer vision task.
The difficulty stems from three main sources: the extreme scarcity of target
appearance features, the complex motion entanglement caused by the combined
dynamics of the camera and the targets themselves, and the frequent occlusions
and identity ambiguity arising from dense flocking behavior. This paper details
our championship-winning solution in the MVA 2025 "Finding Birds" Small
Multi-Object Tracking Challenge (SMOT4SB), which adopts the
tracking-by-detection paradigm with targeted innovations at both the detection
and association levels. On the detection side, we propose a systematic training
enhancement framework named \textbf{SliceTrain}. This framework, through the
synergy of 'deterministic full-coverage slicing' and 'slice-level stochastic
augmentation, effectively addresses the problem of insufficient learning for
small objects in high-resolution image training. On the tracking side, we
designed a robust tracker that is completely independent of appearance
information. By integrating a \textbf{motion direction maintenance (EMA)}
mechanism and an \textbf{adaptive similarity metric} combining \textbf{bounding
box expansion and distance penalty} into the OC-SORT framework, our tracker can
stably handle irregular motion and maintain target identities. Our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SMOT4SB public test set, reaching
an SO-HOTA score of \textbf{55.205}, which fully validates the effectiveness
and advancement of our framework in solving complex real-world SMOT problems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于特征空间结构特性的对抗性人脸生成方法，无需迭代优化，仅需少量查询即可高效攻击人脸识别系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸识别系统（FRSs）的对抗性攻击对安全和隐私构成威胁，当前方法依赖迭代优化或迁移性，效率低且不实用。

Method: 利用FRS特征空间中具有相同属性（如性别或种族）的个体形成的子空间，生成对抗性人脸，仅需单次非自适应查询。

Result: 在AWS的CompareFaces API上，仅需100张人脸图像的单次查询，攻击成功率超过93%。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且实用，无需依赖迁移性或开源模型，并能生成具有特定属性的对抗性人脸。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on face recognition systems (FRSs) pose serious security
and privacy threats, especially when these systems are used for identity
verification. In this paper, we propose a novel method for generating
adversarial faces-synthetic facial images that are visually distinct yet
recognized as a target identity by the FRS. Unlike iterative optimization-based
approaches (e.g., gradient descent or other iterative solvers), our method
leverages the structural characteristics of the FRS feature space. We figure
out that individuals sharing the same attribute (e.g., gender or race) form an
attributed subsphere. By utilizing such subspheres, our method achieves both
non-adaptiveness and a remarkably small number of queries. This eliminates the
need for relying on transferability and open-source surrogate models, which
have been a typical strategy when repeated adaptive queries to commercial FRSs
are impossible. Despite requiring only a single non-adaptive query consisting
of 100 face images, our method achieves a high success rate of over 93% against
AWS's CompareFaces API at its default threshold. Furthermore, unlike many
existing attacks that perturb a given image, our method can deliberately
produce adversarial faces that impersonate the target identity while exhibiting
high-level attributes chosen by the adversary.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在光照调整和高频信息恢复方面具有显著优势。

Conclusion: 通过小波变换和特征空间解耦，本文方法有效提升了低光立体图像的增强效果，代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: Low-light images suffer from complex degradation, and existing enhancement
methods often encode all degradation factors within a single latent space. This
leads to highly entangled features and strong black-box characteristics, making
the model prone to shortcut learning. To mitigate the above issues, this paper
proposes a wavelet-based low-light stereo image enhancement method with feature
space decoupling. Our insight comes from the following findings: (1) Wavelet
transform enables the independent processing of low-frequency and
high-frequency information. (2) Illumination adjustment can be achieved by
adjusting the low-frequency component of a low-light image, extracted through
multi-level wavelet decomposition. Thus, by using wavelet transform the feature
space is decomposed into a low-frequency branch for illumination adjustment and
multiple high-frequency branches for texture enhancement. Additionally, stereo
low-light image enhancement can extract useful cues from another view to
improve enhancement. To this end, we propose a novel high-frequency guided
cross-view interaction module (HF-CIM) that operates within high-frequency
branches rather than across the entire feature space, effectively extracting
valuable image details from the other view. Furthermore, to enhance the
high-frequency information, a detail and texture enhancement module (DTEM) is
proposed based on cross-attention mechanism. The model is trained on a dataset
consisting of images with uniform illumination and images with non-uniform
illumination. Experimental results on both real and synthetic images indicate
that our algorithm offers significant advantages in light adjustment while
effectively recovering high-frequency information. The code and dataset are
publicly available at: https://github.com/Cherisherr/WDCI-Net.git.

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction of vehicles is vital for applications such as
vehicle inspection, predictive maintenance, and urban planning. Existing
methods like Neural Radiance Fields and Gaussian Splatting have shown
impressive results but remain limited by their reliance on dense input views,
which hinders real-world applicability. This paper addresses the challenge of
reconstructing vehicles from sparse-view inputs, leveraging depth maps and a
robust pose estimation architecture to synthesize novel views and augment
training data. Specifically, we enhance Gaussian Splatting by integrating a
selective photometric loss, applied only to high-confidence pixels, and
replacing standard Structure-from-Motion pipelines with the DUSt3R architecture
to improve camera pose estimation. Furthermore, we present a novel dataset
featuring both synthetic and real-world public transportation vehicles,
enabling extensive evaluation of our approach. Experimental results demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, showcasing the
method's ability to achieve high-quality reconstructions even under constrained
input conditions.

Terracotta Temples with a brand-new data augmentation method called MosaicSlice
on the third. Furthermore, we delve deeper into the Super Resolution strategy
to upscale the images without losing significant amount of quality. Our methods
allow for the development of seamless region-filling and highly detailed tiles
while maintaining authenticity using a novel data augmentation strategy within
affordable costs introducing automation. By providing effective solutions that
preserve the delicate balance between tradition and innovation, this study

Result: 模型在生成阴影图像方面表现优异，并成功应用于亚利桑那州坦佩市的路径规划中。

Conclusion: 该研究为极端高温天气下的城市规划提供了参考，具有潜在的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Heatwaves pose a significant threat to public health, especially as global
warming intensifies. However, current routing systems (e.g., online maps) fail
to incorporate shade information due to the difficulty of estimating shades
directly from noisy satellite imagery and the limited availability of training
data for generative models. In this paper, we address these challenges through
two main contributions. First, we build an extensive dataset covering diverse
longitude-latitude regions, varying levels of building density, and different
urban layouts. Leveraging Blender-based 3D simulations alongside building
outlines, we capture building shadows under various solar zenith angles
throughout the year and at different times of day. These simulated shadows are
aligned with satellite images, providing a rich resource for learning shade
patterns. Second, we propose the DeepShade, a diffusion-based model designed to
learn and synthesize shade variations over time. It emphasizes the nuance of
edge features by jointly considering RGB with the Canny edge layer, and
incorporates contrastive learning to capture the temporal change rules of
shade. Then, by conditioning on textual descriptions of known conditions (e.g.,
time of day, solar angles), our framework provides improved performance in
generating shade images. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by using
our shade predictions to calculate shade ratios for real-world route planning
in Tempe, Arizona. We believe this work will benefit society by providing a
reference for urban planning in extreme heat weather and its potential
practical applications in the environment.

Motivation: 医学图像分割网络在有限和不完美的数据集上容易发生前景与背景的误分类，OoD数据在其他视觉任务中表现出色，因此尝试将其用于医学分割。

Method: 提出Med-OoD框架，利用OoD数据监督完全监督的医学分割，无需外部数据、特征正则化目标或额外标注，且无需修改网络架构。

Conclusion: Med-OoD展示了OoD数据在医学分割中的潜力，提出了一种新的学习范式，鼓励重新思考OoD数据的作用。

Abstract: Biomedical segmentation networks easily suffer from the unexpected
misclassification between foreground and background objects when learning on
limited and imperfect medical datasets. Inspired by the strong power of
Out-of-Distribution (OoD) data on other visual tasks, we propose a data-centric
framework, Med-OoD to address this issue by introducing OoD data supervision
into fully-supervised biomedical segmentation with none of the following needs:
(i) external data sources, (ii) feature regularization objectives, (iii)
additional annotations. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into
segmentation networks without any modification on the architectures. Extensive
experiments show that Med-OoD largely prevents various segmentation networks
from the pixel misclassification on medical images and achieves considerable
performance improvements on Lizard dataset. We also present an emerging
learning paradigm of training a medical segmentation network completely using
OoD data devoid of foreground class labels, surprisingly turning out 76.1% mIoU
as test result. We hope this learning paradigm will attract people to rethink
the roles of OoD data. Code is made available at

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种基于深度学习的模型，利用出生24小时内的胸部X光片预测极低出生体重婴儿的中重度支气管肺发育不良（BPD）结局，AUROC为0.78。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BPD是一种常见的慢性肺病，预防性干预可能带来严重风险，因此早期预测至关重要。

Method: 使用ResNet-50模型，通过领域特定的预训练、渐进层冻结和CutMix增强技术进行优化。

Result: 模型在预测中重度BPD时表现优异（AUROC 0.78），显著优于ImageNet初始化（p=0.031）。

Conclusion: 领域特定预训练结合渐进冻结和线性探测，为BPD预测提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease affecting 35% of
extremely low birth weight infants. Defined by oxygen dependence at 36 weeks
postmenstrual age, it causes lifelong respiratory complications. However,
preventive interventions carry severe risks, including neurodevelopmental
impairment, ventilator-induced lung injury, and systemic complications.
Therefore, early BPD prognosis and prediction of BPD outcome is crucial to
avoid unnecessary toxicity in low risk infants. Admission radiographs of
extremely preterm infants are routinely acquired within 24h of life and could
serve as a non-invasive prognostic tool. In this work, we developed and
investigated a deep learning approach using chest X-rays from 163 extremely
low-birth-weight infants ($\leq$32 weeks gestation, 401-999g) obtained within
24 hours of birth. We fine-tuned a ResNet-50 pretrained specifically on adult
chest radiographs, employing progressive layer freezing with discriminative
learning rates to prevent overfitting and evaluated a CutMix augmentation and
linear probing. For moderate/severe BPD outcome prediction, our best performing
model with progressive freezing, linear probing and CutMix achieved an AUROC of
0.78 $\pm$ 0.10, balanced accuracy of 0.69 $\pm$ 0.10, and an F1-score of 0.67
$\pm$ 0.11. In-domain pre-training significantly outperformed ImageNet
initialization (p = 0.031) which confirms domain-specific pretraining to be
important for BPD outcome prediction. Routine IRDS grades showed limited
prognostic value (AUROC 0.57 $\pm$ 0.11), confirming the need of learned
markers. Our approach demonstrates that domain-specific pretraining enables
accurate BPD prediction from routine day-1 radiographs. Through progressive
freezing and linear probing, the method remains computationally feasible for
site-level implementation and future federated learning deployments.

Abstract: Dynamic driving scene reconstruction is of great importance in fields like
digital twin system and autonomous driving simulation. However, unacceptable
degradation occurs when the view deviates from the input trajectory, leading to
corrupted background and vehicle models. To improve reconstruction quality on
novel trajectory, existing methods are subject to various limitations including
inconsistency, deformation, and time consumption. This paper proposes
LidarPainter, a one-step diffusion model that recovers consistent driving views
from sparse LiDAR condition and artifact-corrupted renderings in real-time,
enabling high-fidelity lane shifts in driving scene reconstruction. Extensive
experiments show that LidarPainter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
speed, quality and resource efficiency, specifically 7 x faster than
StreetCrafter with only one fifth of GPU memory required. LidarPainter also
supports stylized generation using text prompts such as "foggy" and "night",
allowing for a diverse expansion of the existing asset library.

hierarchical scene graph with a Large Language Model for multistep reasoning.
This integration leverages inter-layer (e.g., room-to-object) and intra-layer
(e.g., object-to-object) connections, enhancing spatial contextual
understanding. We investigate the semantic and geometry accuracy of
hierarchical representation on Habitat Matterport 3D Semantic multi-floor

Result: 在ImageNet分类任务中，DeiT-T和DeiT-S的准确率分别提高了1.3%和2.0%，计算开销减少了50%。

Conclusion: BSPF-ViT在保持准确性的同时显著提升了ViT的计算效率，适用于各种ViT模型。

Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) has achieved impressive results across various
vision tasks, yet its high computational cost limits practical applications.
Recent methods have aimed to reduce ViT's $O(n^2)$ complexity by pruning
unimportant tokens. However, these techniques often sacrifice accuracy by
independently pruning query (Q) and key (K) tokens, leading to performance
degradation due to overlooked token interactions. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel {\bf Block-based Symmetric Pruning and Fusion} for
efficient ViT (BSPF-ViT) that optimizes the pruning of Q/K tokens jointly.
Unlike previous methods that consider only a single direction, our approach
evaluates each token and its neighbors to decide which tokens to retain by
taking token interaction into account. The retained tokens are compressed
through a similarity fusion step, preserving key information while reducing
computational costs. The shared weights of Q/K tokens create a symmetric
attention matrix, allowing pruning only the upper triangular part for speed up.
BSPF-ViT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art ViT methods at all pruning
levels, increasing ImageNet classification accuracy by 1.3% on DeiT-T and 2.0%
on DeiT-S, while reducing computational overhead by 50%. It achieves 40%
speedup with improved accuracy across various ViTs.

Abstract: We argue that diffusion models' success in modeling complex distributions is,
for the most part, coming from their input conditioning. This paper
investigates the representation used to condition diffusion models from the
perspective that ideal representations should improve sample fidelity, be easy
to generate, and be compositional to allow out-of-training samples generation.
We introduce Discrete Latent Code (DLC), an image representation derived from
Simplicial Embeddings trained with a self-supervised learning objective. DLCs
are sequences of discrete tokens, as opposed to the standard continuous image
embeddings. They are easy to generate and their compositionality enables
sampling of novel images beyond the training distribution. Diffusion models
trained with DLCs have improved generation fidelity, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for unconditional image generation on ImageNet. Additionally,
we show that composing DLCs allows the image generator to produce
out-of-distribution samples that coherently combine the semantics of images in
diverse ways. Finally, we showcase how DLCs can enable text-to-image generation
by leveraging large-scale pretrained language models. We efficiently finetune a
text diffusion language model to generate DLCs that produce novel samples
outside of the image generator training distribution.

Conclusion: BPAM框架成功结合了双边网格的空间建模能力和MLP的非线性映射能力，实现了高效的图像增强。

Abstract: Deep learning-based bilateral grid processing has emerged as a promising
solution for image enhancement, inherently encoding spatial and intensity
information while enabling efficient full-resolution processing through slicing
operations. However, existing approaches are limited to linear affine
transformations, hindering their ability to model complex color relationships.
Meanwhile, while multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) excel at non-linear mappings,
traditional MLP-based methods employ globally shared parameters, which is hard
to deal with localized variations. To overcome these dual challenges, we
propose a Bilateral Grid-based Pixel-Adaptive Multi-layer Perceptron (BPAM)
framework. Our approach synergizes the spatial modeling of bilateral grids with
the non-linear capabilities of MLPs. Specifically, we generate bilateral grids
containing MLP parameters, where each pixel dynamically retrieves its unique
transformation parameters and obtain a distinct MLP for color mapping based on
spatial coordinates and intensity values. In addition, we propose a novel grid
decomposition strategy that categorizes MLP parameters into distinct types
stored in separate subgrids. Multi-channel guidance maps are used to extract
category-specific parameters from corresponding subgrids, ensuring effective
utilization of color information during slicing while guiding precise parameter
generation. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in performance while maintaining
real-time processing capabilities.

Motivation: 结合对比学习和聚类的优势，以提升无监督视觉表示学习的性能。

Method: 使用两个神经网络（查询和键），键网络通过查询输出的慢速移动平均更新，结合对比损失和聚类目标。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet-100上分别达到91.40%、68.56%和78.65%的top-1分类准确率。

Conclusion: CueCo通过整合对比学习和聚类，为无监督视觉表示学习开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We introduce Cluster Contrast (CueCo), a novel approach to unsupervised
visual representation learning that effectively combines the strengths of
contrastive learning and clustering methods. Inspired by recent advancements,
CueCo is designed to simultaneously scatter and align feature representations
within the feature space. This method utilizes two neural networks, a query and
a key, where the key network is updated through a slow-moving average of the
query outputs. CueCo employs a contrastive loss to push dissimilar features
apart, enhancing inter-class separation, and a clustering objective to pull
together features of the same cluster, promoting intra-class compactness. Our
method achieves 91.40% top-1 classification accuracy on CIFAR-10, 68.56% on
CIFAR-100, and 78.65% on ImageNet-100 using linear evaluation with a ResNet-18
backbone. By integrating contrastive learning with clustering, CueCo sets a new
direction for advancing unsupervised visual representation learning.

*Jiawei Xu,Kai Deng,Zexin Fan,Shenlong Wang,Jin Xie,Jian Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AD-GS是一种自监督框架，用于从单一日志中高质量自由视角渲染驾驶场景，无需手动标注，优于现有无标注方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前高质量方法依赖昂贵的手动标注，而自监督方法无法准确捕捉动态物体运动或正确分解场景，导致渲染伪影。

Method: AD-GS结合局部感知B样条曲线和全局感知三角函数，通过动态高斯和双向时间可见性掩模自动分割场景，并引入可见性推理和物理刚性正则化。

Result: AD-GS在无标注方法中表现显著优于现有技术，甚至可与依赖标注的方法竞争。

Conclusion: AD-GS提供了一种高效且高质量的自监督解决方案，适用于动态驾驶场景的建模与渲染。

Abstract: Modeling and rendering dynamic urban driving scenes is crucial for
self-driving simulation. Current high-quality methods typically rely on costly
manual object tracklet annotations, while self-supervised approaches fail to
capture dynamic object motions accurately and decompose scenes properly,
resulting in rendering artifacts. We introduce AD-GS, a novel self-supervised
framework for high-quality free-viewpoint rendering of driving scenes from a
single log. At its core is a novel learnable motion model that integrates
locality-aware B-spline curves with global-aware trigonometric functions,
enabling flexible yet precise dynamic object modeling. Rather than requiring
comprehensive semantic labeling, AD-GS automatically segments scenes into
objects and background with the simplified pseudo 2D segmentation, representing
objects using dynamic Gaussians and bidirectional temporal visibility masks.
Further, our model incorporates visibility reasoning and physically rigid
regularization to enhance robustness. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that
our annotation-free model significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art
annotation-free methods and is competitive with annotation-dependent
approaches.

Result: 通过定性和定量评估验证了方法的有效性，并通过消融实验分析了其影响。

Conclusion: 为人体运动捕捉和重建流程中的姿态先验提供了概率学基础。

Abstract: We introduce a principled, data-driven approach for modeling a neural prior
over human body poses using normalizing flows. Unlike heuristic or
low-expressivity alternatives, our method leverages RealNVP to learn a flexible
density over poses represented in the 6D rotation format. We address the
challenge of modeling distributions on the manifold of valid 6D rotations by
inverting the Gram-Schmidt process during training, enabling stable learning
while preserving downstream compatibility with rotation-based frameworks. Our
architecture and training pipeline are framework-agnostic and easily
reproducible. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the learned prior through
both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, and we analyze its impact via
ablation studies. This work provides a sound probabilistic foundation for
integrating pose priors into human motion capture and reconstruction pipelines.

Conclusion: 该方法可显著提升自动驾驶大规模数据集的可靠性和准确性。

Abstract: Training of autonomous driving systems requires extensive datasets with
precise annotations to attain robust performance. Human annotations suffer from
imperfections, and multiple iterations are often needed to produce high-quality
datasets. However, manually reviewing large datasets is laborious and
expensive. In this paper, we introduce AutoVDC (Automated Vision Data Cleaning)
framework and investigate the utilization of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to
automatically identify erroneous annotations in vision datasets, thereby
enabling users to eliminate these errors and enhance data quality. We validate
our approach using the KITTI and nuImages datasets, which contain object
detection benchmarks for autonomous driving. To test the effectiveness of
AutoVDC, we create dataset variants with intentionally injected erroneous
annotations and observe the error detection rate of our approach. Additionally,
we compare the detection rates using different VLMs and explore the impact of
VLM fine-tuning on our pipeline. The results demonstrate our method's high
performance in error detection and data cleaning experiments, indicating its
potential to significantly improve the reliability and accuracy of large-scale
production datasets in autonomous driving.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需依赖预训练模型的高性能细粒度图像识别（FGIR）方法，通过TGDA框架结合数据增强和知识蒸馏，实现了任务特定和硬件感知的架构设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统FGIR方法依赖预训练模型，限制了在资源受限环境中的适应性和任务特定架构的发展。

Method: 引入TGDA框架，结合数据感知增强和基于细粒度感知教师模型的弱监督，通过知识蒸馏实现高效训练。

Result: 在多个FGIR基准测试中，TGDA方法表现优于或匹配现有预训练模型，尤其在低分辨率设置下显著提升性能并减少资源需求。

Conclusion: TGDA为细粒度视觉系统提供了一种高效且适应性强的替代方案，减少了对预训练的依赖。

Abstract: Fine-grained image recognition (FGIR) aims to distinguish visually similar
sub-categories within a broader class, such as identifying bird species. While
most existing FGIR methods rely on backbones pretrained on large-scale datasets
like ImageNet, this dependence limits adaptability to resource-constrained
environments and hinders the development of task-specific architectures
tailored to the unique challenges of FGIR.
  In this work, we challenge the conventional reliance on pretrained models by
demonstrating that high-performance FGIR systems can be trained entirely from
scratch. We introduce a novel training framework, TGDA, that integrates
data-aware augmentation with weak supervision via a fine-grained-aware teacher
model, implemented through knowledge distillation. This framework unlocks the
design of task-specific and hardware-aware architectures, including LRNets for
low-resolution FGIR and ViTFS, a family of Vision Transformers optimized for
efficient inference.
  Extensive experiments across three FGIR benchmarks over diverse settings
involving low-resolution and high-resolution inputs show that our method
consistently matches or surpasses state-of-the-art pretrained counterparts. In
particular, in the low-resolution setting, LRNets trained with TGDA improve
accuracy by up to 23\% over prior methods while requiring up to 20.6x less
parameters, lower FLOPs, and significantly less training data. Similarly,
ViTFS-T can match the performance of a ViT B-16 pretrained on ImageNet-21k
while using 15.3x fewer trainable parameters and requiring orders of magnitudes
less data. These results highlight TGDA's potential as an adaptable alternative
to pretraining, paving the way for more efficient fine-grained vision systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuRe通过硬负采样和奖励模型优化解决CIR中的假阴性问题，提升检索相关性和用户满意度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CIR方法仅关注目标图像检索，忽略其他图像的相关性，导致假阴性和用户满意度下降。

Method: 提出QuRe方法，结合奖励模型目标和硬负采样策略，过滤假阴性。

Result: 在FashionIQ和CIRR数据集上达到SOTA性能，并在HP-FashionIQ数据集上与人偏好最一致。

Conclusion: QuRe有效提升CIR的检索质量和用户满意度。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) retrieves relevant images based on a reference
image and accompanying text describing desired modifications. However, existing
CIR methods only focus on retrieving the target image and disregard the
relevance of other images. This limitation arises because most methods
employing contrastive learning-which treats the target image as positive and
all other images in the batch as negatives-can inadvertently include false
negatives. This may result in retrieving irrelevant images, reducing user
satisfaction even when the target image is retrieved. To address this issue, we
propose Query-Relevant Retrieval through Hard Negative Sampling (QuRe), which
optimizes a reward model objective to reduce false negatives. Additionally, we
introduce a hard negative sampling strategy that selects images positioned
between two steep drops in relevance scores following the target image, to
effectively filter false negatives. In order to evaluate CIR models on their
alignment with human satisfaction, we create Human-Preference FashionIQ
(HP-FashionIQ), a new dataset that explicitly captures user preferences beyond
target retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QuRe achieves
state-of-the-art performance on FashionIQ and CIRR datasets while exhibiting
the strongest alignment with human preferences on the HP-FashionIQ dataset. The

Conclusion: 提出的双重集成框架有效提高了脑肿瘤分类的准确性，并通过消融研究验证了各组件的作用。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is widely recognized as the most reliable
tool for detecting tumors due to its capability to produce detailed images that
reveal their presence. However, the accuracy of diagnosis can be compromised
when human specialists evaluate these images. Factors such as fatigue, limited
expertise, and insufficient image detail can lead to errors. For example, small
tumors might go unnoticed, or overlap with healthy brain regions could result
in misidentification. To address these challenges and enhance diagnostic
precision, this study proposes a novel double ensembling framework, consisting
of ensembled pre-trained deep learning (DL) models for feature extraction and
ensembled fine-tuned hyperparameter machine learning (ML) models to efficiently
classify brain tumors. Specifically, our method includes extensive
preprocessing and augmentation, transfer learning concepts by utilizing various
pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks and vision transformer networks
to extract deep features from brain MRI, and fine-tune hyperparameters of ML
classifiers. Our experiments utilized three different publicly available Kaggle
MRI brain tumor datasets to evaluate the pre-trained DL feature extractor
models, ML classifiers, and the effectiveness of an ensemble of deep features
along with an ensemble of ML classifiers for brain tumor classification. Our
results indicate that the proposed feature fusion and classifier fusion improve
upon the state of the art, with hyperparameter fine-tuning providing a
significant enhancement over the ensemble method. Additionally, we present an
ablation study to illustrate how each component contributes to accurate brain
tumor classification.

Result: 在多个数据集上，RODS显著提高了采样保真度和鲁棒性，检测并修正了大量幻觉样本。

Conclusion: RODS在不增加额外训练成本的情况下有效减少了扩散模型中的幻觉现象。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in generative
modeling, yet their sampling procedures remain vulnerable to hallucinations,
often stemming from inaccuracies in score approximation. In this work, we
reinterpret diffusion sampling through the lens of optimization and introduce
RODS (Robust Optimization-inspired Diffusion Sampler), a novel method that
detects and corrects high-risk sampling steps using geometric cues from the
loss landscape. RODS enforces smoother sampling trajectories and adaptively
adjusts perturbations, reducing hallucinations without retraining and at
minimal additional inference cost. Experiments on AFHQv2, FFHQ, and 11k-hands
demonstrate that RODS improves both sampling fidelity and robustness, detecting
over 70% of hallucinated samples and correcting more than 25%, all while
avoiding the introduction of new artifacts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型未能捕捉放射科医生在图像解读中每个注视点背后的意图，而理解这种意图对提高诊断效率至关重要。

Method: 采用基于Transformer的架构，处理眼动数据的时空维度，将细粒度注视特征转化为粗粒度的诊断意图表示。

Result: RadGazeIntent在三个意图标记数据集（RadSeq、RadExplore、RadHybrid）上均优于基线方法，能准确预测放射科医生的诊断目标。

Conclusion: RadGazeIntent成功建模了放射科医生的意图驱动行为，为医学图像解读提供了新的分析工具。

Abstract: Radiologists rely on eye movements to navigate and interpret medical images.
A trained radiologist possesses knowledge about the potential diseases that may
be present in the images and, when searching, follows a mental checklist to
locate them using their gaze. This is a key observation, yet existing models
fail to capture the underlying intent behind each fixation. In this paper, we
introduce a deep learning-based approach, RadGazeIntent, designed to model this
behavior: having an intention to find something and actively searching for it.
Our transformer-based architecture processes both the temporal and spatial
dimensions of gaze data, transforming fine-grained fixation features into
coarse, meaningful representations of diagnostic intent to interpret
radiologists' goals. To capture the nuances of radiologists' varied
intention-driven behaviors, we process existing medical eye-tracking datasets
to create three intention-labeled subsets: RadSeq (Systematic Sequential
Search), RadExplore (Uncertainty-driven Exploration), and RadHybrid (Hybrid
Pattern). Experimental results demonstrate RadGazeIntent's ability to predict
which findings radiologists are examining at specific moments, outperforming
baseline methods across all intention-labeled datasets.

Method: 扩展了VQA数据集为DD-VQA+，并提出了MGFFD-VLM框架，结合属性驱动的混合LoRA策略和多粒度提示学习。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在文本伪造判断和分析中优于现有方法，准确率更高。

Conclusion: MGFFD-VLM框架通过改进属性和训练策略，显著提升了深度伪造检测的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Recent studies have utilized visual large language models (VLMs) to answer
not only "Is this face a forgery?" but also "Why is the face a forgery?" These
studies introduced forgery-related attributes, such as forgery location and
type, to construct deepfake VQA datasets and train VLMs, achieving high
accuracy while providing human-understandable explanatory text descriptions.
However, these methods still have limitations. For example, they do not fully
leverage face quality-related attributes, which are often abnormal in forged
faces, and they lack effective training strategies for forgery-aware VLMs. In
this paper, we extend the VQA dataset to create DD-VQA+, which features a
richer set of attributes and a more diverse range of samples. Furthermore, we
introduce a novel forgery detection framework, MGFFD-VLM, which integrates an
Attribute-Driven Hybrid LoRA Strategy to enhance the capabilities of Visual
Large Language Models (VLMs). Additionally, our framework incorporates
Multi-Granularity Prompt Learning and a Forgery-Aware Training Strategy. By
transforming classification and forgery segmentation results into prompts, our
method not only improves forgery classification but also enhances
interpretability. To further boost detection performance, we design multiple
forgery-related auxiliary losses. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach surpasses existing methods in both text-based forgery judgment and
analysis, achieving superior accuracy.

Conclusion: 生成式模型为医学图像短语定位提供了更有效和可解释的解决方案，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Phrase grounding, i.e., mapping natural language phrases to specific image
regions, holds significant potential for disease localization in medical
imaging through clinical reports. While current state-of-the-art methods rely
on discriminative, self-supervised contrastive models, we demonstrate that
generative text-to-image diffusion models, leveraging cross-attention maps, can
achieve superior zero-shot phrase grounding performance. Contrary to prior
assumptions, we show that fine-tuning diffusion models with a frozen,
domain-specific language model, such as CXR-BERT, substantially outperforms
domain-agnostic counterparts. This setup achieves remarkable improvements, with
mIoU scores doubling those of current discriminative methods. These findings
highlight the underexplored potential of generative models for phrase grounding
tasks. To further enhance performance, we introduce Bimodal Bias Merging (BBM),
a novel post-processing technique that aligns text and image biases to identify
regions of high certainty. BBM refines cross-attention maps, achieving even
greater localization accuracy. Our results establish generative approaches as a
more effective paradigm for phrase grounding in the medical imaging domain,
paving the way for more robust and interpretable applications in clinical
practice. The source code and model weights are available at

Conclusion: 研究为体操领域自动化工具的开发提供了初步基础。

Abstract: Calisthenics is a fast-growing bodyweight discipline that consists of
different categories, one of which is focused on skills. Skills in calisthenics
encompass both static and dynamic elements performed by athletes. The
evaluation of static skills is based on their difficulty level and the duration
of the hold. Automated tools able to recognize isometric skills from a video by
segmenting them to estimate their duration would be desirable to assist
athletes in their training and judges during competitions. Although the video
understanding literature on action recognition through body pose analysis is
rich, no previous work has specifically addressed the problem of calisthenics
skill temporal video segmentation. This study aims to provide an initial step
towards the implementation of automated tools within the field of Calisthenics.
To advance knowledge in this context, we propose a dataset of video footage of
static calisthenics skills performed by athletes. Each video is annotated with
a temporal segmentation which determines the extent of each skill. We hence
report the results of a baseline approach to address the problem of skill
temporal segmentation on the proposed dataset. The results highlight the
feasibility of the proposed problem, while there is still room for improvement.

Result: FADE在概念移除和图像质量上优于现有方法，性能提升5-10%。

Conclusion: FADE为安全公平的生成建模设定了新标准，无需从头训练即可移除指定概念。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable image generation capabilities,
but also pose risks in privacy and fairness by memorizing sensitive concepts or
perpetuating biases. We propose a novel \textbf{concept erasure} method for
text-to-image diffusion models, designed to remove specified concepts (e.g., a
private individual or a harmful stereotype) from the model's generative
repertoire. Our method, termed \textbf{FADE} (Fair Adversarial Diffusion
Erasure), combines a trajectory-aware fine-tuning strategy with an adversarial
objective to ensure the concept is reliably removed while preserving overall
model fidelity. Theoretically, we prove a formal guarantee that our approach
minimizes the mutual information between the erased concept and the model's
outputs, ensuring privacy and fairness. Empirically, we evaluate FADE on Stable
Diffusion and FLUX, using benchmarks from prior work (e.g., object, celebrity,
explicit content, and style erasure tasks from MACE). FADE achieves
state-of-the-art concept removal performance, surpassing recent baselines like
ESD, UCE, MACE, and ANT in terms of removal efficacy and image quality.
Notably, FADE improves the harmonic mean of concept removal and fidelity by
5--10\% over the best prior method. We also conduct an ablation study to
validate each component of FADE, confirming that our adversarial and
trajectory-preserving objectives each contribute to its superior performance.
Our work sets a new standard for safe and fair generative modeling by
unlearning specified concepts without retraining from scratch.

Abstract: Calisthenics skill classification is the computer vision task of inferring
the skill performed by an athlete from images, enabling automatic performance
assessment and personalized analytics. Traditional methods for calisthenics
skill recognition are based on pose estimation methods to determine the
position of skeletal data from images, which is later fed to a classification
algorithm to infer the performed skill. Despite the progress in human pose
estimation algorithms, they still involve high computational costs, long
inference times, and complex setups, which limit the applicability of such
approaches in real-time applications or mobile devices. This work proposes a
direct approach to calisthenics skill recognition, which leverages depth
estimation and athlete patch retrieval to avoid the computationally expensive
human pose estimation module. Using Depth Anything V2 for depth estimation and
YOLOv10 for athlete localization, we segment the subject from the background
rather than relying on traditional pose estimation techniques. This strategy
increases efficiency, reduces inference time, and improves classification
accuracy. Our approach significantly outperforms skeleton-based methods,
achieving 38.3x faster inference with RGB image patches and improved
classification accuracy with depth patches (0.837 vs. 0.815). Beyond these
performance gains, the modular design of our pipeline allows for flexible
replacement of components, enabling future enhancements and adaptation to
real-world applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces KeyDiff3D, a framework for unsupervised monocular 3D
keypoints estimation that accurately predicts 3D keypoints from a single image.
While previous methods rely on manual annotations or calibrated multi-view
images, both of which are expensive to collect, our method enables monocular 3D
keypoints estimation using only a collection of single-view images. To achieve
this, we leverage powerful geometric priors embedded in a pretrained multi-view
diffusion model. In our framework, this model generates multi-view images from
a single image, serving as a supervision signal to provide 3D geometric cues to
our model. We also use the diffusion model as a powerful 2D multi-view feature
extractor and construct 3D feature volumes from its intermediate
representations. This transforms implicit 3D priors learned by the diffusion
model into explicit 3D features. Beyond accurate keypoints estimation, we
further introduce a pipeline that enables manipulation of 3D objects generated
by the diffusion model. Experimental results on diverse aspects and datasets,
including Human3.6M, Stanford Dogs, and several in-the-wild and out-of-domain
datasets, highlight the effectiveness of our method in terms of accuracy,
generalization, and its ability to enable manipulation of 3D objects generated
by the diffusion model from a single image.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了通道知识蒸馏（CWD）和掩码生成蒸馏（MGD）方法，用于提升轻量级模型在杂草检测中的性能，实验表明两种方法均能显著提高模型准确率，且不影响模型复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 杂草检测是精准农业的关键，但资源受限平台上部署高精度模型仍具挑战性，尤其是区分视觉相似的杂草种类。

Method: 使用YOLO11x作为教师模型，YOLO11n作为学生模型，通过CWD和MGD方法进行知识蒸馏。

Result: CWD和MGD分别提升mAP50达2.5%和1.9%，并在嵌入式设备上验证了实时部署的可行性。

Conclusion: CWD和MGD是提升深度学习杂草检测准确性的高效实用方法。

Abstract: Weed detection is a critical component of precision agriculture, facilitating
targeted herbicide application and reducing environmental impact. However,
deploying accurate object detection models on resource-limited platforms
remains challenging, particularly when differentiating visually similar weed
species commonly encountered in plant phenotyping applications. In this work,
we investigate Channel-wise Knowledge Distillation (CWD) and Masked Generative
Distillation (MGD) to enhance the performance of lightweight models for
real-time smart spraying systems. Utilizing YOLO11x as the teacher model and
YOLO11n as both reference and student, both CWD and MGD effectively transfer
knowledge from the teacher to the student model. Our experiments, conducted on
a real-world dataset comprising sugar beet crops and four weed types (Cirsium,
Convolvulus, Fallopia, and Echinochloa), consistently show increased AP50
across all classes. The distilled CWD student model achieves a notable
improvement of 2.5% and MGD achieves 1.9% in mAP50 over the baseline without
increasing model complexity. Additionally, we validate real-time deployment
feasibility by evaluating the student YOLO11n model on Jetson Orin Nano and
Raspberry Pi 5 embedded devices, performing five independent runs to evaluate
performance stability across random seeds. These findings confirm CWD and MGD
as an effective, efficient, and practical approach for improving deep
learning-based weed detection accuracy in precision agriculture and plant
phenotyping scenarios.

Motivation: 解决医学图像标注成本高的问题，利用文本信息增强视觉语义理解，填补3D医学影像任务中文本数据应用的空白。

Method: 框架包含三个模块：文本增强多平面表示（TMR）、类别感知语义对齐（CSA）和动态认知增强（DCA）。TMR通过平面映射实现文本-视觉交互，CSA进行跨模态语义对齐，DCA减少标记与未标记数据的分布差异。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验表明，模型能有效利用文本信息增强视觉特征，性能优于其他方法。

Conclusion: Text-SemiSeg通过文本驱动的多平面交互，显著提升了半监督医学图像分割的效果，为相关任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Semi-supervised medical image segmentation is a crucial technique for
alleviating the high cost of data annotation. When labeled data is limited,
textual information can provide additional context to enhance visual semantic
understanding. However, research exploring the use of textual data to enhance
visual semantic embeddings in 3D medical imaging tasks remains scarce. In this
paper, we propose a novel text-driven multiplanar visual interaction framework
for semi-supervised medical image segmentation (termed Text-SemiSeg), which
consists of three main modules: Text-enhanced Multiplanar Representation (TMR),
Category-aware Semantic Alignment (CSA), and Dynamic Cognitive Augmentation
(DCA). Specifically, TMR facilitates text-visual interaction through planar
mapping, thereby enhancing the category awareness of visual features. CSA
performs cross-modal semantic alignment between the text features with
introduced learnable variables and the intermediate layer of visual features.
DCA reduces the distribution discrepancy between labeled and unlabeled data
through their interaction, thus improving the model's robustness. Finally,
experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our model effectively
enhances visual features with textual information and outperforms other
methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/taozh2017/Text-SemiSeg.

Conclusion: 该工作为开发更高效和鲁棒的目标检测架构提供了基准和实验设置。

Abstract: Realistic human surveillance datasets are crucial for training and evaluating
computer vision models under real-world conditions, facilitating the
development of robust algorithms for human and human-interacting object
detection in complex environments. These datasets need to offer diverse and
challenging data to enable a comprehensive assessment of model performance and
the creation of more reliable surveillance systems for public safety. To this
end, we present two visual object detection benchmarks named OD-VIRAT Large and
OD-VIRAT Tiny, aiming at advancing visual understanding tasks in surveillance
imagery. The video sequences in both benchmarks cover 10 different scenes of
human surveillance recorded from significant height and distance. The proposed
benchmarks offer rich annotations of bounding boxes and categories, where
OD-VIRAT Large has 8.7 million annotated instances in 599,996 images and
OD-VIRAT Tiny has 288,901 annotated instances in 19,860 images. This work also
focuses on benchmarking state-of-the-art object detection architectures,
including RETMDET, YOLOX, RetinaNet, DETR, and Deformable-DETR on this object
detection-specific variant of VIRAT dataset. To the best of our knowledge, it
is the first work to examine the performance of these recently published
state-of-the-art object detection architectures on realistic surveillance
imagery under challenging conditions such as complex backgrounds, occluded
objects, and small-scale objects. The proposed benchmarking and experimental
settings will help in providing insights concerning the performance of selected
object detection models and set the base for developing more efficient and
robust object detection architectures.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的损失函数InterpIoU，通过插值框解决IoU在非重叠情况下的不可微问题，并避免边界框放大的副作用。进一步提出Dynamic InterpIoU动态调整插值系数，显著提升了小物体检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有IoU损失函数依赖手工几何惩罚项，对小物体检测效果不佳且易导致边界框放大问题。

Method: 提出InterpIoU，利用插值框与目标的IoU替代手工惩罚项；进一步提出Dynamic InterpIoU动态调整插值系数。

Result: 在COCO、VisDrone和PASCAL VOC数据集上表现优于现有方法，尤其在小物体检测中提升显著。

Conclusion: InterpIoU和Dynamic InterpIoU有效解决了现有IoU损失函数的局限性，提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Bounding box regression (BBR) is fundamental to object detection, where the
regression loss is crucial for accurate localization. Existing IoU-based losses
often incorporate handcrafted geometric penalties to address IoU's
non-differentiability in non-overlapping cases and enhance BBR performance.
However, these penalties are sensitive to box shape, size, and distribution,
often leading to suboptimal optimization for small objects and undesired
behaviors such as bounding box enlargement due to misalignment with the IoU
objective. To address these limitations, we propose InterpIoU, a novel loss
function that replaces handcrafted geometric penalties with a term based on the
IoU between interpolated boxes and the target. By using interpolated boxes to
bridge the gap between predictions and ground truth, InterpIoU provides
meaningful gradients in non-overlapping cases and inherently avoids the box
enlargement issue caused by misaligned penalties. Simulation results further
show that IoU itself serves as an ideal regression target, while existing
geometric penalties are both unnecessary and suboptimal. Building on InterpIoU,
we introduce Dynamic InterpIoU, which dynamically adjusts interpolation
coefficients based on IoU values, enhancing adaptability to scenarios with
diverse object distributions. Experiments on COCO, VisDrone, and PASCAL VOC
show that our methods consistently outperform state-of-the-art IoU-based losses
across various detection frameworks, with particularly notable improvements in
small object detection, confirming their effectiveness.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级的视频识别网络DVFL-Net，通过知识蒸馏和时空特征调制，在保持高性能的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Transformer在视频识别中表现出色，但其计算成本高昂，限制了实际应用。因此，需要一种高效的轻量级解决方案。

Method: DVFL-Net利用知识蒸馏和时空焦点调制技术，从大型预训练教师模型（Video-FocalNet Base）中提取知识，并转移到紧凑的学生模型（VFL-Net）。

Result: 在多个基准数据集（如UCF101、Kinetics-400等）上，DVFL-Net在性能和效率之间取得了最佳平衡，表现出低内存占用、低计算量和强准确性。

Conclusion: DVFL-Net是一种适用于实时人类动作识别的高效解决方案，为轻量级视频识别提供了实用方法。

Abstract: The landscape of video recognition has evolved significantly, shifting from
traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to Transformer-based
architectures for improved accuracy. While 3D CNNs have been effective at
capturing spatiotemporal dynamics, recent Transformer models leverage
self-attention to model long-range spatial and temporal dependencies. Despite
achieving state-of-the-art performance on major benchmarks, Transformers remain
computationally expensive, particularly with dense video data. To address this,
we propose a lightweight Video Focal Modulation Network, DVFL-Net, which
distills spatiotemporal knowledge from a large pre-trained teacher into a
compact nano student model, enabling efficient on-device deployment. DVFL-Net
utilizes knowledge distillation and spatial-temporal feature modulation to
significantly reduce computation while preserving high recognition performance.
We employ forward Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence alongside spatio-temporal
focal modulation to effectively transfer both local and global context from the
Video-FocalNet Base (teacher) to the proposed VFL-Net (student). We evaluate
DVFL-Net on UCF50, UCF101, HMDB51, SSV2, and Kinetics-400, benchmarking it
against recent state-of-the-art methods in Human Action Recognition (HAR).
Additionally, we conduct a detailed ablation study analyzing the impact of
forward KL divergence. The results confirm the superiority of DVFL-Net in
achieving an optimal balance between performance and efficiency, demonstrating
lower memory usage, reduced GFLOPs, and strong accuracy, making it a practical
solution for real-time HAR applications.

Abstract: Accurate pedestrian intention estimation is crucial for the safe navigation
of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and hence attracts a lot of research attention.
However, current models often fail to adequately consider dynamic traffic
signals and contextual scene information, which are critical for real-world
applications. This paper presents a Traffic-Aware Spatio-Temporal Graph
Convolutional Network (TA-STGCN) that integrates traffic signs and their states
(Red, Yellow, Green) into pedestrian intention prediction. Our approach
introduces the integration of dynamic traffic signal states and bounding box
size as key features, allowing the model to capture both spatial and temporal
dependencies in complex urban environments. The model surpasses existing
methods in accuracy. Specifically, TA-STGCN achieves a 4.75% higher accuracy
compared to the baseline model on the PIE dataset, demonstrating its
effectiveness in improving pedestrian intention prediction.

Motivation: 针对文本密集图像的VQA任务，需要细粒度提取文本信息，DAM的区域级描述能力可能对此有益。

Method: 提出DAM-QA框架，整合DAM的区域感知能力，通过多区域视图聚合答案，优化文本相关证据的识别。

Result: 在六个VQA基准测试中表现优于基线DAM，DocVQA提升7+分，参数更少且性能接近通用视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: DAM-QA展示了区域感知模型在文本密集VQA任务中的潜力，结合高效使用策略可缩小与通用模型的差距。

Abstract: Recent progress has been made in region-aware vision-language modeling,
particularly with the emergence of the Describe Anything Model (DAM). DAM is
capable of generating detailed descriptions of any specific image areas or
objects without the need for additional localized image-text alignment
supervision. We hypothesize that such region-level descriptive capability is
beneficial for the task of Visual Question Answering (VQA), especially in
challenging scenarios involving images with dense text. In such settings, the
fine-grained extraction of textual information is crucial to producing correct
answers. Motivated by this, we introduce DAM-QA, a framework with a tailored
evaluation protocol, developed to investigate and harness the region-aware
capabilities from DAM for the text-rich VQA problem that requires reasoning
over text-based information within images. DAM-QA incorporates a mechanism that
aggregates answers from multiple regional views of image content, enabling more
effective identification of evidence that may be tied to text-related elements.
Experiments on six VQA benchmarks show that our approach consistently
outperforms the baseline DAM, with a notable 7+ point gain on DocVQA. DAM-QA
also achieves the best overall performance among region-aware models with fewer
parameters, significantly narrowing the gap with strong generalist VLMs. These
results highlight the potential of DAM-like models for text-rich and broader
VQA tasks when paired with efficient usage and integration strategies. Our code
is publicly available at https://github.com/Linvyl/DAM-QA.git.

models, such as Depth Anything V2, to estimate object distances. A comparative
analysis of these models provides valuable insights into their accuracy,
efficiency, and robustness in real-world conditions. The system is evaluated in

Result: 实验显示SENTINEL将幻觉减少90%以上，并在幻觉和通用能力基准上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SENTINEL通过早期干预和偏好学习有效解决幻觉问题，具有优越性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have revolutionized cross-modal
understanding but continue to struggle with hallucinations - fabricated content
contradicting visual inputs. Existing hallucination mitigation methods either
incur prohibitive computational costs or introduce distribution mismatches
between training data and model outputs. We identify a critical insight:
hallucinations predominantly emerge at the early stages of text generation and
propagate through subsequent outputs. To address this, we propose **SENTINEL**
(**S**entence-level **E**arly i**N**tervention **T**hrough **IN**-domain
pr**E**ference **L**earning), a framework that eliminates dependency on human
annotations. Specifically, we first bootstrap high-quality in-domain preference
pairs by iteratively sampling model outputs, validating object existence
through cross-checking with two open-vocabulary detectors, and classifying
sentences into hallucinated/non-hallucinated categories. Subsequently, we use
context-coherent positive samples and hallucinated negative samples to build
context-aware preference data iteratively. Finally, we train models using a
context-aware preference loss (C-DPO) that emphasizes discriminative learning
at the sentence level where hallucinations initially manifest. Experimental
results show that SENTINEL can reduce hallucinations by over 90\% compared to
the original model and outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method on both
hallucination benchmarks and general capabilities benchmarks, demonstrating its
superiority and generalization ability. The models, datasets, and code are

Abstract: We present SpatialTrackerV2, a feed-forward 3D point tracking method for
monocular videos. Going beyond modular pipelines built on off-the-shelf
components for 3D tracking, our approach unifies the intrinsic connections
between point tracking, monocular depth, and camera pose estimation into a

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) emerged as a promising tool for mechanistic
interpretability of transformer-based foundation models. Very recently, SAEs
were also adopted for the visual domain, enabling the discovery of visual
concepts and their patch-wise attribution to tokens in the transformer model.
While a growing number of foundation models emerged for medical imaging, tools
for explaining their inferences are still lacking. In this work, we show the
applicability of SAEs for hematology. We propose CytoSAE, a sparse autoencoder
which is trained on over 40,000 peripheral blood single-cell images. CytoSAE
generalizes to diverse and out-of-domain datasets, including bone marrow
cytology, where it identifies morphologically relevant concepts which we
validated with medical experts. Furthermore, we demonstrate scenarios in which
CytoSAE can generate patient-specific and disease-specific concepts, enabling
the detection of pathognomonic cells and localized cellular abnormalities at
the patch level. We quantified the effect of concepts on a patient-level AML
subtype classification task and show that CytoSAE concepts reach performance
comparable to the state-of-the-art, while offering explainability on the
sub-cellular level. Source code and model weights are available at

Abstract: 3D modeling is moving from virtual to physical. Existing 3D generation
primarily emphasizes geometries and textures while neglecting physical-grounded
modeling. Consequently, despite the rapid development of 3D generative models,
the synthesized 3D assets often overlook rich and important physical
properties, hampering their real-world application in physical domains like
simulation and embodied AI. As an initial attempt to address this challenge, we
propose \textbf{PhysX}, an end-to-end paradigm for physical-grounded 3D asset
generation. 1) To bridge the critical gap in physics-annotated 3D datasets, we
present PhysXNet - the first physics-grounded 3D dataset systematically
annotated across five foundational dimensions: absolute scale, material,
affordance, kinematics, and function description. In particular, we devise a
scalable human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline based on vision-language models,
which enables efficient creation of physics-first assets from raw 3D assets.2)
Furthermore, we propose \textbf{PhysXGen}, a feed-forward framework for
physics-grounded image-to-3D asset generation, injecting physical knowledge
into the pre-trained 3D structural space. Specifically, PhysXGen employs a
dual-branch architecture to explicitly model the latent correlations between 3D
structures and physical properties, thereby producing 3D assets with plausible
physical predictions while preserving the native geometry quality. Extensive
experiments validate the superior performance and promising generalization
capability of our framework. All the code, data, and models will be released to
facilitate future research in generative physical AI.

significant variations in evaluation consistency ({\alpha} ranging from 1.00 to
0.35) and five distinct evaluation patterns. Additionally, evaluation variance
across stories differed by up to 4.5-fold, with TF-IDF analysis confirming
distinctive evaluation vocabularies for each model. Our seven-session
within-day protocol using an original Science Fiction corpus strategically
minimizes external biases, allowing us to observe implicit value systems shaped
by RLHF and their influence on literary judgment. These findings suggest that
LLMs may possess individual evaluation characteristics similar to human
critical schools, rather than functioning as neutral benchmarkers.

*Varun Srivastava,Fan Lei,Srija Mukhopadhyay,Vivek Gupta,Ross Maciejewski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MapIQ是一个新的基准数据集，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在地图视觉问答（Map-VQA）中的表现，涵盖多种地图类型和主题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Map-VQA研究主要局限于等值区域图，限制了主题类别和视觉分析任务的多样性。

Method: 引入MapIQ数据集，包含14,706个问答对，覆盖三种地图类型和六个主题，评估多种MLLMs的性能。

Result: 通过六项视觉分析任务和地图设计变化实验，比较MLLMs的性能及其对地理知识的依赖。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了MLLMs的鲁棒性和敏感性，为提升Map-VQA性能提供了潜在方向。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have driven
researchers to explore how well these models read data visualizations, e.g.,
bar charts, scatter plots. More recently, attention has shifted to visual
question answering with maps (Map-VQA). However, Map-VQA research has primarily
focused on choropleth maps, which cover only a limited range of thematic
categories and visual analytical tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce
MapIQ, a benchmark dataset comprising 14,706 question-answer pairs across three
map types: choropleth maps, cartograms, and proportional symbol maps spanning
topics from six distinct themes (e.g., housing, crime). We evaluate multiple
MLLMs using six visual analytical tasks, comparing their performance against
one another and a human baseline. An additional experiment examining the impact
of map design changes (e.g., altered color schemes, modified legend designs,
and removal of map elements) provides insights into the robustness and
sensitivity of MLLMs, their reliance on internal geographic knowledge, and
potential avenues for improving Map-VQA performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决波斯语情感分析中数据稀缺的问题，同时利用高资源语言的知识。

Method: 使用XLM-RoBERTa、mDeBERTa和DistilBERT三种预训练模型，通过少样本和增量学习在小样本波斯语数据上进行微调。

Result: mDeBERTa和XLM-RoBERTa在波斯语情感分析中达到96%的准确率。

Conclusion: 结合少样本学习、增量学习和多语言预训练模型是有效的跨语言情感分析方法。

Abstract: This research examines cross-lingual sentiment analysis using few-shot
learning and incremental learning methods in Persian. The main objective is to
develop a model capable of performing sentiment analysis in Persian using
limited data, while getting prior knowledge from high-resource languages. To
achieve this, three pre-trained multilingual models (XLM-RoBERTa, mDeBERTa, and
DistilBERT) were employed, which were fine-tuned using few-shot and incremental
learning approaches on small samples of Persian data from diverse sources,
including X, Instagram, Digikala, Snappfood, and Taaghche. This variety enabled
the models to learn from a broad range of contexts. Experimental results show
that the mDeBERTa and XLM-RoBERTa achieved high performances, reaching 96%
accuracy on Persian sentiment analysis. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of combining few-shot learning and incremental learning with
multilingual pre-trained models.

Motivation: 多模态学习中，单模态和配对模态特征的分离学习可以更全面地利用模态信息，适应不同下游任务。

Method: 提出PgM框架，包含模态分割器、单模态学习器、配对模态学习器和解码器，分别处理单模态和配对模态特征。

Result: 在四个多模态任务中验证了PgM的有效性，并展示了其可迁移性和特征分布的可视化结果。

Conclusion: PgM通过分离学习单模态和配对模态特征，提升了多模态学习的灵活性和性能。

Abstract: Multimodal learning benefits from multiple modal information, and each
learned modal representations can be divided into uni-modal that can be learned
from uni-modal training and paired-modal features that can be learned from
cross-modal interaction. Building on this perspective, we propose a
partitioner-guided modal learning framework, PgM, which consists of the modal
partitioner, uni-modal learner, paired-modal learner, and uni-paired modal
decoder. Modal partitioner segments the learned modal representation into
uni-modal and paired-modal features. Modal learner incorporates two dedicated
components for uni-modal and paired-modal learning. Uni-paired modal decoder
reconstructs modal representation based on uni-modal and paired-modal features.
PgM offers three key benefits: 1) thorough learning of uni-modal and
paired-modal features, 2) flexible distribution adjustment for uni-modal and
paired-modal representations to suit diverse downstream tasks, and 3) different
learning rates across modalities and partitions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of PgM across four multimodal tasks and further
highlight its transferability to existing models. Additionally, we visualize
the distribution of uni-modal and paired-modal features across modalities and
tasks, offering insights into their respective contributions.

Abstract: We present ExpliCIT-QA, a system that extends our previous MRT approach for
tabular question answering into a multimodal pipeline capable of handling
complex table images and providing explainable answers. ExpliCIT-QA follows a
modular design, consisting of: (1) Multimodal Table Understanding, which uses a
Chain-of-Thought approach to extract and transform content from table images;
(2) Language-based Reasoning, where a step-by-step explanation in natural
language is generated to solve the problem; (3) Automatic Code Generation,
where Python/Pandas scripts are created based on the reasoning steps, with
feedback for handling errors; (4) Code Execution to compute the final answer;
and (5) Natural Language Explanation that describes how the answer was
computed. The system is built for transparency and auditability: all
intermediate outputs, parsed tables, reasoning steps, generated code, and final
answers are available for inspection. This strategy works towards closing the
explainability gap in end-to-end TableVQA systems. We evaluated ExpliCIT-QA on
the TableVQA-Bench benchmark, comparing it with existing baselines. We
demonstrated improvements in interpretability and transparency, which open the
door for applications in sensitive domains like finance and healthcare where
auditing results are critical.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合有限语法分析和LLM的方法（CRABS），用于理解Python笔记本中的信息流和执行依赖关系，解决了LLM在长上下文和幻觉问题上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于重新执行笔记本以理解其信息流和操作不切实际，且现有LLM在处理复杂笔记本时存在幻觉和长上下文问题，因此需要一种更可靠的方法。

Method: 采用浅层语法分析和AST解析来捕获笔记本的上下界估计，再通过LLM的零样本学习解决剩余歧义，生成信息流图和执行依赖图。

Result: 在50个Kaggle笔记本上测试，LLM解决了98%的歧义，CRABS在信息流和执行依赖识别上的F1分数分别达到98%和99%。

Conclusion: CRABS方法有效结合了语法分析和LLM的优势，显著提升了笔记本理解的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Recognizing the information flows and operations comprising data science and
machine learning Python notebooks is critical for evaluating, reusing, and
adapting notebooks for new tasks. Investigating a notebook via re-execution
often is impractical due to the challenges of resolving data and software
dependencies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) pre-trained on large codebases
have demonstrated effectiveness in understanding code without running it, we
observe that they fail to understand some realistic notebooks due to
hallucinations and long-context challenges. To address these issues, we propose
a notebook understanding task yielding an information flow graph and
corresponding cell execution dependency graph for a notebook, and demonstrate
the effectiveness of a pincer strategy that uses limited syntactic analysis to
assist full comprehension of the notebook using an LLM. Our Capture and Resolve
Assisted Bounding Strategy (CRABS) employs shallow syntactic parsing and
analysis of the abstract syntax tree (AST) to capture the correct
interpretation of a notebook between lower and upper estimates of the
inter-cell I/O sets, then uses an LLM to resolve remaining ambiguities via
cell-by-cell zero-shot learning, thereby identifying the true data inputs and
outputs of each cell. We evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach using an annotated dataset of 50 representative, highly up-voted
Kaggle notebooks that together represent 3454 actual cell inputs and outputs.
The LLM correctly resolves 1397 of 1425 (98%) ambiguities left by analyzing the
syntactic structure of these notebooks. Across 50 notebooks, CRABS achieves
average F1 scores of 98% identifying cell-to-cell information flows and 99%
identifying transitive cell execution dependencies.

Conclusion: 结合情感特征的Transformer模型在多语言主观性检测任务中表现优异，尤其在零样本设置下具有良好泛化能力。

Abstract: This paper presents AI Wizards' participation in the CLEF 2025 CheckThat! Lab
Task 1: Subjectivity Detection in News Articles, classifying sentences as
subjective/objective in monolingual, multilingual, and zero-shot settings.
Training/development datasets were provided for Arabic, German, English,
Italian, and Bulgarian; final evaluation included additional unseen languages
(e.g., Greek, Romanian, Polish, Ukrainian) to assess generalization. Our
primary strategy enhanced transformer-based classifiers by integrating
sentiment scores, derived from an auxiliary model, with sentence
representations, aiming to improve upon standard fine-tuning. We explored this
sentiment-augmented architecture with mDeBERTaV3-base, ModernBERT-base
(English), and Llama3.2-1B. To address class imbalance, prevalent across
languages, we employed decision threshold calibration optimized on the
development set. Our experiments show sentiment feature integration
significantly boosts performance, especially subjective F1 score. This
framework led to high rankings, notably 1st for Greek (Macro F1 = 0.51).

Motivation: 探讨LLMs中注意力头在事实与反事实信息竞争中的作用，以解决现有研究中的不一致结论。

Method: 复现并整合Ortu等人、Yu、Merullo和Pavlick及McDougall等人的研究，使用机制解释工具分析注意力头强度与事实输出比例的关系，评估其抑制机制假说，并研究注意力模式的领域特异性。

Result: 注意力头通过通用复制抑制促进事实输出，而非选择性反事实抑制；其行为具有领域依赖性，较大模型表现出更专业和类别敏感的模式。

Conclusion: 注意力头在事实与反事实信息竞争中扮演关键角色，其机制和行为受模型规模和领域影响。

Abstract: This paper presents a reproducibility study examining how Large Language
Models (LLMs) manage competing factual and counterfactual information, focusing
on the role of attention heads in this process. We attempt to reproduce and
reconcile findings from three recent studies by Ortu et al., Yu, Merullo, and
Pavlick and McDougall et al. that investigate the competition between
model-learned facts and contradictory context information through Mechanistic
Interpretability tools. Our study specifically examines the relationship
between attention head strength and factual output ratios, evaluates competing
hypotheses about attention heads' suppression mechanisms, and investigates the
domain specificity of these attention patterns. Our findings suggest that
attention heads promoting factual output do so via general copy suppression
rather than selective counterfactual suppression, as strengthening them can
also inhibit correct facts. Additionally, we show that attention head behavior
is domain-dependent, with larger models exhibiting more specialized and
category-sensitive patterns.

Result: 基线模型在语言识别任务中表现与最先进模型相当。

Conclusion: 论文为印度语言识别提供了新数据集和基线模型，推动了该领域的研究。

Abstract: The language identification task is a crucial fundamental step in NLP. Often
it serves as a pre-processing step for widely used NLP applications such as
multilingual machine translation, information retrieval, question and
answering, and text summarization. The core challenge of language
identification lies in distinguishing languages in noisy, short, and code-mixed
environments. This becomes even harder in case of diverse Indian languages that
exhibit lexical and phonetic similarities, but have distinct differences. Many
Indian languages share the same script making the task even more challenging.
In this paper, we release a dataset of 230K sentences consisting of English and
all 22 official Indian languages labeled with their language identifiers where
data in most languages are newly created. We also develop and release robust
baseline models using state-of-the-art approaches in machine learning and deep
learning that can aid the research in this field. Our baseline models are
comparable to the state-of-the-art models for the language identification task.

Motivation: 自回归语言模型因逐令牌生成的顺序性限制了推理速度和并行性，尤其在生成后期文本方向和语义相对确定时。

Method: 1. 使用掩码输入联合预测多个未来令牌；2. 通过门控LoRA保留原始模型功能并支持多令牌预测；3. 轻量可学习采样器生成连贯序列；4. 辅助训练损失（如一致性损失）提升联合生成令牌的连贯性和准确性；5. 推测生成策略在保持高保真度的同时实现未来令牌的二次扩展。

Result: 在预训练模型上进行监督微调后，代码和数学生成速度提升近5倍，通用聊天和知识任务提升约2.5倍，且无质量损失。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了自回归语言模型的推理效率，同时保持了生成质量。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models are constrained by their inherently sequential
nature, generating one token at a time. This paradigm limits inference speed
and parallelism, especially during later stages of generation when the
direction and semantics of text are relatively certain. In this work, we
propose a novel framework that leverages the inherent knowledge of vanilla
autoregressive language models about future tokens, combining techniques to
realize this potential and enable simultaneous prediction of multiple
subsequent tokens. Our approach introduces several key innovations: (1) a
masked-input formulation where multiple future tokens are jointly predicted
from a common prefix; (2) a gated LoRA formulation that preserves the original
LLM's functionality, while equipping it for multi-token prediction; (3) a
lightweight, learnable sampler module that generates coherent sequences from
the predicted future tokens; (4) a set of auxiliary training losses, including
a consistency loss, to enhance the coherence and accuracy of jointly generated
tokens; and (5) a speculative generation strategy that expands tokens
quadratically in the future while maintaining high fidelity. Our method
achieves significant speedups through supervised fine-tuning on pretrained
models. For example, it generates code and math nearly 5x faster, and improves
general chat and knowledge tasks by almost 2.5x. These gains come without any
loss in quality.

Abstract: Accurate recognition of personally identifiable information (PII) is central
to automated text anonymization. This paper investigates the effectiveness of
cross-domain model transfer, multi-domain data fusion, and sample-efficient
learning for PII recognition. Using annotated corpora from healthcare (I2B2),
legal (TAB), and biography (Wikipedia), we evaluate models across four
dimensions: in-domain performance, cross-domain transferability, fusion, and

biographical texts, while medical domains resist incoming transfer. Fusion
benefits are domain-specific, and high-quality recognition is achievable with
only 10% of training data in low-specialization domains.

Conclusion: DualReward框架能有效平衡从可靠人类示例中学习与探索高质量干扰项，适用于自动化测试生成。

Abstract: This paper introduces DualReward, a novel reinforcement learning framework
for automatic distractor generation in cloze tests. Unlike conventional
approaches that rely primarily on supervised learning or static generative
models, our method employs a dual reward structure with adaptive scaling that
differentiates between human-created gold standard distractors and
model-generated candidates. The framework dynamically adjusts reward signal
intensity based on model performance and confidence. We evaluate our approach
on both passage-level (CLOTH-F) and sentence-level (MCQ) cloze test datasets,
demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.
Experimental results show that our adaptive reward scaling mechanism provides
modest but consistent benefits on homogeneous datasets (CLOTH-F) and more
substantial improvements (3.48-3.86% in P@1) on diverse, cross-domain data
(MCQ), suggesting its particular effectiveness for handling varied question
types and domains. Our work offers a flexible framework that effectively
balances learning from reliable human examples while exploring novel,

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs内部将“有害性”和“拒绝”编码为两个独立的概念，并提出了“有害性方向”作为新的安全机制分析维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否真正理解“有害性”而不仅仅是机械拒绝，并分析其内部安全机制。

Method: 通过识别“有害性方向”和“拒绝方向”，分析LLMs的内部表示，并验证其对无害指令的误判和拒绝行为。

Result: 发现某些越狱方法通过减少拒绝信号而非改变有害性判断来绕过安全机制，且对抗性微调对有害性内部表示影响较小。

Conclusion: LLMs对有害性的内部理解比拒绝行为更稳健，提出了基于潜在有害性表示的安全应用（Latent Guard）。

Abstract: LLMs are trained to refuse harmful instructions, but do they truly understand
harmfulness beyond just refusing? Prior work has shown that LLMs' refusal
behaviors can be mediated by a one-dimensional subspace, i.e., a refusal
direction. In this work, we identify a new dimension to analyze safety
mechanisms in LLMs, i.e., harmfulness, which is encoded internally as a
separate concept from refusal. There exists a harmfulness direction that is
distinct from the refusal direction. As causal evidence, steering along the
harmfulness direction can lead LLMs to interpret harmless instructions as
harmful, but steering along the refusal direction tends to elicit refusal
responses directly without reversing the model's judgment on harmfulness.
Furthermore, using our identified harmfulness concept, we find that certain
jailbreak methods work by reducing the refusal signals without reversing the
model's internal belief of harmfulness. We also find that adversarially
finetuning models to accept harmful instructions has minimal impact on the
model's internal belief of harmfulness. These insights lead to a practical
safety application: The model's latent harmfulness representation can serve as
an intrinsic safeguard (Latent Guard) for detecting unsafe inputs and reducing
over-refusals that is robust to finetuning attacks. For instance, our Latent
Guard achieves performance comparable to or better than Llama Guard 3 8B, a
dedicated finetuned safeguard model, across different jailbreak methods. Our
findings suggest that LLMs' internal understanding of harmfulness is more
robust than their refusal decision to diverse input instructions, offering a
new perspective to study AI safety

Conclusion: Marco-Bench-MIF为多语言指令跟随提供了更准确的评估工具，揭示了跨语言挑战。

Abstract: Instruction-following capability has become a major ability to be evaluated
for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing datasets, such as IFEval,
are either predominantly monolingual and centered on English or simply machine
translated to other languages, limiting their applicability in multilingual
contexts. In this paper, we present an carefully-curated extension of IFEval to
a localized multilingual version named Marco-Bench-MIF, covering 30 languages
with varying levels of localization. Our benchmark addresses linguistic
constraints (e.g., modifying capitalization requirements for Chinese) and
cultural references (e.g., substituting region-specific company names in
prompts) via a hybrid pipeline combining translation with verification. Through
comprehensive evaluation of 20+ LLMs on our Marco-Bench-MIF, we found that: (1)
25-35% accuracy gap between high/low-resource languages, (2) model scales
largely impact performance by 45-60% yet persists script-specific challenges,
and (3) machine-translated data underestimates accuracy by7-22% versus
localized data. Our analysis identifies challenges in multilingual instruction
following, including keyword consistency preservation and compositional
constraint adherence across languages. Our Marco-Bench-MIF is available at

### [103] [POLYCHARTQA: Benchmarking Large Vision-Language Models with Multilingual Chart Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11939)
*Yichen Xu,Liangyu Chen,Liang Zhang,Wenxuan Wang,Qin Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PolyChartQA是一个多语言图表问答基准，覆盖10种语言的22,606张图表和26,151个问答对，旨在解决现有图表理解基准的英语中心化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图表理解基准主要针对英语，限制了其全球适用性。PolyChartQA旨在通过多语言支持提升图表理解的包容性。

Method: 采用解耦流水线，分离图表数据和渲染代码，利用LLM翻译和严格质量控制生成多语言图表。

Result: 实验显示，英语与其他语言（尤其是非拉丁文字的低资源语言）之间存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: PolyChartQA为推进全球包容性视觉语言模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Charts are a universally adopted medium for interpreting and communicating
data. However, existing chart understanding benchmarks are predominantly
English-centric, limiting their accessibility and applicability to global
audiences. In this paper, we present PolyChartQA, the first large-scale
multilingual chart question answering benchmark covering 22,606 charts and
26,151 question-answering pairs across 10 diverse languages. PolyChartQA is
built using a decoupled pipeline that separates chart data from rendering code,
allowing multilingual charts to be flexibly generated by simply translating the
data and reusing the code. We leverage state-of-the-art LLM-based translation
and enforce rigorous quality control in the pipeline to ensure the linguistic
and semantic consistency of the generated multilingual charts. PolyChartQA
facilitates systematic evaluation of multilingual chart understanding.
Experiments on both open- and closed-source large vision-language models reveal
a significant performance gap between English and other languages, especially
low-resource ones with non-Latin scripts. This benchmark lays a foundation for
advancing globally inclusive vision-language models.

### [104] [BlockBPE: Parallel BPE Tokenization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11941)
*Amos You*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BlockBPE是一种并行GPU实现的BPE算法，优化了高吞吐量的批量推理，比现有方法快2-2.5倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CPU绑定的BPE实现（如HuggingFace Tokenizers和tiktoken）在GPU批量推理中效率低下，BlockBPE旨在解决这一问题。

Method: BlockBPE通过消除Regex预分词步骤，实现线程块内的高度并行化分词合并，复杂度降至O(nd)。

Result: 在高批量推理任务中，BlockBPE的吞吐量比tiktoken高2倍，比HuggingFace Tokenizers高2.5倍。

Conclusion: BlockBPE显著提升了GPU批量推理的效率，尽管牺牲了少量生成质量。

Abstract: Tokenization is a critical preprocessing step in large language model
pipelines, yet widely-used implementations remain CPU-bound and suboptimal for
batch inference workflows on GPU. We present BlockBPE, a parallel GPU
implementation of byte-pair encoding (BPE) that achieves near linear-time
complexity under realistic assumptions and is optimized for high-throughput,
batch inference. Unlike existing Rust-based tokenizers such as HuggingFace
Tokenizers or OpenAI's tiktoken-whose runtimes are dominated by Regex
pre-tokenization and exhibit $O(n \log n)$ runtime-BlockBPE eliminates the
Regex pre-tokenization which leads to small loss in generation quality, but
enables highly parallelized token merges within thread blocks, reducing overall
complexity to $O(nd)$ where $d \ll n$. On high-batch inference workloads,
BlockBPE achieves up to 2x higher throughput than tiktoken and 2.5x over
HuggingFace Tokenizers.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态注意力感知的任务无关提示压缩方法（DAC），通过结合熵和注意力信息，动态感知压缩过程中的熵变化，实现细粒度提示压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖信息熵作为压缩指标，忽略了注意力关键令牌的重要性以及压缩过程中熵的变化。

Method: 提出动态注意力感知方法（DAC），整合熵和注意力信息，动态感知熵变化。

Result: 在多个领域（如LongBench、GSM8K、BBH）的实验表明，DAC在不同任务和LLMs上均表现优异。

Conclusion: DAC方法在任务无关提示压缩中表现出高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Task-agnostic prompt compression leverages the redundancy in natural language
to reduce computational overhead and enhance information density within
prompts, especially in long-context scenarios. Existing methods predominantly
rely on information entropy as the metric to compress lexical units, aiming to
achieve minimal information loss. However, these approaches overlook two
critical aspects: (i) the importance of attention-critical tokens at the
algorithmic level, and (ii) shifts in information entropy during the
compression process. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a dynamic
attention-aware approach for task-agnostic prompt compression (DAC). This
approach effectively integrates entropy and attention information, dynamically
sensing entropy shifts during compression to achieve fine-grained prompt
compression. Extensive experiments across various domains, including LongBench,
GSM8K, and BBH, show that DAC consistently yields robust and substantial
improvements across a diverse range of tasks and LLMs, offering compelling
evidence of its efficacy.

*Yi Zhao,Zuchao Li,Hai Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IAM框架通过利用不同规模LLMs间注意力矩阵的高相似性，实现了加速注意力计算和减少KV缓存使用的双重优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在长上下文场景下资源消耗大，现有优化方法主要依赖模型内部稀疏性，未利用外部信息。

Method: 提出IAM框架，通过分析注意力矩阵相似性、选择映射层并验证一致性，实现小规模与大规模LLMs间的注意力映射。

Result: IAM加速预填充15%，减少KV缓存使用22.1%，且性能损失可忽略，适用于多种模型。

Conclusion: IAM是一种通用且与现有KV缓存优化方法正交的解决方案，显著提升LLM效率。

Abstract: LLMs encounter significant challenges in resource consumption nowadays,
especially with long contexts. Despite extensive efforts dedicate to enhancing
inference efficiency, these methods primarily exploit internal sparsity within
the models, without leveraging external information for optimization. We
identify the high similarity of attention matrices across different-scale LLMs,
which offers a novel perspective for optimization. We first conduct a
comprehensive analysis of how to measure similarity, how to select mapping
Layers and whether mapping is consistency. Based on these insights, we
introduce the IAM framework, which achieves dual benefits of accelerated
attention computation and reduced KV cache usage by performing attention
mapping between small and large LLMs. Our experimental results demonstrate that
IAM can accelerate prefill by 15% and reduce KV cache usage by 22.1% without
appreciably sacrificing performance. Experiments on different series of models
show the generalizability of IAM. Importantly, it is also orthogonal to many
existing KV cache optimization methods, making it a versatile addition to the
current toolkit for enhancing LLM efficiency.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于查询的多阶段知识图谱问答（KGQA）框架，用于提升多跳推理和时间问题的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在问答任务中表现优异，但在多跳推理和时间问题上仍有不足，因此探索模块化的查询生成方法。

Method: 采用多阶段查询生成框架，结合新颖的实体链接和谓词匹配方法，利用链式推理（CoT）。

Result: 在多跳和时间问答数据集上表现出色，验证了框架的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 基于查询的多阶段KGQA框架为小型语言模型在多跳和时间问答任务中提供了潜力。

Abstract: Large language models excel in question-answering (QA) yet still struggle
with multi-hop reasoning and temporal questions. Query-based knowledge graph QA
(KGQA) offers a modular alternative by generating executable queries instead of
direct answers. We explore multi-stage query-based framework for WikiData QA,
proposing multi-stage approach that enhances performance on challenging
multi-hop and temporal benchmarks. Through generalization and rejection
studies, we evaluate robustness across multi-hop and temporal QA datasets.
Additionally, we introduce a novel entity linking and predicate matching method
using CoT reasoning. Our results demonstrate the potential of query-based

*Xinyu Wang,Vahid Partovi Nia,Peng Lu,Jerry Huang,Xiao-Wen Chang,Boxing Chen,Yufei Cui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的PoT量化框架，用于LLM权重，在极低精度格式下优于现有方法，并通过高效反量化加速推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs部署因计算资源需求高而具有挑战性，现有PoT量化在GPU上效果不佳。

Method: 采用两步后训练算法：初始化量化尺度并校准，优化反量化效率。

Result: 在2-和3-bit格式下超越现有整数量化方法，反量化速度显著提升。

Conclusion: 新型PoT量化框架在低精度和推理速度上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, their deployment is
challenging due to the substantial computational resources required.
Power-of-two (PoT) quantization is a general tool to counteract this
difficulty. Albeit previous works on PoT quantization can be efficiently
dequantized on CPUs using fixed-point addition, it showed less effectiveness on
GPUs. The reason is entanglement of the sign bit and sequential bit
manipulations needed for dequantization. We propose a novel POT quantization
framework for LLM weights that (i) outperforms state-of-the-art accuracy in
extremely low-precision number formats, and (ii) enables faster inference
through more efficient dequantization. To maintain the accuracy of the
quantized model, we introduce a two-step post-training algorithm: (i)
initialize the quantization scales with a robust starting point, and (ii)
refine these scales using a minimal calibration set. The performance of our PoT
post-training algorithm surpasses the current state-of-the-art in integer
quantization, particularly at low precisions such as 2- and 3-bit formats. Our
PoT quantization accelerates the dequantization step required for the floating
point inference and leads to $3.67\times$ speed up on a NVIDIA V100, and
$1.63\times$ on a NVIDIA RTX 4090, compared to uniform integer dequantization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段框架，用于在低资源语言对中保留毒性内容的翻译，以新加坡英语（Singlish）为例，通过人工验证的少样本提示工程和模型优化，提升了翻译质量和文化敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线交流中，低资源语言和方言的翻译系统常无法保留本地俚语、混合语和文化嵌入的有害言论标记，且缺乏平行数据和安全性过滤。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1）人工验证的少样本提示工程，筛选和排名标注者选定的Singlish目标示例；2）通过语义相似度基准测试优化模型-提示对。

Result: 定量人工评估证实了框架的有效性和效率，提升了翻译质量，并支持低资源环境下的文化敏感内容审核。

Conclusion: 框架不仅提升了翻译质量，还强调了在内容审核和区域平台治理等实际应用中保留社会语言细微差别的重要性。

Abstract: As online communication increasingly incorporates under-represented languages
and colloquial dialects, standard translation systems often fail to preserve
local slang, code-mixing, and culturally embedded markers of harmful speech.
Translating toxic content between low-resource language pairs poses additional
challenges due to scarce parallel data and safety filters that sanitize
offensive expressions. In this work, we propose a reproducible, two-stage
framework for toxicity-preserving translation, demonstrated on a code-mixed
Singlish safety corpus. First, we perform human-verified few-shot prompt
engineering: we iteratively curate and rank annotator-selected Singlish-target
examples to capture nuanced slang, tone, and toxicity. Second, we optimize
model-prompt pairs by benchmarking several large language models using semantic
similarity via direct and back-translation. Quantitative human evaluation
confirms the effectiveness and efficiency of our pipeline. Beyond improving
translation quality, our framework contributes to the safety of multicultural
LLMs by supporting culturally sensitive moderation and benchmarking in
low-resource contexts. By positioning Singlish as a testbed for inclusive NLP,
we underscore the importance of preserving sociolinguistic nuance in real-world
applications such as content moderation and regional platform governance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨人类与LLMs在语言理解上的差异，以促进人机协同学习。

Method: 使用LLM将文本转化为基于语义的图结构，并通过眼动数据验证重要节点和边的注视分布。

Result: LLMs在图拓扑结构层面表现出高度一致的语言理解能力。

Conclusion: 研究为有效的人机协同学习策略提供了新见解。

Abstract: Reading comprehension is a fundamental skill in human cognitive development.
With the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a growing need
to compare how humans and LLMs understand language across different contexts
and apply this understanding to functional tasks such as inference, emotion
interpretation, and information retrieval. Our previous work used LLMs and
human biomarkers to study the reading comprehension process. The results showed
that the biomarkers corresponding to words with high and low relevance to the
inference target, as labeled by the LLMs, exhibited distinct patterns,
particularly when validated using eye-tracking data. However, focusing solely
on individual words limited the depth of understanding, which made the
conclusions somewhat simplistic despite their potential significance. This
study used an LLM-based AI agent to group words from a reading passage into
nodes and edges, forming a graph-based text representation based on semantic
meaning and question-oriented prompts. We then compare the distribution of eye
fixations on important nodes and edges. Our findings indicate that LLMs exhibit
high consistency in language understanding at the level of graph topological
structure. These results build on our previous findings and offer insights into
effective human-AI co-learning strategies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了价值相似性对LLM代理之间关系建立的影响，发现相似性高的代理表现出更强的信任和亲密感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索价值相似性在人工社会中是否像人类社会中一样影响关系建立。

Method: 通过两个实验：初步实验评估LLM中价值的可控性；主实验生成具有特定价值的代理对并分析其对话后的信任和亲密感。

Result: 价值相似性高的代理对表现出更强的信任和亲密感，且结果在英语和日语中一致。

Conclusion: LLM代理模拟可作为社会科学理论的有效测试平台，并揭示了价值影响关系建立的机制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for simulating
complex social phenomena using human-like agents with specific traits. In human
societies, value similarity is important for building trust and close
relationships; however, it remains unexplored whether this principle holds true
in artificial societies comprising LLM agents. Therefore, this study
investigates the influence of value similarity on relationship-building among
LLM agents through two experiments. First, in a preliminary experiment, we
evaluated the controllability of values in LLMs to identify the most effective
model and prompt design for controlling the values. Subsequently, in the main
experiment, we generated pairs of LLM agents imbued with specific values and
analyzed their mutual evaluations of trust and interpersonal closeness
following a dialogue. The experiments were conducted in English and Japanese to
investigate language dependence. The results confirmed that pairs of agents
with higher value similarity exhibited greater mutual trust and interpersonal
closeness. Our findings demonstrate that the LLM agent simulation serves as a
valid testbed for social science theories, contributes to elucidating the
mechanisms by which values influence relationship building, and provides a
foundation for inspiring new theories and insights into the social sciences.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了简化对多义词定义质量的影响，发现简化会显著降低定义的完整性，增加误解风险。通过微调模型，可以显著提升多义词回答质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）能提供准确的单词定义，但针对不同目标群体（如儿童或语言学习者）时，定义的简化可能导致信息丢失或误导。

Method: 使用两种新的多语言评估数据集，测试多个LLM模型（如DeepSeek v3、Llama 4等），并通过LLM-as-Judge和人工标注评估简化对多义词定义的影响。

Result: 简化显著降低了定义的完整性，尤其是忽略了多义性。通过微调Llama 3.1 8B模型，显著提升了多义词回答质量。

Conclusion: 教育领域的NLP需要在简单性和完整性之间取得平衡，以确保为所有学习者提供可靠且上下文感知的定义。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can provide accurate word definitions and
explanations for any context. However, the scope of the definition changes for
different target groups, like children or language learners. This is especially
relevant for homonyms, words with multiple meanings, where oversimplification
might risk information loss by omitting key senses, potentially misleading
users who trust LLM outputs. We investigate how simplification impacts homonym
definition quality across three target groups: Normal, Simple, and ELI5. Using
two novel evaluation datasets spanning multiple languages, we test DeepSeek v3,
Llama 4 Maverick, Qwen3-30B A3B, GPT-4o mini, and Llama 3.1 8B via LLM-as-Judge
and human annotations. Our results show that simplification drastically
degrades definition completeness by neglecting polysemy, increasing the risk of
misunderstanding. Fine-tuning Llama 3.1 8B with Direct Preference Optimization
substantially improves homonym response quality across all prompt types. These
findings highlight the need to balance simplicity and completeness in
educational NLP to ensure reliable, context-aware definitions for all learners.

Abstract: This thesis addresses challenges related to data and parameter efficiency in
neural language models, with a focus on representation analysis and the
introduction of new optimization techniques. The first part examines the
properties and dynamics of language representations within neural models,
emphasizing their significance in enhancing robustness and generalization. It
proposes innovative approaches based on representation smoothness, including
regularization strategies that utilize Jacobian and Hessian matrices to
stabilize training and mitigate sensitivity to input perturbations. The second
part focuses on methods to significantly enhance data and parameter efficiency
by integrating active learning strategies with parameter-efficient fine-tuning,
guided by insights from representation smoothness analysis. It presents
smoothness-informed early-stopping techniques designed to eliminate the need
for labeled validation sets and proposes innovative combinations of active
learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning to reduce labeling efforts and
computational resources. Extensive experimental evaluations across various NLP
tasks demonstrate that these combined approaches substantially outperform
traditional methods in terms of performance, stability, and efficiency. The
third part explores weak supervision techniques enhanced by in-context learning
to effectively utilize unlabeled data, further reducing dependence on extensive
labeling. It shows that using in-context learning as a mechanism for weak
supervision enables models to better generalize from limited labeled data by
leveraging unlabeled examples more effectively during training. Comprehensive
empirical evaluations confirm significant gains in model accuracy,
adaptability, and robustness, especially in low-resource settings and dynamic
data environments.

Method: 测试包括多种任务，评估了24名人类和24个LLMs的创造力，并使用OCSAI工具自动评估答案的原创性、精细度和灵活性。

Result: LLMs在所有评估标准中均优于人类，并在八项任务中的六项表现更好。人类更倾向于扩展性创造力（E-creativity），而LLMs更倾向于固定性创造力（F-creativity）。

Conclusion: 研究表明LLMs在语言创造力方面具有显著优势，但人类和LLMs在创造力类型上存在差异。

Abstract: The following paper introduces a general linguistic creativity test for
humans and Large Language Models (LLMs). The test consists of various tasks
aimed at assessing their ability to generate new original words and phrases
based on word formation processes (derivation and compounding) and on
metaphorical language use. We administered the test to 24 humans and to an
equal number of LLMs, and we automatically evaluated their answers using OCSAI
tool for three criteria: Originality, Elaboration, and Flexibility. The results
show that LLMs not only outperformed humans in all the assessed criteria, but
did better in six out of the eight test tasks. We then computed the uniqueness
of the individual answers, which showed some minor differences between humans
and LLMs. Finally, we performed a short manual analysis of the dataset, which
revealed that humans are more inclined towards E(extending)-creativity, while
LLMs favor F(ixed)-creativity.

Motivation: 现有共指消解基准主要针对中小规模文本，缺乏对长文本（如书籍规模）的评估能力。

Method: 开发了一个自动标注管道，并基于此创建了BOOKCOREF基准，平均文档长度超过20万词。

Conclusion: BOOKCOREF为书籍规模共指消解研究提供了新资源，并指出了未来改进方向。

Abstract: Coreference Resolution systems are typically evaluated on benchmarks
containing small- to medium-scale documents. When it comes to evaluating long
texts, however, existing benchmarks, such as LitBank, remain limited in length
and do not adequately assess system capabilities at the book scale, i.e., when
co-referring mentions span hundreds of thousands of tokens. To fill this gap,
we first put forward a novel automatic pipeline that produces high-quality
Coreference Resolution annotations on full narrative texts. Then, we adopt this
pipeline to create the first book-scale coreference benchmark, BOOKCOREF, with
an average document length of more than 200,000 tokens. We carry out a series
of experiments showing the robustness of our automatic procedure and
demonstrating the value of our resource, which enables current long-document
coreference systems to gain up to +20 CoNLL-F1 points when evaluated on full
books. Moreover, we report on the new challenges introduced by this
unprecedented book-scale setting, highlighting that current models fail to
deliver the same performance they achieve on smaller documents. We release our
data and code to encourage research and development of new book-scale
Coreference Resolution systems at https://github.com/sapienzanlp/bookcoref.

Abstract: This paper presents an intervention study on the effects of the combined
methods of (1) the Socratic method, (2) Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning, (3)
simplified gamification and (4) formative feedback on university students'
Maths learning driven by large language models (LLMs). We call our approach
Mathematics Explanations through Games by AI LLMs (MEGA). Some students
struggle with Maths and as a result avoid Math-related discipline or subjects
despite the importance of Maths across many fields, including signal
processing. Oftentimes, students' Maths difficulties stem from suboptimal
pedagogy. We compared the MEGA method to the traditional step-by-step (CoT)
method to ascertain which is better by using a within-group design after
randomly assigning questions for the participants, who are university students.
Samples (n=60) were randomly drawn from each of the two test sets of the Grade
School Math 8K (GSM8K) and Mathematics Aptitude Test of Heuristics (MATH)
datasets, based on the error margin of 11%, the confidence level of 90%, and a
manageable number of samples for the student evaluators. These samples were
used to evaluate two capable LLMs at length (Generative Pretrained Transformer
4o (GPT4o) and Claude 3.5 Sonnet) out of the initial six that were tested for
capability. The results showed that students agree in more instances that the
MEGA method is experienced as better for learning for both datasets. It is even
much better than the CoT (47.5% compared to 26.67%) in the more difficult MATH
dataset, indicating that MEGA is better at explaining difficult Maths problems.

### [119] [Iterative Augmentation with Summarization Refinement (IASR) Evaluation for Unstructured Survey data Modeling and Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12126)
*Payal Bhattad,Sai Manoj Pudukotai Dinakarrao,Anju Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种评估大型语言模型（LLM）文本增强的框架，包括可扩展性分析和迭代增强与摘要细化（IASR），验证了其在提升语义保真度和多样性方面的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有文本增强技术在语义保真和稳定性方面的不足，特别是在大规模或迭代生成时。

Method: 提出两个评估组件：可扩展性分析和IASR，用于测量语义一致性和语义漂移。

Result: GPT-3.5 Turbo在语义保真、多样性和生成效率上表现最佳；在实际任务中，主题粒度提升400%且完全消除主题重叠。

Conclusion: 验证了所提框架在LLM增强文本中的实用性，为实际NLP任务提供了结构化评估方法。

Abstract: Text data augmentation is a widely used strategy for mitigating data sparsity
in natural language processing (NLP), particularly in low-resource settings
where limited samples hinder effective semantic modeling. While augmentation
can improve input diversity and downstream interpretability, existing
techniques often lack mechanisms to ensure semantic preservation during
large-scale or iterative generation, leading to redundancy and instability.
This work introduces a principled evaluation framework for large language model
(LLM) based text augmentation, comprising two components: (1) Scalability
Analysis, which measures semantic consistency as augmentation volume increases,
and (2) Iterative Augmentation with Summarization Refinement (IASR), which
evaluates semantic drift across recursive paraphrasing cycles. Empirical
evaluations across state-of-the-art LLMs show that GPT-3.5 Turbo achieved the
best balance of semantic fidelity, diversity, and generation efficiency.
Applied to a real-world topic modeling task using BERTopic with GPT-enhanced
few-shot labeling, the proposed approach results in a 400% increase in topic
granularity and complete elimination of topic overlaps. These findings
validated the utility of the proposed frameworks for structured evaluation of
LLM-based augmentation in practical NLP pipelines.

*Pavel Šindelář,Ondřej Bojar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ELOQUENT的Sensemaking任务通过教师、学生和评估者系统三步评估生成模型的理解能力，2025年实验涉及多语言材料，发现任务1需改进评估策略，任务2中LLMs表现尚可但受限，任务3中LLM-as-a-Judge存在误判问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在为生成语言模型建立可测试的高层次评估标准，通过Sensemaking任务模拟课堂考试形式，评估模型对文本的理解能力。

Method: 采用三步评估法：教师系统生成问题，学生系统回答问题，评估系统评分。实验涵盖多语言材料，使用自动和手动评估方法。

Result: 任务1需改进问题生成评估策略；任务2中LLMs表现尚可但受限；任务3中LLM-as-a-Judge误判问题明显。

Conclusion: Sensemaking任务初步验证了评估生成模型理解能力的可行性，但需进一步优化评估策略和模型表现。

Abstract: ELOQUENT is a set of shared tasks that aims to create easily testable
high-level criteria for evaluating generative language models. Sensemaking is
one such shared task.
  In Sensemaking, we try to assess how well generative models ``make sense out
of a given text'' in three steps inspired by exams in a classroom setting: (1)
Teacher systems should prepare a set of questions, (2) Student systems should
answer these questions, and (3) Evaluator systems should score these answers,
all adhering rather strictly to a given set of input materials.
  We report on the 2025 edition of Sensemaking, where we had 7 sources of test
materials (fact-checking analyses of statements, textbooks, transcribed
recordings of a lecture, and educational videos) spanning English, German,
Ukrainian, and Czech languages.
  This year, 4 teams participated, providing us with 2 Teacher submissions, 2
Student submissions, and 2 Evaluator submissions. We added baselines for
Teacher and Student using commercial large language model systems. We devised a
fully automatic evaluation procedure, which we compare to a minimalistic manual
evaluation.
  We were able to make some interesting observations. For the first task, the
creation of questions, better evaluation strategies will still have to be
devised because it is difficult to discern the quality of the various candidate
question sets. In the second task, question answering, the LLMs examined
overall perform acceptably, but restricting their answers to the given input
texts remains problematic. In the third task, evaluation of question answers,
our adversarial tests reveal that systems using the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm
erroneously rate both garbled question-answer pairs and answers to mixed-up
questions as acceptable.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种行为翻译风格空间（BTSS），用于描述可能的翻译行为模式，并通过分层结构分析眼动和手指运动等行为数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于理解翻译行为背后的高阶认知过程和情感状态，以及如何通过行为数据揭示隐藏的心理处理结构。

Method: 方法包括分析击键和注视数据，并将行为模式组织为多层嵌入的BTSS。

Result: 结果表明BTSS可以作为计算翻译代理的基础，模拟人类翻译过程中的情感、自动化行为和认知的动态变化。

Conclusion: 结论指出BTSS为研究翻译行为提供了新的框架，并有助于开发模拟人类翻译的计算模型。

Abstract: The paper introduces a Behavioural Translation Style Space (BTSS) that
describes possible behavioural translation patterns. The suggested BTSS is
organized as a hierarchical structure that entails various embedded processing
layers. We posit that observable translation behaviour - i.e., eye and finger
movements - is fundamental when executing the physical act of translation but
it is caused and shaped by higher-order cognitive processes and affective
translation states. We analyse records of keystrokes and gaze data as
indicators of the hidden mental processing structure and organize the
behavioural patterns as a multi-layered embedded BTSS. The BTSS serves as the
basis for a computational translation agent to simulate the temporal dynamics
of affect, automatized behaviour and cognition during human translation
production.

*Reuben Smit,Retief Louw,Herman Kamper*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于自监督学习（SSL）模型的少样本方法，用于低资源环境下儿童孤立词阅读评估，但发现SSL表示在处理儿童语音时存在局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低资源环境下，传统自动语音识别（ASR）方法难以适用，因此探索一种无需ASR的儿童阅读评估方法。

Method: 使用SSL模型的中间层编码儿童语音和成人参考模板，通过离散化SSL特征和模板的质心平均进行设计优化。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在成人语音上表现良好，但在儿童语音输入时性能显著下降，即使使用儿童模板。

Conclusion: 尽管SSL表示在低资源语音任务中表现优异，但在少样本分类系统中处理儿童数据时存在明显局限性。

Abstract: We explore an ASR-free method for isolated word reading assessment in
low-resource settings. Our few-shot approach compares input child speech to a
small set of adult-provided reference templates. Inputs and templates are
encoded using intermediate layers from large self-supervised learned (SSL)
models. Using an Afrikaans child speech benchmark, we investigate design
options such as discretising SSL features and barycentre averaging of the
templates. Idealised experiments show reasonable performance for adults, but a
substantial drop for child speech input, even with child templates. Despite the
success of employing SSL representations in low-resource speech tasks, our work
highlights the limitations of SSL representations for processing child data
when used in a few-shot classification system.

### [123] [Improving Contextual ASR via Multi-grained Fusion with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12252)
*Shilin Zhou,Zhenghua Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种多粒度融合方法，结合了词级和短语级融合的优势，利用LLM提升ASR关键词识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ASR模型在识别上下文相关关键词（如专有名词或用户特定实体）时表现不佳，现有方法各有局限性。

Method: 提出多粒度融合方法，结合词级和短语级融合，采用后融合策略平衡声学信息和上下文知识。

Result: 在中英文数据集上实现了关键词相关指标的最优性能，同时保持非关键词的高准确率。

Conclusion: 多粒度融合框架中词级和短语级组件相辅相成，显著提升性能。

Abstract: While end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models have shown
impressive performance in transcribing general speech, they often struggle to
accurately recognize contextually relevant keywords, such as proper nouns or
user-specific entities.
  Previous approaches have explored leveraging keyword dictionaries in the
textual modality to improve keyword recognition, either through token-level
fusion that guides token-by-token generation or phrase-level fusion that
enables direct copying of keyword phrases.
  However, these methods operate at different granularities and have their own
limitations.
  In this paper, we propose a novel multi-grained fusion approach that jointly
leverages the strengths of both token-level and phrase-level fusion with Large
Language Models (LLMs).
  Our approach incorporates a late-fusion strategy that elegantly combines
ASR's acoustic information with LLM's rich contextual knowledge, balancing
fine-grained token precision with holistic phrase-level understanding.
  Experiments on Chinese and English datasets demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on keyword-related metrics while
preserving high accuracy on non-keyword text.
  Ablation studies further confirm that the token-level and phrase-level
components both contribute significantly to the performance gains,
complementing each other in our joint multi-grained framework.
  The code and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的翻译文本量化指标T-index，通过对比微调的语言模型计算，能够有效测量翻译文本的特性，并在跨领域和人类评估中表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有翻译质量评估指标（如BLEU、COMET）未能充分捕捉翻译文本的特性（translationese），需要一种新的量化方法。

Method: 使用对比微调的语言模型（0.5B参数）计算T-index，并通过合成数据和真实翻译数据验证其泛化性和有效性。

Result: T-index在跨领域和人类评估中表现稳健，与人类评分相关性较高（Pearson's r=0.568），且与现有MT质量评估指标相关性低。

Conclusion: T-index是一种有效的翻译文本量化指标，可作为现有MT质量评估指标的补充。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose the first quantitative measure for translationese
-- the translationese-index (T-index) for graded and generalizable measurement
of translationese, computed from the likelihood ratios of two contrastively
fine-tuned language models (LMs). We use a synthesized dataset and a dataset
with translations in the wild to evaluate T-index's generalizability in
cross-domain settings and its validity against human judgments. Our results
show that T-index is both robust and efficient. T-index scored by two 0.5B LMs
fine-tuned on only 1-5k pairs of synthetic data can well capture translationese
in the wild. We find that the relative differences in T-indices between
translations can well predict pairwise translationese annotations obtained from
human annotators; and the absolute values of T-indices correlate well with
human ratings of degrees of translationese (Pearson's $r = 0.568$).
Additionally, the correlation between T-index and existing machine translation
(MT) quality estimation (QE) metrics such as BLEU and COMET is low, suggesting
that T-index is not covered by these metrics and can serve as a complementary
metric in MT QE.

*Johann Frei,Nils Feldhus,Lisa Raithel,Roland Roller,Alexander Meyer,Frank Kramer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Infherno是一个基于LLM代理和代码执行的端到端框架，用于将自由形式的临床笔记转换为结构化FHIR资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在通用性和结构一致性上的不足。

Method: 结合LLM代理、代码执行和医学术语数据库工具。

Result: Infherno在预测FHIR资源方面表现接近人类基准。

Conclusion: Infherno支持临床数据集成和跨机构互操作性。

Abstract: For clinical data integration and healthcare services, the HL7 FHIR standard
has established itself as a desirable format for interoperability between
complex health data. Previous attempts at automating the translation from
free-form clinical notes into structured FHIR resources rely on modular,
rule-based systems or LLMs with instruction tuning and constrained decoding.
Since they frequently suffer from limited generalizability and structural
inconformity, we propose an end-to-end framework powered by LLM agents, code
execution, and healthcare terminology database tools to address these issues.
Our solution, called Infherno, is designed to adhere to the FHIR document
schema and competes well with a human baseline in predicting FHIR resources
from unstructured text. The implementation features a front end for custom and
synthetic data and both local and proprietary models, supporting clinical data
integration processes and interoperability across institutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏标准化的基准测试，现有的文本异常检测方法难以进行严格比较和创新开发。

Method: 利用多种预训练语言模型（如GloVe、BERT、LLaMa等）的嵌入，结合多领域文本数据集和综合评估指标（AUROC、AUPRC），进行系统评估。

Result: 研究发现嵌入质量对异常检测效果至关重要，且深度学习方法在LLM嵌入下并未优于传统浅层算法（如KNN、Isolation Forest）。

Conclusion: 该工作为未来文本异常检测系统的研究提供了基础，并开源了基准工具包。

Abstract: Text anomaly detection is a critical task in natural language processing
(NLP), with applications spanning fraud detection, misinformation
identification, spam detection and content moderation, etc. Despite significant
advances in large language models (LLMs) and anomaly detection algorithms, the
absence of standardized and comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating the
existing anomaly detection methods on text data limits rigorous comparison and
development of innovative approaches. This work performs a comprehensive
empirical study and introduces a benchmark for text anomaly detection,
leveraging embeddings from diverse pre-trained language models across a wide
array of text datasets. Our work systematically evaluates the effectiveness of
embedding-based text anomaly detection by incorporating (1) early language
models (GloVe, BERT); (2) multiple LLMs (LLaMa-2, LLama-3, Mistral, OpenAI
(small, ada, large)); (3) multi-domain text datasets (news, social media,
scientific publications); (4) comprehensive evaluation metrics (AUROC, AUPRC).
Our experiments reveal a critical empirical insight: embedding quality
significantly governs anomaly detection efficacy, and deep learning-based
approaches demonstrate no performance advantage over conventional shallow
algorithms (e.g., KNN, Isolation Forest) when leveraging LLM-derived
embeddings.In addition, we observe strongly low-rank characteristics in
cross-model performance matrices, which enables an efficient strategy for rapid
model evaluation (or embedding evaluation) and selection in practical
applications. Furthermore, by open-sourcing our benchmark toolkit that includes
all embeddings from different models and code at
https://github.com/jicongfan/Text-Anomaly-Detection-Benchmark, this work
provides a foundation for future research in robust and scalable text anomaly
detection systems.

TL;DR: 该论文评估了现有代码大语言模型（LLMs）在VHDL代码生成和摘要任务中的表现，发现其性能不足，并提出了一种名为Chain-of-Descriptions（CoDes）的新方法以提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在通用代码任务中表现优异，但在硬件描述语言（如VHDL）领域的研究和评估较少，存在明显的性能差距。

Method: 论文提出了CoDes方法，通过生成一系列中间描述步骤（基于问题陈述或VHDL代码），并将其与原始输入结合以提升LLMs的表现。

Result: 实验表明，CoDes方法在VHDL-Eval和VHDL-Xform数据集上显著优于标准提示策略。

Conclusion: CoDes不仅提高了VHDL代码生成和摘要的质量，还为未来研究提供了框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely used across diverse NLP tasks
and domains, demonstrating their adaptability and effectiveness. In the realm
of Electronic Design Automation (EDA), LLMs show promise for tasks like
Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code generation and summarization. However,
despite the proliferation of LLMs for general code-related tasks, there's a
dearth of research focused on evaluating and refining these models for hardware
description languages (HDLs), notably VHDL. In this study, we evaluate the
performance of existing code LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization
using various metrics and two datasets -- VHDL-Eval and VHDL-Xform. The latter,
an in-house dataset, aims to gauge LLMs' understanding of functionally
equivalent code. Our findings reveal consistent underperformance of these
models across different metrics, underscoring a significant gap in their
suitability for this domain. To address this challenge, we propose
Chain-of-Descriptions (CoDes), a novel approach to enhance the performance of
LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization tasks. CoDes involves
generating a series of intermediate descriptive steps based on: (i) the problem
statement for code generation, and (ii) the VHDL code for summarization. These
steps are then integrated with the original input prompt (problem statement or
code) and provided as input to the LLMs to generate the final output. Our
experiments demonstrate that the CoDes approach significantly surpasses the
standard prompting strategy across various metrics on both datasets. This
method not only improves the quality of VHDL code generation and summarization
but also serves as a framework for future research aimed at enhancing code LLMs
for VHDL.

Motivation: 探讨性别偏见在AD语音感知中的影响，为开发更公平的AD检测模型提供依据。

Method: 通过16名中文听众对中文和希腊语语音的感知实验，结合声学分析（如shimmer值和语音部分）。

Result: 男性语音更频繁被识别为AD，中文语音中性别偏见更明显；shimmer值与AD感知正相关，语音部分与AD识别负相关。

Conclusion: 性别偏见在AD语音感知中起关键作用，需在模型开发中加以解决，并进一步验证跨语言性能。

Abstract: Gender bias has been widely observed in speech perception tasks, influenced
by the fundamental voicing differences between genders. This study reveals a
gender bias in the perception of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) speech. In a
perception experiment involving 16 Chinese listeners evaluating both Chinese
and Greek speech, we identified that male speech was more frequently identified
as AD, with this bias being particularly pronounced in Chinese speech. Acoustic
analysis showed that shimmer values in male speech were significantly
associated with AD perception, while speech portion exhibited a significant
negative correlation with AD identification. Although language did not have a
significant impact on AD perception, our findings underscore the critical role
of gender bias in AD speech perception. This work highlights the necessity of
addressing gender bias when developing AD detection models and calls for
further research to validate model performance across different linguistic
contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在处理用户请求时存在模糊性问题，需要更有效的方法来提升其性能。

Method: 采用三种LLM架构（Llama3-8B、Gemma2-9B和Mistral-7B变体）和一个包含多样模糊性的数据集，设计并评估多智能体辩论框架。

Result: 辩论框架显著提升了Llama3-8B和Mistral-7B变体的性能，其中Mistral-7B主导的辩论成功率达到了76.7%，尤其在复杂模糊性和高效共识方面表现突出。

Conclusion: 多智能体辩论框架是一种有效的针对性方法，可以增强LLMs的能力，为开发更鲁棒和自适应的语言理解系统提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in
understanding and generating human language, contributing to more natural
interactions with complex systems. However, they face challenges such as
ambiguity in user requests processed by LLMs. To address these challenges, this
paper introduces and evaluates a multi-agent debate framework designed to
enhance detection and resolution capabilities beyond single models. The
framework consists of three LLM architectures (Llama3-8B, Gemma2-9B, and
Mistral-7B variants) and a dataset with diverse ambiguities. The debate
framework markedly enhanced the performance of Llama3-8B and Mistral-7B
variants over their individual baselines, with Mistral-7B-led debates achieving
a notable 76.7% success rate and proving particularly effective for complex
ambiguities and efficient consensus. While acknowledging varying model
responses to collaborative strategies, these findings underscore the debate
framework's value as a targeted method for augmenting LLM capabilities. This
work offers important insights for developing more robust and adaptive language
understanding systems by showing how structured debates can lead to improved
clarity in interactive systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLMs依赖静态数据，无法实时获取信息。研究探索了LLMs通过浏览网页分析社交媒体数据的能力，填补了直接检索和分析社交媒体数据的空白。

Method: 使用合成数据集（48个X/Twitter账户）和调查数据集（1,384名国际参与者），评估LLMs访问社交媒体内容并预测用户属性的能力。

Result: LLMs能够访问社交媒体内容并预测用户人口统计信息，但可能因账户活动少而引入性别和政治偏见。

Conclusion: 此能力对计算社会科学有潜力，但也存在滥用风险，建议限制公开应用，仅保留受控研究访问。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have traditionally relied on static training
data, limiting their knowledge to fixed snapshots. Recent advancements,
however, have equipped LLMs with web browsing capabilities, enabling real time
information retrieval and multi step reasoning over live web content. While
prior studies have demonstrated LLMs ability to access and analyze websites,
their capacity to directly retrieve and analyze social media data remains
unexplored. Here, we evaluate whether web browsing LLMs can infer demographic
attributes of social media users given only their usernames. Using a synthetic
dataset of 48 X (Twitter) accounts and a survey dataset of 1,384 international
participants, we show that these models can access social media content and
predict user demographics with reasonable accuracy. Analysis of the synthetic
dataset further reveals how LLMs parse and interpret social media profiles,
which may introduce gender and political biases against accounts with minimal
activity. While this capability holds promise for computational social science
in the post API era, it also raises risks of misuse particularly in information
operations and targeted advertising underscoring the need for safeguards. We
recommend that LLM providers restrict this capability in public facing
applications, while preserving controlled access for verified research
purposes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型内部激活是否能用于检测算术错误，以提升模型自我修正能力。

Method: 从3位数加法开始，训练探针解码隐藏状态；扩展到结构化思维链任务，验证泛化能力；利用探针指导选择性重新提示。

Result: 探针能准确解码预测和正确答案，错误检测器准确率超90%；在复杂任务中表现一致，提升任务准确性。

Conclusion: 算术错误可通过内部激活预测，简单探针为轻量级模型自我修正提供可行路径。

Abstract: We investigate whether internal activations in language models can be used to
detect arithmetic errors. Starting with a controlled setting of 3-digit
addition, we show that simple probes can accurately decode both the model's
predicted output and the correct answer from hidden states, regardless of
whether the model's output is correct. Building on this, we train lightweight
error detectors that predict model correctness with over 90% accuracy. We then
extend our analysis to structured chain-of-thought traces on addition-only
GSM8K problems and find that probes trained on simple arithmetic generalize
well to this more complex setting, revealing consistent internal
representations. Finally, we demonstrate that these probes can guide selective
re-prompting of erroneous reasoning steps, improving task accuracy with minimal
disruption to correct outputs. Our findings suggest that arithmetic errors can
be anticipated from internal activations alone, and that simple probes offer a
viable path toward lightweight model self-correction.

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的RAG框架，结合混合检索策略和元数据过滤，显著提升了企业数据处理的准确性和相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业依赖专有数据决策，但现有LLMs和RAG框架在处理结构化数据时存在局限。

Method: 采用混合检索（密集嵌入和BM25）、元数据过滤、语义分块和量化索引，结合人工反馈优化。

Result: 实验显示Precision@5提升15%，Recall@5提升13%，且定性评估得分显著提高。

Conclusion: 框架有效提升企业任务响应质量，未来将扩展至多模态数据和基于代理的检索。

Abstract: Organizations increasingly rely on proprietary enterprise data, including HR
records, structured reports, and tabular documents, for critical
decision-making. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have strong generative
capabilities, they are limited by static pretraining, short context windows,
and challenges in processing heterogeneous data formats. Conventional
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks address some of these gaps but
often struggle with structured and semi-structured data.
  This work proposes an advanced RAG framework that combines hybrid retrieval
strategies using dense embeddings (all-mpnet-base-v2) and BM25, enhanced by
metadata-aware filtering with SpaCy NER and cross-encoder reranking. The
framework applies semantic chunking to maintain textual coherence and retains
tabular data structures to preserve row-column integrity. Quantized indexing
optimizes retrieval efficiency, while human-in-the-loop feedback and
conversation memory improve adaptability.
  Experiments on enterprise datasets show notable improvements: Precision@5
increased by 15 percent (90 versus 75), Recall@5 by 13 percent (87 versus 74),
and Mean Reciprocal Rank by 16 percent (0.85 versus 0.69). Qualitative
evaluations show higher scores in Faithfulness (4.6 versus 3.0), Completeness
(4.2 versus 2.5), and Relevance (4.5 versus 3.2) on a 5-point Likert scale.
These results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in delivering accurate,
comprehensive, and contextually relevant responses for enterprise tasks. Future
work includes extending to multimodal data and integrating agent-based
retrieval. The source code will be released at

Method: 评估了多种监控方法，包括人类、大语言模型和文本分类器，比较了基于CoT文本和激活的方法。

Result: 基于CoT激活的线性探针显著优于文本方法，且能在推理完成前准确预测安全性。

Conclusion: 轻量级探针可实现实时安全监控和早期干预，适用于不同模型和基准。

Abstract: Open-weights reasoning language models generate long chains-of-thought (CoTs)
before producing a final response, which improves performance but introduces
additional alignment risks, with harmful content often appearing in both the
CoTs and the final outputs. In this work, we investigate if we can use CoTs to
predict final response misalignment. We evaluate a range of monitoring
approaches, including humans, highly-capable large language models, and text
classifiers, using either CoT text or activations. First, we find that a simple
linear probe trained on CoT activations can significantly outperform all
text-based methods in predicting whether a final response will be safe or
unsafe. CoT texts are often unfaithful and can mislead humans and classifiers,
while model latents (i.e., CoT activations) offer a more reliable predictive
signal. Second, the probe makes accurate predictions before reasoning
completes, achieving strong performance even when applied to early CoT
segments. These findings generalize across model sizes, families, and safety
benchmarks, suggesting that lightweight probes could enable real-time safety
monitoring and early intervention during generation.

*Suman Adhya,Debarshi Kumar Sanyal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: S2WTM通过球形切片Wasserstein距离解决VAE-NTMs中的后验坍塌问题，提升主题建模效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAE-NTMs在建模高维文本数据时易发生后验坍塌，导致潜在表示失效。

Method: 提出S2WTM，利用球形切片Wasserstein距离对齐后验分布与先验分布。

Result: S2WTM在生成主题的连贯性和多样性上优于现有模型，下游任务表现更佳。

Conclusion: S2WTM有效解决了后验坍塌问题，提升了主题建模性能。

Abstract: Modeling latent representations in a hyperspherical space has proven
effective for capturing directional similarities in high-dimensional text data,
benefiting topic modeling. Variational autoencoder-based neural topic models
(VAE-NTMs) commonly adopt the von Mises-Fisher prior to encode hyperspherical
structure. However, VAE-NTMs often suffer from posterior collapse, where the KL
divergence term in the objective function highly diminishes, leading to
ineffective latent representations. To mitigate this issue while modeling
hyperspherical structure in the latent space, we propose the Spherical Sliced
Wasserstein Autoencoder for Topic Modeling (S2WTM). S2WTM employs a prior
distribution supported on the unit hypersphere and leverages the Spherical
Sliced-Wasserstein distance to align the aggregated posterior distribution with
the prior. Experimental results demonstrate that S2WTM outperforms
state-of-the-art topic models, generating more coherent and diverse topics
while improving performance on downstream tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为BETR的显式优化数据选择方法，通过将预训练文档与基准测试示例对齐，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于探索显式优化数据选择方法的效果，以替代传统的隐式基准驱动迭代。

Method: 提出BETR方法，通过嵌入基准示例和预训练文档到共享空间，基于相似性评分选择数据，并训练轻量级分类器预测全语料库的评分。

Result: 实验表明，BETR在计算效率上优于基线方法（2.1倍），并在10个任务中的9个上表现更好。此外，BETR在多样化基准测试上也表现优异。

Conclusion: 结论指出，直接匹配预训练数据与目标任务能精确塑造模型能力，且数据选择策略需根据模型规模调整。

Abstract: Every data selection method inherently has a target. In practice, these
targets often emerge implicitly through benchmark-driven iteration: researchers
develop selection strategies, train models, measure benchmark performance, then
refine accordingly. This raises a natural question: what happens when we make
this optimization explicit? To explore this, we propose benchmark-targeted
ranking (BETR), a simple method that selects pretraining documents based on
similarity to benchmark training examples. BETR embeds benchmark examples and a
sample of pretraining documents in a shared space, scores this sample by
similarity to benchmarks, then trains a lightweight classifier to predict these
scores for the full corpus. We compare data selection methods by training over
500 models spanning $10^{19}$ to $10^{22}$ FLOPs and fitting scaling laws to
them. From this, we find that simply aligning pretraining data to evaluation
benchmarks using BETR achieves a 2.1x compute multiplier over DCLM-Baseline
(4.7x over unfiltered data) and improves performance on 9 out of 10 tasks
across all scales. BETR also generalizes well: when targeting a diverse set of
benchmarks disjoint from our evaluation suite, it still matches or outperforms
baselines. Our scaling analysis further reveals a clear trend: larger models
require less aggressive filtering. Overall, our findings show that directly
matching pretraining data to target tasks precisely shapes model capabilities
and highlight that optimal selection strategies must adapt to model scale.

Abstract: This paper asks whether our relationship with nature can move from human
dominance to genuine interdependence, and whether artificial intelligence (AI)
can mediate that shift. We examine a new ecological-design paradigm in which AI
interacts with non-human life forms. Through case studies we show how artists
and designers apply AI for data analysis, image recognition, and ecological
restoration, producing results that differ from conventional media. We argue
that AI not only expands creative methods but also reframes the theory and
practice of ecological design. Building on the author's prototype for
AI-assisted water remediation, the study proposes design pathways that couple
reinforcement learning with plant-based phytoremediation. The findings
highlight AI's potential to link scientific insight, artistic practice, and
environmental stewardship, offering a roadmap for future research on

Abstract: We introduce a modular harness design for LLM agents that composes of

backbone to tackle a wide spectrum of multi turn gaming environments without
domain-specific engineering. Using classic and modern game suites as
low-barrier, high-diversity testbeds, our framework provides a unified workflow
for analyzing how each module affects performance across dynamic interactive
settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the harness lifts gameplay
performance consistently over un-harnessed baselines and reveals distinct
contribution patterns, for example, memory dominates in long-horizon puzzles
while perception is critical in vision noisy arcades. These findings highlight
the effectiveness of our modular harness design in advancing general-purpose
agent, given the familiarity and ubiquity of games in everyday human
experience.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在缺乏明确成功标准的领域（如计算机使用），如何将人类直觉转化为可扩展的规则是一个挑战，MLLMs因其世界知识和对齐人类偏好的能力成为潜在解决方案。

Method: 提出自我基础验证（SGV），通过无条件生成和条件生成两步，利用MLLMs自身的采样机制优化验证过程。

Result: SGV显著提升了MLLMs的验证准确性（高达20个百分点），并在多个任务中实现了实时监督，性能超越之前最佳方法48%。

Conclusion: SGV方法有效解决了MLLMs的‘同意偏见’问题，显著提升了其在复杂任务中的验证能力。

Abstract: Verifiers -- functions assigning rewards to agent behavior -- have been key
for AI progress in domains like math and board games. However, extending these
gains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains
a challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this
intuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language
Models(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge,
human-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as
verifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and
robotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a
strong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often
generating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is
pervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several
methods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering). Notably, it occurs
despite MLLMs showing strong, human-aligned priors on desired behavior. To
address this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method
that enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing
their own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation. SGV
operates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to retrieve broad priors
about task completion, independent of the data under evaluation. Then,
conditioned on self-generated priors, it reasons over and evaluates a candidate
trajectory. Enhanced with SGV, MLLM verifiers show gains of up to 20 points in
accuracy and failure detection rates, and can perform real-time supervision of
heterogeneous agents, boosting task completion of a GUI specialist in OSWorld,
a diffusion policy in robomimic, and a ReAct agent in VisualWebArena -- setting
a new state of the art on the benchmark, surpassing the previous best by 48%.

Motivation: 动态规划（DP）建模需要专业知识，LLM可自动化此过程，但面临数据稀缺和随机性挑战。

Method: 提出DPLM模型和DualReflect数据生成方法，结合前向和后向生成以提升多样性和可靠性。

Result: DPLM性能媲美主流LLM，在难题上表现更优，DualReflect在低数据和高数据场景下各有优势。

Conclusion: 结合前向和后向生成的方法能有效解决DP问题中LLM的数据和多样性挑战。

Abstract: Dynamic programming (DP) is a fundamental method in operations research, but
formulating DP models has traditionally required expert knowledge of both the
problem context and DP techniques. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the
potential to automate this process. However, DP problems pose unique challenges
due to their inherently stochastic transitions and the limited availability of
training data. These factors make it difficult to directly apply existing
LLM-based models or frameworks developed for other optimization problems, such
as linear or integer programming. We introduce DP-Bench, the first benchmark
covering a wide range of textbook-level DP problems to enable systematic
evaluation. We present Dynamic Programming Language Model (DPLM), a
7B-parameter specialized model that achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art LLMs like OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, and surpasses them on
hard problems. Central to DPLM's effectiveness is DualReflect, our novel
synthetic data generation pipeline, designed to scale up training data from a
limited set of initial examples. DualReflect combines forward generation for
diversity and backward generation for reliability. Our results reveal a key
insight: backward generation is favored in low-data regimes for its strong
correctness guarantees, while forward generation, though lacking such
guarantees, becomes increasingly valuable at scale for introducing diverse
formulations. This trade-off highlights the complementary strengths of both
approaches and the importance of combining them.

Conclusion: 该方法成功利用GPU并行计算优化了DFS，并保持了最优性保证。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of GPU technology has unlocked powerful parallel
processing capabilities, creating new opportunities to enhance classic search
algorithms. A recent successful application of GPUs is in compressing large
pattern database (PDB) heuristics using neural networks while preserving
heuristic admissibility. However, very few algorithms have been designed to
exploit GPUs during search. Several variants of A* exist that batch GPU
computations. In this paper we introduce a method for batching GPU computations
in depth first search. In particular, we describe a new cost-bounded
depth-first search (CB-DFS) method that leverages the combined parallelism of
modern CPUs and GPUs. This is used to create algorithms like \emph{Batch IDA*},
an extension of the Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*) algorithm, or Batch BTS, an
extensions of Budgeted Tree Search. Our approach builds on the general approach
used by Asynchronous Parallel IDA* (AIDA*), while maintaining optimality
guarantees. We evaluate the approach on the 3x3 Rubik's Cube and 4x4 sliding
tile puzzle (STP), showing that GPU operations can be efficiently batched in
DFS. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to analyze the effects of
hyperparameters, neural network heuristic size, and hardware resources on
performance.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) are
emerging as a powerful paradigm for solving complex, multifaceted problems.
However, the potential of these systems is often constrained by the prevalent
plan-and-execute framework, which suffers from critical limitations: rigid plan
execution, static agent capabilities, and inefficient communication. These
weaknesses hinder their adaptability and robustness in dynamic environments.
This paper introduces Aime, a novel multi-agent framework designed to overcome
these challenges through dynamic, reactive planning and execution. Aime
replaces the conventional static workflow with a fluid and adaptive
architecture. Its core innovations include: (1) a Dynamic Planner that
continuously refines the overall strategy based on real-time execution
feedback; (2) an Actor Factory that implements Dynamic Actor instantiation,
assembling specialized agents on-demand with tailored tools and knowledge; and
(3) a centralized Progress Management Module that serves as a single source of
truth for coherent, system-wide state awareness. We empirically evaluated Aime
on a diverse suite of benchmarks spanning general reasoning (GAIA), software
engineering (SWE-bench Verified), and live web navigation (WebVoyager). The
results demonstrate that Aime consistently outperforms even highly specialized
state-of-the-art agents in their respective domains. Its superior adaptability
and task success rate establish Aime as a more resilient and effective
foundation for multi-agent collaboration.

Result: 训练后的无人机主要关注光流不连续区域和大光流区域，行为类似昆虫。

Conclusion: 该方法可能为无人机开发简单明确的控制策略提供有效思路。

Abstract: Bio-inspired design is often used in autonomous UAV navigation due to the
capacity of biological systems for flight and obstacle avoidance despite
limited sensory and computational capabilities. In particular, honeybees mainly
use the sensory input of optic flow, the apparent motion of objects in their
visual field, to navigate cluttered environments. In our work, we train a
Reinforcement Learning agent to navigate a tunnel with obstacles using only
optic flow as sensory input. We inspect the attention patterns of trained
agents to determine the regions of optic flow on which they primarily base
their motor decisions. We find that agents trained in this way pay most
attention to regions of discontinuity in optic flow, as well as regions with
large optic flow magnitude. The trained agents appear to navigate a cluttered
tunnel by avoiding the obstacles that produce large optic flow, while
maintaining a centered position in their environment, which resembles the
behavior seen in flying insects. This pattern persists across independently
trained agents, which suggests that this could be a good strategy for
developing a simple explicit control law for physical UAVs.

Conclusion: TPE-MARL成功平衡了探索与利用，适用于混合和完全自动驾驶场景，为MARL在动态交通中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The exploration-exploitation trade-off constitutes one of the fundamental
challenges in reinforcement learning (RL), which is exacerbated in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) due to the exponential growth of joint
state-action spaces. This paper proposes a topology-enhanced MARL (TPE-MARL)
method for optimizing cooperative decision-making of connected and autonomous
vehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic. This work presents two primary contributions:
First, we construct a game topology tensor for dynamic traffic flow,
effectively compressing high-dimensional traffic state information and decrease
the search space for MARL algorithms. Second, building upon the designed game
topology tensor and using QMIX as the backbone RL algorithm, we establish a
topology-enhanced MARL framework incorporating visit counts and agent mutual
information. Extensive simulations across varying traffic densities and CAV
penetration rates demonstrate the effectiveness of TPE-MARL. Evaluations
encompassing training dynamics, exploration patterns, macroscopic traffic
performance metrics, and microscopic vehicle behaviors reveal that TPE-MARL
successfully balances exploration and exploitation. Consequently, it exhibits
superior performance in terms of traffic efficiency, safety, decision
smoothness, and task completion. Furthermore, the algorithm demonstrates
decision-making rationality comparable to or exceeding that of human drivers in
both mixed-autonomy and fully autonomous traffic scenarios. Code of our work is

Abstract: This paper proposes Partially Observable Reference Policy Programming, a
novel anytime online approximate POMDP solver which samples meaningful future

provide theoretical guarantees for the algorithm's underlying scheme which say
that the performance loss is bounded by the average of the sampling
approximation errors rather than the usual maximum, a crucial requirement given
the sampling sparsity of online planning. Empirical evaluations on two
large-scale problems with dynamically evolving environments -- including a
helicopter emergency scenario in the Corsica region requiring approximately 150
planning steps -- corroborate the theoretical results and indicate that our
solver considerably outperforms current online benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该研究为在空间复杂领域开发通用战略智能提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Game playing has long served as a fundamental benchmark for evaluating
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). While Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated impressive capabilities in general reasoning, their effectiveness
in spatial strategic reasoning, which is critical for complex and fully
observable board games, remains insufficiently explored. In this work, we adopt
Chinese Chess (Xiangqi) as a challenging and rich testbed due to its intricate
rules and spatial complexity. To advance LLMs' strategic competence in such
environments, we propose a training framework tailored to Xiangqi, built upon a
large-scale dataset of five million board-move pairs enhanced with expert
annotations and engine evaluations. Building on this foundation, we introduce
Xiangqi-R1, a 7B-parameter model trained in multi-stage manner: (1) fine-tuning
for legal move prediction to capture basic spatial rules, (2) incorporating
strategic annotations to improve decision-making, and (3) applying
reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with
multi-dimensional reward signals to enhance reasoning stability. Our
Experimental results indicate that, despite their size and power,
general-purpose LLMs struggle to achieve satisfactory performance in these
tasks. Compared to general-purpose LLMs, Xiangqi-R1 greatly advances with an
18% rise in move legality and a 22% boost in analysis accuracy. Our results
point to a promising path for creating general strategic intelligence in
spatially complex areas.

Conclusion: CompressedVQA-HDR框架有效解决了HDR视频质量评估问题，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Video compression is a standard procedure applied to all videos to minimize
storage and transmission demands while preserving visual quality as much as
possible. Therefore, evaluating the visual quality of compressed videos is
crucial for guiding the practical usage and further development of video
compression algorithms. Although numerous compressed video quality assessment
(VQA) methods have been proposed, they often lack the generalization capability
needed to handle the increasing diversity of video types, particularly high
dynamic range (HDR) content. In this paper, we introduce CompressedVQA-HDR, an
effective VQA framework designed to address the challenges of HDR video quality
assessment. Specifically, we adopt the Swin Transformer and SigLip 2 as the
backbone networks for the proposed full-reference (FR) and no-reference (NR)
VQA models, respectively. For the FR model, we compute deep structural and
textural similarities between reference and distorted frames using
intermediate-layer features extracted from the Swin Transformer as its
quality-aware feature representation. For the NR model, we extract the global
mean of the final-layer feature maps from SigLip 2 as its quality-aware
representation. To mitigate the issue of limited HDR training data, we
pre-train the FR model on a large-scale standard dynamic range (SDR) VQA
dataset and fine-tune it on the HDRSDR-VQA dataset. For the NR model, we employ
an iterative mixed-dataset training strategy across multiple compressed VQA
datasets, followed by fine-tuning on the HDRSDR-VQA dataset. Experimental
results show that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to
existing FR and NR VQA models. Moreover, CompressedVQA-HDR-FR won first place
in the FR track of the Generalizable HDR & SDR Video Quality Measurement Grand
Challenge at IEEE ICME 2025. The code is available at

Abstract: Quantifiable image patterns associated with disease progression and treatment
response are critical tools for guiding individual treatment, and for
developing novel therapies. Here, we show that unsupervised machine learning
can identify a pattern vocabulary of liver tissue in magnetic resonance images
that quantifies treatment response in diffuse liver disease. Deep clustering
networks simultaneously encode and cluster patches of medical images into a
low-dimensional latent space to establish a tissue vocabulary. The resulting
tissue types capture differential tissue change and its location in the liver
associated with treatment response. We demonstrate the utility of the
vocabulary on a randomized controlled trial cohort of non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis patients. First, we use the vocabulary to compare longitudinal
liver change in a placebo and a treatment cohort. Results show that the method
identifies specific liver tissue change pathways associated with treatment, and
enables a better separation between treatment groups than established
non-imaging measures. Moreover, we show that the vocabulary can predict biopsy
derived features from non-invasive imaging data. We validate the method on a
separate replication cohort to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed
method.

Abstract: Cortical lesions (CLs) have emerged as valuable biomarkers in multiple
sclerosis (MS), offering high diagnostic specificity and prognostic relevance.
However, their routine clinical integration remains limited due to subtle
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) appearance, challenges in expert annotation,
and a lack of standardized automated methods. We propose a comprehensive
multi-centric benchmark of CL detection and segmentation in MRI. A total of 656
MRI scans, including clinical trial and research data from four institutions,
were acquired at 3T and 7T using MP2RAGE and MPRAGE sequences with
expert-consensus annotations. We rely on the self-configuring nnU-Net
framework, designed for medical imaging segmentation, and propose adaptations
tailored to the improved CL detection. We evaluated model generalization
through out-of-distribution testing, demonstrating strong lesion detection
capabilities with an F1-score of 0.64 and 0.5 in and out of the domain,
respectively. We also analyze internal model features and model errors for a
better understanding of AI decision-making. Our study examines how data
variability, lesion ambiguity, and protocol differences impact model
performance, offering future recommendations to address these barriers to
clinical adoption. To reinforce the reproducibility, the implementation and
models will be publicly accessible and ready to use at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索WebGPU在实时布料模拟中的潜力，解决传统WebGL方法在复杂物理模拟中的局限性。

Result: WebGPU在高分辨率模拟中表现优异，可处理640K节点和100K三角形表面模型的实时碰撞。

Conclusion: WebGPU在实时布料模拟中具有显著优势，平衡了性能与真实感渲染的需求。

Abstract: This study explores the capabilities of WebGPU, an emerging web graphics
paradigm, for real-time cloth simulation. Traditional WebGL-based methods have
been in handling complex physical simulations due to their emphasis on graphics
rendering rather than general-purpose GPU (GPGPU) operations. WebGPU, designed
to provide modern 3D graphics and computational capabilities, offers
significant improvements through parallel processing and support for
computational shaders. In this work, we implemented a cloth simulation system
using the Mass-Spring Method within the WebGPU framework, integrating collision
detection and response handling with the 3D surface model. First, comparative
performance evaluations demonstrate that WebGPU substantially outperforms
WebGL, particularly in high-resolution simulations, maintaining 60 frames per
second (fps) even with up to 640K nodes. The second experiment aimed to
determine the real-time limitations of WebGPU and confirmed that WebGPU can
handle real-time collisions between 4K and 100k cloth node models and a 100K
triangle surface model in real-time. These experiments also highlight the
importance of balancing real-time performance with realistic rendering when
handling collisions between cloth models and complex 3D objects. Our source

Motivation: 探索不同实验方法和自动技术对视觉保真度的测量和预测效果，以改进相关技术。

Method: 使用多边形模型，通过两种简化算法改变保真度，采用命名时间、评分和偏好三种实验测量方法，并测试多种自动预测技术。

Result: 实验测量方法对简化类型和程度敏感，但对物体类型反应不同；自动技术能较好预测评分，但对偏好和命名时间预测效果较差。

Conclusion: 提出了改进实验和自动测量视觉保真度的建议。

Abstract: This paper is a study of techniques for measuring and predicting visual
fidelity. As visual stimuli we use polygonal models, and vary their fidelity
with two different model simplification algorithms. We also group the stimuli
into two object types: animals and man made artifacts. We examine three
different experimental techniques for measuring these fidelity changes: naming
times, ratings, and preferences. All the measures were sensitive to the type of
simplification and level of simplification. However, the measures differed from
one another in their response to object type. We also examine several automatic
techniques for predicting these experimental measures, including techniques
based on images and on the models themselves. Automatic measures of fidelity
were successful at predicting experimental ratings, less successful at
predicting preferences, and largely failures at predicting naming times. We
conclude with suggestions for use and improvement of the experimental and
automatic measures of visual fidelity.

Abstract: Enabling virtual humans to dynamically and realistically respond to diverse
auditory stimuli remains a key challenge in character animation, demanding the
integration of perceptual modeling and motion synthesis. Despite its
significance, this task remains largely unexplored. Most previous works have
primarily focused on mapping modalities like speech, audio, and music to
generate human motion. As of yet, these models typically overlook the impact of
spatial features encoded in spatial audio signals on human motion. To bridge
this gap and enable high-quality modeling of human movements in response to
spatial audio, we introduce the first comprehensive Spatial Audio-Driven Human
Motion (SAM) dataset, which contains diverse and high-quality spatial audio and
motion data. For benchmarking, we develop a simple yet effective
diffusion-based generative framework for human MOtion generation driven by
SPatial Audio, termed MOSPA, which faithfully captures the relationship between
body motion and spatial audio through an effective fusion mechanism. Once
trained, MOSPA could generate diverse realistic human motions conditioned on
varying spatial audio inputs. We perform a thorough investigation of the
proposed dataset and conduct extensive experiments for benchmarking, where our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance on this task. Our model and
dataset will be open-sourced upon acceptance. Please refer to our supplementary
video for more details.

Motivation: 现有3D表示方法（如网格、NeRF等）在通用性、编辑性和复杂性之间存在显著局限性，无法同时满足重建、生成、编辑和驱动等多任务需求。

Method: 通过稀疏的分层组织（树状结构）代理节点表示物体的形状和纹理，每个节点存储局部信息（由小型MLP隐式编码），并通过神经插值和轻量解码实现高效查询。

Conclusion: 提出的分层代理节点表示方法在通用性、编辑性和复杂性之间取得了显著平衡，为3D表示提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Current 3D representations like meshes, voxels, point clouds, and NeRF-based
neural implicit fields exhibit significant limitations: they are often
task-specific, lacking universal applicability across reconstruction,
generation, editing, and driving. While meshes offer high precision, their
dense vertex data complicates editing; NeRFs deliver excellent rendering but
suffer from structural ambiguity, hindering animation and manipulation; all
representations inherently struggle with the trade-off between data complexity
and fidelity. To overcome these issues, we introduce a novel 3D Hierarchical
Proxy Node representation. Its core innovation lies in representing an object's
shape and texture via a sparse set of hierarchically organized
(tree-structured) proxy nodes distributed on its surface and interior. Each
node stores local shape and texture information (implicitly encoded by a small
MLP) within its neighborhood. Querying any 3D coordinate's properties involves
efficient neural interpolation and lightweight decoding from relevant nearby
and parent nodes. This framework yields a highly compact representation where
nodes align with local semantics, enabling direct drag-and-edit manipulation,
and offers scalable quality-complexity control. Extensive experiments across 3D
reconstruction and editing demonstrate our method's expressive efficiency,
high-fidelity rendering quality, and superior editability.

Result: 实验表明，SmokeSVD在重建质量上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: SmokeSVD通过生成与物理一致的视图，显著提升了单视图重建的效果。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic fluids from sparse views is a long-standing and
challenging problem, due to the severe lack of 3D information from insufficient
view coverage. While several pioneering approaches have attempted to address
this issue using differentiable rendering or novel view synthesis, they are
often limited by time-consuming optimization and refinement processes under
ill-posed conditions. To tackle above challenges, we propose SmokeSVD, an
efficient and effective framework to progressively generate and reconstruct
dynamic smoke from a single video by integrating both the powerful generative
capabilities from diffusion models and physically guided consistency
optimization towards realistic appearance and dynamic evolution. Specifically,
we first propose a physically guided side-view synthesizer based on diffusion
models, which explicitly incorporates divergence and gradient guidance of
velocity fields to generate visually realistic and spatio-temporally consistent
side-view images frame by frame, significantly alleviating the ill-posedness of
single-view reconstruction without imposing additional constraints.
Subsequently, we determine a rough estimation of density field from the pair of
front-view input and side-view synthetic image, and further refine 2D blurry
novel-view images and 3D coarse-grained density field through an iterative
process that progressively renders and enhances the images from increasing
novel viewing angles, generating high-quality multi-view image sequences.
Finally, we reconstruct and estimate the fine-grained density field, velocity
field, and smoke source via differentiable advection by leveraging the
Navier-Stokes equations. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments
show that our approach achieves high-quality reconstruction and outperforms
previous state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: It is demanding to author an existing hairstyle for novel characters in games
and VR applications. However, it is a non-trivial task for artists due to the
complicated hair geometries and spatial interactions to preserve. In this
paper, we present an automatic shape adaptation method to retarget 3D
hairstyles. We formulate the adaptation process as a constrained optimization
problem, where all the shape properties and spatial relationships are converted
into individual objectives and constraints. To make such an optimization on
high-resolution hairstyles tractable, we adopt a multi-scale strategy to
compute the target positions of the hair strands in a coarse-to-fine manner.
The global solving for the inter-strands coupling is restricted to the coarse
level, and the solving for fine details is made local and parallel. In
addition, we present a novel hairline edit tool to allow for user customization
during retargeting. We achieve it by solving physics-based deformations of an
embedded membrane to redistribute the hair roots with minimal distortion. We
demonstrate the efficacy of our method through quantitative and qualitative
experiments on various hairstyles and characters.
