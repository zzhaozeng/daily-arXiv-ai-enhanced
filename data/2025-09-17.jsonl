For rasterization and other tasks, it is often\nnecessary to extract a mesh that represents the shape. Unbounded scenes with\nlong-range camera trajectories, such as flying through a forest, pose a unique\nchallenge for mesh extraction. A single static mesh representing all the\ngeometric detail necessary for the full camera path can be prohibitively large.\nTherefore, independent meshes can be extracted for different camera views, but\nthis approach may lead to popping artifacts during transitions. We propose a\ntemporally coherent method for extracting meshes suitable for long-range camera\ntrajectories in unbounded scenes represented by an occupancy function. The key\nidea is to perform 4D mesh extraction using a new spacetime tree structure\ncalled a binary-octree. Experiments show that, compared to existing baseline\nmethods, our method offers superior visual consistency at a comparable cost.\nThe code and the supplementary video for this paper are available at\nhttps://github.com/princeton-vl/BinocMesher."}

Dermoscopy aids melanoma triage, yet image-only AI often\nignores patient metadata (age, sex, site) and the physical scale needed for\ngeometric analysis. We present GraphDerm, a population-graph framework that\nfuses imaging, millimeter-scale calibration, and metadata for multiclass\ndermoscopic classification, to the best of our knowledge the first ISIC-scale\napplication of GNNs to dermoscopy.

Pixels-per-millimeter are\nregressed from the ruler-mask two-point correlation via a lightweight 1D-CNN.\nFrom lesion masks we compute real-scale descriptors (area, perimeter, radius of\ngyration). Node features use EfficientNet-B3; edges encode metadata/geometry\nsimilarity (fully weighted or thresholded). A spectral GNN performs\nsemi-supervised node classification; an image-only ANN is the baseline.\nResults.

This challenge is further amplified in multi-label scenarios, where data\nexhibit complex characteristics such as label co-occurrence, inter-label\ndependency, and discrepancies between local and global label relationships.\nWhile most existing FL research primarily focuses on single-label\nclassification, many real-world applications, particularly in domains such as\nmedical imaging, often involve multi-label settings. In this paper, we address\nthis important yet underexplored scenario in FL, where clients hold multi-label\ndata with skewed label distributions. Neural Collapse (NC) describes a\ngeometric structure in the latent feature space where features of each class\ncollapse to their class mean with vanishing intra-class variance, and the class\nmeans form a maximally separated configuration. Motivated by this theory, we\npropose a method to align feature distributions across clients and to learn\nhigh-quality, well-clustered representations. To make the NC-structure\napplicable to multi-label settings, where image-level features may contain\nmultiple semantic concepts, we introduce a feature disentanglement module that\nextracts semantically specific features. The clustering of these disentangled\nclass-wise features is guided by a predefined shared NC structure, which\nmitigates potential conflicts between client models due to diverse local data\ndistributions. In addition, we design regularisation losses to encourage\ncompact clustering in the latent feature space. Experiments conducted on four\nbenchmark datasets across eight diverse settings demonstrate that our approach\noutperforms existing methods, validating its effectiveness in this challenging\nFL scenario."}

We employ this\nbenchmark to assess the performance of several open-weight LLMs. Our results\nfirst reveal that while LLMs can satisfy certain constraints, they struggle to\nmeet all evaluation criteria consistently. They also show that reasoning LLMs,\nlike QwQ and GPT-oss, significantly outperform traditional models such as\nLlama, Qwen or Mistral, defined here as models used without any dedicated\nreasoning mechanisms. Moreover, we observed that LLMs reacted differently to\nthe various prompting strategies tested, which include Chain-of-Thought,\nIn-Context Learning and role-based prompting, with no prompt consistently\noffering the best performance. Finally, we report the performances from\niterative prompting with auto-generated feedback and show that they are not\nmonotonic; they can peak early and then significantly decline in later\nattempts. Overall, this work offers a new perspective on model reasoning\nperformance and the effectiveness of prompting strategies in combinatorial\noptimization problems with preferential constraints."}

Specifically, Defense2Attack consists of three key components:\n(1) a visual optimizer that embeds universal adversarial perturbations with\naffirmative and encouraging semantics; (2) a textual optimizer that refines the\ninput using a defense-styled prompt; and (3) a red-team suffix generator that\nenhances the jailbreak through reinforcement fine-tuning.

Dermoscopy aids melanoma triage, yet image-only AI often\nignores patient metadata (age, sex, site) and the physical scale needed for\ngeometric analysis. We present GraphDerm, a population-graph framework that\nfuses imaging, millimeter-scale calibration, and metadata for multiclass\ndermoscopic classification, to the best of our knowledge the first ISIC-scale\napplication of GNNs to dermoscopy. Methods. We curate ISIC 2018/2019,\nsynthesize ruler-embedded images with exact masks, and train U-Nets\n(SE-ResNet-18) for lesion and ruler segmentation. Pixels-per-millimeter are\nregressed from the ruler-mask two-point correlation via a lightweight 1D-CNN.\nFrom lesion masks we compute real-scale descriptors (area, perimeter, radius of\ngyration). Node features use EfficientNet-B3; edges encode metadata/geometry\nsimilarity (fully weighted or thresholded). A spectral GNN performs\nsemi-supervised node classification; an image-only ANN is the baseline.\nResults. Ruler and lesion segmentation reach Dice 0.904 and 0.908; scale\nregression attains MAE 1.5 px (RMSE 6.6). The graph attains AUC 0.9812, with a\nthresholded variant using about 25% of edges preserving AUC 0.9788 (vs. 0.9440\nfor the image-only baseline); per-class AUCs typically fall in the 0.97-0.99\nrange.

To tackle these\nchallenges, this paper proposes TFANet, a Three-stage Image-Text Feature\nAlignment Network that systematically enhances multimodal alignment through a\nhierarchical framework comprising three stages: Knowledge Plus Stage (KPS),\nKnowledge Fusion Stage (KFS), and Knowledge Intensification Stage (KIS).

This enables the encoder to\njointly capture fine-grained spectral continuity, spatial structure, and global\nsemantic features. Unlike prior dual-task SSL methods, CMTSSL simultaneously\naddresses spatial and spectral reasoning within a unified and computationally\nefficient design, being particularly suitable for training lightweight models\nfor onboard satellite deployment. We validate our approach on four public\nbenchmark datasets, demonstrating consistent gains in downstream segmentation\ntasks, using architectures that are over 16,000x lighter than some\nstate-of-the-art models. These results highlight the potential of CMTSSL in\ngeneralizable representation learning with lightweight architectures for\nreal-world HSI applications.

However, computing frame-level features for these tasks is\ncomputationally expensive given the temporal resolution requirements. In this\npaper, we make three contributions to reduce the cost of computing features for\ntemporally dense tasks. First, we introduce a vision transformer (ViT)\narchitecture, dubbed ResidualViT, that leverages the large temporal redundancy\nin videos to efficiently compute temporally dense frame-level features. Our\narchitecture incorporates (i) learnable residual connections that ensure\ntemporal consistency across consecutive frames and (ii) a token reduction\nmodule that enhances processing speed by selectively discarding temporally\nredundant information while reusing weights of a pretrained foundation model.\nSecond, we propose a lightweight distillation strategy to approximate the\nframe-level features of the original foundation model. Finally, we evaluate our\napproach across four tasks and five datasets, in both zero-shot and fully\nsupervised settings, demonstrating significant reductions in computational cost\n(up to 60%) and improvements in inference speed (up to 2.5x faster), all while\nclosely approximating the accuracy of the original foundation model."}

While impressive progress has been made in\ngenerating 3D objects from text or images, creating style-controllable 3D\nassets remains a complex and challenging problem. In this work, we propose\nStyleSculptor, a novel training-free approach for generating style-guided 3D\nassets from a content image and one or more style images. Unlike previous\nworks, StyleSculptor achieves style-guided 3D generation in a zero-shot manner,\nenabling fine-grained 3D style control that captures the texture, geometry, or\nboth styles of user-provided style images. At the core of StyleSculptor is a\nnovel Style Disentangled Attention (SD-Attn) module, which establishes a\ndynamic interaction between the input content image and style image for\nstyle-guided 3D asset generation via a cross-3D attention mechanism, enabling\nstable feature fusion and effective style-guided generation. To alleviate\nsemantic content leakage, we also introduce a style-disentangled feature\nselection strategy within the SD-Attn module, which leverages the variance of\n3D feature patches to disentangle style- and content-significant channels,\nallowing selective feature injection within the attention framework. With\nSD-Attn, the network can dynamically compute texture-, geometry-, or\nboth-guided features to steer the 3D generation process. Built upon this, we\nfurther propose the Style Guided Control (SGC) mechanism, which enables\nexclusive geometry- or texture-only stylization, as well as adjustable style\nintensity control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StyleSculptor\noutperforms existing baseline methods in producing high-fidelity 3D assets."}

We evaluated multimodal large language\nmodels (MLLMs) for DR detection and their ability to simulate clinical AI\nassistance across different output types. Two models were tested on IDRiD and\nMessidor-2: GPT-4o, a general-purpose MLLM, and MedGemma, an open-source\nmedical model. Experiments included: (1) baseline evaluation, (2) simulated AI\nassistance with synthetic predictions, and (3) actual AI-to-AI collaboration\nwhere GPT-4o incorporated MedGemma outputs.
