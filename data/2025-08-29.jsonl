However, scaling diffusion transformers to generate long-context\nvideos is fundamentally limited by the quadratic cost of self-attention, which\nmakes memory and computation intractable and difficult to optimize for long\nsequences. We recast long-context video generation as an internal information\nretrieval task and propose a simple, learnable sparse attention routing module,\nMixture of Contexts (MoC), as an effective long-term memory retrieval engine.\nIn MoC, each query dynamically selects a few informative chunks plus mandatory\nanchors (caption, local windows) to attend to, with causal routing that\nprevents loop closures. As we scale the data and gradually sparsify the\nrouting, the model allocates compute to salient history, preserving identities,\nactions, and scenes over minutes of content. Efficiency follows as a byproduct\nof retrieval (near-linear scaling), which enables practical training and\nsynthesis, and the emergence of memory and consistency at the scale of minutes."}

To uncover the functional roles of different\nlayers, we evaluate these probes under three types of controlled prompt\nvariations: (1) lexical variants that test sensitivity to surface-level\nchanges, (2) semantic negation variants that flip the expected answer by\nmodifying the visual concept in the prompt, and (3) output format variants that\npreserve reasoning but alter the answer format. Applying our framework to\nLLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, and Qwen2-VL, we identify a consistent\nstage-wise structure in which early layers perform visual grounding, middle\nlayers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers\nprepare task-specific outputs.

In parallel, we design a semantic-aware normal field constraint that\npreserves geometric coherence in regions with clear semantic cues, reducing\nuncertainty from the unstable 3D representation. This dual-branch mechanism\nforms a complementary loop: enhanced spatial perception improves semantic\nclassification, and robust semantic predictions further refine spatial\nunderstanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DUO over\nexisting methods across various datasets and domain shift types."}

To address\nthese issues, we propose GDLLM, a Global Distance-aware modeling approach based\non LLMs. We first present a distance-aware graph structure utilizing Graph\nAttention Network(GAT) to assist the LLMs in capturing long-distance dependency\nfeatures. Additionally, we design a temporal feature learning paradigm based on\nsoft inference to augment the identification of relations with a short-distance\nproximity band, which supplements the probabilistic information generated by\nLLMs into the multi-head attention mechanism. Since the global feature can be\ncaptured effectively, our framework substantially enhances the performance of\nminority relation classes and improves the overall learning ability.\nExperiments on two publicly available datasets, TB-Dense and MATRES,\ndemonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance."}

We train linear classifiers to predict fine-grained visual categories\n(e.g., dog breeds) from token embeddings extracted at each layer, using a\nstandardized anchor question. To uncover the functional roles of different\nlayers, we evaluate these probes under three types of controlled prompt\nvariations: (1) lexical variants that test sensitivity to surface-level\nchanges, (2) semantic negation variants that flip the expected answer by\nmodifying the visual concept in the prompt, and (3) output format variants that\npreserve reasoning but alter the answer format. Applying our framework to\nLLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, and Qwen2-VL, we identify a consistent\nstage-wise structure in which early layers perform visual grounding, middle\nlayers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers\nprepare task-specific outputs.

ROSI operates as a simple,\nfine-tuning-free rank-one weight modification applied to all residual stream\nwrite matrices.

To address this challenge, we propose AvatarBack, a\nnovel plug-and-play framework specifically designed to reconstruct complete and\nconsistent 3D Gaussian avatars by explicitly modeling the missing back-head\nregions. AvatarBack integrates two core technical innovations,i.e., the\nSubject-specific Generator (SSG) and the Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy\n(ASA). The former leverages a generative prior to synthesize\nidentity-consistent, plausible back-view pseudo-images from sparse frontal\ninputs, providing robust multi-view supervision. To achieve precise geometric\nalignment between these synthetic views and the 3D Gaussian representation, the\nlater employs learnable transformation matrices optimized during training,\neffectively resolving inherent pose and coordinate discrepancies.

Our results show that the Diffusion\nClassifier and ViLT perform well at concept binding tasks, but that all models\nstruggle significantly with the relational GZSL task, underscoring the broader\nchallenges VLMs face with relational reasoning. Analysis of CLIP embeddings\nsuggests that the difficulty may stem from overly similar representations of\nrelational concepts such as left and right.

We recast long-context video generation as an internal information\nretrieval task and propose a simple, learnable sparse attention routing module,\nMixture of Contexts (MoC), as an effective long-term memory retrieval engine.\nIn MoC, each query dynamically selects a few informative chunks plus mandatory\nanchors (caption, local windows) to attend to, with causal routing that\nprevents loop closures. As we scale the data and gradually sparsify the\nrouting, the model allocates compute to salient history, preserving identities,\nactions, and scenes over minutes of content.

To address this challenge, we\nintroduce novel methods that mitigate data scarcity by leveraging readily\navailable web data. We utilize a large collection of manually forged images\nfrom the web, as well as automatically generated annotations derived from a\nsimpler auxiliary task, constrained image manipulation localization.\nSpecifically, we introduce a new paradigm CAAAv2, which automatically and\naccurately annotates manipulated regions at the pixel level. To further improve\nannotation quality, we propose a novel metric, QES, which filters out\nunreliable annotations. Through CAAA v2 and QES, we construct MIMLv2, a\nlarge-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset containing 246,212 manually\nforged images with pixel-level mask annotations. This is over 120x larger than\nexisting handcrafted datasets like IMD20.

Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method\nsuccessfully achieves near-perfect watermark removal (95.7%) with negligible\nimpact on the residual image's quality. We hope that our attacks inspire the\ndevelopment of more robust image watermarking methods."}

In response, governments have issued ethics guidelines\nto promote the development of trustworthy AI. However, these guidelines are\ntypically high-level demands for developers and testers, leaving a gap in\ntranslating them into actionable testing questions to verify LLM compliance.\n  To address this challenge, we introduce GUARD (\\textbf{G}uideline\n\\textbf{U}pholding Test through \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{R}ole-play and\nJailbreak \\textbf{D}iagnostics), a testing method designed to operationalize\nguidelines into specific guideline-violating questions that assess LLM\nadherence. To implement this, GUARD uses automated generation of\nguideline-violating questions based on government-issued guidelines, thereby\ntesting whether responses comply with these guidelines. When responses directly\nviolate guidelines, GUARD reports inconsistencies. Furthermore, for responses\nthat do not directly violate guidelines, GUARD integrates the concept of\n``jailbreaks'' to diagnostics, named GUARD-JD, which creates scenarios that\nprovoke unethical or guideline-violating responses, effectively identifying\npotential scenarios that could bypass built-in safety mechanisms. Our method\nfinally culminates in a compliance report, delineating the extent of adherence\nand highlighting any violations.\n  We have empirically validated the effectiveness of GUARD on seven LLMs,\nincluding Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, Llama2-7B, Llama-3-8B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4,\nGPT-4o, and Claude-3.7, by testing compliance under three government-issued\nguidelines and conducting jailbreak diagnostics. Additionally, GUARD-JD can\ntransfer jailbreak diagnostics to vision-language models, demonstrating its\nusage in promoting reliable LLM-based applications."}

However, scaling diffusion transformers to generate long-context\nvideos is fundamentally limited by the quadratic cost of self-attention, which\nmakes memory and computation intractable and difficult to optimize for long\nsequences. We recast long-context video generation as an internal information\nretrieval task and propose a simple, learnable sparse attention routing module,\nMixture of Contexts (MoC), as an effective long-term memory retrieval engine.\nIn MoC, each query dynamically selects a few informative chunks plus mandatory\nanchors (caption, local windows) to attend to, with causal routing that\nprevents loop closures. As we scale the data and gradually sparsify the\nrouting, the model allocates compute to salient history, preserving identities,\nactions, and scenes over minutes of content. Efficiency follows as a byproduct\nof retrieval (near-linear scaling), which enables practical training and\nsynthesis, and the emergence of memory and consistency at the scale of minutes."}
