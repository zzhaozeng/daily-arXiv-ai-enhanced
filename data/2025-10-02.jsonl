The key challenge lies in ensuring that the model completely\nforgets the knowledge of the forget set without compromising its overall\nutility. Existing unlearning methods for large language models (LLMs) often\nutilize auxiliary language models, retain datasets, or even commercial AI\nservices for effective unlearning and maintaining the model utility. However,\ndependence on these external resources is often impractical and could\npotentially introduce additional privacy risks. In this work, we propose direct\ntoken optimization (DTO), a novel self-contained unlearning approach for LLMs\nthat directly optimizes the token level objectives and eliminates the need for\nexternal resources. Given a sequence to unlearn, we identify two categories of\ntokens: target tokens, which capture critical knowledge for unlearning, and the\nremaining non-target tokens, which are crucial for maintaining the model\nutility. The former are used to optimize the unlearning objective, while the\nlatter serve to preserve the model's performance. The experimental results show\nthat the proposed DTO achieves up to 16.8$\\times$ improvement in forget quality\non several benchmark datasets than the latest baselines while maintaining a\ncomparable level of model utility."}

To address this gap, we present the first\nopen-source RAG pipeline for ELMs, along with baselines and ablation studies\nfor NLG. Experiments on three public datasets show that ELMs with RAG\nconsistently improves performance over non-RAG baselines and highlights key ELM\ndesign considerations.

HunyuanImage 2.1 and Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large also reproduce\ngender stereotypes but with varying degrees of sensitivity to prompt\nformulation.

However,\nlocal LLMs consistently underperform compared to frontier models in tool\ncalling scenarios, struggling with both tool selection from large tool sets and\naccurate argument generation for complex parameter structures. We introduce a\nmethodology that disaggregates a tool-calling task into two distinct subtasks:\ntool selection and argument generation. We propose \"decoupled fine-tuning\", a\nnovel post-training approach that employs LoRA fine-tuning to create dedicated\nLoRA adapters for tool selection and tool-specific argument generation using\nseparate loss masking for each of the subtasks. Furthermore, we present\nDualTune, an inference framework that leverages the LoRA adapters created using\ndecoupled fine-tuning to perform efficient agent orchestration with the help of\nlocal models on end-user devices. DualTune decomposes the tool-call generation\nstep into tool selection and argument generation, and dynamically loads the\ncorresponding LoRA adapters to generate tool calls. Additionally, DualTune\nimplements hierarchical orchestration to restrict the number of tools required\nfor tool selection.

To address these\nissues, this article proposes a semantic-driven AI agent communication\nframework and develops three enabling techniques. First, semantic adaptation\ntransmission applies fine-tuning with real or generative samples to efficiently\nadapt models to varying environments. Second, semantic lightweight transmission\nincorporates pruning, quantization, and perception-aware sampling to reduce\nmodel complexity and alleviate computational burden on edge agents. Third,\nsemantic self-evolution control employs distributed hierarchical\ndecision-making to optimize multi-dimensional resources, enabling robust\nmulti-agent collaboration in dynamic environments. Simulation results show that\nthe proposed solutions achieve faster convergence and stronger robustness,\nwhile the proposed distributed hierarchical optimization method significantly\noutperforms conventional decision-making schemes, highlighting its potential\nfor AI agent communication networks."}

To overcome\nthese limitations, we introduce Interactive-MEN-RT, a dedicated IMIS tool\nspecifically developed for clinician-assisted 3D meningioma segmentation in RT\nworkflows. The system incorporates multiple clinically relevant interaction\nmethods, including point annotations, bounding boxes, lasso tools, and\nscribbles, enhancing usability and clinical precision. In our evaluation\ninvolving 500 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI scans from the BraTS 2025\nMeningioma RT Segmentation Challenge, Interactive-MEN-RT demonstrated\nsubstantial improvement compared to other segmentation methods, achieving Dice\nsimilarity coefficients of up to 77.6\\% and Intersection over Union scores of\n64.8\\%. These results emphasize the need for clinically tailored segmentation\nsolutions in critical applications such as meningioma RT planning.

While attention-score-based KV\ncache pruning shows promise, it faces critical practical limitations: attention\nscores from future tokens are unavailable during compression, and modern\nimplementations like Flash Attention do not materialize the full attention\nmatrix, making past scores inaccessible. To overcome these challenges, we\nintroduce $\\textbf{Expected Attention, a training-free compression method}$\nthat estimates KV pairs importance by predicting how future queries will attend\nto them. Our approach leverages the distributional properties of LLM\nactivations to compute expected attention scores in closed form for each KV\npair. These scores enable principled ranking and pruning of KV pairs with\nminimal impact on the residual stream, achieving effective compression without\nperformance degradation. Importantly, our method operates seamlessly across\nboth prefilling and decoding phases, consistently outperforming\nstate-of-the-art baselines in both scenarios.

Previous efforts\nto fine-tune MLLMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) have struggled, as SFT\nrelies on accurate target annotations, which are often flawed in user-generated\nalt-text. To address this, we propose Multi-faceted Cross-modal Direct\nPreference Optimization (MCM-DPO), which improves alt-text generation by\nlearning to identify better options in preference pairs without requiring\nprecise annotations. MCM-DPO optimizes preferences across single, paired, and\nmulti-preference dimensions, covering textual, visual, and cross-modal factors.\nIn light of the scarcity of high-quality annotated and preference-labeled\ndatasets for alt-text, we constructed two large-scale, high-quality datasets\nnamed TAlt and PAlt, sourced from Twitter and Pinterest. These datasets include\n202k annotated alt-text samples and 18k preference pairs that cover diverse\npreference dimensions, aiming to support further research in this domain.\nExperimental results show that our proposed MCM-DPO method consistently\noutperforms both DPO and SFT, establishing a new state of the art in alt-text\ngeneration.

However, they overlook the challenge of\nagents taking harmful actions when the most effective path to an operational\ngoal conflicts with human safety. To address this gap, we introduce\nManagerBench, a benchmark that evaluates LLM decision-making in realistic,\nhuman-validated managerial scenarios. Each scenario forces a choice between a\npragmatic but harmful action that achieves an operational goal, and a safe\naction that leads to worse operational performance. A parallel control set,\nwhere potential harm is directed only at inanimate objects, measures a model's\npragmatism and identifies its tendency to be overly safe. Our findings indicate\nthat the frontier LLMs perform poorly when navigating this safety-pragmatism\ntrade-off. Many consistently choose harmful options to advance their\noperational goals, while others avoid harm only to become overly safe and\nineffective. Critically, we find this misalignment does not stem from an\ninability to perceive harm, as models' harm assessments align with human\njudgments, but from flawed prioritization.

In\nthe literature, the problem is mainly addressed by suppressing the BG,\nsacrificing context information for improved generalization.\n  We propose RCOR -- Robust Context-Aware Object Recognition -- the first\napproach that jointly achieves robustness and context-awareness without\ncompromising either. RCOR treats localization as an integral part of\nrecognition to decouple object-centric and context-aware modelling, followed by\na robust, non-parametric fusion. It improves the performance of both supervised\nmodels and VLM on datasets with both in-domain and out-of-domain BG, even\nwithout fine-tuning. The results confirm that localization before recognition\nis now possible even in complex scenes as in ImageNet-1k."}

We frame this\nproblem as estimating the probability that a given model will correctly answer\na specific query.

In contrast, humans\nrecognize their limitations and can either seek external help for such\nquestions or abstain. In this paper, we introduce MASH (Modeling Abstention via\nSelective Help-seeking), a training framework that readily extracts abstentions\nfrom LLMs. Our key idea is that any external help-seeking by an LLM, i.e.\nsearch tool use, can serve as a proxy for abstention if the external help\n(search) is appropriately penalized while simultaneously rewarding answer\naccuracy. MASH operationalizes this idea using reinforcement learning with a\npay-per-search reward.\n  We run experiments on three knowledge-intensive QA datasets. Our results show\nthat MASH substantially improves upon the selective help-seeking performance of\nprior efficient search approaches; on multi-hop datasets, MASH improves answer\naccuracy by 7.6%. Furthermore, MASH demonstrates strong off-the-shelf\nabstention -- it can distinguish between unanswerable/answerable questions and\nselectively generate responses for answerable questions -- showcasing behavior\nanalogous to specialized abstention approaches. We emphasize that contrary to\nprior abstention methods, MASH does not require pre-determining knowledge\nboundaries to construct training data. Instead, MASH's abstentions are a\nby-product of training for the auxiliary selective help-seeking task.

While recent studies have begun to explore the\npotential of world models on common vision tasks, these explorations typically\nlack a systematic investigation of generic, multimodal tasks. In this work, we\nstrive to investigate the capabilities when world model priors are transferred\ninto Vision-Language Models: we re-purpose a video diffusion model as a\ngenerative encoder to perform a single denoising step and treat the resulting\nlatents as a set of visual embedding. We empirically investigate this class of\nmodels, which we refer to as World-Language Models (WorldLMs), and we find that\ngenerative encoders can capture latents useful for downstream understanding\nthat show distinctions from conventional encoders. Naming our best-performing\nvariant Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA), we further discover that this method\nsignificantly enhances spatial reasoning abilities and enables single-image\nmodels to perform multi-frame reasoning.

This study presents a\nfully automated deep learning pipeline (PAL-Net) for localizing 50 anatomical\nlandmarks on stereo-photogrammetry facial models. The method combines coarse\nalignment, region-of-interest filtering, and an initial approximation of\nlandmarks with a patch-based pointwise CNN enhanced by attention mechanisms.\nTrained and evaluated on 214 annotated scans from healthy adults, PAL-Net\nachieved a mean localization error of 3.686 mm and preserves relevant\nanatomical distances with a 2.822 mm average error, comparable to\nintra-observer variability. To assess generalization, the model was further\nevaluated on 700 subjects from the FaceScape dataset, achieving a point-wise\nerror of 0.41\\,mm and a distance-wise error of 0.38\\,mm. Compared to existing\nmethods, PAL-Net offers a favorable trade-off between accuracy and\ncomputational cost. While performance degrades in regions with poor mesh\nquality (e.g., ears, hairline), the method demonstrates consistent accuracy\nacross most anatomical regions. PAL-Net generalizes effectively across datasets\nand facial regions, outperforming existing methods in both point-wise and\nstructural evaluations.

MetaLogic leverages metamorphic testing, generating image pairs\nfrom prompts that differ grammatically but are semantically identical. By\ndirectly comparing these image pairs, the framework identifies inconsistencies\nthat signal failures in preserving the intended meaning, effectively diagnosing\nrobustness issues in the model's logic understanding. Unlike existing\nevaluation methods that compare a generated image to a single prompt, MetaLogic\nevaluates semantic equivalence between paired images, offering a scalable,\nground-truth-free approach to identifying alignment failures. It categorises\nthese alignment errors (e.g., entity omission, duplication, positional\nmisalignment) and surfaces counterexamples that can be used for model debugging\nand refinement. We evaluate MetaLogic across multiple state-of-the-art T2I\nmodels and reveal consistent robustness failures across a range of logical\nconstructs. We find that even the SOTA text-to-image models like Flux.dev and\nDALLE-3 demonstrate a 59 percent and 71 percent misalignment rate,\nrespectively. Our results show that MetaLogic is not only efficient and\nscalable, but also effective in uncovering fine-grained logical inconsistencies\nthat are overlooked by existing evaluation metrics."}
