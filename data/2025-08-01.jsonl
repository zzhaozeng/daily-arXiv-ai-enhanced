This paper presents a hierarchical classification framework that\ncombines fine-tuned language models with a semi-supervised ensemble learning\nstrategy to detect and classify illicit marketplace content across diverse\nplatforms. We extract semantic representations using ModernBERT, a transformer\nmodel for long documents, finetuned on domain-specific data from deep and dark\nweb pages, Telegram channels, Subreddits, and Pastebin pastes to capture\nspecialized jargon and ambiguous linguistic patterns.

When these opinions form an argumentative structure around\nforecasts, it is useful to study the properties of the forecasts from an\nargumentative perspective. In this paper, we advocate and formally define a\nproperty of argumentative coherence, which, in essence, requires that a\nforecaster's reasoning is coherent with their forecast. We then conduct three\nevaluations with our notion of coherence. First, we assess the impact of\nenforcing coherence on human forecasters as well as on Large Language Model\n(LLM)-based forecasters, given that they have recently shown to be competitive\nwith human forecasters. In both cases, we show that filtering out incoherent\npredictions improves forecasting accuracy consistently, supporting the\npractical value of coherence in both human and LLM-based forecasting. Then, via\ncrowd-sourced user experiments, we show that, despite its apparent\nintuitiveness and usefulness, users do not generally align with this coherence\nproperty. This points to the need to integrate, within argumentation-based\njudgmental forecasting, mechanisms to filter out incoherent opinions before\nobtaining group forecasting predictions."}

Synthetic\ndata methods are gaining prominence due to the cost and complexity of gathering\nreal-world data, but they demand a high degree of realism and controllability\nto be useful. This work introduces two novel methods for synthetic data\ngeneration in autonomous driving and medical image analysis, namely MObI and\nAnydoorMed, respectively. MObI is a first-of-its-kind framework for Multimodal\nObject Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to produce realistic and\ncontrollable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated\nsimultaneously for camera and lidar. Given a single reference RGB image, MObI\nenables seamless object insertion into existing multimodal scenes at a\nspecified 3D location, guided by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic\nconsistency and multimodal coherence. Unlike traditional inpainting methods\nthat rely solely on edit masks, this approach uses 3D bounding box conditioning\nto ensure accurate spatial positioning and realistic scaling. AnydoorMed\nextends this paradigm to the medical imaging domain, focusing on\nreference-guided inpainting for mammography scans. It leverages a\ndiffusion-based model to inpaint anomalies with impressive detail preservation,\nmaintaining the reference anomaly's structural integrity while semantically\nblending it with the surrounding tissue. Together, these methods demonstrate\nthat foundation models for reference-guided inpainting in natural images can be\nreadily adapted to diverse perceptual modalities, paving the way for the next\ngeneration of systems capable of constructing highly realistic, controllable\nand multimodal counterfactual scenarios."}

However, the complexity of tasks, the spatiotemporal dynamism of\ndistributed device resources, and the inevitable assessment overhead\ndramatically increase the complexity and resource consumption of the trust\nevaluation process. As a result, ill-timed or overly frequent trust evaluations\ncan reduce utilization rate of constrained resources, negatively affecting\ncollaborative task execution. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an\nautonomous trust orchestration method based on a new concept of semantic\nchain-of-trust. Our technique employs agentic AI and hypergraph to establish\nand maintain trust relationships among devices. By leveraging its strengths in\nautonomous perception, task decomposition, and semantic reasoning, we propose\nagentic AI to perceive device states and autonomously perform trust evaluations\nof collaborators based on historical performance data only during device idle\nperiods, thereby enabling efficient utilization of distributed resources. In\naddition, agentic AI performs task-specific trust evaluations on collaborator\nresources by analyzing the alignment between resource capabilities and task\nrequirements. Moreover, by maintaining a trust hypergraph embedded with trust\nsemantics for each device, agentic AI enables hierarchical management of\ncollaborators and identifies collaborators requiring trust evaluation based on\ntrust semantics, thereby achieving a balance between overhead and trust\naccuracy. Furthermore, local trust hypergraphs from multiple devices can be\nchained together to support multi-hop collaboration, enabling efficient\ncoordination in large-scale systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed method achieves resource-efficient trust evaluation."}

In conventional methods, the agent can retrieve\ninformation from its equipped memory module to help the person recall\nincomplete or vague memories. The limited size of memory module hinders the\nacquisition of complete memories and impacts the memory recall performance in\npractice. Memory theories suggest that the person's relevant memory can be\nproactively activated through some effective cues. Inspired by this, we propose\na novel strategy-guided agent-assisted memory recall method, allowing the agent\nto transform an original query into a cue-rich one via the judiciously designed\nstrategy to help the person recall memories. To this end, there are two key\nchallenges. (1) How to choose the appropriate recall strategy for diverse\nforgetting scenarios with distinct memory-recall characteristics? (2) How to\nobtain the high-quality responses leveraging recall strategies, given only\nabstract and sparsely annotated strategy patterns? To address the challenges,\nwe propose a Recall Router framework. Specifically, we design a 5W Recall Map\nto classify memory queries into five typical scenarios and define fifteen\nrecall strategy patterns across the corresponding scenarios. We then propose a\nhierarchical recall tree combined with the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to\noptimize the selection of strategy and the generation of strategy responses. We\nconstruct an instruction tuning dataset and fine-tune multiple open-source\nlarge language models (LLMs) to develop MemoCue, an agent that excels in\nproviding memory-inspired responses.

To address the above challenges, we propose an adversarial-guided\ndiffusion (AGD) approach for adversarial attack MLLMs. We introduce\nadversarial-guided noise to ensure attack efficacy. A key observation in our\ndesign is that, unlike most traditional adversarial attacks which embed\nhigh-frequency perturbations directly into the clean image, AGD injects target\nsemantics into the noise component of the reverse diffusion. Since the added\nnoise in a diffusion model spans the entire frequency spectrum, the adversarial\nsignal embedded within it also inherits this full-spectrum property.\nImportantly, during reverse diffusion, the adversarial image is formed as a\nlinear combination of the clean image and the noise. Thus, when applying\ndefenses such as a simple low-pass filtering, which act independently on each\ncomponent, the adversarial image within the noise component is less likely to\nbe suppressed, as it is not confined to the high-frequency band. This makes AGD\ninherently robust to variety defenses.

A retrieval-augmented\ngeneration mechanism is introduced to improve the framework's capability in\nhandling both Question-Answering tasks with high-level(Code,build,Test,etc.)\nand low-level(fault analysis,anomaly detection,etc.). Finally, the proposed\nmethod is implemented in the AIOps domain, and extensive experiments are\nconducted on the DevOps-EVAL dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that\nCoE-Ops achieves a 72% improvement in routing accuracy for high-level AIOps\ntasks compared to existing CoE methods, delivers up to 8% accuracy enhancement\nover single AIOps models in DevOps problem resolution, and outperforms\nlarger-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models by up to 14% in accuracy."}

Diverging from critical traditions that conflate\narbitrariness with injustice, it posits arbitrariness as a semiotic trait: a\nproperty enabling systems - linguistic, legal, or social - to operate\neffectively while withholding their internal rationale. Building on Ferdinand\nde Saussure's concept of l'arbitraire du signe, the analysis extends this\nprinciple beyond language to demonstrate its cross-domain applicability,\nparticularly in law and social dynamics. The paper introduces the \"Motivation\n-> Constatability -> Contestability\" chain, arguing that motivation functions\nas a crucial interface rendering an act's logic vulnerable to intersubjective\ncontestation. When this chain is broken through mechanisms like\n\"immotivization\" or \"Conflict Lateralization\" (exemplified by \"the blur of the\nwolf drowned in the fish\"), acts produce binding effects without exposing their\nrationale, thus precluding justiciability. This structural opacity, while\nappearing illogical, is a deliberate design protecting authority from\naccountability. Drawing on Shannon's entropy model, the paper formalizes\narbitrariness as A = H(L|M) (conditional entropy). It thereby proposes a modern\ntheory of arbitrariness as a neutral operator central to control as well as\ncare, an overlooked dimension of interpersonal relations. While primarily\ndeveloped through human social systems, this framework also illuminates a new\npathway for analyzing explainability in advanced artificial intelligence\nsystems."}

The Impact of Translation Strategies in Cross-lingual LLM Prompting", "comment": "Accepted at Prompt Optimization KDD '25", "summary": "Despite advances in the multilingual capabilities of Large Language Models\n(LLMs), their performance varies substantially across different languages and\ntasks. In multilingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based systems,\nknowledge bases (KB) are often shared from high-resource languages (such as\nEnglish) to low-resource ones, resulting in retrieved information from the KB\nbeing in a different language than the rest of the context. In such scenarios,\ntwo common practices are pre-translation to create a mono-lingual prompt and\ncross-lingual prompting for direct inference. However, the impact of these\nchoices remains unclear. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact\nof different prompt translation strategies for classification tasks with\nRAG-enhanced LLMs in multilingual systems. Experimental results show that an\noptimized prompting strategy can significantly improve knowledge sharing across\nlanguages, therefore improve the performance on the downstream classification\ntask. The findings advocate for a broader utilization of multilingual resource\nsharing and cross-lingual prompt optimization for non-English languages,\nespecially the low-resource ones."}

Especially with the rapid development of the Text-to-Image (T2I)\nmodels, AI-Generated Talking Heads (AGTHs) have gradually become an emerging\ndigital human media. However, challenges persist regarding the quality of these\ntalkers and AGTHs they generate, and comprehensive studies addressing these\nissues remain limited. To address this gap, this paper presents the largest\nAGTH quality assessment dataset THQA-10K to date, which selects 12 prominent\nT2I models and 14 advanced talkers to generate AGTHs for 14 prompts. After\nexcluding instances where AGTH generation is unsuccessful, the THQA-10K dataset\ncontains 10,457 AGTHs. Then, volunteers are recruited to subjectively rate the\nAGTHs and give the corresponding distortion categories. In our analysis for\nsubjective experimental results, we evaluate the performance of talkers in\nterms of generalizability and quality, and also expose the distortions of\nexisting AGTHs. Finally, an objective quality assessment method based on the\nfirst frame, Y-T slice and tone-lip consistency is proposed.

Diverging from critical traditions that conflate\narbitrariness with injustice, it posits arbitrariness as a semiotic trait: a\nproperty enabling systems - linguistic, legal, or social - to operate\neffectively while withholding their internal rationale. Building on Ferdinand\nde Saussure's concept of l'arbitraire du signe, the analysis extends this\nprinciple beyond language to demonstrate its cross-domain applicability,\nparticularly in law and social dynamics. The paper introduces the \"Motivation\n-> Constatability -> Contestability\" chain, arguing that motivation functions\nas a crucial interface rendering an act's logic vulnerable to intersubjective\ncontestation. When this chain is broken through mechanisms like\n\"immotivization\" or \"Conflict Lateralization\" (exemplified by \"the blur of the\nwolf drowned in the fish\"), acts produce binding effects without exposing their\nrationale, thus precluding justiciability. This structural opacity, while\nappearing illogical, is a deliberate design protecting authority from\naccountability. Drawing on Shannon's entropy model, the paper formalizes\narbitrariness as A = H(L|M) (conditional entropy). It thereby proposes a modern\ntheory of arbitrariness as a neutral operator central to control as well as\ncare, an overlooked dimension of interpersonal relations. While primarily\ndeveloped through human social systems, this framework also illuminates a new\npathway for analyzing explainability in advanced artificial intelligence\nsystems."}

Synthetic\ndata methods are gaining prominence due to the cost and complexity of gathering\nreal-world data, but they demand a high degree of realism and controllability\nto be useful. This work introduces two novel methods for synthetic data\ngeneration in autonomous driving and medical image analysis, namely MObI and\nAnydoorMed, respectively. MObI is a first-of-its-kind framework for Multimodal\nObject Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to produce realistic and\ncontrollable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated\nsimultaneously for camera and lidar. Given a single reference RGB image, MObI\nenables seamless object insertion into existing multimodal scenes at a\nspecified 3D location, guided by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic\nconsistency and multimodal coherence. Unlike traditional inpainting methods\nthat rely solely on edit masks, this approach uses 3D bounding box conditioning\nto ensure accurate spatial positioning and realistic scaling. AnydoorMed\nextends this paradigm to the medical imaging domain, focusing on\nreference-guided inpainting for mammography scans. It leverages a\ndiffusion-based model to inpaint anomalies with impressive detail preservation,\nmaintaining the reference anomaly's structural integrity while semantically\nblending it with the surrounding tissue. Together, these methods demonstrate\nthat foundation models for reference-guided inpainting in natural images can be\nreadily adapted to diverse perceptual modalities, paving the way for the next\ngeneration of systems capable of constructing highly realistic, controllable\nand multimodal counterfactual scenarios."}

However, existing methods often only consider single-relational\ngraphs and require a predefined number of clusters, which hinders their ability\nto fully represent rich relational information and adaptively partition\nsentence groups to reduce redundancy. To overcome these limitations, we propose\nMRGSEM-Sum, an unsupervised multi-document summarization framework based on\nmulti-relational graphs and structural entropy minimization. Specifically, we\nconstruct a multi-relational graph that integrates semantic and discourse\nrelations between sentences, comprehensively modeling the intricate and dynamic\nconnections among sentences across documents.

Experiments on industrial in-house\ndata demonstrate significant improvements, with\n$\\text{RL-QR}_{\\text{multi-modal}}$ achieving an 11\\% relative gain in NDCG@3\nfor multi-modal RAG and $\\text{RL-QR}_{\\text{lexical}}$ yielding a 9\\% gain for\nlexical retrievers. However, challenges persist with semantic and hybrid\nretrievers, where rewriters failed to improve performance, likely due to\ntraining misalignments. Our findings highlight RL-QR's potential to\nrevolutionize query optimization for RAG systems, offering a scalable,\nannotation-free solution for real-world retrieval tasks, while identifying\navenues for further refinement in semantic retrieval contexts."}

However, current\nbenchmarks face two key challenges: (1) they cannot directly assess multimodal\nreal-world planning capabilities, and (2) they lack constraints or implicit\nconstraints across modalities. To address these issues, we introduce Multimodal\nPlanning with Complex Constraints (MPCC), the first benchmark to systematically\nevaluate MLLMs' ability to handle multimodal constraints in planning. To\naddress the first challenge, MPCC focuses on three real-world tasks: Flight\nPlanning, Calendar Planning, and Meeting Planning. To solve the second\nchallenge, we introduce complex constraints (e.g. budget, temporal, and\nspatial) in these tasks, with graded difficulty levels (EASY, MEDIUM, HARD) to\nseparate constraint complexity from search space expansion. Experiments on 13\nadvanced MLLMs reveal significant challenges: closed-source models achieve only\n21.3% feasible plans, while open-source models average below 11%. Additionally,\nwe observe that MLLMs are highly sensitive to constraint complexity and that\ntraditional multimodal prompting strategies fail in multi-constraint scenarios.\nOur work formalizes multimodal constraints in planning, provides a rigorous\nevaluation framework, and highlights the need for advancements in\nconstraint-aware reasoning for real-world MLLM applications."}

On\nthe other hand, logic-based explanations are formally and rigorously defined\nbut their computability relies on strict assumptions about the model that do\nnot hold on image classifiers.\n  In this paper, we show that causal explanations, in addition to being\nformally and rigorously defined, enjoy the same formal properties as\nlogic-based ones, while still lending themselves to black-box algorithms and\nbeing a natural fit for image classifiers. We prove formal properties of causal\nexplanations and introduce contrastive causal explanations for image\nclassifiers. Moreover, we augment the definition of explanation with confidence\nawareness and introduce complete causal explanations: explanations that are\nclassified with exactly the same confidence as the original image.\n  We implement our definitions, and our experimental results demonstrate that\ndifferent models have different patterns of sufficiency, contrastiveness, and\ncompleteness. Our algorithms are efficiently computable, taking on average 6s\nper image on a ResNet50 model to compute all types of explanations, and are\ntotally black-box, needing no knowledge of the model, no access to model\ninternals, no access to gradient, nor requiring any properties, such as\nmonotonicity, of the model."}

We introduce XSpecMesh, a quality-preserving acceleration method for\nauto-regressive mesh generation models. XSpecMesh employs a lightweight,\nmulti-head speculative decoding scheme to predict multiple tokens in parallel\nwithin a single forward pass, thereby accelerating inference. We further\npropose a verification and resampling strategy: the backbone model verifies\neach predicted token and resamples any tokens that do not meet the quality\ncriteria. In addition, we propose a distillation strategy that trains the\nlightweight decoding heads by distilling from the backbone model, encouraging\ntheir prediction distributions to align and improving the success rate of\nspeculative predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method\nachieves a 1.7x speedup without sacrificing generation quality. Our code will\nbe released."}
