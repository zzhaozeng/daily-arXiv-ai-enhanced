### [1] [StreetMath: Study of LLMs' Approximation Behaviors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25776)
*Chiung-Yi Tseng,Somshubhra Roy,Maisha Thasin,Danyang Zhang,Blessing Effiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文引入了StreetMath基准来评估大型语言模型在非正式、快节奏数学运算中的近似推理能力，发现这些模型在需要近似计算时仍倾向于计算精确值或调用外部工具，且精确与近似运算依赖不同的神经组件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前文献中对大型语言模型在精确算术运算中的表现有较多研究，但对其在非正式、快节奏数学运算中的近似推理能力关注较少，特别是在非自回归解码器模型中。因此，作者希望填补这一研究空白。

Method: 作者引入了StreetMath基准，评估了不同LLM架构在现实近似场景下的表现，并应用机制可解释性技术探测模型的内部计算状态。

Result: 分析表明，即使在需要近似计算的任务中，LLMs通常尝试计算精确值或调用外部工具，且在解决近似任务时会消耗更多标记。精确与近似算术操作依赖不同的神经组件。

Conclusion: LLMs在街头数学环境中不像人类那样表现出认知吝啬。作者公开了相关数据和代码。

Abstract: There is a substantial body of literature examining the mathematical
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
performance on precise arithmetic operations in autoregressive architectures.
However, their ability to perform approximate reasoning in informal, fast-paced
mathematical operations has received far less attention, especially among
non-autoregressive decoder models. Our work addresses this gap by introducing
StreetMath, a benchmark designed to evaluate models' approximation abilities
under real-world approximation scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluations
across different LLM architectures: Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507,
Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507, Dream-v0-Instruct-7B, Falcon-Mamba-7B-Instruct, and
Mamba-GPT-3B. Furthermore, we apply mechanistic interpretability techniques to
probe their internal computational states. Our analysis reveals that LLMs
generally attempt to compute exact values or invoke external tools even in
tasks that call for approximation. Moreover, while models sometimes reach the
correct answer in early layers or steps, they still consume more tokens when
solving approximation tasks. Additional experiments indicate that exact and
approximate arithmetic operations rely on largely separate neural components.
Drawing upon research on cognitive psychology, we argue that LLMs do not
exhibit cognitive miserliness in the same way humans do in street math
settings. We open source our work https://github.com/ctseng777/StreetMath

### [2] [Review Based Entity Ranking using Fuzzy Logic Algorithmic Approach: Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25778)
*Pratik N. Kalamkar,Anupama G. Phakatkar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种基于模糊逻辑和句法依赖解析的细粒度情感分析方法，通过结合观点词对实体评论和用户查询进行排序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于词典的情感分析方法忽略了观点的强度，无法区分观点的细微差异。

Method: 使用模糊逻辑算法对观点词进行分类，并结合句法依赖解析来找到与感兴趣方面相关的关系。

Result: 能够根据观点的方向和强度对实体评论和用户查询进行排序，并计算出每个方面的实体得分。

Conclusion: 该方法能够更细致地分析观点，提高情感分析的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Opinion mining, also called sentiment analysis, is the field of study that
analyzes people opinions, sentiments, evaluations, appraisals, attitudes, and
emotions towards entities such as products, services, organizations,
individuals, issues, events, topics, and their attributes. Holistic
lexicon-based approach does not consider the strength of each opinion, i.e.,
whether the opinion is very strongly negative (or positive), strongly negative
(or positive), moderate negative (or positive), very weakly negative (or
positive) and weakly negative (or positive). In this paper, we propose approach
to rank entities based on orientation and strength of the entity reviews and
user's queries by classifying them in granularity levels (i.e. very weak, weak,
moderate, very strong and strong) by combining opinion words (i.e. adverb,
adjective, noun and verb) that are related to aspect of interest of certain
product. We shall use fuzzy logic algorithmic approach in order to classify
opinion words into different category and syntactic dependency resolution to
find relations for desired aspect words. Opinion words related to certain
aspects of interest are considered to find the entity score for that aspect in
the review.

### [3] [LASTIST: LArge-Scale Target-Independent STance dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25783)
*DongJae Kim,Yaejin Lee,Minsu Park,Eunil Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新的韩语立场检测数据集 LASTIST，填补了低资源语言中立场检测研究的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数立场检测研究集中在目标依赖的立场检测任务，并且基准数据集主要是英语，这限制了韩语等低资源语言的立场检测模型的开发。

Method: 从韩国政党的新闻稿中收集并构建了 LASTIST 数据集，包含563,299个带标注的韩语句子。详细描述了数据集的收集与构建过程，并训练了最新的深度学习和立场检测模型。

Result: LASTIST 数据集支持包括目标独立立场检测和历时演变立场检测在内的多种立场检测任务。

Conclusion: LASTIST 数据集为韩语的立场检测研究提供了有力支持，并已在 https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LASTIST-3721/ 上公开。

Abstract: Stance detection has emerged as an area of research in the field of
artificial intelligence. However, most research is currently centered on the
target-dependent stance detection task, which is based on a person's stance in
favor of or against a specific target. Furthermore, most benchmark datasets are
based on English, making it difficult to develop models in low-resource
languages such as Korean, especially for an emerging field such as stance
detection. This study proposes the LArge-Scale Target-Independent STance
(LASTIST) dataset to fill this research gap. Collected from the press releases
of both parties on Korean political parties, the LASTIST dataset uses 563,299
labeled Korean sentences. We provide a detailed description of how we collected
and constructed the dataset and trained state-of-the-art deep learning and
stance detection models. Our LASTIST dataset is designed for various tasks in
stance detection, including target-independent stance detection and diachronic
evolution stance detection. We deploy our dataset on
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LASTIST-3721/.

### [4] [zFLoRA: Zero-Latency Fused Low-Rank Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25784)
*Dhananjaya Gowda,Seoha Song,Harshith Goka,Junhyun Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种零延迟融合低秩适配器(zFLoRA)，解决任务特定适配器在推理时延过高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管适配器参数占比小(<1%)，但其带来的计算开销在推理时显著增加(可达基础模型的2.5倍)。

Method: 设计新型zFLoRA适配器，通过融合技术实现零/可忽略的延迟开销。

Result: 在1B/3B/7B模型上，zFLoRA在18个任务中表现优于LoRA和FFT；在NPU/GPU平台验证了零延迟特性。

Conclusion: zFLoRA在保持性能的同时有效消除了适配器带来的推理延迟问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed with task-specific
adapters catering to multiple downstream applications. In such a scenario, the
additional compute associated with these apparently insignificant number of
adapter parameters (typically less than 1% of the base model) turns out to be
disproportionately significant during inference time (upto 2.5x times that of
the base model). In this paper, we propose a new zero-latency fused low-rank
adapter (zFLoRA) that introduces zero or negligible latency overhead on top of
the base model. Experimental results on LLMs of size 1B, 3B and 7B show that
zFLoRA compares favorably against the popular supervised fine-tuning benchmarks
including low-rank adapters (LoRA) as well as full fine-tuning (FFT).
Experiments are conducted on 18 different tasks across three different
categories namely commonsense reasoning, math reasoning and summary-dialogue.
Latency measurements made on NPU (Samsung Galaxy S25+) as well as GPU (NVIDIA
H100) platforms show that the proposed zFLoRA adapters introduce zero to
negligible latency overhead.

*Yaniv Nikankin,Dana Arad,Itay Itzhak,Anja Reusch,Adi Simhi,Gal Kesten-Pomeranz,Yonatan Belinkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了三种改进电路发现的方法，通过自举法、基于比率的选择策略和整数线性规划，提高了电路发现的可信度和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机械可解释性中，电路发现是一个主要挑战，即确定模型中哪些部分执行特定任务。本文在机械可解释性基准（MIB）的基础上提出了改进方法。

Method: 1. 使用自举法识别具有稳定归因分数的边。2. 引入基于比率的简单选择策略，优先考虑强正分数的边。3. 用整数线性规划替代标准贪婪选择。

Result: 所提出的方法在多个MIB任务中表现出更高的可信度，并且性能优于先前的方法。

Conclusion: 通过三种关键改进，本文的方法在电路发现中实现了更高的可信度和性能，为机械可解释性提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: One of the main challenges in mechanistic interpretability is circuit
discovery, determining which parts of a model perform a given task. We build on
the Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark (MIB) and propose three key
improvements to circuit discovery. First, we use bootstrapping to identify
edges with consistent attribution scores. Second, we introduce a simple
ratio-based selection strategy to prioritize strong positive-scoring edges,
balancing performance and faithfulness. Third, we replace the standard greedy
selection with an integer linear programming formulation. Our methods yield
more faithful circuits and outperform prior approaches across multiple MIB
tasks and models. Our code is available at:

### [6] [LISTEN to Your Preferences: An LLM Framework for Multi-Objective Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25799)
*Adam S. Jovine,Tinghan Ye,Francis Bahk,Jingjing Wang,David B. Shmoys,Peter I. Frazier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LISTEN框架利用大语言模型（LLM）作为零样本偏好预言机，通过自然语言指导专家在多目标决策中选出最佳选项。提出了两种算法：LISTEN-U用于参数化效用函数，LISTEN-T用于非参数化比赛式选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类专家在面对具有多个竞争目标的大型项目选择时，常因难以形式化复杂且隐含的偏好而遭遇困难。为解决这一问题，引入LLM以简化决策过程。

Method: 提出LISTEN框架，包含两种迭代算法：LISTEN-U通过LLM优化参数化效用函数，LISTEN-T通过小批量比赛式选择进行非参数化决策。

Result: 在航班预订、购物和考试安排等多种任务上的评估结果显示，LISTEN-U在偏好参数化对齐时表现突出，而LISTEN-T提供更稳健的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为通过自然语言直接引导复杂的多目标决策提供了新方向，减轻了传统偏好提取的认知负担。

Abstract: Human experts often struggle to select the best option from a large set of
items with multiple competing objectives, a process bottlenecked by the
difficulty of formalizing complex, implicit preferences. To address this, we
introduce LISTEN, a framework that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) as a
zero-shot preference oracle, guided only by an expert's high-level priorities
in natural language. To operate within LLM constraints like context windows and
inference costs, we propose two iterative algorithms: LISTEN-U, which uses the
LLM to refine a parametric utility function, and LISTEN-T, a non-parametric
method that performs tournament-style selections over small batches of
solutions. Evaluated on diverse tasks including flight booking, shopping, and
exam scheduling, our results show LISTEN-U excels when preferences are
parametrically aligned (a property we measure with a novel concordance metric),
while LISTEN-T offers more robust performance. This work explores a promising
direction for steering complex multi-objective decisions directly with natural
language, reducing the cognitive burden of traditional preference elicitation.

### [7] [Beyond Length: Quantifying Long-Range Information for Long-Context LLM Pretraining Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25804)
*Haoran Deng,Yingyu Lin,Zhenghao Lin,Xiao Liu,Yizhou Sun,Yi-An Ma,Yeyun Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongFilter 是一个用于长上下文预训练的数据筛选框架，通过对比长上下文和短上下文模型预测的信息增益，识别出真正需要长距离依赖的样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文语言模型在处理长文本数据时具有优势，但大部分现有长文本数据缺乏有意义的长距离依赖，导致训练效率低下。因此，需要一种高效的数据筛选方法。

Method: 提出 LongFilter 框架，通过对比模型在长上下文和短上下文设置下的预测差异，测量扩展上下文带来的信息增益，从而筛选出高质量的长上下文训练数据。

Result: 在使用 LLaMA-3-8B 模型进行实验，将其上下文长度从 8K 扩展到 64K 时，LongFilter 能高效选择高质量数据，并在 HELMET、LongBench 和 RULER 等基准测试上显著提升性能。

Conclusion: LongFilter 是一种有效的长上下文预训练数据筛选方法，可以显著提高模型在长文本任务上的表现。

Abstract: Long-context language models unlock advanced capabilities in reasoning, code
generation, and document summarization by leveraging dependencies across
extended spans of text. However, a significant portion of readily available
long-text data lacks meaningful long-distance dependencies; most spans can be
predicted using only local context. Training on such data is inefficient,
making careful data selection crucial. Therefore, we introduce LongFilter, a
framework for curating training data tailored to long-context pretraining.
LongFilter measures the information gain provided by extended context by
contrasting model predictions under long-context versus short-context settings,
thereby identifying samples where long-range dependencies are essential.
Experiments with LLaMA-3-8B, extending its context length from 8K to 64K, show
that LongFilter efficiently selects high-quality data and yields substantial
improvements on benchmarks such as HELMET, LongBench, and RULER.

### [8] [Ideology-Based LLMs for Content Moderation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25805)
*Stefano Civelli,Pietro Bernardelle,Nardiena A. Pratama,Gianluca Demartini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了个性化角色对大型语言模型在有害内容分类中的公平性和一致性的影响，揭示了角色设定可能引入的意识形态偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在内容审核系统中的广泛应用，确保其公平性和中立性变得至关重要。本文旨在探讨不同个性化角色如何影响有害内容分类的公平性和一致性。

Method: 研究考察了不同LLM架构、模型大小和内容模态（语言与视觉）下，个性化角色对有害内容分类的影响。通过详细的行为分析和额外政治任务研究，评估了模型在不同角色下的表现。

Result: 虽然初步性能指标显示个性化角色对分类准确率影响不大，但深入分析发现，不同意识形态的角色在有害内容判断上表现出明显差异，模型更容易与其同意识形态的角色保持一致。

Conclusion: 个性化角色可能引入细微的意识形态偏见，使AI系统可能在看似中立的情况下强化党派观点，从而引发对AI系统公平性的担忧。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in content moderation
systems, where ensuring fairness and neutrality is essential. In this study, we
examine how persona adoption influences the consistency and fairness of harmful
content classification across different LLM architectures, model sizes, and
content modalities (language vs. vision). At first glance, headline performance
metrics suggest that personas have little impact on overall classification
accuracy. However, a closer analysis reveals important behavioral shifts.
Personas with different ideological leanings display distinct propensities to
label content as harmful, showing that the lens through which a model "views"
input can subtly shape its judgments. Further agreement analyses highlight that
models, particularly larger ones, tend to align more closely with personas from
the same political ideology, strengthening within-ideology consistency while
widening divergence across ideological groups. To show this effect more
directly, we conducted an additional study on a politically targeted task,
which confirmed that personas not only behave more coherently within their own
ideology but also exhibit a tendency to defend their perspective while
downplaying harmfulness in opposing views. Together, these findings highlight
how persona conditioning can introduce subtle ideological biases into LLM
outputs, raising concerns about the use of AI systems that may reinforce
partisan perspectives under the guise of neutrality.

### [9] [Beyond Long Context: When Semantics Matter More than Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25816)
*Tarun Kumar Chawdhury,Jon D. Duke*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLEAR方法通过实体感知检索显著提升了临床文档的问答性能，并在效率和准确性上优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录(EHR)以base64编码存储在FHIR DocumentReference资源中，使得语义问答困难。传统向量数据库方法往往错过细微的临床关系。

Method: Lopez等人2025年提出的CLEAR方法采用实体感知检索，通过Clinical Notes QA Evaluation Platform验证其性能，与传统分块检索增强生成和零样本大上下文推理进行对比。

Result: CLEAR的F1得分为0.90，高于基于检索的0.86，并且使用少70%以上的标记。在12个临床笔记上的测试中，CLEAR的胜率为58.3%，语义相似度平均为0.878，比大上下文处理少用78%的标记。

Conclusion: 实体感知检索在临床自然语言处理中提升了效率和准确性，特别是在处理长笔记时表现突出。评估框架为临床问答系统提供了可重用和透明的基准。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) store clinical documentation as base64
encoded attachments in FHIR DocumentReference resources, which makes semantic
question answering difficult. Traditional vector database methods often miss
nuanced clinical relationships. The Clinical Entity Augmented Retrieval (CLEAR)
method, introduced by Lopez et al. 2025, uses entity aware retrieval and
achieved improved performance with an F1 score of 0.90 versus 0.86 for
embedding based retrieval, while using over 70 percent fewer tokens. We
developed a Clinical Notes QA Evaluation Platform to validate CLEAR against
zero shot large context inference and traditional chunk based retrieval
augmented generation. The platform was tested on 12 clinical notes ranging from
10,000 to 65,000 tokens representing realistic EHR content. CLEAR achieved a
58.3 percent win rate, an average semantic similarity of 0.878, and used 78
percent fewer tokens than wide context processing. The largest performance
gains occurred on long notes, with a 75 percent win rate for documents
exceeding 65,000 tokens. These findings confirm that entity aware retrieval
improves both efficiency and accuracy in clinical natural language processing.
The evaluation framework provides a reusable and transparent benchmark for
assessing clinical question answering systems where semantic precision and
computational efficiency are critical.

Abstract: Post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for unlocking their
task generalization potential and domain-specific capabilities. However, the
current LLM post-training paradigm faces significant data challenges, including
the high costs of manual annotation and diminishing marginal returns on data
scales. Therefore, achieving data-efficient post-training has become a key
research question. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey of
data-efficient LLM post-training from a data-centric perspective. We propose a
taxonomy of data-efficient LLM post-training methods, covering data selection,
data quality enhancement, synthetic data generation, data distillation and
compression, and self-evolving data ecosystems. We summarize representative
approaches in each category and outline future research directions. By
examining the challenges in data-efficient LLM post-training, we highlight open
problems and propose potential research avenues. We hope our work inspires
further exploration into maximizing the potential of data utilization in
large-scale model training. Paper List:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了基于LLM的语义角色标注器在FrameNet类语义标注任务中的表现，通过三种实验设置（手动、自动和半自动）比较了标注时间、覆盖率和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在语言资源创建中具有潜力，但对它们在语义标注任务中的全面评估，尤其是在NLP的视角化方法下的表现，仍存在研究空白。

Method: 通过比较三种实验设置（手动、自动和半自动）的标注时间、覆盖率和多样性来评估LLM的性能。

Result: 半自动标注设置在框架多样性和标注覆盖率方面优于手动设置，而自动设置在除标注时间外的所有指标上表现较差。

Conclusion: 半自动方法在保持标注质量的同时提高了框架多样性，而纯自动方法在大多数指标上表现不佳。

Abstract: The use of LLM-based applications as a means to accelerate and/or substitute
human labor in the creation of language resources and dataset is a reality.
Nonetheless, despite the potential of such tools for linguistic research,
comprehensive evaluation of their performance and impact on the creation of
annotated datasets, especially under a perspectivized approach to NLP, is still
missing. This paper contributes to reduction of this gap by reporting on an
extensive evaluation of the (semi-)automatization of FrameNet-like semantic
annotation by the use of an LLM-based semantic role labeler. The methodology
employed compares annotation time, coverage and diversity in three experimental
settings: manual, automatic and semi-automatic annotation. Results show that
the hybrid, semi-automatic annotation setting leads to increased frame
diversity and similar annotation coverage, when compared to the human-only
setting, while the automatic setting performs considerably worse in all
metrics, except for annotation time.

*Negar Foroutan,Paul Teiletche,Ayush Kumar Tarun,Antoine Bosselut*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究大规模语言模型中多语言数据混合的影响，发现多语言训练并不会导致性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨多语言预训练中语言覆盖与性能之间的权衡问题，挑战常见的多语言训练假设。

Method: 通过在不同多语言语料库上训练1.1B和3B参数的LLMs，语言数量从25到400不等。

Result: 结合英语和多语言数据在预训练语料库中语言有足够多的标记时，不会降低任何一组的语言性能；使用英语作为枢纽语言对语言家族有益；没有观察到显著的多语言诅咒。

Conclusion: 多语言数据在适当平衡的情况下，可以增强语言模型能力，而不会损害性能，即使在低资源环境下也是如此。

Abstract: The impact of different multilingual data mixtures in pretraining large
language models (LLMs) has been a topic of ongoing debate, often raising
concerns about potential trade-offs between language coverage and model
performance (i.e., the curse of multilinguality). In this work, we investigate
these assumptions by training 1.1B and 3B parameter LLMs on diverse
multilingual corpora, varying the number of languages from 25 to 400. Our study
challenges common beliefs surrounding multilingual training. First, we find
that combining English and multilingual data does not necessarily degrade the
in-language performance of either group, provided that languages have a
sufficient number of tokens included in the pretraining corpus. Second, we
observe that using English as a pivot language (i.e., a high-resource language
that serves as a catalyst for multilingual generalization) yields benefits
across language families, and contrary to expectations, selecting a pivot
language from within a specific family does not consistently improve
performance for languages within that family. Lastly, we do not observe a
significant "curse of multilinguality" as the number of training languages
increases in models at this scale. Our findings suggest that multilingual data,
when balanced appropriately, can enhance language model capabilities without
compromising performance, even in low-resource settings

*Mohsinul Kabir,Tasnim Ahmed,Md Mezbaur Rahman,Polydoros Giannouris,Sophia Ananiadou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 机器翻译中的文化差异会导致语义标签偏移，尤其在文化敏感领域，这会影响翻译的准确性和下游应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管情感在翻译过程中的保持已经得到了广泛研究，文化因素在机器翻译中的作用却鲜有关注。本文旨在探索文化差异如何影响翻译中的语义标签保持。

Method: 通过在文化敏感和中性领域进行一系列实验，研究现代机器翻译系统（包括大型语言模型）在不同文化间翻译时的标签偏移现象。

Result: 研究发现：(1) 机器翻译系统会导致标签偏移，特别是在文化敏感领域；(2) 大型语言模型包含文化知识，可以放大标签偏移；(3) 源语言和目标语言的文化相似性影响标签保持。

Conclusion: 忽视机器翻译中的文化因素会削弱标签的准确性，并可能导致下游应用中的误解和文化冲突。

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) is widely employed to address resource scarcity in
low-resource languages by generating synthetic data from high-resource
counterparts. While sentiment preservation in translation has long been
studied, a critical but underexplored factor is the role of cultural alignment
between source and target languages. In this paper, we hypothesize that
semantic labels are drifted or altered during MT due to cultural divergence.
Through a series of experiments across culturally sensitive and neutral
domains, we establish three key findings: (1) MT systems, including modern
Large Language Models (LLMs), induce label drift during translation,
particularly in culturally sensitive domains; (2) unlike earlier statistical MT
tools, LLMs encode cultural knowledge, and leveraging this knowledge can
amplify label drift; and (3) cultural similarity or dissimilarity between
source and target languages is a crucial determinant of label preservation. Our
findings highlight that neglecting cultural factors in MT not only undermines
label fidelity but also risks misinterpretation and cultural conflict in
downstream applications.

*Sina Bagheri Nezhad,Yao Li,Ameeta Agrawal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SymCode是一个神经符号框架，通过生成可验证的代码来解决大型语言模型在复杂数学推理中的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂数学推理中常常产生未经验证和算术上不正确的解决方案，现有的提示策略无法提供确定性验证机制。

Method: 引入SymCode，将数学问题解决重构为使用SymPy库的可验证代码生成任务。

Result: 在MATH-500和OlympiadBench等具有挑战性的基准测试中，SymCode相比基线实现了高达13.6个百分点的准确率提升。

Conclusion: SymCode通过将LLM推理置于确定性符号引擎中，为更准确和可信的AI在形式领域的应用迈出了关键一步。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning, where prose-based generation leads to unverified and arithmetically
unsound solutions. Current prompting strategies like Chain of Thought still
operate within this unreliable medium, lacking a mechanism for deterministic
verification. To address these limitations, we introduce SymCode, a
neurosymbolic framework that reframes mathematical problem-solving as a task of
verifiable code generation using the SymPy library. We evaluate SymCode on
challenging benchmarks, including MATH-500 and OlympiadBench, demonstrating
significant accuracy improvements of up to 13.6 percentage points over
baselines. Our analysis shows that SymCode is not only more token-efficient but
also fundamentally shifts model failures from opaque logical fallacies towards
transparent, programmatic errors. By grounding LLM reasoning in a deterministic
symbolic engine, SymCode represents a key step towards more accurate and
trustworthy AI in formal domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trainium作为AWS的AI加速器，其异构架构和脉动阵列设计带来了高性能潜力，但也因数据布局特殊要求而难以发挥。论文旨在解决如何高效利用Trainium进行LLM推理的问题。

Method: 采用内核融合和新型缓存策略，减少软件管理内存层级间的数据移动，最大化SRAM带宽，避免昂贵矩阵转置操作。

Conclusion: 所提技术能有效释放Trainium硬件潜力，为LLM推理提供显著性能提升，证明针对特定AI加速器定制化优化的重要性。

Abstract: AI accelerators, customized to AI workloads, provide cost-effective and
high-performance solutions for training and inference. Trainium, an AI
accelerator recently developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS), provides an
attractive option for LLM training and inference through its heterogeneous
architecture. However, leveraging Trainium architecture for high performance
can be challenging because of its systolic array architecture and special
requirement on data layout. In this paper, we design high-performance matrix
multiplication (matmul), a critical compute kernel, for LLM inference on
Trainium. We introduce a series of techniques customized to Trainium based on
kernel fusion and novel caching strategies to reduce data movement across the
software-managed memory hierarchy, maximize SRAM bandwidth, and avoid expensive
matrix transpose. Evaluating with nine datasets and four recent LLMs, we show
that our system largely outperforms the state-of-the-art matmul implemented by
AWS on Trainium: at the level of matmul kernel, it achieves an average 1.35x
speedup (up to 2.22x), which translates to an average 1.66x speedup (up to
2.49x) for end-to-end LLM inference.

TL;DR: 本文提出AttnCache框架，通过重用相似注意力图加速LLM预填充阶段的推理，减少自注意力计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多实际应用只依赖于LLM的预填充阶段，而自注意力计算因其二次复杂度成为性能瓶颈。

Method: 基于注意力图记忆数据库，AttnCache采用高效缓存和相似性搜索技术，重用预缓存的注意力图。

Result: 实验结果显示，在CPU上实现了平均1.2倍端到端和2倍注意力加速，在GPU上实现了1.6倍端到端和3倍注意力加速，且精度下降可忽略不计。

Conclusion: AttnCache通过重用相似注意力图有效提升了LLM预填充阶段的推理效率，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in generative applications such
as chatting, code generation, and reasoning. However, many realworld workloads
such as classification, question answering, recommendation, and text embedding
rely solely on the prefill stage of inference, where the model encodes input
sequences without performing autoregressive decoding. In these prefill only
scenarios, the self-attention computation becomes the primary performance
bottleneck due to its quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length. In
this paper, we observe that semantically different sentences often produce
similar attention maps across layers and heads. Building on this insight, we
propose AttnCache, a framework that accelerates the prefill stage of LLM
inference by retrieving and reusing similar attention maps. Based on an
attention map memorization database, AttnCache employs efficient caching and
similarity search techniques to identify and reuse pre-cached attention maps
during inference, thereby reducing the computational overhead of
self-attention. Experimental results show that AttnCache achieves an average of
1.2x end-to-end and 2x attention speedup on CPU, and 1.6x end-to-end and 3x
attention speedup on GPU, with negligible accuracy degradation.

TL;DR: PORTool是一种强化学习方法，通过鼓励大语言模型探索多种轨迹，提高工具使用的动态环境性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具使用的大语言模型在静态数据集上训练，无法有效探索动态工具调用环境中的多种解决方案，导致性能受限。

Method: PORTool方法首先生成多个轨迹，形成树状结构，然后根据步骤产生正确答案和成功工具调用的能力分配奖励，使用步骤奖励计算分叉相对优势，并与轨迹相对优势结合来训练模型。

Result: 在17种工具上进行的实验显示，PORTool在最终准确率和工具调用步骤数量上显著优于其他训练方法。

Conclusion: PORTool通过引入步骤奖励和分叉相对优势，有效提升了工具使用LLMs在动态环境中的表现，具有设计的必要性和稳健性。

Abstract: Current tool-use large language models (LLMs) are trained on static datasets,
enabling them to interact with external tools and perform multi-step,
tool-integrated reasoning, which produces tool-call trajectories. However,
these models imitate how a query is resolved in a generic tool-call routine,
thereby failing to explore possible solutions and demonstrating limited
performance in an evolved, dynamic tool-call environment. In this work, we
propose PORTool, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that encourages a
tool-use LLM to explore various trajectories yielding the correct answer.
Specifically, this method starts with generating multiple rollouts for a given
query, and some of them share the first few tool-call steps, thereby forming a
tree-like structure. Next, we assign rewards to each step, based on its ability
to produce a correct answer and make successful tool calls. A shared step
across different trajectories receives the same reward, while different steps
under the same fork receive different rewards. Finally, these step-wise rewards
are used to calculate fork-relative advantages, blended with
trajectory-relative advantages, to train the LLM for tool use. The experiments
utilize 17 tools to address user queries, covering both time-sensitive and
time-invariant topics. We conduct ablation studies to systematically justify
the necessity and the design robustness of step-wise rewards. Furthermore, we
compare the proposed PORTool with other training approaches and demonstrate
significant improvements in final accuracy and the number of tool-call steps.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了跨语言对齐（CLA）中的文化擦除问题，并提出了一种新的推理时方法Surgical Steering以平衡知识转移和文化定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 论文假设追求跨语言对齐会导致文化擦除，即模型在查询不同语言时失去提供文化相关响应的能力。

Method: 引入一个全面的评估框架transfer-localization plane，重新评估了最近的CLA方法，并提出了一种新的推理时方法Surgical Steering，通过在不同模型层应用有针对性的激活控制来分离通用事实转移和文化特定知识。

Result: 发现所有研究的六种语言中，CLA方法在提高事实转移的同时直接牺牲了文化定位。Surgical Steering方法在平衡这两个竞争维度上表现更好。

Conclusion: 通过在不同层应用有针对性的激活控制，Surgical Steering方法有效地克服了当前对齐技术的局限性，实现了更好的平衡。

Abstract: Cross-lingual alignment (CLA) aims to align multilingual representations,
enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to seamlessly transfer knowledge across
languages. While intuitive, we hypothesize, this pursuit of representational
convergence can inadvertently cause "cultural erasure", the functional loss of
providing culturally-situated responses that should diverge based on the query
language. In this work, we systematically analyze this trade-off by introducing
a holistic evaluation framework, the transfer-localization plane, which
quantifies both desirable knowledge transfer and undesirable cultural erasure.
Using this framework, we re-evaluate recent CLA approaches and find that they
consistently improve factual transfer at the direct cost of cultural
localization across all six languages studied. Our investigation into the
internal representations of these models reveals a key insight: universal
factual transfer and culturally-specific knowledge are optimally steerable at
different model layers. Based on this finding, we propose Surgical Steering, a
novel inference-time method that disentangles these two objectives. By applying
targeted activation steering to distinct layers, our approach achieves a better
balance between the two competing dimensions, effectively overcoming the
limitations of current alignment techniques.

TL;DR: 提出QCoder Benchmark，用于评估大型语言模型在量子编程任务中的表现，并引入量子模拟器环境和实际人类编程比赛数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在自动生成编程代码方面取得进展，但在需要与硬件设备交互的领域（如量子编程）仍缺乏探索。

Method: 引入一个评估框架，支持通过量子模拟器环境进行评估，并结合实际人类编程比赛中的代码提交，对LLM输出进行定性和定量分析。

Result: 实验显示，GPT-4o的准确率约为18.97%，而推理模型o3达到78%的准确率，超过人类代码的平均成功率（39.98%）。

Conclusion: QCoder Benchmark揭示了量子编程任务的难度，并展示了推理模型在该领域的潜力，同时提供了支持进一步研究的数据集和评估API。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been applied to automatic
programming code generation. This task can be viewed as a language generation
task that bridges natural language, human knowledge, and programming logic.
However, it remains underexplored in domains that require interaction with
hardware devices, such as quantum programming, where human coders write Python
code that is executed on a quantum computer. To address this gap, we introduce
QCoder Benchmark, an evaluation framework that assesses LLMs on quantum
programming with feedback from simulated hardware devices. Our benchmark offers
two key features. First, it supports evaluation using a quantum simulator
environment beyond conventional Python execution, allowing feedback of
domain-specific metrics such as circuit depth, execution time, and error
classification, which can be used to guide better generation. Second, it
incorporates human-written code submissions collected from real programming
contests, enabling both quantitative comparisons and qualitative analyses of
LLM outputs against human-written codes. Our experiments reveal that even
advanced models like GPT-4o achieve only around 18.97% accuracy, highlighting
the difficulty of the benchmark. In contrast, reasoning-based models such as o3
reach up to 78% accuracy, outperforming averaged success rates of human-written
codes (39.98%). We release the QCoder Benchmark dataset and public evaluation
API to support further research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的训练范式1PNS，通过引入多个有效推理路径以提高模型输出的多样性，解决了测试时缩放(TTS)中由于单一答案导致的推理路径狭窄的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLM)在推理能力上虽然通过测试时缩放(TTS)得到了改善，但低输出多样性成为瓶颈，部分原因是训练中常采用“一个问题，一个解决方案”(1P1S)的做法，使得模型倾向于窄的推理路径。

Method: 引入“一个问题，多个解决方案”(1PNS)的训练范式，并提出了推理路径散度(RPD)这一步骤级指标，用于衡量多步推理链之间的语义差异，并选择多样性最大的解决方案进行训练。

Result: 实验表明，RPD选择的训练数据产生了更多样化的输出和更高的pass@k，pass@16平均增益为+2.80%，在AIME24上增益为+4.99%，证明了1PNS对TTS的有效性增强。

Conclusion: 1PNS训练范式通过引入多样化的推理路径，显著提升了TTS的有效性，为大型语言模型的推理能力提供了新的提升路径。

Abstract: While Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the reasoning
ability of large language models (LLMs), low diversity in model outputs often
becomes a bottleneck; this is partly caused by the common "one problem, one
solution" (1P1S) training practice, which provides a single canonical answer
and can push models toward a narrow set of reasoning paths. To address this, we
propose a "one problem, multiple solutions" (1PNS) training paradigm that
exposes the model to a variety of valid reasoning trajectories and thus
increases inference diversity. A core challenge for 1PNS is reliably measuring
semantic differences between multi-step chains of thought, so we introduce
Reasoning Path Divergence (RPD), a step-level metric that aligns and scores
Long Chain-of-Thought solutions to capture differences in intermediate
reasoning. Using RPD, we curate maximally diverse solution sets per problem and
fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Base. Experiments show that RPD-selected training yields
more varied outputs and higher pass@k, with an average +2.80% gain in pass@16
over a strong 1P1S baseline and a +4.99% gain on AIME24, demonstrating that
1PNS further amplifies the effectiveness of TTS. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 本文研究了说服技巧（PTs）和话语关系（DRs）之间的关系，通过利用大型语言模型（LLMs）和提示工程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于目前没有同时标注PTs和DRs的数据集，本文旨在通过LLMs为现有数据集标注DRs，从而分析两者之间的关系。

Method: 以SemEval 2023 Task 3数据集为起点，开发了基于LLMs的分类器，为数据集中的每个实例标注PDTB 3.0 level-2 DRs。使用了四种LLMs和十种不同的提示，生成了40种独特的DR分类器，并通过集成模型创建了五个同时标注PTs和DRs的银标数据集。

Result: 银标数据集大小因多数合并技术不同而异，从1,281个实例到204个实例。统计分析表明，六种话语关系（即原因、目的、对比、原因+信念、让步和条件）在说服性文本中起关键作用，尤其是在使用加载语言、夸大/最小化、重复和怀疑等技巧时。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了特定话语关系在说服技巧中的重要性，对检测在线宣传和虚假信息以及理解有效沟通具有贡献。

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between Persuasion Techniques (PTs)
and Discourse Relations (DRs) by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and
prompt engineering. Since no dataset annotated with both PTs and DRs exists, we
took the SemEval 2023 Task 3 dataset labelled with 19 PTs as a starting point
and developed LLM-based classifiers to label each instance of the dataset with
one of the 22 PDTB 3.0 level-2 DRs. In total, four LLMs were evaluated using 10
different prompts, resulting in 40 unique DR classifiers. Ensemble models using
different majority-pooling strategies were used to create 5 silver datasets of
instances labelled with both persuasion techniques and level-2 PDTB senses. The
silver dataset sizes vary from 1,281 instances to 204 instances, depending on
the majority pooling technique used. Statistical analysis of these silver
datasets shows that six discourse relations (namely Cause, Purpose, Contrast,
Cause+Belief, Concession, and Condition) play a crucial role in persuasive
texts, especially in the use of Loaded Language, Exaggeration/Minimisation,
Repetition and to cast Doubt. This insight can contribute to detecting online
propaganda and misinformation, as well as to our general understanding of
effective communication.

Motivation: 改善生成序列的概率分布，减少回避（abstentions），提高统计效率。

Method: 利用最终层SDM激活层进行有监督微调，估计基变换并优化下一标记损失，结合对比输入编码方案和在线生成的硬负样本。

Result: 与强监督基线相比，SDM语言模型减少了回避，提高了统计效率。

Conclusion: 现有预训练解码器型Transformer语言模型可以通过有监督微调转化为SDM语言模型，提高生成序列的质量。

Abstract: We introduce Similarity-Distance-Magnitude (SDM) language models (LMs), which
are sequence prediction models fine-tuned to maximize the proportion of
generations in the well-calibrated, high-probability region partitioned by a
final-layer SDM activation layer used for binary classification of
instruction-following. We demonstrate that existing pre-trained decoder-only
Transformer LMs can be readily converted into SDM LMs via supervised
fine-tuning, using the final-layer SDM activation layer during training to
estimate a change-of-base for a supervised next-token loss over a contrastive
input encoding scheme, with additional hard negative examples generated online
during training. This results in reduced abstentions (i.e., improved
statistical efficiency) compared to strong supervised baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了扩散语言模型（DLMs）中的更新遗忘问题，并提出了一种称为Token Timestep Allocation（TTA）的方法，通过按token的时间步长排序来提高模型的控制性和流畅性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型在细粒度调整方面表现出潜力，但其实际控制能力依然脆弱。更新遗忘是主要问题，即无差别和上下文无关的更新导致token级别的波动，从而影响语义编辑和累积调整过程。

Method: 作者提出了Token Timestep Allocation（TTA），通过每个token的时间步长安排实现软性和语义性的token排序：关键token早期冻结，而不确定的token持续细化。时间步长排序可以固定策略或基于任务信号的适应性策略实例化。

Result: 实验表明，TTA提高了控制性和流畅性：在情感控制任务中，准确率提高了20%以上，困惑度减少近一半；在去毒化任务中，最大毒性降低（12.2 vs 14.5），困惑度降低（26.0 vs 32.0）。

Conclusion: 通过时间步长分配实现的软性排序是缓解更新遗忘和实现稳定可控扩散文本生成的关键。

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) enable fine-grained refinement, their
practical controllability remains fragile. We identify and formally
characterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform
and context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps,
erasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement
process, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in
uniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token
ordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and
semantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are
frozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This
timestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an
adaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of
refinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies
uniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision
sources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment
control, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves
perplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers
maximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0).
Together, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep
allocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving
stable and controllable diffusion text generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG评估基准主要关注局部理解（local RAG），但现实应用需要跨文档聚合信息的global RAG能力，现有方法在此类任务上表现不佳。

Method: 1) 构建GlobalQA基准，包含计数、极值查询、排序、top-k提取四类任务；2) 提出GlobalRAG框架，结合块级检索、LLM智能过滤和符号计算聚合模块。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-14B模型上，GlobalRAG达到6.63 F1，显著优于最强基线（1.51 F1）。

Conclusion: 现有RAG方法难以处理全局任务，GlobalRAG通过多工具协作框架有效提升了global RAG性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a leading approach to
reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). Current RAG evaluation
benchmarks primarily focus on what we call local RAG: retrieving relevant
chunks from a small subset of documents to answer queries that require only
localized understanding within specific text chunks. However, many real-world
applications require a fundamentally different capability -- global RAG --
which involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document
collections to derive corpus-level insights (for example, "What are the top 10
most cited papers in 2023?"). In this paper, we introduce GlobalQA -- the first
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate global RAG capabilities, covering
four core task types: counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k
extraction. Through systematic evaluation across different models and
baselines, we find that existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks,
with the strongest baseline achieving only 1.51 F1 score. To address these
challenges, we propose GlobalRAG, a multi-tool collaborative framework that
preserves structural coherence through chunk-level retrieval, incorporates
LLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and integrates
aggregation modules for precise symbolic computation. On the Qwen2.5-14B model,
GlobalRAG achieves 6.63 F1 compared to the strongest baseline's 1.51 F1,
validating the effectiveness of our method.

Motivation: 准确解释隐含意义在人类交流和语言使用中至关重要，期望语言模型也具备这一能力。

Method: 提出一种方法，将Gricean语用学和关联理论等语用学理论概述作为提示，引导语言模型进行逐步推理。

Result: 与基线方法相比，该方法在语用推理任务上最高可提升9.6%的分数；即使仅提及理论名称，较大模型的性能也能提升1-3%。

Conclusion: 将语用学理论作为提示是一种有效的上下文学习方法，有助于提升语言模型对隐含意义的理解能力。

Abstract: The ability to accurately interpret implied meanings plays a crucial role in
human communication and language use, and language models are also expected to
possess this capability. This study demonstrates that providing language models
with pragmatic theories as prompts is an effective in-context learning approach
for tasks to understand implied meanings. Specifically, we propose an approach
in which an overview of pragmatic theories, such as Gricean pragmatics and
Relevance Theory, is presented as a prompt to the language model, guiding it
through a step-by-step reasoning process to derive a final interpretation.
Experimental results showed that, compared to the baseline, which prompts
intermediate reasoning without presenting pragmatic theories (0-shot
Chain-of-Thought), our methods enabled language models to achieve up to 9.6\%
higher scores on pragmatic reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we show that even
without explaining the details of pragmatic theories, merely mentioning their
names in the prompt leads to a certain performance improvement (around 1-3%) in
larger models compared to the baseline.

Motivation: 在双语社区中，说话者通常能区分外来词和本地词汇，本文旨在探究预训练语言模型是否具备类似能力，尤其是在主流语言对少数语言施加词汇压力的情况下。

Method: 评估了10种语言上的多个预训练语言模型，通过明确指示和上下文信息来测试其区分外来词和本地词汇的能力。

Result: 尽管有明确的指示和上下文信息，模型在区分外来词和本地词汇方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 现代自然语言处理系统表现出对外来词的偏向，这对开发支持少数语言和保护语言多样性的NLP工具具有重要意义。

Abstract: Throughout language history, words are borrowed from one language to another
and gradually become integrated into the recipient's lexicon. Speakers can
often differentiate these loanwords from native vocabulary, particularly in
bilingual communities where a dominant language continuously imposes lexical
items on a minority language. This paper investigates whether pretrained
language models, including large language models, possess similar capabilities
for loanword identification. We evaluate multiple models across 10 languages.
Despite explicit instructions and contextual information, our results show that
models perform poorly in distinguishing loanwords from native ones. These
findings corroborate previous evidence that modern NLP systems exhibit a bias
toward loanwords rather than native equivalents. Our work has implications for
developing NLP tools for minority languages and supporting language
preservation in communities under lexical pressure from dominant languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉-语言模型在不同语言间表现不均，且模型压缩会加剧该问题。知识蒸馏虽有效，但在多语言场景下应用尚不充分，因此需要系统性研究。

Method: 通过控制实验，对比五种知识蒸馏方法在CLIP和SigLIP2模型上的表现，聚焦跨语言表征一致性与下游任务稳定性。

Result: 部分蒸馏配置在模型尺寸减半时仍能保持或提升多语言检索性能，但其他配置无法维持跨任务稳定性，显示出设计敏感性的权衡。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏在多语言视觉-语言模型压缩中的表现依赖于具体配置，需综合考虑跨语言一致性与任务稳定性，而不仅仅是整体准确率。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit uneven performance across languages, a
problem that is often exacerbated when the model size is reduced. While
Knowledge distillation (KD) demonstrates promising results in transferring
knowledge from larger to smaller VLMs, applying KD in multilingualism is an
underexplored area. This paper presents a controlled empirical study of KD
behavior across five distillation approaches, isolating their effects on
cross-lingual representation consistency and downstream performance stability
under model compression. We study five distillation formulations across CLIP
and SigLIP2, and evaluate them on in-domain retrieval and out-of-domain visual
QA. We find that some configurations preserve or even improve multilingual
retrieval robustness despite halving model size, but others fail to maintain
cross-task stability, exposing design-sensitive trade-offs that aggregate
accuracy alone does not reveal.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型通过样本-评估-集成解码器提升推理能力，但传统方法依赖外部信号（如token概率、熵），这些信号在训练后可能校准不佳。本文提出基于神经元激活的内部行为分析，并设计了一种无监督的Neuron Agreement Decoding (NAD)方法，该方法利用激活稀疏性和跨样本神经元一致性选择候选答案，实现早期正确性预测和高效解码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 外部信号（如token概率）在训练后校准不佳，无法充分反映模型内部推理质量。作者通过分析神经元激活发现，正确与错误响应在神经元激活模式上存在显著差异，这为改进解码提供了新方向。

Method: 提出Neuron Agreement Decoding (NAD)，一种无监督的best-of-N方法，通过激活稀疏性和跨样本神经元一致性选择候选答案。NAD仅依赖内部信号，无需文本输出比较，支持早期停止。

Result: 在数学和科学基准上，NAD与多数投票相当；在开放式编码任务中，NAD优于Avg@64。NAD可减少99%的token使用量，同时保持生成质量。

Conclusion: 内部信号（如神经元激活）为无标签集成解码提供了可靠、可扩展且高效的指导，NAD展示了内部行为分析在提升模型推理效率方面的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) commonly boost reasoning via
sample-evaluate-ensemble decoders, achieving label free gains without ground
truth. However, prevailing strategies score candidates using only external
outputs such as token probabilities, entropies, or self evaluations, and these
signals can be poorly calibrated after post training. We instead analyze
internal behavior based on neuron activations and uncover three findings: (1)
external signals are low dimensional projections of richer internal dynamics;
(2) correct responses activate substantially fewer unique neurons than
incorrect ones throughout generation; and (3) activations from correct
responses exhibit stronger cross sample agreement, whereas incorrect ones
diverge. Motivated by these observations, we propose Neuron Agreement Decoding
(NAD), an unsupervised best-of-N method that selects candidates using
activation sparsity and cross sample neuron agreement, operating solely on
internal signals and without requiring comparable textual outputs. NAD enables
early correctness prediction within the first 32 generated tokens and supports
aggressive early stopping. Across math and science benchmarks with verifiable
answers, NAD matches majority voting; on open ended coding benchmarks where
majority voting is inapplicable, NAD consistently outperforms Avg@64. By
pruning unpromising trajectories early, NAD reduces token usage by 99% with
minimal loss in generation quality, showing that internal signals provide
reliable, scalable, and efficient guidance for label free ensemble decoding.

Conclusion: 研究为理解预训练LLMs如何操作数字提供了基础，并提出了通过更准确的探测技术改进LLMs架构的潜力。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that different large language models (LLMs) converge to
similar and accurate input embedding representations for numbers. These
findings conflict with the documented propensity of LLMs to produce erroneous
outputs when dealing with numeric information. In this work, we aim to explain
this conflict by exploring how language models manipulate numbers and quantify
the lower bounds of accuracy of these mechanisms. We find that despite
surfacing errors, different language models learn interchangeable
representations of numbers that are systematic, highly accurate and universal
across their hidden states and the types of input contexts. This allows us to
create universal probes for each LLM and to trace information -- including the
causes of output errors -- to specific layers. Our results lay a fundamental
understanding of how pre-trained LLMs manipulate numbers and outline the
potential of more accurate probing techniques in addressed refinements of LLMs'
architectures.

TL;DR: SCRIBE是一个用于教育反馈报告的多跳、工具增强推理框架，通过领域特定工具和自反推理管道生成有效响应，并在3B和8B模型上实现了与更大模型相媲美或更优的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在教育场景中提供个性化反馈时面临隐私、计算资源和教学有效性三大挑战，需要小而开源、可本地运行且能可靠输出正确信息的模型。

Method: SCRIBE框架结合领域特定工具和自反推理管道，支持迭代推理、工具使用和错误恢复，通过两阶段LoRA在合成数据上微调3B和8B模型。

Result: 8B-SCRIBE在相关性和可操作性等维度上与更大模型相当或更优，学生感知质量与GPT-4o和Llama-3.3 70B相当。

Conclusion: SCRIBE在低资源、隐私敏感的教育场景中展示了其可行性，为实际部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Language models can be used to provide interactive, personalized student
feedback in educational settings. However, real-world deployment faces three
key challenges: privacy concerns, limited computational resources, and the need
for pedagogically valid responses. These constraints require small, open-source
models that can run locally and reliably ground their outputs in correct
information. We introduce SCRIBE, a framework for multi-hop, tool-augmented
reasoning designed to generate valid responses to student questions about
feedback reports. SCRIBE combines domain-specific tools with a self-reflective
inference pipeline that supports iterative reasoning, tool use, and error
recovery. We distil these capabilities into 3B and 8B models via two-stage LoRA
fine-tuning on synthetic GPT-4o-generated data. Evaluation with a human-aligned
GPT-Judge and a user study with 108 students shows that 8B-SCRIBE models
achieve comparable or superior quality to much larger models in key dimensions
such as relevance and actionability, while being perceived on par with GPT-4o
and Llama-3.3 70B by students. These findings demonstrate the viability of
SCRIBE for low-resource, privacy-sensitive educational applications.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种名为ACER的方法，通过合成课程和问答对，将通用语言模型转变为领域专家，同时保持其通用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在需要深度、原则性理解的专业领域（如经济学和心理学）表现不佳。为了解决这个问题，作者提出了ACER方法，以提升模型在特定领域的性能。

Method: ACER方法首先生成一个全面的教科书式课程，通过生成科目的目录，然后根据Bloom的分类法创建问题-答案对。这一合成的语料库用于持续预训练，采用交替课程安排，使内容和认知维度的学习对齐。

Result: 在Llama 3.2（1B和3B）上的实验显示，在特定的MMLU子集上有显著的性能提升。在微观经济学等具有挑战性的领域，ACER将准确率提高了5个百分点。在所有目标领域，观察到一致的平均提升3个百分点。此外，ACER还促进了跨领域的知识迁移，提高了非目标领域的性能。

Conclusion: ACER提供了一种可扩展且有效的方法，以弥补LLMs中的关键领域差距，同时避免灾难性遗忘并促进知识迁移。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at general tasks but underperform in
specialized domains like economics and psychology, which require deep,
principled understanding. To address this, we introduce ACER (Automated
Curriculum-Enhanced Regimen) that transforms generalist models into domain
experts without sacrificing their broad capabilities. ACER first synthesizes a
comprehensive, textbook-style curriculum by generating a table of contents for
a subject and then creating question-answer (QA) pairs guided by Bloom's
taxonomy. This ensures systematic topic coverage and progressively increasing
difficulty. The resulting synthetic corpus is used for continual pretraining
with an interleaved curriculum schedule, aligning learning across both content
and cognitive dimensions.
  Experiments with Llama 3.2 (1B and 3B) show significant gains in specialized
MMLU subsets. In challenging domains like microeconomics, where baselines
struggle, ACER boosts accuracy by 5 percentage points. Across all target
domains, we observe a consistent macro-average improvement of 3 percentage
points. Notably, ACER not only prevents catastrophic forgetting but also
facilitates positive cross-domain knowledge transfer, improving performance on
non-target domains by 0.7 points. Beyond MMLU, ACER enhances performance on
knowledge-intensive benchmarks like ARC and GPQA by over 2 absolute points,
while maintaining stable performance on general reasoning tasks. Our results
demonstrate that ACER offers a scalable and effective recipe for closing
critical domain gaps in LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文研究了如何通过合成数据生成和轻量级微调技术提升大语言模型（LLMs）在科学类谬误论点识别任务中的表现，提出了MisSynth框架，在MISSCI数据集上实现了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 健康类错误信息危害大且难以识别，尤其当这些主张歪曲或误读科学发现时。现有LLMs在零样本条件下识别谬误的能力有限，且标注数据稀缺，因此需要利用合成数据增强模型性能。

Method: 提出MisSynth流水线，结合检索增强生成（RAG）生成合成谬误样本，并用于微调LLM模型。通过轻量级微调技术提升模型在科学类谬误识别任务中的表现。

Result: 微调后的模型在MISSCI测试集上相比基线模型有显著性能提升，例如LLaMA 3.1 8B微调模型F1分数提升了35%以上。

Conclusion: 通过引入合成谬误数据增强有限的标注资源，可以显著提升零样本LLM在现实世界科学错误信息分类任务中的性能，即使计算资源有限也能取得良好效果。

Abstract: Health-related misinformation is very prevalent and potentially harmful. It
is difficult to identify, especially when claims distort or misinterpret
scientific findings. We investigate the impact of synthetic data generation and
lightweight fine-tuning techniques on the ability of large language models
(LLMs) to recognize fallacious arguments using the MISSCI dataset and
framework. In this work, we propose MisSynth, a pipeline that applies
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to produce synthetic fallacy samples,
which are then used to fine-tune an LLM model. Our results show substantial
accuracy gains with fine-tuned models compared to vanilla baselines. For
instance, the LLaMA 3.1 8B fine-tuned model achieved an over 35% F1-score
absolute improvement on the MISSCI test split over its vanilla baseline. We
demonstrate that introducing synthetic fallacy data to augment limited
annotated resources can significantly enhance zero-shot LLM classification
performance on real-world scientific misinformation tasks, even with limited
computational resources. The code and synthetic dataset are available on

TL;DR: 提出一种以交互为中心的框架，用于自动组成多语言模型团队，无需先验知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体方法依赖协同团队组成，但最优团队的形成具有挑战性，因为模型的内在特性不透明。

Method: 构建‘语言模型图’，通过语义一致性映射模型间关系，并应用社区检测识别协同模型集群。

Result: 实验显示该方法能发现反映潜在专长的功能一致组，团队表现优于随机组合，接近手动策划团队。

Conclusion: 为自动化设计协作多智能体LLM团队提供了新基础。

Abstract: While a multi-agent approach based on large language models (LLMs) represents
a promising strategy to surpass the capabilities of single models, its success
is critically dependent on synergistic team composition. However, forming
optimal teams is a significant challenge, as the inherent opacity of most
models obscures the internal characteristics necessary for effective
collaboration. In this paper, we propose an interaction-centric framework for
automatic team composition that does not require any prior knowledge including
their internal architectures, training data, or task performances. Our method
constructs a "language model graph" that maps relationships between models from
the semantic coherence of pairwise conversations, and then applies community
detection to identify synergistic model clusters. Our experiments with diverse
LLMs demonstrate that the proposed method discovers functionally coherent
groups that reflect their latent specializations. Priming conversations with
specific topics identified synergistic teams which outperform random baselines
on downstream benchmarks and achieve comparable accuracy to that of
manually-curated teams based on known model specializations. Our findings
provide a new basis for the automated design of collaborative multi-agent LLM
teams.

Method: 研究采用预训练语言模型和大型语言模型进行话语关系分类，重点分析科学出版物，并考察了上下文（由话语结构定义）对分类任务的影响。

Result: 实验表明，上下文通常有助于提升话语关系分类的效果，并分析了哪些科学话语关系类型最能从上下文中获益。

Conclusion: 该研究为科学出版物中话语关系分类任务提供了初步见解，强调了利用上下文信息的重要性，为未来改进AI生成科学主张的证据支持提供了方向。

Abstract: With the increasing use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods to
support science workflows, we are interested in the use of discourse-level
information to find supporting evidence for AI generated scientific claims. A
first step towards this objective is to examine the task of inferring discourse
structure in scientific writing.
  In this work, we present a preliminary investigation of pretrained language

Classification (DRC), focusing on scientific publications, an under-studied
genre for this task. We examine how context can help with the DRC task, with
our experiments showing that context, as defined by discourse structure, is
generally helpful. We also present an analysis of which scientific discourse
relation types might benefit most from context.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了OmniEduBench，一个全面的中文教育基准，旨在评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在教育领域的能力，尤其是在知识维度和培养维度方面的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs及其基准主要集中在知识维度，忽视了教育场景中重要的培养能力评估，同时当前基准往往局限于单一学科或题型，缺乏多样性，这在中文语境中尤为突出。

Method: 引入了OmniEduBench，包含24,602个高质量问答对，分为知识维度和培养维度，并细分为61个不同学科。数据集涵盖11种常见考试题型，用于全面评估LLMs的教育能力。

Result: 在知识维度上，只有Gemini-2.5 Pro的准确率超过60%。在培养维度上，表现最好的模型QWQ仍然落后人类智能近30%。

Conclusion: 实验结果突显了LLMs在教育领域应用的挑战和改进空间，强调了进一步研究和开发的必要性。

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), various LLM-based
works have been widely applied in educational fields. However, most existing
LLMs and their benchmarks focus primarily on the knowledge dimension, largely
neglecting the evaluation of cultivation capabilities that are essential for
real-world educational scenarios. Additionally, current benchmarks are often
limited to a single subject or question type, lacking sufficient diversity.
This issue is particularly prominent within the Chinese context. To address
this gap, we introduce OmniEduBench, a comprehensive Chinese educational
benchmark. OmniEduBench consists of 24.602K high-quality question-answer pairs.
The data is meticulously divided into two core dimensions: the knowledge
dimension and the cultivation dimension, which contain 18.121K and 6.481K
entries, respectively. Each dimension is further subdivided into 6 fine-grained
categories, covering a total of 61 different subjects (41 in the knowledge and
20 in the cultivation). Furthermore, the dataset features a rich variety of
question formats, including 11 common exam question types, providing a solid
foundation for comprehensively evaluating LLMs' capabilities in education.
Extensive experiments on 11 mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs
reveal a clear performance gap. In the knowledge dimension, only Gemini-2.5 Pro
surpassed 60\% accuracy, while in the cultivation dimension, the
best-performing model, QWQ, still trailed human intelligence by nearly 30\%.
These results highlight the substantial room for improvement and underscore the
challenges of applying LLMs in education.

TL;DR: SSLC方法通过结合低秩近似和稀疏优化技术，在不进行额外训练的情况下，实现了对大语言模型的高效压缩，超越了单独使用任一技术的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型因带宽和计算需求巨大，限制了其广泛应用。尽管剪枝和低秩近似各自展示了良好的性能，但二者结合用于LLM的潜力仍待探索。

Method: SSLC方法将低秩近似和稀疏优化统一为一个问题，通过迭代优化算法进行解决，从而利用两者的优势。

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen2.5模型上的实验显示，SSLC在没有额外训练步骤的情况下，始终优于单独使用任一方法，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SSLC方法通过有效结合两种压缩技术，为高效部署大型语言模型提供了实用解决方案，特别是在Qwen2.5上实现了50%压缩且性能无下降。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
language comprehension and generation; however, their widespread adoption is
constrained by substantial bandwidth and computational demands. While pruning
and low-rank approximation have each demonstrated promising performance
individually, their synergy for LLMs remains underexplored. We introduce
\underline{S}ynergistic \underline{S}parse and \underline{L}ow-Rank
\underline{C}ompression (SSLC) methods for LLMs, which leverages the strengths
of both techniques: low-rank approximation compresses the model by retaining
its essential structure with minimal information loss, whereas sparse
optimization eliminates non-essential weights, preserving those crucial for
generalization. Based on theoretical analysis, we first formulate the low-rank
approximation and sparse optimization as a unified problem and solve it by
iterative optimization algorithm. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen2.5 models
(7B-70B) show that SSLC, without any additional training steps, consistently
surpasses standalone methods, achieving state-of-the-arts results. Notably,
SSLC compresses Qwen2.5 by 50\% with no performance drop and achieves at least
1.63$\times$ speedup, offering a practical solution for efficient LLM
deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希伯来语元音标注对准确发音和消除歧义至关重要，当前无元音文本高度歧义，需有效自动标注方法。

Method: 将任务视为零样本分类问题，利用希伯来语视觉语言模型，将无元音文本作为图像处理，动态生成候选元音标注集，并结合上下文选择最佳标注。

Result: 在“oracle”设定下，DIVRIT实现了高准确率，通过架构优化和训练方法改进，显著提升了系统的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 视觉表示在希伯来语自动元音标注中具有巨大潜力，DIVRIT展示了不依赖复杂语言分析的高效标注能力。

Abstract: Diacritics restoration in Hebrew is a fundamental task for ensuring accurate
word pronunciation and disambiguating textual meaning. Despite the language's
high degree of ambiguity when unvocalized, recent machine learning approaches
have significantly advanced performance on this task.
  In this work, we present DIVRIT, a novel system for Hebrew diacritization
that frames the task as a zero-shot classification problem. Our approach
operates at the word level, selecting the most appropriate diacritization
pattern for each undiacritized word from a dynamically generated candidate set,
conditioned on the surrounding textual context. A key innovation of DIVRIT is
its use of a Hebrew Visual Language Model, which processes undiacritized text
as an image, allowing diacritic information to be embedded directly within the
input's vector representation.
  Through a comprehensive evaluation across various configurations, we
demonstrate that the system effectively performs diacritization without relying
on complex, explicit linguistic analysis. Notably, in an ``oracle'' setting
where the correct diacritized form is guaranteed to be among the provided
candidates, DIVRIT achieves a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, strategic
architectural enhancements and optimized training methodologies yield
significant improvements in the system's overall generalization capabilities.
These findings highlight the promising potential of visual representations for
accurate and automated Hebrew diacritization.

Motivation: 大语言模型因其自回归设计和较大规模，面临显著的推理延迟挑战。现有的推测解码技术虽然有所改进，但忽略了GPU设备和批量大小等关键系统变量的影响。

Method: 提出了一种新的动态树解码方法CAST，该方法考虑了包括GPU配置和批量大小在内的推理成本，动态优化树结构。

Result: 在六项不同任务和六个不同大语言模型上的广泛实验表明，该方法比传统解码方法快达5.2倍，并且通常优于现有技术5%至20%。

Conclusion: CAST方法通过动态调整树结构，有效提升了解码速度，为推测解码领域提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant inference latency challenges
stemming from their autoregressive design and large size. To address this,
speculative decoding emerges as a solution, enabling the simultaneous
generation and validation of multiple tokens. While recent approaches like
EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3 improve speculative decoding using dynamic tree structures,
they often neglect the impact of crucial system variables such as GPU devices
and batch sizes.
  Therefore, we introduce a new dynamic tree decoding approach called CAST that
takes into account inference costs, including factors such as GPU
configurations and batch sizes, to dynamically refine the tree structure.
Through comprehensive experimentation across six diverse tasks and utilizing
six distinct LLMs, our methodology demonstrates remarkable results, achieving
speeds up to 5.2 times faster than conventional decoding methods. Moreover, it
generally outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques from 5% to 20%.

TL;DR: 本文对编码器-解码器架构的LLM（RedLLM）与主流解码器架构LLM（DecLLM）进行了全面的比较分析，发现RedLLM在扩展性、上下文长度推断能力和推理效率方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM的研究重点已经从编码器-解码器模型转向了解码器模型，但缺乏从扩展性角度对这两种架构的深入比较，因此作者希望填补这一空白。

Method: 通过将RedLLM与DecLLM在不同模型规模（从~150M到~8B）上进行比较，并使用RedPajama V1（1.6T tokens）进行预训练，FLAN进行指令微调。

Result: RedLLM在扩展性和上下文长度推断能力上与DecLLM相当，在指令微调后，在各种下游任务上达到甚至超过了DecLLM的表现，同时推理效率更高。

Conclusion: RedLLM在性能和效率方面具有很大潜力，值得进一步研究和开发，以构建更强大且高效的LLM。

Abstract: Recent large language model (LLM) research has undergone an architectural
shift from encoder-decoder modeling to nowadays the dominant decoder-only
modeling. This rapid transition, however, comes without a rigorous comparative
analysis especially \textit{from the scaling perspective}, raising concerns
that the potential of encoder-decoder models may have been overlooked. To fill
this gap, we revisit encoder-decoder LLM (RedLLM), enhancing it with recent
recipes from decoder-only LLM (DecLLM). We conduct a comprehensive comparison
between RedLLM, pretrained with prefix language modeling (LM), and DecLLM,
pretrained with causal LM, at different model scales, ranging from $\sim$150M
to $\sim$8B. Using RedPajama V1 (1.6T tokens) for pretraining and FLAN for
instruction tuning, our experiments show that RedLLM produces compelling
scaling properties and surprisingly strong performance. While DecLLM is overall
more compute-optimal during pretraining, RedLLM demonstrates comparable scaling
and context length extrapolation capabilities. After instruction tuning, RedLLM
achieves comparable and even better results on various downstream tasks while
enjoying substantially better inference efficiency. We hope our findings could
inspire more efforts on re-examining RedLLM, unlocking its potential for
developing powerful and efficient LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗等数据敏感领域，缺乏高质量、领域特定的训练语料，阻碍了LLMs的专业应用。

Method: Evontree从原始模型中提取领域本体，使用两个核心本体规则检测不一致性，并通过自蒸馏微调增强精炼知识。

Result: 在Llama3-8B-Instruct和Med42-v2上的实验显示，Evontree在医学QA基准测试中始终优于未修改模型和领先的监督基线，准确率提高达3.7%。

Conclusion: Evontree方法在LLMs的低资源领域适应中有效、高效且稳健。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities
across multiple domains by leveraging massive pre-training and curated
fine-tuning data. However, in data-sensitive fields such as healthcare, the
lack of high-quality, domain-specific training corpus hinders LLMs' adaptation
for specialized applications. Meanwhile, domain experts have distilled domain
wisdom into ontology rules, which formalize relationships among concepts and
ensure the integrity of knowledge management repositories. Viewing LLMs as
implicit repositories of human knowledge, we propose Evontree, a novel
framework that leverages a small set of high-quality ontology rules to
systematically extract, validate, and enhance domain knowledge within LLMs,
without requiring extensive external datasets. Specifically, Evontree extracts
domain ontology from raw models, detects inconsistencies using two core
ontology rules, and reinforces the refined knowledge via self-distilled
fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on medical QA benchmarks with
Llama3-8B-Instruct and Med42-v2 demonstrate consistent outperformance over both
unmodified models and leading supervised baselines, achieving up to a 3.7%
improvement in accuracy. These results confirm the effectiveness, efficiency,
and robustness of our approach for low-resource domain adaptation of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全注意力机制在短、长上下文及强化学习扩展中的性能瓶颈，提升有限有限状态RNN内存的利用效率。

Method: 引入Kimi Delta Attention (KDA)，扩展Gated DeltaNet并采用更细粒度的门控机制，使用定制的分块算法提高硬件效率。

Result: Kimi Linear模型在相同训练条件下优于全MLA，KV缓存使用减少75%，解码吞吐量提升6倍。

Conclusion: Kimi Linear可作为全注意力架构的高性能高效替代品，并开源了相关实现和模型。

Abstract: We introduce Kimi Linear, a hybrid linear attention architecture that, for
the first time, outperforms full attention under fair comparisons across
various scenarios -- including short-context, long-context, and reinforcement
learning (RL) scaling regimes. At its core lies Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), an
expressive linear attention module that extends Gated DeltaNet with a
finer-grained gating mechanism, enabling more effective use of limited
finite-state RNN memory. Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware
efficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR)
transition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the
general DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical
delta rule.
  We pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total
parameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention
(MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linear
outperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while
reducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding
throughput for a 1M context. These results demonstrate that Kimi Linear can be
a drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior
performance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output
lengths.
  To support further research, we open-source the KDA kernel and vLLM
implementations, and release the pre-trained and instruction-tuned model
checkpoints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM的端到端标签具有误导性，实际依赖于需要手动调优超参数的非可微解码过程。

Method: 在标准transformer基础上增加轻量级头部，动态预测上下文特定的temperature和top-p值，将解码转化为参数化过程。

Result: 在八个基准测试中，AutoDeco显著优于默认解码策略，性能接近oracle-tuned基线。

Conclusion: AutoDeco能够解释自然语言指令并逐token调整解码策略，为可操纵和交互式LLM解码开辟了新范式。

Abstract: The "end-to-end" label for LLMs is a misnomer. In practice, they depend on a
non-differentiable decoding process that requires laborious, hand-tuning of
hyperparameters like temperature and top-p. This paper introduces AutoDeco, a
novel architecture that enables truly "end-to-end" generation by learning to
control its own decoding strategy. We augment the standard transformer with
lightweight heads that, at each step, dynamically predict context-specific
temperature and top-p values alongside the next-token logits. This approach
transforms decoding into a parametric, token-level process, allowing the model
to self-regulate its sampling strategy within a single forward pass.
  Through extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, we demonstrate that
AutoDeco not only significantly outperforms default decoding strategies but
also achieves performance comparable to an oracle-tuned baseline derived from
"hacking the test set"-a practical upper bound for any static method.
Crucially, we uncover an emergent capability for instruction-based decoding
control: the model learns to interpret natural language commands (e.g.,
"generate with low randomness") and adjusts its predicted temperature and top-p
on a token-by-token basis, opening a new paradigm for steerable and interactive
LLM decoding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究大语言模型在训练过程中如何获得和变化人类价值观，并分析不同训练阶段和数据集的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在社会中日益重要，需要符合人类价值观。现有研究主要关注完全训练好的模型，而忽略了模型训练过程中价值观的学习动态。

Method: 分析Llama-3和Qwen-3模型在不同训练阶段（监督微调和偏好优化）和数据集下的价值观变化，并使用合成偏好数据集控制变量进行比较。

Result: 监督微调阶段主要确定模型的价值观，随后的偏好优化很少重新对齐这些价值观。不同的优化算法在相同数据下会导致不同的价值观对齐结果。

Conclusion: 研究结果为如何在大语言模型训练过程中学习和对齐人类价值观提供了实用见解，有助于数据管理和算法选择，以提升模型对人类价值观的对齐。

Abstract: As LLMs occupy an increasingly important role in society, they are more and
more confronted with questions that require them not only to draw on their
general knowledge but also to align with certain human value systems.
Therefore, studying the alignment of LLMs with human values has become a
crucial field of inquiry. Prior work, however, mostly focuses on evaluating the
alignment of fully trained models, overlooking the training dynamics by which
models learn to express human values. In this work, we investigate how and at
which stage value alignment arises during the course of a model's
post-training. Our analysis disentangles the effects of post-training
algorithms and datasets, measuring both the magnitude and time of value drifts
during training. Experimenting with Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of different
sizes and popular supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization
datasets and algorithms, we find that the SFT phase generally establishes a
model's values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns these
values. Furthermore, using a synthetic preference dataset that enables
controlled manipulation of values, we find that different preference
optimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes, even when
preference data is held constant. Our findings provide actionable insights into
how values are learned during post-training and help to inform data curation,
as well as the selection of models and algorithms for preference optimization
to improve model alignment to human values.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AMO-Bench是一个高级数学推理基准，包含50个原创且经过专家交叉验证的奥林匹克级别或更高难度的问题，旨在评估大语言模型（LLMs）的数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数学竞赛在评估顶尖LLMs时效果逐渐减弱，因为模型在这些竞赛中趋于饱和。AMO-Bench通过引入更高难度和原创性问题来应对这一挑战。

Method: AMO-Bench包含50个原创问题，每个问题都经过专家验证，符合国际数学奥林匹克（IMO）的难度标准。问题只需求最终答案而非证明，以便自动评分。

Result: 在AMO-Bench上的实验结果显示，即使是性能最好的模型准确率也只有52.4%，大多数LLMs的得分低于40%。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在数学推理方面仍有巨大的提升空间，AMO-Bench的发布旨在促进语言模型推理能力的进一步研究。

Abstract: We present AMO-Bench, an Advanced Mathematical reasoning benchmark with
Olympiad level or even higher difficulty, comprising 50 human-crafted problems.
Existing benchmarks have widely leveraged high school math competitions for
evaluating mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, many existing math competitions are becoming less effective for
assessing top-tier LLMs due to performance saturation (e.g., AIME24/25). To
address this, AMO-Bench introduces more rigorous challenges by ensuring all 50
problems are (1) cross-validated by experts to meet at least the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) difficulty standards, and (2) entirely original
problems to prevent potential performance leakages from data memorization.
Moreover, each problem in AMO-Bench requires only a final answer rather than a
proof, enabling automatic and robust grading for evaluation. Experimental
results across 26 LLMs on AMO-Bench show that even the best-performing model
achieves only 52.4% accuracy on AMO-Bench, with most LLMs scoring below 40%.
Beyond these poor performances, our further analysis reveals a promising
scaling trend with increasing test-time compute on AMO-Bench. These results
highlight the significant room for improving the mathematical reasoning in
current LLMs. We release AMO-Bench to facilitate further research into
advancing the reasoning abilities of language models.

### [45] [Towards Piece-by-Piece Explanations for Chess Positions with SHAP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25775)
*Francesco Spinnato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了如何将SHAP（SHapley Additive exPlanations）应用于国际象棋分析，以便将引擎的评估归因于棋盘上的特定棋子。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 国际象棋引擎提供的评估通常是精确的，但是不透明的，这阻碍了人类对每个棋子或模式的具体贡献的理解。

Method: 通过将棋子视为特征，并系统地剔除它们，计算每个棋子的加性贡献，以解释引擎的输出。

Result: 该方法以局部可信和人类可解释的方式解释国际象棋引擎的评估，并为可视化、人类训练和引擎比较开辟了新可能。

Conclusion: 通过借鉴经典国际象棋教学法，并结合现代可解释的AI技术，该方法为国际象棋AI的进一步研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Contemporary chess engines offer precise yet opaque evaluations, typically
expressed as centipawn scores. While effective for decision-making, these
outputs obscure the underlying contributions of individual pieces or patterns.
In this paper, we explore adapting SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to the
domain of chess analysis, aiming to attribute a chess engines evaluation to
specific pieces on the board. By treating pieces as features and systematically
ablating them, we compute additive, per-piece contributions that explain the
engines output in a locally faithful and human-interpretable manner. This
method draws inspiration from classical chess pedagogy, where players assess
positions by mentally removing pieces, and grounds it in modern explainable AI
techniques. Our approach opens new possibilities for visualization, human
training, and engine comparison. We release accompanying code and data to
foster future research in interpretable chess AI.

### [46] [The Information-Theoretic Imperative: Compression and the Epistemic Foundations of Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25883)
*Christian Dittrich,Jennifer Flygare Kinne*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个两级框架，解释压缩过程为何发现因果结构而非仅统计模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有框架未明确压缩过程为何能发现因果结构，而不仅仅是表面统计模式。

Method: 引入信息论必要性（ITI）和压缩效率原则（CEP）两个层次框架。

Result: ITI和CEP形成因果链，从生存压力到现实对齐，每个环节由物理、信息论或进化约束。

Conclusion: 智能是多尺度系统中持久性的机械必然结果，无需假设意识或主观经验。

Abstract: Existing frameworks converge on the centrality of compression to intelligence
but leave underspecified why this process enforces the discovery of causal
structure rather than superficial statistical patterns. We introduce a
two-level framework to address this gap. The Information-Theoretic Imperative
(ITI) establishes that any system persisting in uncertain environments must
minimize epistemic entropy through predictive compression: this is the
evolutionary "why" linking survival pressure to information-processing demands.
The Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) specifies how efficient compression
mechanically selects for generative, causal models through
exception-accumulation dynamics, making reality alignment a consequence rather
than a contingent achievement. Together, ITI and CEP define a causal chain:
from survival pressure to prediction necessity, compression requirement,
efficiency optimization, generative structure discovery, and ultimately reality
alignment. Each link follows from physical, information-theoretic, or
evolutionary constraints, implying that intelligence is the mechanically
necessary outcome of persistence in structured environments. This framework
yields empirically testable predictions: compression efficiency, measured as
approach to the rate-distortion frontier, correlates with out-of-distribution
generalization; exception-accumulation rates differentiate causal from
correlational models; hierarchical systems exhibit increasing efficiency across
abstraction layers; and biological systems demonstrate metabolic costs that
track representational complexity. ITI and CEP thereby provide a unified
account of convergence across biological, artificial, and multi-scale systems,
addressing the epistemic and functional dimensions of intelligence without
invoking assumptions about consciousness or subjective experience.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过学习聚合多个基于准则的评判者输出的框架，以建模多样化、基于角色的偏好，解决LLM评判者与人类偏好对齐的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对齐基于LLM的评判者与人类偏好是一个重大挑战，因为它们难以校准，并且经常受到准则敏感性、偏见和不稳定性的影响。解决这一挑战可以推动关键应用的发展，例如为人类反馈强化学习（RLHF）创建可靠的奖励模型，以及构建有效的路由系统。

Method: 提出了一种通过聚合多个基于准则的评判者输出，以建模多样化、基于角色的偏好的框架。主要贡献包括一种用于大规模合成偏好标签的基于角色的方法和两种不同的聚合器实现：广义加性模型（GAM）和多层感知机（MLP）。

Result: 通过针对人类和LLM评判者的偏见进行案例研究，评估了该方法的性能和稳健性，并对比了朴素基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架在建模和聚合多样化偏好方面展示了良好的性能，并为大规模偏好标签合成提供了有效的方法。

Abstract: Aligning LLM-based judges with human preferences is a significant challenge,
as they are difficult to calibrate and often suffer from rubric sensitivity,
bias, and instability. Overcoming this challenge advances key applications,
such as creating reliable reward models for Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) and building effective routing systems that select the
best-suited model for a given user query. In this work, we propose a framework
for modeling diverse, persona-based preferences by learning to aggregate
outputs from multiple rubric-conditioned judges. We investigate the performance
of this approach against naive baselines and assess its robustness through case
studies on both human and LLM-judges biases. Our primary contributions include
a persona-based method for synthesizing preference labels at scale and two
distinct implementations of our aggregator: Generalized Additive Model (GAM)
and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SciTrust 2.0是一个用于评估科学应用中大型语言模型（LLMs）可信度的全面框架，涵盖真实性、对抗鲁棒性、科学安全性和科学伦理四个维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在高风险科学环境中的应用引发了对其可信度的重大关注，需要一个综合框架来评估这些模型的可信度。

Method: 引入了SciTrust 2.0框架，包括通过验证的反思调整流程和专家验证开发的开放式真实性基准，以及涵盖八个子类别（如双重用途研究和偏见）的科学伦理基准。

Result: 评估了七个主流LLMs，发现通用行业模型在各项可信度维度上整体优于科学专业模型，GPT-o4-mini在真实性和对抗鲁棒性方面表现突出；科学专业模型在逻辑和伦理推理方面存在显著不足。

Conclusion: 通过开源SciTrust 2.0框架，为开发更可信的人工智能系统和推进科学背景下模型安全与伦理的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential in
scientific research, yet their deployment in high-stakes contexts raises
significant trustworthiness concerns. Here, we introduce SciTrust 2.0, a
comprehensive framework for evaluating LLM trustworthiness in scientific
applications across four dimensions: truthfulness, adversarial robustness,
scientific safety, and scientific ethics. Our framework incorporates novel,
open-ended truthfulness benchmarks developed through a verified
reflection-tuning pipeline and expert validation, alongside a novel ethics
benchmark for scientific research contexts covering eight subcategories
including dual-use research and bias. We evaluated seven prominent LLMs,
including four science-specialized models and three general-purpose industry
models, using multiple evaluation metrics including accuracy, semantic
similarity measures, and LLM-based scoring. General-purpose industry models
overall outperformed science-specialized models across each trustworthiness
dimension, with GPT-o4-mini demonstrating superior performance in truthfulness
assessments and adversarial robustness. Science-specialized models showed
significant deficiencies in logical and ethical reasoning capabilities, along
with concerning vulnerabilities in safety evaluations, particularly in
high-risk domains such as biosecurity and chemical weapons. By open-sourcing
our framework, we provide a foundation for developing more trustworthy AI
systems and advancing research on model safety and ethics in scientific
contexts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 一个3.8B的模型Humans-Junior在FACTS准确性方面达到与GPT-4o相当的水平，在Q1-Q500上的等价性在±5 pp范围内。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过结合最小的定向“外骨骼推理”支架与行为微调，提高小型语言模型的性能，并降低实现成本。

Method: 采用最小的定向“外骨骼推理”支架和行为微调相结合的方法，微调侧重于协议合规性（认知纪律），而不是领域答案。

Result: Humans-Junior在Q1-Q500上表现与GPT-4o相当，配对差异为0.8 pp；结合方法提升了性能17.7 pp，并减少了方差。

Conclusion: Humans-Junior在云端的价格比GPT-4o低约19倍，自托管或边缘部署可以进一步降低成本，接近零边际成本。

Abstract: We introduce Humans-Junior, a 3.8B model that matches GPT-4o on the FACTS
Grounding public subset within a $\pm 5$ pp equivalence margin.
  Results. On Q1--Q500 under identical judges, GPT-4o scores 73.5% (95% CI
69.5--77.2) and Humans-Junior 72.7% (95% CI 68.7--76.5); the paired difference
is 0.8 pp (bootstrap 95% CI $-3.1$ to $+4.7$; permutation $p = 0.72$; Cohen's
$d = 0.023$). TOST establishes equivalence at $\pm 5$ pp (not at $\pm 3$ pp).
When purchased as managed APIs, Humans-Junior's base model
(Phi-3.5-mini-instruct) is $\approx 19\times$ less expensive than GPT-4o on
Microsoft AI Foundry pricing; self-hosted or edge deployments can drive
incremental inference cost toward zero. Measured vs estimated pricing sources
are tabulated in Appendix E.
  Method. Our approach combines minimal directed "Exoskeleton Reasoning"
scaffolds with behavioral fine-tuning that teaches protocol compliance
(epistemic discipline) rather than domain answers. Fine-tuning alone adds
little; combined, they synergize (+17.7 pp, $p < 0.001$) and reduce variance
($\approx 25\%$). In prompt-only settings on frontier models (Q1--Q100;
non-comparable), directed reasoning improved GPT-4o by +11.8 pp to 85.3% and
Gemini-2.5-Pro by +5.0 pp to 93.3% (baseline 88.3%, $n = 100$); see Section~5.
  TL;DR. A 3.8B model achieves GPT-4o-level FACTS accuracy (equivalent within
$\pm 5$ pp on Q1--Q500). Cloud pricing shows $\approx 19\times$ lower cost
versus GPT-4o, and self-hosted/edge deployments can approach zero marginal
cost. Pricing sources are listed in Appendix E. Frontier prompt-only gains
(Q1--Q100; non-comparable) and optimized-prompt exploratory results under
earlier judges are summarized in Appendix F.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的注意力感知逆规划方法，以从行为中推断人们的注意力偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人们的日常行为受认知偏差影响，而自主系统需要理解这些偏差以提高交互效率。

Method: 结合深度强化学习和计算认知建模，提出了一种注意力感知逆规划方法。

Result: 该方法能有效地从行为中推断注意力偏差，并在Waymo Open Dataset的驾驶场景中得到验证。

Conclusion: 注意力感知逆规划能有效推断认知偏差，具有在现实场景中应用的扩展性。

Abstract: People's goal-directed behaviors are influenced by their cognitive biases,
and autonomous systems that interact with people should be aware of this. For
example, people's attention to objects in their environment will be biased in a
way that systematically affects how they perform everyday tasks such as driving
to work. Here, building on recent work in computational cognitive science, we
formally articulate the attention-aware inverse planning problem, in which the
goal is to estimate a person's attentional biases from their actions. We
demonstrate how attention-aware inverse planning systematically differs from
standard inverse reinforcement learning and how cognitive biases can be
inferred from behavior. Finally, we present an approach to attention-aware
inverse planning that combines deep reinforcement learning with computational
cognitive modeling. We use this approach to infer the attentional strategies of
RL agents in real-life driving scenarios selected from the Waymo Open Dataset,
demonstrating the scalability of estimating cognitive biases with
attention-aware inverse planning.

Abstract: The rapid growth of research literature, particularly in large language
models (LLMs), has made producing comprehensive and current survey papers
increasingly difficult. This paper introduces autosurvey2, a multi-stage
pipeline that automates survey generation through retrieval-augmented synthesis
and structured evaluation. The system integrates parallel section generation,
iterative refinement, and real-time retrieval of recent publications to ensure
both topical completeness and factual accuracy. Quality is assessed using a
multi-LLM evaluation framework that measures coverage, structure, and relevance
in alignment with expert review standards. Experimental results demonstrate
that autosurvey2 consistently outperforms existing retrieval-based and
automated baselines, achieving higher scores in structural coherence and
topical relevance while maintaining strong citation fidelity. By combining
retrieval, reasoning, and automated evaluation into a unified framework,
autosurvey2 provides a scalable and reproducible solution for generating
long-form academic surveys and contributes a solid foundation for future
research on automated scholarly writing. All code and resources are available

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StuckSolver是一个新颖的基于大型语言模型的自动驾驶车辆（AV）恢复框架，通过自我推理和乘客引导的决策解决AV在交通场景中卡住的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆在某些交通场景中仍然难以像人类驾驶员一样灵活应对，导致车辆卡住，影响交通流。现有的恢复方案如远程干预和手动接管存在成本高和效率低的问题。

Method: StuckSolver被设计为一个插件模块，无需修改AV的现有内部架构，通过接口与标准传感器数据流交互，检测卡住状态，解释环境上下文，并生成可由AV原生规划器执行的高级恢复命令。

Result: 在Bench2Drive基准测试和自定义不确定性场景中，StuckSolver通过自我推理实现了接近最先进的性能，并在引入乘客引导后性能进一步提升。

Conclusion: StuckSolver通过结合自我推理和乘客引导，有效地解决了AV在特定交通场景中的卡住问题，提升了自动驾驶的可靠性和可用性。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in recent decades, autonomous vehicles (AVs)
continue to face challenges in navigating certain traffic scenarios where human
drivers excel. In such situations, AVs often become immobilized, disrupting
overall traffic flow. Current recovery solutions, such as remote intervention
(which is costly and inefficient) and manual takeover (which excludes
non-drivers and limits AV accessibility), are inadequate. This paper introduces
StuckSolver, a novel Large Language Model (LLM) driven recovery framework that
enables AVs to resolve immobilization scenarios through self-reasoning and/or
passenger-guided decision-making. StuckSolver is designed as a plug-in add-on
module that operates on top of the AV's existing perception-planning-control
stack, requiring no modification to its internal architecture. Instead, it
interfaces with standard sensor data streams to detect immobilization states,
interpret environmental context, and generate high-level recovery commands that
can be executed by the AV's native planner. We evaluate StuckSolver on the
Bench2Drive benchmark and in custom-designed uncertainty scenarios. Results
show that StuckSolver achieves near-state-of-the-art performance through
autonomous self-reasoning alone and exhibits further improvements when
passenger guidance is incorporated.

Motivation: LLM的推理成本是决定其商业可行性和广泛应用的关键因素。

Method: 通过将LLM推理过程视为计算驱动的智能生产活动，分析了边际成本和规模经济，并根据WiNEval-3.0的经验数据构建了LLM推理生产前沿。

Abstract: The inference cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical
factor in determining their commercial viability and widespread adoption. This
paper introduces a quantitative ``economics of inference'' framework, treating
the LLM inference process as a compute-driven intelligent production activity.
We analyze its marginal cost, economies of scale, and quality of output under
various performance configurations. Based on empirical data from WiNEval-3.0,
we construct the first ``LLM Inference Production Frontier,'' revealing three
principles: diminishing marginal cost, diminishing returns to scale, and an
optimal cost-effectiveness zone. This paper not only provides an economic basis
for model deployment decisions but also lays an empirical foundation for the
future market-based pricing and optimization of AI inference resources.

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段的推理课程，通过在数学领域进行强化学习，然后在多领域进行联合强化学习，以提高大语言模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习可以增强大语言模型的推理能力，但大多数工作集中在数学和代码上，缺乏对其他领域的适应性。

Method: 提出Reasoning Curriculum，第一阶段通过数学领域的可验证奖励进行强化学习，第二阶段通过多领域联合强化学习迁移和巩固推理技能。

Result: 在Qwen3-4B和Llama-3.1-8B上评估，推理课程带来了一致的提升，且两个阶段都是必要的。

Conclusion: Reasoning Curriculum是一种紧凑且易于采用的通用推理方法，能有效提升大语言模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can elicit strong reasoning in large language
models (LLMs), yet most open efforts focus on math and code. We propose
Reasoning Curriculum, a simple two-stage curriculum that first elicits
reasoning skills in pretraining-aligned domains such as math, then adapts and
refines these skills across other domains via joint RL. Stage 1 performs a
brief cold start and then math-only RL with verifiable rewards to develop
reasoning skills. Stage 2 runs joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer and
consolidate these skills. The curriculum is minimal and backbone-agnostic,
requiring no specialized reward models beyond standard verifiability checks.
Evaluated on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B over a multi-domain suite, reasoning
curriculum yields consistent gains. Ablations and a cognitive-skill analysis
indicate that both stages are necessary and that math-first elicitation
increases cognitive behaviors important for solving complex problems. Reasoning
Curriculum provides a compact, easy-to-adopt recipe for general reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在处理问卷数据方面能力不足，而现有的问卷分析工具通常以人类为中心，限制了与AI自动化的集成。

Method: 引入QASU基准，测试了六种结构技能，包括答案查找、受访者计数和多跳推理，并尝试了六种序列化格式和多种提示策略。

Result: 选择有效的格式和提示组合可以将准确率提高8.8%，通过自我增强提示可以进一步改进3-4%。

Conclusion: QASU基准提供了一个系统、简单且通用的基础，有助于推动LLM问卷分析的研究和实际应用。

Abstract: Millions of people take surveys every day, from market polls and academic
studies to medical questionnaires and customer feedback forms. These datasets
capture valuable insights, but their scale and structure present a unique
challenge for large language models (LLMs), which otherwise excel at few-shot
reasoning over open-ended text. Yet, their ability to process questionnaire
data or lists of questions crossed with hundreds of respondent rows remains
underexplored. Current retrieval and survey analysis tools (e.g., Qualtrics,
SPSS, REDCap) are typically designed for humans in the workflow, limiting such
data integration with LLM and AI-empowered automation. This gap leaves
scientists, surveyors, and everyday users without evidence-based guidance on
how to best represent questionnaires for LLM consumption. We address this by
introducing QASU (Questionnaire Analysis and Structural Understanding), a
benchmark that probes six structural skills, including answer lookup,
respondent count, and multi-hop inference, across six serialization formats and
multiple prompt strategies. Experiments on contemporary LLMs show that choosing
an effective format and prompt combination can improve accuracy by up to 8.8%
points compared to suboptimal formats. For specific tasks, carefully adding a
lightweight structural hint through self-augmented prompting can yield further
improvements of 3-4% points on average. By systematically isolating format and
prompting effects, our open source benchmark offers a simple yet versatile
foundation for advancing both research and real-world practice in LLM-based

### [57] [Discovering State Equivalences in UCT Search Trees By Action Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26346)
*Robin Schmöcker,Alexander Dockhorn,Bodo Rosenhahn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为IPA-UCT的新技术，通过弱化的状态抽象条件，提高了MCTS的样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大动作空间或噪声环境下，现有状态抽象方法难以应用，导致MCTS效率不高。

Method: 提出了一种弱化的状态抽象条件，称为IPA-UCT，并与OGA-UCT和ASAP进行了比较。还提出了一个更通用的框架p-ASAP。

Result: IPA-UCT在多个测试领域和迭代预算下优于OGA-UCT及其衍生方法。

Conclusion: IPA和ASAP是更通用框架p-ASAP的特例，且p-ASAP是ASASAP框架的特例。

Abstract: One approach to enhance Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is to improve its
sample efficiency by grouping/abstracting states or state-action pairs and
sharing statistics within a group. Though state-action pair abstractions are
mostly easy to find in algorithms such as On the Go Abstractions in Upper
Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT), nearly no state abstractions are
found in either noisy or large action space settings due to constraining
conditions. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence for this claim, and
we slightly alleviate this state abstraction problem by proposing a weaker
state abstraction condition that trades a minor loss in accuracy for finding
many more abstractions. We name this technique Ideal Pruning Abstractions in
UCT (IPA-UCT), which outperforms OGA-UCT (and any of its derivatives) across a
large range of test domains and iteration budgets as experimentally validated.
IPA-UCT uses a different abstraction framework from Abstraction of State-Action
Pairs (ASAP) which is the one used by OGA-UCT, which we name IPA. Furthermore,
we show that both IPA and ASAP are special cases of a more general framework
that we call p-ASAP which itself is a special case of the ASASAP framework.

*Qianli Shen,Daoyuan Chen,Yilun Huang,Zhenqing Ling,Yaliang Li,Bolin Ding,Jingren Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BOTS是一个用于大型语言模型强化微调的贝叶斯在线任务选择框架，通过自适应维持任务难度的后验估计，提高数据效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化微调在使大型语言模型与人类偏好对齐及增强推理方面至关重要，但现有任务选择方法存在效率低、适应性差等问题。

Method: BOTS基于贝叶斯推理，通过Thompson采样在选择任务中保持探索与利用的平衡，并结合显性和隐性证据。采用轻量插值插件估计未评估任务的难度。

Result: 在不同领域和LLM规模上，BOTS在数据效率和性能方面均优于基线和消融实验。

Conclusion: BOTS为强化微调中的动态任务选择提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) is a key technique for aligning Large Language
Models (LLMs) with human preferences and enhancing reasoning, yet its
effectiveness is highly sensitive to which tasks are explored during training.
Uniform task sampling is inefficient, wasting computation on tasks that are
either trivial or unsolvable, while existing task selection methods often
suffer from high rollout costs, poor adaptivity, or incomplete evidence. We
introduce \textbf{BOTS}, a unified framework for \textbf{B}ayesian
\textbf{O}nline \textbf{T}ask \textbf{S}election in LLM reinforcement
finetuning. Grounded in Bayesian inference, BOTS adaptively maintains posterior
estimates of task difficulty as the model evolves. It jointly incorporates
\emph{explicit evidence} from direct evaluations of selected tasks and
\emph{implicit evidence} inferred from these evaluations for unselected tasks,
with Thompson sampling ensuring a principled balance between exploration and
exploitation. To make implicit evidence practical, we instantiate it with an
ultra-light interpolation-based plug-in that estimates difficulties of
unevaluated tasks without extra rollouts, adding negligible overhead.
Empirically, across diverse domains and LLM scales, BOTS consistently improves
data efficiency and performance over baselines and ablations, providing a
practical and extensible solution for dynamic task selection in RFT.

*Yuanhang Liu,Beichen Wang,Peng Li,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了AI数学家（AIM）系统作为研究伙伴的潜力，通过结合人类直觉与机器计算，以解决数学研究中的复杂问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管人工智能在数学推理方面取得了进展，但其在数学研究实践中的整合仍然有限。该研究旨在探索AIM如何作为研究伙伴，而不仅仅是问题解决者。

Method: 研究聚焦于同质化理论中的一个挑战性问题，分析了AIM的自主推理轨迹，并通过有针对性的干预来结构化发现过程，包括问题的迭代分解、适当分析方法的选择和中间结果的验证。

Result: 通过人类与AI的合作，该方法增强了解释的可靠性、透明性和可解释性，同时保持了人类对形式严谨性和正确性的监督，最终得到了一个完整且可验证的证明。

Conclusion: 系统性的人机协同推理可以推动数学发现的边界，为未来的数学研究提供了新的合作范式。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated impressive progress in
mathematical reasoning, yet its integration into the practice of mathematical
research remains limited. In this study, we investigate how the AI
Mathematician (AIM) system can operate as a research partner rather than a mere
problem solver. Focusing on a challenging problem in homogenization theory, we
analyze the autonomous reasoning trajectories of AIM and incorporate targeted
human interventions to structure the discovery process. Through iterative
decomposition of the problem into tractable subgoals, selection of appropriate
analytical methods, and validation of intermediate results, we reveal how human
intuition and machine computation can complement one another. This
collaborative paradigm enhances the reliability, transparency, and
interpretability of the resulting proofs, while retaining human oversight for
formal rigor and correctness. The approach leads to a complete and verifiable
proof, and more broadly, demonstrates how systematic human-AI co-reasoning can
advance the frontier of mathematical discovery.

*Andrew M. Bean,Nabeel Seedat,Shengzhuang Chen,Jonathan Richard Schwarz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的以任务项为中心的方法Scales++，用于高效构建小型代表性基准测试子集，以减少大型语言模型评估的成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于全面评估大型语言模型的成本很高，需要创建小型且具代表性的基准测试子集。现有方法依赖模型性能，成本高，难以处理新基准，并且假设未来模型将共享前代模型的失败模式，存在局限性。

Method: 提出了一种以任务项为中心的方法Scales++，该方法选择基准测试项基于任务项本身的内在特性，而非模型特定的失败模式，具体通过认知需求进行数据选择。

Result: Scales++在选择成本上降低了超过18倍，同时实现了具有竞争力的预测保真度。在Open LLM Leaderboard上，仅使用0.5%的数据子集，预测误差仅为2.9%。

Conclusion: 以任务项为中心的方法能够更高效地评估模型，而不会显著降低保真度，同时提供更好的冷启动性能和更可解释的基准测试。

Abstract: The prohibitive cost of evaluating large language models (LLMs) on
comprehensive benchmarks necessitates the creation of small yet representative
data subsets (i.e., tiny benchmarks) that enable efficient assessment while
retaining predictive fidelity. Current methods for this task operate under a
model-centric paradigm, selecting benchmarking items based on the collective
performance of existing models. Such approaches are limited by large upfront
costs, an inability to immediately handle new benchmarks (`cold-start'), and
the fragile assumption that future models will share the failure patterns of
their predecessors. In this work, we challenge this paradigm and propose a
item-centric approach to benchmark subset selection, arguing that selection
should be based on the intrinsic properties of the task items themselves,
rather than on model-specific failure patterns. We instantiate this
item-centric efficient benchmarking approach via a novel method, Scales++,
where data selection is based on the cognitive demands of the benchmark
samples. Empirically, we show Scales++ reduces the upfront selection cost by
over 18x while achieving competitive predictive fidelity. On the Open LLM
Leaderboard, using just a 0.5\% data subset, we predict full benchmark scores
with a 2.9% mean absolute error. We demonstrate that this item-centric approach
enables more efficient model evaluation without significant fidelity
degradation, while also providing better cold-start performance and more
interpretable benchmarking.

*Vikrant Sahu,Gagan Raj Gupta,Raghav Borikar,Nitin Mane*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Autograder+利用大型语言模型和可视化技术，将自动评分从总结性评估转变为形成性学习体验，提升编程教育的反馈质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 编程教育快速增长导致传统评估工具难以提供有意义且可扩展的反馈，现有自动评分系统仅提供通过/失败结果，缺乏对学生思维和学习需求的洞察。

Method: Autograder+引入两项关键功能：1）通过微调大型语言模型生成自动化反馈；2）通过对比学习代码嵌入实现学生代码提交的可视化，以揭示学习模式。模型基于精选的学生代码和专家反馈进行微调，确保教学一致性和上下文感知指导。

Result: 在来自多个编程任务的600份学生提交中，系统产生的反馈与教师评论具有强语义对齐。可视化方面，使用1000个标注提交训练的对比学习代码嵌入，能按功能和策略将解决方案分组。系统支持提示池，允许教师通过选定提示模板引导反馈风格。

Conclusion: 通过整合AI驱动的反馈、语义聚类和交互式可视化，Autograder+减少了教师工作量，同时支持有针对性的教学并促进更强的学习成果。

Abstract: The rapid growth of programming education has outpaced traditional assessment
tools, leaving faculty with limited means to provide meaningful, scalable
feedback. Conventional autograders, while efficient, act as black-box systems
that simply return pass/fail results, offering little insight into student
thinking or learning needs.
  Autograder+ is designed to shift autograding from a purely summative process
to a formative learning experience. It introduces two key capabilities:
automated feedback generation using a fine-tuned Large Language Model, and
visualization of student code submissions to uncover learning patterns. The
model is fine-tuned on curated student code and expert feedback to ensure
pedagogically aligned, context-aware guidance.
  In evaluation across 600 student submissions from multiple programming tasks,
the system produced feedback with strong semantic alignment to instructor
comments. For visualization, contrastively learned code embeddings trained on
1,000 annotated submissions enable grouping solutions into meaningful clusters
based on functionality and approach. The system also supports prompt-pooling,
allowing instructors to guide feedback style through selected prompt templates.
  By integrating AI-driven feedback, semantic clustering, and interactive
visualization, Autograder+ reduces instructor workload while supporting
targeted instruction and promoting stronger learning outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗AI需要高精度且可解释的模型，当前缺乏对医学视觉模型可解释性的量化方法。

Method: 应用Medical Sparse Autoencoders（MedSAEs）到MedCLIP的潜在空间，提出结合相关性指标、熵分析和MedGEMMA自动命名神经元的评估框架。

Result: 在CheXpert数据集上，MedSAE神经元的单语义性和可解释性优于原始MedCLIP特征。

Conclusion: 该方法弥合了高性能医疗AI与透明度之间的鸿沟，为临床可靠表征提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence in healthcare requires models that are accurate and
interpretable. We advance mechanistic interpretability in medical vision by
applying Medical Sparse Autoencoders (MedSAEs) to the latent space of MedCLIP,
a vision-language model trained on chest radiographs and reports. To quantify
interpretability, we propose an evaluation framework that combines correlation
metrics, entropy analyzes, and automated neuron naming via the MedGEMMA
foundation model. Experiments on the CheXpert dataset show that MedSAE neurons
achieve higher monosemanticity and interpretability than raw MedCLIP features.
Our findings bridge high-performing medical AI and transparency, offering a
scalable step toward clinically reliable representations.

TL;DR: 利用AI提高人类监督的质量，特别是在事实核查方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI能力的提高，人类在核查AI输出质量和安全性方面面临越来越大的挑战。

Method: 结合AI评分和人类评分，基于AI评分者置信度，并给人类提供AI事实核查助手。

Result: 结合AI和人类评分比单独使用任一方更好；提供搜索和证据结果有助于人类更准确地核查，而显示AI解释、置信度和标签会导致过度依赖。

Conclusion: 这些结果对Amplified Oversight有重要影响，即如何结合人类和AI来监督AI系统，即使其性能超过人类专家。

Abstract: Human feedback is critical for aligning AI systems to human values. As AI
capabilities improve and AI is used to tackle more challenging tasks, verifying
quality and safety becomes increasingly challenging. This paper explores how we
can leverage AI to improve the quality of human oversight. We focus on an
important safety problem that is already challenging for humans:
fact-verification of AI outputs. We find that combining AI ratings and human
ratings based on AI rater confidence is better than relying on either alone.
Giving humans an AI fact-verification assistant further improves their
accuracy, but the type of assistance matters. Displaying AI explanation,
confidence, and labels leads to over-reliance, but just showing search results
and evidence fosters more appropriate trust. These results have implications
for Amplified Oversight -- the challenge of combining humans and AI to
supervise AI systems even as they surpass human expert performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了大语言模型（LLMs）在规范推理任务中的表现，并比较了规范模态和认知模态之间的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 规范推理涉及规范性或义务性模态，如义务和许可，但LLMs在这方面的能力尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 引入了一个新数据集，涵盖规范性和认知模态的各种形式推理模式，并包含影响人类推理的非形式认知因素。

Result: LLMs通常遵循有效的推理模式，但在特定类型的规范推理中表现出明显的不一致性，并显示出与心理学研究类似的人类推理认知偏差。

Conclusion: 在LLMs的规范推理中实现逻辑一致性仍面临挑战，这些发现为提高LLMs的可靠性提供了见解。

Abstract: Normative reasoning is a type of reasoning that involves normative or deontic
modality, such as obligation and permission. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, their
ability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain
from both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs
reason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with
normative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a
common formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a
wide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic
domains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence
human reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to
valid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific
types of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those
observed in psychological studies of human reasoning. These findings highlight
challenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and
provide insights for enhancing their reliability. All data and code are

*Xinhan Zheng,Huyu Wu,Xueting Wang,Haiyun Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文揭示了多模态大语言模型中文本偏好源于注意力键空间内部结构失配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在处理视觉-语言数据时表现出对文本输入的显著偏好，限制了其基于视觉证据进行有效推理的能力。以往研究将这种文本偏差归因于外部因素，而本文提出偏差源自模型内部架构。

Method: 通过从LLaVA和Qwen2.5-VL提取关键向量，并使用t-SNE（定性）和Jensen-Shannon散度（定量）分析其分布结构。

Result: 视觉和文本键在注意力空间中占据显著不同的子空间，模态间差异远超模态内变化，具有统计显著性。

Conclusion: 文本偏差源于注意力键空间内的固有失配，而不仅仅是外部数据因素导致。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a pronounced preference for
textual inputs when processing vision-language data, limiting their ability to
reason effectively from visual evidence. Unlike prior studies that attribute
this text bias to external factors such as data imbalance or instruction
tuning, we propose that the bias originates from the model's internal
architecture. Specifically, we hypothesize that visual key vectors (Visual
Keys) are out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the text key space learned
during language-only pretraining. Consequently, these visual keys receive
systematically lower similarity scores during attention computation, leading to
their under-utilization in the context representation. To validate this
hypothesis, we extract key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL and analyze their
distributional structures using qualitative (t-SNE) and quantitative
(Jensen-Shannon divergence) methods. The results provide direct evidence that
visual and textual keys occupy markedly distinct subspaces within the attention
space. The inter-modal divergence is statistically significant, exceeding
intra-modal variation by several orders of magnitude. These findings reveal
that text bias arises from an intrinsic misalignment within the attention key
space rather than solely from external data factors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了建立一个跨平台的基础模型推理能力基准，评估不同计算环境下的性能差异和模型表现。

Method: 在 MareNostrum 5、Nebius AI Studio 和大学集群三种平台上，通过三个阶段实验评估15个模型在79个问题上的表现。

Result: 研究发现训练数据质量比模型规模更为关键，且在不同平台上模型表现具有可重复性。

Conclusion: 提出了一种三基础设施评估方法，为教育、生产和研究场景下的模型选择提供了实用指南，并支持模型推理能力随时间的追踪。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive cross-platform evaluation of reasoning
capabilities in contemporary foundation models, establishing an
infrastructure-agnostic benchmark across three computational paradigms: HPC
supercomputing (MareNostrum 5), cloud platforms (Nebius AI Studio), and
university clusters (a node with eight H200 GPUs).
  We evaluate 15 foundation models across 79 problems spanning eight academic
domains (Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Economics, Biology, Statistics,
Calculus, and Optimization) through three experimental phases: (1) Baseline
establishment: Six models (Mixtral-8x7B, Phi-3, LLaMA 3.1-8B, Gemma-2-9b,
Mistral-7B, OLMo-7B) evaluated on 19 problems using MareNostrum 5, establishing
methodology and reference performance; (2) Infrastructure validation: The
19-problem benchmark repeated on university cluster (seven models including
Falcon-Mamba state-space architecture) and Nebius AI Studio (nine
state-of-the-art models: Hermes-4 70B/405B, LLaMA 3.1-405B/3.3-70B, Qwen3
30B/235B, DeepSeek-R1, GPT-OSS 20B/120B) to confirm infrastructure-agnostic
reproducibility; (3) Extended evaluation: Full 79-problem assessment on both
university cluster and Nebius platforms, probing generalization at scale across
architectural diversity.
  The findings challenge conventional scaling assumptions, establish training
data quality as more critical than model size, and provide actionable
guidelines for model selection across educational, production, and research
contexts. The tri-infrastructure methodology and 79-problem benchmark enable
longitudinal tracking of reasoning capabilities as foundation models evolve.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着越来越多的智能体投入使用，如何在不修改底层系统的情况下保持人类控制成为重要安全课题。

Method: 将智能体（选择自主行动或请求）和人类（选择信任或监督）的互动建模为双人马尔可夫博弈，重点分析马尔可夫势博弈（MPG）情况。

Result: 在人类价值函数的结构假设下，智能体增加自主决策的收益不会损害人类的价值；通过网格世界仿真显示，智能体和人类通过独立学习发现最优的监督角色。

Conclusion: 该模型为内在对齐提供了理论条件，并证明了在部署后通过透明控制层使不对齐的模型更安全的方法。

Abstract: As increasingly capable agents are deployed, a central safety question is how
to retain meaningful human control without modifying the underlying system. We
study a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act
autonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses
whether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the
agent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to
a corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a
two-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies
as a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an
alignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value
function, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits
itself cannot harm the human's value. We also analyze extensions to this MPG
framework. Theoretically, this perspective provides conditions for a specific
form of intrinsic alignment. If the reward structures of the human-agent game
meet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its
own outcome will not harm the human's. Practically, this model motivates a
transparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to
defer when risky and act when safe, while its pretrained policy and the
environment's reward structure remain untouched. Our gridworld simulation shows
that through independent learning, the agent and human discover their optimal
oversight roles. The agent learns to ask when uncertain and the human learns
when to oversee, leading to an emergent collaboration that avoids safety
violations introduced post-training. This demonstrates a practical method for
making misaligned models safer after deployment.

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLMs）在处理列表任务时，学会了编码一种通用的过滤操作，这种操作类似于函数式编程中的'filter'函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs在执行各种列表处理任务时的内在机制，特别是它们如何进行信息过滤。

Method: 采用因果中介分析，对多种列表处理任务中LLMs的行为进行研究，识别出执行过滤操作的特定注意力头（filter heads）。

Result: 发现一小部分注意力头在特定标记的查询状态中编码了过滤谓词的紧凑表示，这种表示具有通用性和可移植性，可以跨任务、格式和语言进行提取和重用。

Conclusion: 变换器模型可以发展出人类可解释的抽象计算操作实现，这些实现以类似于传统函数式编程策略的方式进行泛化。

Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms underlying a range of list-processing tasks in
LLMs, and we find that LLMs have learned to encode a compact, causal
representation of a general filtering operation that mirrors the generic
"filter" function of functional programming. Using causal mediation analysis on
a diverse set of list-processing tasks, we find that a small number of
attention heads, which we dub filter heads, encode a compact representation of
the filtering predicate in their query states at certain tokens. We demonstrate
that this predicate representation is general and portable: it can be extracted
and reapplied to execute the same filtering operation on different collections,
presented in different formats, languages, or even in tasks. However, we also
identify situations where transformer LMs can exploit a different strategy for
filtering: eagerly evaluating if an item satisfies the predicate and storing
this intermediate result as a flag directly in the item representations. Our
results reveal that transformer LMs can develop human-interpretable
implementations of abstract computational operations that generalize in ways
that are surprisingly similar to strategies used in traditional functional
programming patterns.
