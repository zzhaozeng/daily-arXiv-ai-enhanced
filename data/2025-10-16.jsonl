CNC milling offers a scalable alternative, but directly\nmilling traditional joints often fails to produce functional results because\nmilling induces geometric deviations, such as rounded inner corners, that alter\nthe target geometries of the parts. Since joints rely on tightly fitting\nsurfaces, such deviations introduce gaps or overlaps that undermine fit or\nblock assembly. We propose to overcome this problem by (1) designing a language\nthat represent millable geometry, and (2) co-optimizing part geometries to\nrestore coupling.

This parameterization\nenables the modeling of artifact-free geometry under an idealized zero-radius\ndrill bit, matching traditional joint designs.

An alternative is to perform RL from human feedback, which involves\nlearning a reward function from scratch by collecting human preferences over\npairs of trajectories. However, building such datasets is costly. To address\nthe limitations of both approaches, we propose Preference-Based Reward Repair\n(PBRR): an automated iterative framework that repairs a human-specified proxy\nreward function by learning an additive, transition-dependent correction term\nfrom preferences. A manually specified reward function can yield policies that\nare highly suboptimal under the ground-truth objective, yet corrections on only\na few transitions may suffice to recover optimal performance. To identify and\ncorrect for those transitions, PBRR uses a targeted exploration strategy and a\nnew preference-learning objective.

However, they still\noften produce hallucinated samples (hallucinations) that conflict with\nreal-world knowledge, such as generating an implausible duplicate cup floating\nbeside another cup. Despite their prevalence, the lack of feasible\nmethodologies for systematically quantifying such hallucinations hinders\nprogress in addressing this challenge and obscures potential pathways for\ndesigning next-generation generative models under factual constraints. In this\nwork, we bridge this gap by focusing on a specific form of hallucination, which\nwe term counting hallucination, referring to the generation of an incorrect\nnumber of instances or structured objects, such as a hand image with six\nfingers, despite such patterns being absent from the training data. To this\nend, we construct a dataset suite CountHalluSet, with well-defined counting\ncriteria, comprising ToyShape, SimObject, and RealHand. Using these datasets,\nwe develop a standardized evaluation protocol for quantifying counting\nhallucinations, and systematically examine how different sampling conditions in\nDPMs, including solver type, ODE solver order, sampling steps, and initial\nnoise, affect counting hallucination levels. Furthermore, we analyze their\ncorrelation with common evaluation metrics such as FID, revealing that this\nwidely used image quality metric fails to capture counting hallucinations\nconsistently.

We evaluated LGSA on a controlled dataset of short English sentences\nwith gendered pronouns, professions, and binary classification labels.\nStructured prompts were used to produce gender-swapped paraphrases, followed by\nquality control including semantic similarity checks, attribute verification,\ntoxicity screening, and human spot checks. The augmented dataset expanded\ntraining coverage and was used to train a classifier under consistent\nconditions. Results show that LGSA reduces performance disparities without\ncompromising accuracy. The baseline model achieved 96.7 percent accuracy with a\n7.2 percent gender bias gap. Simple swap augmentation reduced the gap to 0.7\npercent but lowered accuracy to 95.6 percent. LGSA achieved 99.1 percent\naccuracy with a 1.9 percent bias gap, improving performance on female-labeled\nexamples. These findings demonstrate that LGSA is an effective strategy for\nbias mitigation, enhancing subgroup balance while maintaining high task\naccuracy and label fidelity."}

However, existing motion generation approaches\naddress either motion semantics or scene-awareness in isolation, since\nconstructing large-scale datasets with both rich text--motion coverage and\nprecise scene interactions is extremely challenging. In this work, we introduce\nSceneAdapt, a framework that injects scene awareness into text-conditioned\nmotion models by leveraging disjoint scene--motion and text--motion datasets\nthrough two adaptation stages: inbetweening and scene-aware inbetweening. The\nkey idea is to use motion inbetweening, learnable without text, as a proxy task\nto bridge two distinct datasets and thereby inject scene-awareness to\ntext-to-motion models. In the first stage, we introduce keyframing layers that\nmodulate motion latents for inbetweening while preserving the latent manifold.\nIn the second stage, we add a scene-conditioning layer that injects scene\ngeometry by adaptively querying local context through cross-attention.\nExperimental results show that SceneAdapt effectively injects scene awareness\ninto text-to-motion models, and we further analyze the mechanisms through which\nthis awareness emerges.

MaskDCPT includes\nan encoder and two decoders: the encoder extracts features from the masked\nlow-quality input image. The classification decoder uses these features to\nidentify the degradation type, whereas the reconstruction decoder aims to\nreconstruct a corresponding high-quality image. This design allows the\npre-training to benefit from both masked image modeling and contrastive\nlearning, resulting in a generalized representation suited for restoration\ntasks.

In this work, we explore whether a combination of 2D object agnostic\npriors in the form of depth and point tracking coupled with a signed distance\nfunction (SDF) representation for dynamic objects can be used to relax some of\nthese requirements. We present a novel approach that integrates Signed Distance\nFunctions (SDFs) with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to create a more robust\nobject representation by harnessing the strengths of both methods. Our unified\noptimization framework enhances the geometric accuracy of 3D Gaussian splatting\nand improves deformation modeling within the SDF, resulting in a more adaptable\nand precise representation. We demonstrate that our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in rendering metrics even without LiDAR data on\nurban scenes. When incorporating LiDAR, our approach improved further in\nreconstructing and generating novel views across diverse object categories,\nwithout ground-truth 3D motion annotation.

We first distinguish attention heads\nbetween locally and globally focused information processing and reveal that\nlocally focused heads produce a sawtooth pattern near the diagonal indicating\nphrasal chunks, while globally focused heads expose tokens that exert broad\ndownstream influence over future tokens. We formalize these with two metrics:\n1) Windowed Average Attention Distance, which measures the extent of backward\nattention within a clipped window; 2) Future Attention Influence, which\nquantifies a token's global importance as the average attention it receives\nfrom subsequent tokens. Taken together, these signals reveal a recurring\npreplan-and-anchor mechanism, where the model first performs a long-range\ncontextual reference to generate an introductory token, which is immediately\nfollowed by or coincides with a semantic anchor token that organizes subsequent\nreasoning. Leveraging these insights, we introduce three novel RL strategies\nthat dynamically perform targeted credit assignment to critical nodes (preplan\ntokens, anchor tokens, and their temporal coupling) and show consistent\nperformance gains across various reasoning tasks. By aligning optimization with\nthe model's intrinsic reasoning rhythm, we aim to transform opaque optimization\ninto an actionable structure-aware process, hoping to offer a potential step\ntoward more transparent and effective optimization of LLM reasoning."}

The investigation is conducted\nthrough four studies operating with five research hypotheses. For several\nanalyses, the studies compare models based on convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) and partial least squares (PLS). Generally, joint spatio-spectral\nanalysis with CNNs outperforms spatial analysis with CNNs and spectral analysis\nwith PLS when modeling parameters where chemical and physical visual\ninformation are relevant. When modeling chemical parameters with a\n2-dimensional (2D) CNN, augmenting the CNN with an initial layer dedicated to\nperforming spectral convolution enhances its predictive performance by learning\na spectral preprocessing similar to that applied by domain experts. Still,\nPLS-based spectral modeling performs equally well for analysis of the mean\ncontent of chemical parameters in samples and is the recommended approach.\nModeling the spatial distribution of chemical parameters with NIR-HSI is\nlimited by the ability to obtain spatially resolved reference values.\nTherefore, a study used bulk mean references for chemical map generation of fat\ncontent in pork bellies. A PLS-based approach gave non-smooth chemical maps and\npixel-wise predictions outside the range of 0-100\\%. Conversely, a 2D CNN\naugmented with a spectral convolution layer mitigated all issues arising with\nPLS. The final study attempted to model barley's germinative capacity by\nanalyzing NIR spectra, RGB images, and NIR-HSI images. However, the results\nwere inconclusive due to the dataset's low degree of germination. Additionally,\nthis thesis has led to the development of two open-sourced Python packages.

We revisit model stitching, i.e., we identify the layer in the 3D\ndecoder that best matches the latent representation produced by the\ntext-to-video generator and stitch the two parts together. That operation\nrequires only a small dataset and no labels. Second, the text-to-video\ngenerator must be aligned with the stitched 3D decoder, to ensure that the\ngenerated latents are decodable into consistent, perceptually convincing 3D\nscene geometry. To that end, we adapt direct reward finetuning, a popular\ntechnique for human preference alignment.

Low-field MRI is cheaper, more accessible, and safer, but suffers\nfrom low resolution and poor signal-to-noise ratio.

The best\nperforming model, GPT-4o, achieves an overall accuracy of 90.8% and lags human\nperformance by 6.7%, though the gap is larger for open-source models. The gap\nhighlights VLURes' critical role in developing intelligent agents to tackle\nmulti-modal visual reasoning."}

However, most existing multimodal models remain\nconstrained by autoregressive architectures, whose inherent limitations prevent\na balanced integration of understanding and generation capabilities. Although\nhybrid and decoupling strategies have been explored to address these tasks\nwithin unified frameworks separately, their redundant, non-integrated designs\nlimit their applicability to broader scenarios, such as cross-modal\nretrieval.In this work, we introduce NExT-OMNI, an open-source omnimodal\nfoundation model that achieves unified modeling through discrete flow\nparadigms. By leveraging metric-induced probability paths and kinetic optimal\nvelocities, NExT-OMNI natively supports any-to-any understanding and generation\nwith enhanced response efficiency, while enabling broader application scenarios\nthrough concise unified representations rather than task-decoupled designs.\nTrained on large-scale interleaved text, image, video, and audio data,\nNExT-OMNI delivers competitive performance on multimodal generation and\nunderstanding benchmarks, while outperforming prior unified models in\nmulti-turn multimodal interaction and cross-modal retrieval, highlighting its\narchitectural advantages as a next-generation multimodal foundation model. To\nadvance further research, we release training details, data protocols, and\nopen-source both the code and model checkpoints."}

Recent\nwork has shown preliminary evidence that grounding may emerge in\n(vision-)language models trained at scale without using explicit grounding\nobjectives. Yet, the specific loci of this emergence and the mechanisms that\ndrive it remain largely unexplored. To address this problem, we introduce a\ncontrolled evaluation framework that systematically traces how symbol grounding\narises within the internal computations through mechanistic and causal\nanalysis. Our findings show that grounding concentrates in middle-layer\ncomputations and is implemented through the aggregate mechanism, where\nattention heads aggregate the environmental ground to support the prediction of\nlinguistic forms. This phenomenon replicates in multimodal dialogue and across\narchitectures (Transformers and state-space models), but not in unidirectional\nLSTMs. Our results provide behavioral and mechanistic evidence that symbol\ngrounding can emerge in language models, with practical implications for\npredicting and potentially controlling the reliability of generation."}
