As technology scales down, EM-induced IR\ndrop becomes increasingly severe. While several EM-aware IR drop analysis tools\nhave been proposed, few incorporate the real impact of temperature distribution\non both EM and IR drop effects. In this work, we introduce EMSpice 2.1, an\nenhanced tool built upon the existing coupled IR-EM analysis framework, EMSpice\n2.0, for EM-aware IR drop analysis. For the first time, EMSpice 2.1 uniquely\nintegrates Joule heating effects and practical thermal maps derived from actual\nchip conditions. Additionally, it features improved interoperability with\ncommercial EDA tools, facilitating more comprehensive EM and IR drop sign-off\nanalysis. Our findings demonstrate that specific hotspot patterns significantly\nimpact the lifetime of interconnects and overall chip reliability due to EM\nfailures.

We\nsystematically compare 12 existing MVGs on 4 different curated real and\nsynthetic datasets. With our analysis, we identify important limitations of\nexisting methods specially in terms of robustness and generalization, and we\nfind the most critical design choices. Using the discovered best practices, we\npropose ViFiGen, a method that outperforms all evaluated MVGs on 3D\nconsistency. Our code, model, and benchmark suite will be publicly released.", "AI": {"tldr": "MVGBench\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff08MVGs\uff09\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce83D\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u51653D\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6307\u6807\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f8312\u79cd\u73b0\u6709MVGs\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ViFiGen\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684MVGs\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u76ee\u6807\u89c6\u56fe\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4e0d\u540cMVGs\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u89c6\u89d2\u3001\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5149\u7167\uff09\u5dee\u5f02\u8f83\u5927\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "MVGBench\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30\u6700\u4f73\u914d\u7f6e\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e09\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b83\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u76843D\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u4ece\u4e0d\u76f8\u4ea4\u751f\u6210\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u76843D\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u57284\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e8612\u79cdMVGs\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684ViFiGen\u65b9\u6cd5\u57283D\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684MVGs\u3002", "conclusion": "MVGBench\u4e3aMVGs\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7ViFiGen\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u4ee3\u7801\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5957\u4ef6\u5c06\u516c\u5f00\u3002"}}

While\nexisting methods perform well on short videos, they often struggle with\nlong-range reasoning in longer videos. To scale Video LLMs for longer video\ncontent, frame sub-sampling (selecting frames at regular intervals) is commonly\nused. However, this approach is suboptimal, often leading to the loss of\ncrucial frames or the inclusion of redundant information from multiple similar\nframes. Missing key frames impairs the model's ability to answer questions\naccurately, while redundant frames lead the model to focus on irrelevant video\nsegments and increase computational resource consumption. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the use of a general-purpose text-to-video moment retrieval model\nto guide the frame sampling process. We propose \"moment sampling\", a novel,\nmodel-agnostic approach that enables the model to select the most relevant\nframes according to the context of the question.

While previous studies on 3D object detection often evaluate\nperformance based on mean average precision (mAP) and latency, they typically\nfail to address the trade-off between speed and accuracy, such as 60.0 mAP at\n100 ms vs 61.0 mAP at 500 ms. A quantitative assessment of the trade-offs\nbetween different hardware devices and accelerators remains unexplored, despite\nbeing critical for real-time applications. Furthermore, they overlook the\nimpact on collision avoidance in motion planning, for example, 60.0 mAP leading\nto safer motion planning or 61.0 mAP leading to high-risk motion planning. In\nthis paper, we introduce latency-aware AP (L-AP) and planning-aware AP (P-AP)\nas new metrics, which consider the physical world such as the concept of time\nand physical constraints, offering a more comprehensive evaluation for\nreal-time 3D object detection.

This is\nespecially problematic in dynamic traffic environments characterised by\nperiodic variations (e.g., day/night, peak hours), where past knowledge remains\nvaluable. Existing approaches like experience replay and visual prompts offer\nsome mitigation, but struggle to effectively prioritize and leverage historical\ndata for optimal knowledge retention and adaptation. Specifically, simply\nstoring and replaying all historical data can be inefficient, while treating\nall historical experiences as equally important overlooks their varying\nrelevance to the current domain. This paper proposes ER-EMU, an edge model\nupdate algorithm based on adaptive experience replay, to address these\nlimitations. ER-EMU utilizes a limited-size experience buffer managed using a\nFirst-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, and a novel Domain Distance Metric-based\nExperience Selection (DDM-ES) algorithm. DDM-ES employs the multi-kernel\nmaximum mean discrepancy (MK-MMD) to quantify the dissimilarity between target\ndomains, prioritizing the selection of historical data that is most dissimilar\nto the current target domain. This ensures training diversity and facilitates\nthe retention of knowledge from a wider range of past experiences, while also\npreventing overfitting to the new domain. The experience buffer is also updated\nusing a simple random sampling strategy to maintain a balanced representation\nof previous domains.

Two types of\nCF events were extracted from highD database, including the tailgated events,\nwhere the time headway between the FV and the ego-vehicle (i.e., time gap) was\nsmaller than 1 second, and the gapped events, where the time gap was larger\nthan 3 seconds.

Statistical analyses were\nconducted to compare the CF-performance metrics in tailgated and gapped events.\nThen, the inverse reinforcement learning was used to recover the reward\nfunction of the ego-vehicle drivers in different CF events. The results showed\nthat the ego-driver would adjust their CF behavior in response to the pressure\nfrom a tailgating FV, by maintaining a closer distance to the LV, but at the\nsame time, driving more cautiously. Further, drivers were still able to adjust\ntheir CF strategies based on the speed of traffic flow and the distance to the\nLV, even when being tailgated.

Second, we\nsurvey the current research landscape from the perspective of agent workflows,\nencompassing urban sensing, memory management, reasoning, execution, and\nlearning. Third, we categorize the application domains of urban LLM agents into\nfive groups: urban planning, transportation, environment, public safety, and\nurban society, presenting representative works in each group. Finally, we\ndiscuss trustworthiness and evaluation issues that are critical for real-world\ndeployment, and identify several open problems for future research. This survey\naims to establish a foundation for the emerging field of urban LLM agents and\nto provide a roadmap for advancing the intersection of LLMs and urban\nintelligence.

Nevertheless, the ultimate measure of effectiveness is their successful\ntransition from simulation to reality (sim2real). However, existing sim2real\ntransfer methods struggle to comprehensively address the autonomy-oriented\nrequirements of balancing: (i) conditioned domain adaptation, (ii) robust\nperformance with limited examples, (iii) modularity in handling multiple domain\nrepresentations, and (iv) real-time performance. To alleviate these pain\npoints, we present a unified framework for learning cross-domain adaptive\nrepresentations for sim2real transferable autonomous driving algorithms using\nconditional latent diffusion models. Our framework offers options to leverage:\n(i) alternate foundation models, (ii) a few-shot fine-tuning pipeline, and\n(iii) textual as well as image prompts for mapping across given source and\ntarget domains. It is also capable of generating diverse high-quality samples\nwhen diffusing across parameter spaces such as times of day, weather\nconditions, seasons, and operational design domains. We systematically analyze\nthe presented framework and report our findings in the form of critical\nquantitative metrics and ablation studies, as well as insightful qualitative\nexamples and remarks.

This contrast is\nprimarily governed by acquisition parameters, such as echo time and repetition\ntime, which are stored in the DICOM metadata. To simplify contrast\nidentification, broad labels such as T1-weighted or T2-weighted are commonly\nused, but these offer only a coarse approximation of the underlying acquisition\nsettings. In many real-world datasets, such labels are entirely missing,\nleaving raw acquisition parameters as the only indicators of contrast. Adding\nto this challenge, the available metadata is often incomplete, noisy, or\ninconsistent. The lack of reliable and standardized metadata complicates tasks\nsuch as image interpretation, retrieval, and integration into clinical\nworkflows. Furthermore, robust contrast-aware representations are essential to\nenable more advanced clinical applications, such as achieving\nmodality-invariant representations and data harmonization. To address these\nchallenges, we propose MR-CLIP, a multimodal contrastive learning framework\nthat aligns MR images with their DICOM metadata to learn contrast-aware\nrepresentations, without relying on manual labels.

It trains the agent while accounting\nfor action mismatches and controller corrections. By incorporating these\nfactors into the training process, the AI agent optimizes the desired action\nwith respect to both the actual control signal and the intended outcome,\nexplicitly considering execution errors. This approach enhances robustness,\nensuring that decision-making remains effective under real-world uncertainties.\nOur approach offers a substantial advancement for engineering practice by\nbridging the gap between idealized learning and real-world implementation. It\nequips intelligent agents operating in engineering environments with the\nability to anticipate and adjust for actuation errors and system disturbances\nduring training. We evaluate the framework in five widely used open-source\nmechanical simulation environments we restructured and developed to reflect\nreal-world operating conditions, showcasing its robustness against\nuncertainties and offering a highly practical and efficient solution for\ncontrol-oriented applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u63a7\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u5e76\u8865\u507f\u52a8\u4f5c\u6267\u884c\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u52a8\u4f5c\u5b8c\u7f8e\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u52a8\u4f5c\u6267\u884c\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1a\u786e\u5b9a\u671f\u671b\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e76\u9009\u62e9\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u6b63\u786e\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u8003\u8651\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4fee\u6b63\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u673a\u68b0\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u63a7\u5236\u5bfc\u5411\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b9e\u8df5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, current studies measure only the accuracy of the\ntranslation of NL logic into formal TL, ignoring a system's capacity to ground\natomic propositions into new scenarios or environments. This is a critical\nfeature, necessary for the verification of resulting formulas in a concrete\nstate space. Consequently, most NL-to-TL translation frameworks propose their\nown bespoke dataset in which the correct grounding is known a-priori, inflating\nperformance metrics and neglecting the need for extensible, domain-general\nsystems. In this paper, we introduce the Verifiable Linear Temporal Logic\nBenchmark ( VLTL-Bench), a unifying benchmark that measures verification and\nverifiability of automated NL-to-LTL translation. The dataset consists of three\nunique state spaces and thousands of diverse natural language specifications\nand corresponding formal specifications in temporal logic.

Recently, masked time-series modeling\nhas been proposed to effectively model temporal dependencies for forecasting by\nreconstructing masked segments from unmasked ones. However, since the semantic\ninformation in time series is involved in intricate temporal variations\ngenerated by multiple time series components, simply masking a raw time series\nignores the inherent semantic structure, which may cause MTM to learn spurious\ntemporal patterns present in the raw data. To capture distinct temporal\nsemantics, we show that masked modeling techniques should address entangled\npatterns through a decomposition approach. Specifically, we propose ST-MTM, a\nmasked time-series modeling framework with seasonal-trend decomposition, which\nincludes a novel masking method for the seasonal-trend components that\nincorporates different temporal variations from each component. ST-MTM uses a\nperiod masking strategy for seasonal components to produce multiple masked\nseasonal series based on inherent multi-periodicity and a sub-series masking\nstrategy for trend components to mask temporal regions that share similar\nvariations. The proposed masking method presents an effective pre-training task\nfor learning intricate temporal variations and dependencies. Additionally,\nST-MTM introduces a contrastive learning task to support masked modeling by\nenhancing contextual consistency among multiple masked seasonal\nrepresentations.

In particular, the paper extends\nexisting results on the analysis of PID-type geometric nonlinear control laws\nto more general higher-order dynamic state-feedback compensators on\n$\\mathrm{SO(3)}$. The candidate Lyapunov function is motivated by quadratic\nLyapunov functions of the form $V(x)=x^{\\top}Px$ typically considered in the\nanalysis of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. The stability analysis is\ncarried out in two steps. In the first step, a sufficient condition is obtained\nfor the positive definiteness of the candidate Lyapunov function, and a\nnecessary and sufficient condition for the negative definiteness of the\ncorresponding Lyapunov rate. These conditions ensure that the desired\nequilibrium is almost globally asymptotically stable (AGAS). In the second\nstep, a convex relaxation of the proposed conditions is used to obtain\nsufficient conditions in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).\nOverall, the approach is motivated by the widespread use of LMI-based analysis\nand design tools for LTI systems.

To address this\nissue, we have developed a defensive strategy for transformer-based modulation\nclassification systems to counter such adversarial attacks. In this paper, we\npropose a novel vision transformer (ViT) architecture by introducing a new\nconcept known as adversarial indicator (AdvI) token to detect adversarial\nattacks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose an\nAdvI token in ViT to defend against adversarial attacks. Integrating an\nadversarial training method with a detection mechanism using AdvI token, we\ncombine a training time defense and running time defense in a unified neural\nnetwork model, which reduces architectural complexity of the system compared to\ndetecting adversarial perturbations using separate models. We investigate into\nthe operational principles of our method by examining the attention mechanism.\nWe show the proposed AdvI token acts as a crucial element within the ViT,\ninfluencing attention weights and thereby highlighting regions or features in\nthe input data that are potentially suspicious or anomalous.

Our consolidated\nanalysis reports mean z-score shifts of $0.90\\sigma$ for\npersistence-of-attack-effects, $0.74\\sigma$ for prompt-injection effectiveness,\nand $0.63\\sigma$ for safety-bypass success across state-of-the-art VLMs.\nNotably, Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct exhibits a peak vulnerability increase\nof $1.29\\sigma$ for persistence-of-attack-effects, while GPT-4o shows increases\nof $0.69\\sigma$ for that same vector and $0.28\\sigma$ for prompt-injection\nattacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "VSF-Med\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u533b\u7597\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u6f0f\u6d1e\u8bc4\u5206\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u653b\u51fb\u6a21\u677f\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u516b\u7ef4\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u533b\u7597VLM\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u7597VLM\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u6f5c\u529b\u5de8\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cVSF-Med\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "VSF-Med\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u65b0\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u653b\u51fb\u6a21\u677f\u5e93\u3001\u57fa\u4e8eSSIM\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u516b\u7ef4\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7z-score\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u751f\u62100-32\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u98ce\u9669\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cVSF-Med\u572830,000\u4e2a\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e865,000\u5f20\u653e\u5c04\u56fe\u50cf\uff0cLlama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct\u548cGPT-4o\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\u6301\u4e45\u6027\u3001\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "VSF-Med\u4e3a\u533b\u7597VLM\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002"}}

However, extending these models to longer\nvideos remains a significant challenge, primarily due to degraded temporal\nconsistency and visual fidelity. Our preliminary observations show that naively\napplying short-video generation models to longer sequences leads to noticeable\nquality degradation. Further analysis identifies a systematic trend where\nhigh-frequency components become increasingly distorted as video length grows,\nan issue we term high-frequency distortion. To address this, we propose\nFreeLong, a training-free framework designed to balance the frequency\ndistribution of long video features during the denoising process. FreeLong\nachieves this by blending global low-frequency features, which capture holistic\nsemantics across the full video, with local high-frequency features extracted\nfrom short temporal windows to preserve fine details. Building on this,\nFreeLong++ extends FreeLong dual-branch design into a multi-branch architecture\nwith multiple attention branches, each operating at a distinct temporal scale.\nBy arranging multiple window sizes from global to local, FreeLong++ enables\nmulti-band frequency fusion from low to high frequencies, ensuring both\nsemantic continuity and fine-grained motion dynamics across longer video\nsequences. Without any additional training, FreeLong++ can be plugged into\nexisting video generation models (e.g. Wan2.1 and LTX-Video) to produce longer\nvideos with substantially improved temporal consistency and visual fidelity. We\ndemonstrate that our approach outperforms previous methods on longer video\ngeneration tasks (e.g. 4x and 8x of native length).

In this framework, an outer optimization loop\nfocuses on the design parameters, in our case the transmission ratios of a\nparallel belt-driven manipulator, which map the desired torques from the joint\nspace to the actuation space. An inner loop performs trajectory optimization in\nthe actuation space, thus exploiting the entire dynamic range of the\nmanipulator.

However, during collaborative tasks, existing\nsystems often lack the ability to accurately capture real-world interactions\nbetween students and physical objects. This issue could be addressed with\nautomatic 6D pose estimation, i.e., estimation of an object's position and\norientation in 3D space from RGB images or videos. For collaborative groups\nthat interact with physical objects, 6D pose estimates allow AI systems to\nrelate objects and entities. As part of this work, we introduce FiboSB, a novel\nand challenging 6D pose video dataset featuring groups of three participants\nsolving an interactive task featuring small hand-held cubes and a weight scale.\nThis setup poses unique challenges for 6D pose because groups are holistically\nrecorded from a distance in order to capture all participants -- this, coupled\nwith the small size of the cubes, makes 6D pose estimation inherently\nnon-trivial.

Yet, how robotic design cues might\nelicit misleading perceptions in people with dementia, and how these\nperceptions arise, remains insufficiently understood. In this scoping review,\nwe examined 26 empirical studies on interactions between people with dementia\nand physical social robots. We identify four key design cue categories that may\ninfluence deceptive impressions: cues resembling physiological signs (e.g.,\nsimulated breathing), social intentions (e.g., playful movement), familiar\nbeings (e.g., animal-like form and sound), and, to a lesser extent, cues that\nreveal artificiality. Thematic analysis of user responses reveals that people\nwith dementia often attribute biological, social, and mental capacities to\nrobots, dynamically shifting between awareness and illusion. These findings\nunderscore the fluctuating nature of ontological perception in dementia\ncontexts. Existing definitions of robotic deception often rest on philosophical\nor behaviorist premises, but rarely engage with the cognitive mechanisms\ninvolved. We propose an empirically grounded definition: robotic deception\noccurs when Type 1 (automatic, heuristic) processing dominates over Type 2\n(deliberative, analytic) reasoning, leading to misinterpretation of a robot's\nartificial nature.

Although decades of research have produced\na rich repertoire of mitigation techniques, persistent limitations: scarce\nhigh-quality data, algorithmic opacity, and residual reliance on expert\njudgment, continue to constrain progress. This review synthesizes recent\nadvances at the intersection of risk-informed decision making, human\nreliability assessment (HRA), artificial intelligence (AI), and cognitive\nscience to clarify how their convergence can curb human-error risk. We first\ncategorize the principal forms of human error observed in complex\nsociotechnical environments and outline their quantitative impact on system\nreliability. Next, we examine risk-informed frameworks that embed HRA within\nprobabilistic and data-driven methodologies, highlighting successes and gaps.\nWe then survey cognitive and human-performance models, detailing how\nmechanistic accounts of perception, memory, and decision-making enrich error\nprediction and complement HRA metrics. Building on these foundations, we\ncritically assess AI-enabled techniques for real-time error detection,\noperator-state estimation, and AI-augmented HRA workflows. Across these\nstrands, a recurring insight emerges: integrating cognitive models with\nAI-based analytics inside risk-informed HRA pipelines markedly enhances\npredictive fidelity, yet doing so demands richer datasets, transparent\nalgorithms, and rigorous validation.

Two foundational technologies, physical\nsimulators and world models, have emerged as critical enablers in this quest.\nPhysical simulators provide controlled, high-fidelity environments for training\nand evaluating robotic agents, allowing safe and efficient development of\ncomplex behaviors.

Among the methods proposed to solve this task,\nthose relying on patterns (i.e. subgraphs) provide good explainability, as the\npatterns used for classification can be directly interpreted. To identify\nmeaningful patterns, a standard approach is to use a quality measure, i.e. a\nfunction that evaluates the discriminative power of each pattern. However, the\nliterature provides tens of such measures, making it difficult to select the\nmost appropriate for a given application. Only a handful of surveys try to\nprovide some insight by comparing these measures, and none of them specifically\nfocuses on graphs. This typically results in the systematic use of the most\nwidespread measures, without thorough evaluation. To address this issue, we\npresent a comparative analysis of 38 quality measures from the literature. We\ncharacterize them theoretically, based on four mathematical properties. We\nleverage publicly available datasets to constitute a benchmark, and propose a\nmethod to elaborate a gold standard ranking of the patterns. We exploit these\nresources to perform an empirical comparison of the measures, both in terms of\npattern ranking and classification performance. Moreover, we propose a\nclustering-based preprocessing step, which groups patterns appearing in the\nsame graphs to enhance classification performance.

However, PbRL can\nsuffer from slow convergence speed since it requires training in a reward\nmodel. Prior work has proposed learning a reward model from demonstrations and\nfine-tuning it using preferences. However, when the model is a neural network,\nusing different loss functions for pre-training and fine-tuning can pose\nchallenges to reliable optimization. In this paper, we propose a method to\neffectively leverage prior knowledge with a Residual Reward Model (RRM). An RRM\nassumes that the true reward of the environment can be split into a sum of two\nparts: a prior reward and a learned reward. The prior reward is a term\navailable before training, for example, a user's ``best guess'' reward\nfunction, or a reward function learned from inverse reinforcement learning\n(IRL), and the learned reward is trained with preferences. We introduce\nstate-based and image-based versions of RRM and evaluate them on several tasks\nin the Meta-World environment suite.

Our method\nachieves performance improvements for a variety of different types of prior\nrewards, including proxy rewards, a reward obtained from IRL, and even a\nnegated version of the proxy reward. We also conduct experiments with a Franka\nPanda to show that our method leads to superior performance on a real robot.

In this study, we proposed a\nnovel approach called plant segmentation neural radiance fields (PlantSegNeRF),\naiming to directly generate high-precision instance point clouds from\nmulti-view RGB image sequences for a wide range of plant species. PlantSegNeRF\nperformed 2D instance segmentation on the multi-view images to generate\ninstance masks for each organ with a corresponding ID. The multi-view instance\nIDs corresponding to the same plant organ were then matched and refined using a\nspecially designed instance matching module. The instance NeRF was developed to\nrender an implicit scene, containing color, density, semantic and instance\ninformation. The implicit scene was ultimately converted into high-precision\nplant instance point clouds based on the volume density. The results proved\nthat in semantic segmentation of point clouds, PlantSegNeRF outperformed the\ncommonly used methods, demonstrating an average improvement of 16.1%, 18.3%,\n17.8%, and 24.2% in precision, recall, F1-score, and IoU compared to the\nsecond-best results on structurally complex datasets.

Unlike traditional end-to-end LLM\ninference, HLMs reduce latency and communication by invoking LLMs only when\nlocal SLM predictions are uncertain, i.e., when token-level confidence is low\nor entropy is high. However, ambiguous or low-confidence predictions still\nrequire frequent offloading to the LLM, leading to significant communication\noverhead in bandwidth-constrained settings. To address this, we propose FedHLM,\na communication-efficient HLM framework that integrates uncertainty-aware\ninference with Federated Learning (FL). FedHLM's key innovation lies in\ncollaboratively learning token-level uncertainty thresholds that govern when\nLLM assistance is needed. Rather than using static or manually tuned\nthresholds, FedHLM employs FL to optimize these thresholds in a\nprivacy-preserving, distributed manner. Additionally, it leverages\nembedding-based token representations for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) resolution,\nenabling clients to reuse tokens inferred by semantically similar peers without\nengaging the LLM. We further introduce hierarchical model aggregation: edge\nservers refine local routing policies through client updates, while\ncross-cluster coordination aligns global decision boundaries.

However, as the users\n(including human clients and downstream machine tasks) become more diverse,\nROI-based image compression needs to be customizable to support various\npreferences. For example, different users may define distinct ROI or require\ndifferent quality trade-offs between ROI and non-ROI. Existing ROI-based image\ncompression schemes predefine the ROI, making it unchangeable, and lack\neffective mechanisms to balance reconstruction quality between ROI and non-ROI.\nThis work proposes a paradigm for customizable ROI-based deep image\ncompression. First, we develop a Text-controlled Mask Acquisition (TMA) module,\nwhich allows users to easily customize their ROI for compression by just\ninputting the corresponding semantic \\emph{text}.

Finally, we present a Latent Mask Attention (LMA)\nmodule, where the latent spatial prior of the mask and the latent\nRate-Distortion Optimization (RDO) prior of the image are extracted and fused\nin the latent space, and further used to optimize the latent representation of\nthe source image.

To achieve\nminimal distortion while maintaining perfect perceptual quality, Posterior-Mean\nRectified Flow (PMRF) proposes a flow based approach where source distribution\nis minimum distortion estimations. Although PMRF is shown to be effective, its\npixel-space modeling approach limits its ability to align with human\nperception, where human perception is defined as how humans distinguish between\ntwo image distributions. In this work, we propose Latent-PMRF, which\nreformulates PMRF in the latent space of a variational autoencoder (VAE),\nfacilitating better alignment with human perception during optimization. By\ndefining the source distribution on latent representations of minimum\ndistortion estimation, we bound the minimum distortion by the VAE's\nreconstruction error.

However, real-world videos typically exist as\ncontinuously evolving data streams (e.g., dynamic scenes captured by wearable\nglasses), necessitating models to continually adapt to shifting data\ndistributions and novel scenarios. Considering the prohibitive computational\ncosts of fine-tuning models on new tasks, usually, a small subset of parameters\nis updated while the bulk of the model remains frozen. This poses new\nchallenges to existing continual learning frameworks in the context of large\nmultimodal foundation models, i.e., catastrophic forgetting and update\nconflict. While the foundation models struggle with parameter-efficient\ncontinual learning, the hippocampus in the human brain has evolved highly\nefficient mechanisms for memory formation and consolidation.

Homepage: https://jinyugy21.github.io/ARIG/", "summary": "Face-to-face communication, as a common human activity, motivates the\nresearch on interactive head generation. A virtual agent can generate motion\nresponses with both listening and speaking capabilities based on the audio or\nmotion signals of the other user and itself. However, previous clip-wise\ngeneration paradigm or explicit listener/speaker generator-switching methods\nhave limitations in future signal acquisition, contextual behavioral\nunderstanding, and switching smoothness, making it challenging to be real-time\nand realistic. In this paper, we propose an autoregressive (AR) based\nframe-wise framework called ARIG to realize the real-time generation with\nbetter interaction realism. To achieve real-time generation, we model motion\nprediction as a non-vector-quantized AR process. Unlike discrete codebook-index\nprediction, we represent motion distribution using diffusion procedure,\nachieving more accurate predictions in continuous space. To improve interaction\nrealism, we emphasize interactive behavior understanding (IBU) and detailed\nconversational state understanding (CSU). In IBU, based on dual-track\ndual-modal signals, we summarize short-range behaviors through\nbidirectional-integrated learning and perform contextual understanding over\nlong ranges. In CSU, we use voice activity signals and context features of IBU\nto understand the various states (interruption, feedback, pause, etc.) that\nexist in actual conversations.

Although recent work\nhas extended this line of research into machine vision, there has been a\nscarcity of studies systematically exploring its perceptual boundaries across\nmultiple tasks and stimulus types, particularly in the current era of rapidly\nadvancing large multimodal models (LMMs), where studying the multifaceted\ncapabilities of models has become a mainstream focus. Moreover, the perceptual\ndefects of LMMs are not investigated thoroughly, resulting in potential\nsecurity issues and suboptimal response efficiency. In this paper, we take an\ninitial attempt and demonstrate that there exist significant visual blind spots\nin current LMMs. To systemically quantify this characteristic, we propose a new\nconcept, {\\bf LMM-JND}, together with its determination pipeline. Targeting\nuncovering the behavior commonalities in HVS-aligned visual perception tasks,\nwe delve into several LMM families and construct a large-scale dataset, named\nVPA-JND, which contains 21.5k reference images with over 489k stimuli across 12\ndistortion types, to facilitate LMM-JND studies. VPA-JND exposes areas where\nstate-of-the-art LMMs, including GPT-4o and the InternVL2.5 series, struggle\nwith basic comparison queries and fall significantly short of human-level\nvisual performance.

Then, a\ncross-attention mechanism is applied to fuse fine-grained visual information,\nenriching the overall visual representation. 2) We present two model variants:\nLLaVA-SP-Cropping, which focuses on detail features through progressive\ncropping, and LLaVA-SP-Pooling, which captures global semantics through\nadaptive pooling, enabling the model to handle diverse visual understanding\ntasks. 3) Extensive experiments show that LLaVA-SP, fine-tuned with LoRA,\nachieves significant performance improvements across various multimodal\nbenchmarks, outperforming the state-of-the-art LLaVA-1.5 model in multiple\ntasks with nearly identical inference latency.

Most recent\nworks in ASD explore the use of large language models (LLMs) in goal-driven\nsettings, relying on human-specified research questions to guide hypothesis\ngeneration. However, scientific discovery may be accelerated further by\nallowing the AI system to drive exploration by its own criteria. The few\nexisting approaches in open-ended ASD select hypotheses based on diversity\nheuristics or subjective proxies for human interestingness, but the former\nstruggles to meaningfully navigate the typically vast hypothesis space, and the\nlatter suffers from imprecise definitions. This paper presents AutoDS -- a\nmethod for open-ended ASD that instead drives scientific exploration using\nBayesian surprise. Here, we quantify the epistemic shift from the LLM's prior\nbeliefs about a hypothesis to its posterior beliefs after gathering\nexperimental results. To efficiently explore the space of nested hypotheses,\nour method employs a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) strategy with progressive\nwidening using surprisal as the reward function.

Existing driving-oriented VQA datasets are limited to full-scene\ndescriptions or waypoint prediction, preventing the assessment of whether VLMs\ncan respond to localized user-driven queries. We introduce Box-QAymo, a\nbox-referring dataset and benchmark designed to both evaluate and finetune VLMs\non spatial and temporal reasoning over user-specified objects. Users express\nintent by drawing bounding boxes, offering a fast and intuitive interface for\nfocused queries in complex scenes. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical\nevaluation protocol that begins with binary sanity-check questions to assess\nbasic model capacities, and progresses to (1) attribute prediction for\nbox-referred objects, (2) motion understanding of target instances, and (3)\nspatiotemporal motion reasoning over inter-object dynamics across frames. To\nsupport this, we crowd-sourced fine-grained object classes and visual\nattributes that reflect the complexity drivers encounter, and extract object\ntrajectories to construct temporally grounded QA pairs. Rigorous quality\ncontrol through negative sampling, temporal consistency checks, and\ndifficulty-aware balancing guarantee dataset robustness and diversity.

This task is extremely challenging due to the difficulty in\ngeneralizing from known to unknown actions. Previous studies typically use\ntwo-stage training: pre-training skeleton encoders on seen action categories\nusing cross-entropy loss and then aligning pre-extracted skeleton and text\nfeatures, enabling knowledge transfer to unseen classes through skeleton-text\nalignment and language models' generalization. However, their efficacy is\nhindered by 1) insufficient discrimination for skeleton features, as the fixed\nskeleton encoder fails to capture necessary alignment information for effective\nskeleton-text alignment; 2) the neglect of alignment bias between skeleton and\nunseen text features during testing. To this end, we propose a prototype-guided\nfeature alignment paradigm for zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition,\ntermed PGFA.

To our knowledge, RAER is the\nfirst dataset capturing diverse natural learning scenarios. Observing that\nannotators naturally consider context cues-such as whether a student is looking\nat a phone or reading a book-alongside facial expressions, we propose CLIP-CAER\n(CLIP-based Context-aware Academic Emotion Recognition). Our method utilizes\nlearnable text prompts within the vision-language model CLIP to effectively\nintegrate facial expression and context cues from videos. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that CLIP-CAER substantially outperforms state-of-the-art\nvideo-based facial expression recognition methods, which are primarily designed\nfor basic emotions, emphasizing the crucial role of context in accurately\nrecognizing academic emotions.

Accurate prediction of such manoeuvres is\nessential for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) to make timely and\ninformed decisions. In this study, we focus on overtake detection using\nController Area Network (CAN) bus data collected from five in-service trucks\nprovided by the Volvo Group. We evaluate three common classifiers for vehicle\nmanoeuvre detection, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Random Forest (RF), and\nSupport Vector Machines (SVM), and analyse how different preprocessing\nconfigurations affect performance. We find that variability in traffic\nconditions strongly influences the signal patterns, particularly in the\nno-overtake class, affecting classification performance if training data lacks\nadequate diversity. Since the data were collected under unconstrained,\nreal-world conditions, class diversity cannot be guaranteed a priori. However,\ntraining with data from multiple vehicles improves generalisation and reduces\ncondition-specific bias. Our pertruck analysis also reveals that classification\naccuracy, especially for overtakes, depends on the amount of training data per\nvehicle. To address this, we apply a score-level fusion strategy, which yields\nthe best per-truck performance across most cases. Overall, we achieve an\naccuracy via fusion of TNR=93% (True Negative Rate) and TPR=86.5% (True\nPositive Rate).

A critical research challenge arises: constructing\nan informative driving world model to enable perception annotation-free,\nend-to-end planning via self-supervised learning. In this paper, we present\nWorld4Drive, an end-to-end autonomous driving framework that employs vision\nfoundation models to build latent world models for generating and evaluating\nmulti-modal planning trajectories. Specifically, World4Drive first extracts\nscene features, including driving intention and world latent representations\nenriched with spatial-semantic priors provided by vision foundation models. It\nthen generates multi-modal planning trajectories based on current scene\nfeatures and driving intentions and predicts multiple intention-driven future\nstates within the latent space. Finally, it introduces a world model selector\nmodule to evaluate and select the best trajectory.

Previous wireframe-alignment-based method\nLoD-Loc has shown promising localization results leveraging LoD models.\nHowever, LoD-Loc mainly relies on high-LoD (LoD3 or LoD2) city models, but the\nmajority of available models and those many countries plan to construct\nnationwide are low-LoD (LoD1). Consequently, enabling localization on low-LoD\ncity models could unlock drones' potential for global urban localization. To\naddress these issues, we introduce LoD-Loc v2, which employs a coarse-to-fine\nstrategy using explicit silhouette alignment to achieve accurate localization\nover low-LoD city models in the air. Specifically, given a query image, LoD-Loc\nv2 first applies a building segmentation network to shape building silhouettes.\nThen, in the coarse pose selection stage, we construct a pose cost volume by\nuniformly sampling pose hypotheses around a prior pose to represent the pose\nprobability distribution. Each cost of the volume measures the degree of\nalignment between the projected and predicted silhouettes. We select the pose\nwith maximum value as the coarse pose. In the fine pose estimation stage, a\nparticle filtering method incorporating a multi-beam tracking approach is used\nto efficiently explore the hypothesis space and obtain the final pose\nestimation. To further facilitate research in this field, we release two\ndatasets with LoD1 city models covering 10.7 km , along with real RGB queries\nand ground-truth pose annotations. Experimental results show that LoD-Loc v2\nimproves estimation accuracy with high-LoD models and enables localization with\nlow-LoD models for the first time.

Equal contribution by Kiyoung Om,\n  Kyuil Sim, and Taeyoung Yun", "summary": "Optimizing high-dimensional black-box functions under black-box constraints\nis a pervasive task in a wide range of scientific and engineering problems.\nThese problems are typically harder than unconstrained problems due to\nhard-to-find feasible regions. While Bayesian optimization (BO) methods have\nbeen developed to solve such problems, they often struggle with the curse of\ndimensionality. Recently, generative model-based approaches have emerged as a\npromising alternative for constrained optimization. However, they suffer from\npoor scalability and are vulnerable to mode collapse, particularly when the\ntarget distribution is highly multi-modal. In this paper, we propose a new\nframework to overcome these challenges. Our method iterates through two stages.\nFirst, we train flow-based models to capture the data distribution and\nsurrogate models that predict both function values and constraint violations\nwith uncertainty quantification. Second, we cast the candidate selection\nproblem as a posterior inference problem to effectively search for promising\ncandidates that have high objective values while not violating the constraints.\nDuring posterior inference, we find that the posterior distribution is highly\nmulti-modal and has a large plateau due to constraints, especially when\nconstraint feedback is given as binary indicators of feasibility. To mitigate\nthis issue, we amortize the sampling from the posterior distribution in the\nlatent space of flow-based models, which is much smoother than that in the data\nspace.

However, its quadratic complexity limits its\napplicability to vision tasks. In contrast, Linear Attention shares a similar\nformulation with Softmax Attention while achieving linear complexity, enabling\nefficient global information modeling. Nevertheless, Linear Attention suffers\nfrom a significant performance degradation compared to standard Softmax\nAttention. In this paper, we analyze the underlying causes of this issue based\non the formulation of Linear Attention. We find that, unlike Softmax Attention,\nLinear Attention entirely disregards the magnitude information of the Query.\nThis prevents the attention score distribution from dynamically adapting as the\nQuery scales. As a result, despite its structural similarity to Softmax\nAttention, Linear Attention exhibits a significantly different attention score\ndistribution. Based on this observation, we propose Magnitude-Aware Linear\nAttention (MALA), which modifies the computation of Linear Attention to fully\nincorporate the Query's magnitude. This adjustment allows MALA to generate an\nattention score distribution that closely resembles Softmax Attention while\nexhibiting a more well-balanced structure. We evaluate the effectiveness of\nMALA on multiple tasks, including image classification, object detection,\ninstance segmentation, semantic segmentation, natural language processing,\nspeech recognition, and image generation.

BEV-VAE first trains a multi-view image\nvariational autoencoder for a compact and unified BEV latent space and then\ngenerates the scene with a latent diffusion transformer. BEV-VAE supports\narbitrary view generation given camera configurations, and optionally 3D\nlayouts. Experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse 2 (AV2) show strong performance\nin both 3D consistent reconstruction and generation.

We represent the dataset-specific features of the\nvictim model by the output differences between the shadow and victim models.\nAfter that, a meta-classifier is trained to identify stolen models by\ndetermining whether suspicious models contain the dataset-specific features of\nthe victim. In the third stage, we conduct model ownership verification by\nhypothesis test to mitigate randomness and enhance robustness. Extensive\nexperiments on benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod in detecting different types of model stealing simultaneously.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u5bb3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6240\u6709\u6743\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u76f8\u4f3c\u5171\u540c\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u514d\u53d7\u6a21\u578b\u7a83\u53d6\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6548\u6216\u5f15\u5165\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u521b\u5efa\u4fdd\u7559\u5171\u540c\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5f71\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8bc6\u522b\u88ab\u76d7\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6240\u6709\u6743\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u7a83\u53d6\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6240\u6709\u6743\u9a8c\u8bc1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This paper\naims to bridge this gap by introducing a novel paradigm: the Cognitive\nLoad-Aware Inference (CLAI) framework, which operationalizes principles from\nCognitive Load Theory (CLT) and neuroscience for LLM inference. We formalize\nthe concepts of Intrinsic Cognitive Load, Extraneous Cognitive Load, and\nGermane Cognitive Load into quantifiable LLM metrics ($ICL_{LLM}$, $ECL_{LLM}$,\nand $GCL_{LLM}$), thereby reframing the inference process as a cognitive\neconomics optimization problem: based on the intrinsic complexity of a problem\n($ICL_{LLM}$), minimize wasteful computation ($ECL_{LLM}$), and strategically\nallocate the token budget to productive reasoning ($GCL_{LLM}$).

When ERA5 is used as a reference, SCAWaveNet achieves\nan average RMSE of 0.438 m. When using buoy data from NDBC, the average RMSE\nreaches 0.432 m. Compared to state-of-the-art models, SCAWaveNet reduces the\naverage RMSE by at least 3.52% on the ERA5 dataset and by 5.47% on the NDBC\nbuoy observations.

While some metrics\nfail to account for the ordinal structure of difficulty levels, none adequately\naddress class imbalance, resulting in biased performance assessments. This\nstudy addresses these limitations by benchmarking three types of model outputs\n-- discretized regression, classification, and ordinal regression -- using the\nbalanced Discrete Ranked Probability Score (DRPS), a novel metric that jointly\ncaptures ordinality and class imbalance. In addition to using popular ordinal\nregression methods, we propose OrderedLogitNN, extending the ordered logit\nmodel from econometrics to neural networks. We fine-tune BERT on the RACE++ and\nARC datasets and find that OrderedLogitNN performs considerably better on\ncomplex tasks. The balanced DRPS offers a robust and fair evaluation metric for\ndiscrete-level QDE, providing a principled foundation for future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u95ee\u9898\u96be\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff08QDE\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u548c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u987a\u5e8f\u6027\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709QDE\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u96be\u5ea6\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u672a\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5e73\u8861\u79bb\u6563\u6392\u540d\u6982\u7387\u5f97\u5206\uff08DRPS\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86OrderedLogitNN\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u6709\u5e8f\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "OrderedLogitNN\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e73\u8861DRPS\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aQDE\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

These challenges highlight the necessity for a robust and efficient\nmultimodal UAV object detection method. Mamba has demonstrated considerable\npotential in multimodal image fusion. Leveraging this, we propose UAVD-Mamba, a\nmultimodal UAV object detection framework based on Mamba architectures. To\nimprove geometric adaptability, we propose the Deformable Token Mamba Block\n(DTMB) to generate deformable tokens by incorporating adaptive patches from\ndeformable convolutions alongside normal patches from normal convolutions,\nwhich serve as the inputs to the Mamba Block. To optimize the multimodal\nfeature complementarity, we design two separate DTMBs for the RGB and infrared\n(IR) modalities, with the outputs from both DTMBs integrated into the Mamba\nBlock for feature extraction and into the Fusion Mamba Block for feature\nfusion. Additionally, to improve multiscale object detection, especially for\nsmall objects, we stack four DTMBs at different scales to produce multiscale\nfeature representations, which are then sent to the Detection Neck for Mamba\n(DNM). The DNM module, inspired by the YOLO series, includes modifications to\nthe SPPF and C3K2 of YOLOv11 to better handle the multiscale features. In\nparticular, we employ cross-enhanced spatial attention before the DTMB and\ncross-channel attention after the Fusion Mamba Block to extract more\ndiscriminative features.

Effective forecasting allows\nfor the precise application of anti-sprouting chemicals (ASCs), minimizing\nwaste and reducing costs. This need has become even more pressing following the\nban on Isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate (CIPC) or Chlorpropham due to\nhealth and environmental concerns, which has led to the adoption of\nsignificantly more expensive alternative ASCs. Existing approaches primarily\nrely on visual identification, which only detects sprouting after morphological\nchanges have occurred, limiting their effectiveness for proactive management. A\nreliable early prediction method is therefore essential to enable timely\nintervention and improve the efficiency of post-harvest storage strategies,\nwhere early refers to detecting sprouting before any visible signs appear. In\nthis work, we address the problem of early prediction of potato sprouting. To\nthis end, we propose a novel machine learning (ML)-based approach that enables\nearly prediction of potato sprouting using electrophysiological signals\nrecorded from tubers using proprietary sensors. Our approach preprocesses the\nrecorded signals, extracts relevant features from the wavelet domain, and\ntrains supervised ML models for early sprouting detection. Additionally, we\nincorporate uncertainty quantification techniques to enhance predictions.\nExperimental results demonstrate promising performance in the early detection\nof potato sprouting by accurately predicting the exact day of sprouting for a\nsubset of potatoes and while showing acceptable average error across all\npotatoes.

This work addresses\nthis challenge by leveraging a single intraoperative image and preoperative\ndata to train NeRF efficiently for surgical scenarios.\n  Methods: We leverage preoperative MRI data to define the set of camera\nviewpoints and images needed for robust and unobstructed training.\nIntraoperatively, the appearance of the surgical image is transferred to the\npre-constructed training set through neural style transfer, specifically\ncombining WTC2 and STROTSS to prevent over-stylization. This process enables\nthe creation of a dataset for instant and fast single-image NeRF training.\n  Results: The method is evaluated with four clinical neurosurgical cases.\nQuantitative comparisons to NeRF models trained on real surgical microscope\nimages demonstrate strong synthesis agreement, with similarity metrics\nindicating high reconstruction fidelity and stylistic alignment. When compared\nwith ground truth, our method demonstrates high structural similarity,\nconfirming good reconstruction quality and texture preservation.\n  Conclusion: Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of single-image NeRF\ntraining in surgical settings, overcoming the limitations of traditional\nmulti-view methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u5355\u5f20\u672f\u4e2d\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u672f\u524d\u6570\u636e\u5feb\u901f\u8bad\u7ec3NeRF\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "NeRF\u57283D\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u89c6\u56fe\u5408\u6210\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u9650\u5236\u65e0\u6cd5\u83b7\u53d6\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u5f20\u672f\u4e2d\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u672f\u524d\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u672f\u524dMRI\u6570\u636e\u5b9a\u4e49\u76f8\u673a\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\uff08WTC2\u548cSTROTSS\uff09\u5c06\u672f\u4e2d\u56fe\u50cf\u5916\u89c2\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u9884\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u5feb\u901f\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u795e\u7ecf\u5916\u79d1\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u624b\u672f\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u56fe\u50cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684NeRF\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u63a5\u8fd1\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u8bad\u7ec3NeRF\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002"}}

Large\nknowledge graphs store such knowledge, and embedding methods can be used to\ndistill it into ready-to-use vector representations for downstream\napplications. For this purpose, current models have however two limitations:\nthey are primarily optimized for link prediction, via local contrastive\nlearning, and they struggle to scale to the largest graphs due to GPU memory\nlimits. To address these, we introduce SEPAL: a Scalable Embedding Propagation\nALgorithm for large knowledge graphs designed to produce high-quality\nembeddings for downstream tasks at scale. The key idea of SEPAL is to enforce\nglobal embedding alignment by optimizing embeddings only on a small core of\nentities, and then propagating them to the rest of the graph via message\npassing. We evaluate SEPAL on 7 large-scale knowledge graphs and 46 downstream\nmachine learning tasks. Our results show that SEPAL significantly outperforms\nprevious methods on downstream tasks.

We then propose a ghost category extension for standard classifiers\nthat adds auxiliary ghost output nodes so the model gains extra descent\ndirections that open a lateral corridor around narrow loss barriers and enable\nthe optimizer to bypass poor basins during the early training phase. We show\nthat this extension strictly reduces approximation error and that after\nsufficient convergence the ghost dimensions collapse and the extended model's\ninvariant law coincides with that of the original and there exists a path in\nthe enlarged parameter space along which the total loss does not increase while\nthe original loss decreases by an arbitrary margin.

In this paper, we introduce ZeCO (Zero Communication Overhead)\nsequence parallelism for linear attention models, a new SP method designed to\novercome these limitations and achieve end-to-end near-linear scalability for\nlong sequence training. For example, training a model with a 1M sequence length\nacross 64 devices using ZeCO takes roughly the same time as training with an\n16k sequence on a single device. At the heart of ZeCO lies All-Scan, a new\ncollective communication primitive. All-Scan provides each SP rank with\nprecisely the initial operator state it requires while maintaining a minimal\ncommunication footprint, effectively eliminating communication overhead.\nTheoretically, we prove the optimaity of ZeCO, showing that it introduces only\nnegligible time and space overhead. Empirically, we compare the communication\ncosts of different sequence parallelism strategies and demonstrate that\nAll-Scan achieves the fastest communication in SP scenarios.
