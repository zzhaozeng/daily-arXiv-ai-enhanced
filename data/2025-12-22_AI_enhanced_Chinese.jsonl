Within this broader landscape, Entity Set Expansion is one prominent task aimed at taking an initial set of (tuples of) entities and identifying additional ones that share relevant semantic properties with the former -- potentially repeating the process to form increasingly broader sets. However, this ``linear'' approach does not unveil the richer ``taxonomic'' structures present in knowledge resources. A recent logic-based framework introduces the notion of an expansion graph: a rooted directed acyclic graph where each node represents a semantic generalization labeled by a logical formula, and edges encode strict semantic inclusion. This structure supports taxonomic expansions of entity sets driven by knowledge bases. Yet, the potentially large size of such graphs may make full materialization impractical in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, we formalize reasoning tasks that check whether two tuples belong to comparable, incomparable, or the same nodes in the graph. Our results show that, under realistic assumptions -- such as bounding the input or limiting entity descriptions -- these tasks can be implemented efficiently. This enables local, incremental navigation of expansion graphs, supporting practical applications without requiring full graph construction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u4f53\u96c6\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u6269\u5c55\u56fe\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u6784\u5efa\u5b8c\u6574\u56fe\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u589e\u91cf\u5bfc\u822a\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u96c6\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u80fd\u7ebf\u6027\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u63ed\u793a\u77e5\u8bc6\u8d44\u6e90\u4e2d\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u96c6\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6269\u5c55\u56fe\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5373\u6839\u6709\u5411\u65e0\u73af\u56fe\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u8868\u793a\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u903b\u8f91\u516c\u5f0f\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u8fb9\u8868\u793a\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5305\u542b\u3002\u5e76\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e86\u68c0\u67e5\u4e24\u4e2a\u5143\u7ec4\u662f\u5426\u5c5e\u4e8e\u53ef\u6bd4\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u6bd4\u6216\u76f8\u540c\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff08\u5982\u9650\u5236\u8f93\u5165\u6216\u5b9e\u4f53\u63cf\u8ff0\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u589e\u91cf\u5bfc\u822a\u6269\u5c55\u56fe\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u6784\u5efa\u5b8c\u6574\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u589e\u91cf\u5bfc\u822a\u6269\u5c55\u56fe\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u5b8c\u5168\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u96c6\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Experiments on long-horizon benchmarks (AppWorld, OfficeBench, and 8-Objective QA) demonstrate that PAACE consistently improves agent correctness while substantially reducing context load. On AppWorld, PAACE achieves higher accuracy than all baselines while lowering peak context and cumulative dependency. On OfficeBench and multi-hop QA, PAACE improves both accuracy and F1, achieving fewer steps, lower peak tokens, and reduced attention dependency.

The main challenge lies in the abundance of candidate subgraphs, where trivial or overly common connections often obscure the identification of unique and informative answers. To tackle this, we propose UniRel-R1, a unified framework that integrates subgraph selection, multi-stage graph pruning, and an LLM fine-tuned with reinforcement learning.

Current solutions force enterprises to choose between expensive, proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs) and low-performing Small Language Models (SLMs). Efforts to improve SLMs often rely on distilling reasoning from large LLMs using unstructured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces, a process that remains inherently ambiguous. Instead, we hypothesize that a formal, structured reasoning representation provides a clearer, more reliable teaching signal, as the Text-to-SQL task requires explicit and precise logical steps. To evaluate this hypothesis, we propose Struct-SQL, a novel Knowledge Distillation (KD) framework that trains an SLM to emulate a powerful large LLM. Consequently, we adopt a query execution plan as a formal blueprint to derive this structured reasoning. Our SLM, distilled with structured CoT, achieves an absolute improvement of 8.1% over an unstructured CoT distillation baseline. A detailed error analysis reveals that a key factor in this gain is a marked reduction in syntactic errors.

Moreover, each non-autoregressive language model typically requires it own data collation, loss, and prediction logic, making it challenging to reuse common components. In this work, we present the XLM python package, which is designed to make implementing small non-autoregressive language models faster with a secondary goal of providing a suite of small pre-trained models (through a companion xlm-models package) that can be used by the research community.

Assigning a utility to each possible interaction history forces us to confront the ambiguity that some hypotheses in the agent's belief distribution only predict a finite prefix of the history, which is sometimes interpreted as implying a chance of death equal to a quantity called the semimeasure loss. This death interpretation suggests one way to assign utilities to such history prefixes. We argue that it is as natural to view the belief distributions as imprecise probability distributions, with the semimeasure loss as total ignorance. This motivates us to consider the consequences of computing expected utilities with Choquet integrals from imprecise probability theory, including an investigation of their computability level. We recover the standard recursive value function as a special case.

A paraphrase is chosen so that its score closely matches that of the original text, to avoid introducing any distribution shifts. To test whether a suspect model has been trained on the watermarked data, we compare its token probabilities against those of the scoring model. We demonstrate that SPECTRA achieves a consistent p-value gap of over nine orders of magnitude when detecting data used for training versus data not used for training, which is greater than all baselines tested.

While general-purpose programming languages are well supported, generating code for domain-specific languages remains a challenging problem for LLMs. In this paper, we focus on the LLM-based generation of code for Answer Set Programming (ASP), a particularly effective approach for finding solutions to combinatorial search problems. The effectiveness of LLMs in ASP code generation is currently hindered by the limited number of examples seen during their initial pre-training phase.\n  In this paper, we introduce a novel ASP-solver-in-the-loop approach for solver-guided instruction-tuning of LLMs to addressing the highly complex semantic parsing task inherent in ASP code generation. Our method only requires problem specifications in natural language and their solutions. Specifically, we sample ASP statements for program continuations from LLMs for unriddling logic puzzles. Leveraging the special property of declarative ASP programming that partial encodings increasingly narrow down the solution space, we categorize them into chosen and rejected instances based on solver feedback. We then apply supervised fine-tuning to train LLMs on the curated data and further improve robustness using a solver-guided search that includes best-of-N sampling.

Evaluation and methodology study on dialogue topic segmentation", "summary": "Dialogue topic segmentation supports summarization, retrieval, memory management, and conversational continuity. Despite decades of prior work, evaluation practice in dialogue topic segmentation remains dominated by strict boundary matching and F1-based metrics, even as modern LLM-based conversational systems increasingly rely on segmentation to manage conversation history beyond the model's fixed context window, where unstructured context accumulation degrades efficiency and coherence.\n  This paper introduces an evaluation objective for dialogue topic segmentation that treats boundary density and segment coherence as primary criteria, alongside window-tolerant F1 (W-F1). Through extensive cross-dataset empirical evaluation, we show that reported performance differences across dialogue segmentation benchmarks are driven not by model quality, but by annotation granularity mismatches and sparse boundary labels. This indicates that many reported improvements arise from evaluation artifacts rather than improved boundary detection.\n  We evaluated multiple, structurally distinct dialogue segmentation strategies across eight dialogue datasets spanning task-oriented, open-domain, meeting-style, and synthetic interactions. Across these settings, we observe high segment coherence combined with extreme oversegmentation relative to sparse labels, producing misleadingly low exact-match F1 scores. We show that topic segmentation is best understood as selecting an appropriate granularity rather than predicting a single correct boundary set. We operationalize this view by explicitly separating boundary scoring from boundary selection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u5272\u8bc4\u4f30\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u8fb9\u754c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u7247\u6bb5\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u7a97\u53e3\u5bb9\u5fcdF1\uff08W-F1\uff09\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u4e25\u683c\u8fb9\u754c\u5339\u914d\u548cF1\u6307\u6807\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u5272\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e25\u683c\u8fb9\u754c\u5339\u914d\u548cF1\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u73b0\u4ee3\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u5206\u5272\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8d85\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u56fa\u5b9a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5386\u53f2\u65f6\uff0c\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u79ef\u7d2f\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5c06\u8fb9\u754c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u7247\u6bb5\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u7a97\u53e3\u5bb9\u5fcdF1\uff08W-F1\uff09\u6307\u6807\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5206\u5272\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5206\u5272\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u660e\u786e\u5c06\u8fb9\u754c\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0e\u8fb9\u754c\u9009\u62e9\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u6807\u6ce8\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u8fb9\u754c\u6807\u7b7e\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5206\u5272\u4e0e\u7a00\u758f\u6807\u7b7e\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4f4eF1\u5206\u6570\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5206\u79bb\u8fb9\u754c\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0e\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u5272\u5e94\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u7c92\u5ea6\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u9884\u6d4b\u552f\u4e00\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u96c6\u5408\u3002\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u542bW-F1\u548c\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff09\u66f4\u8d34\u5408\u5b9e\u9645\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f2a\u5f71\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Applied to benchmark (Mini-ARC) tasks, our method produces Solomonoff-weighted mixtures for per-cell predictions, yielding conservative, uncertainty-aware outputs even when hypotheses are noisy or partially incorrect. Compared to Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA), Solomonoff scoring spreads probability more evenly across competing hypotheses, while BMA concentrates weight on the most likely but potentially flawed candidates.

To address this gap, we propose to introduce reinforcement learning into multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation, enhancing the reasoning capabilities of multi-modal large language models through a two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning framework to achieve explainable multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation.

In this paper, we propose Mindscape-Aware RAG (MiA-RAG), the first approach that equips LLM-based RAG systems with explicit global context awareness. MiA-RAG builds a mindscape through hierarchical summarization and conditions both retrieval and generation on this global semantic representation. This enables the retriever to form enriched query embeddings and the generator to reason over retrieved evidence within a coherent global context. We evaluate MiA-RAG across diverse long-context and bilingual benchmarks for evidence-based understanding and global sense-making.

Even state-of-the-art models such as Whisper struggle to maintain accuracy under varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). This study presents a robust noise-sensitive ASR error correction framework that combines multiple hypotheses and noise-aware modeling. Using noisy Persian speech, we generate 5-best hypotheses from a modified Whisper-large decoder. Error Level Noise (ELN) is introduced as a representation that captures semantic- and token-level disagreement across hypotheses, quantifying the linguistic distortions caused by noise. ELN thus provides a direct measure of noise-induced uncertainty, enabling the LLM to reason about the reliability of each hypothesis during correction. Three models are evaluated: (1) a base LLaMA-2-7B model without fine-tuning, (2) a fine-tuned variant trained on text-only hypotheses, and (3) a noise-conditioned model integrating ELN embeddings at both sentence and word levels. Experimental results demonstrate that the ELN-conditioned model achieves substantial reductions in Word Error Rate (WER). Specifically, on the challenging Mixed Noise test set, the proposed Fine-tuned + ELN (Ours) model reduces the WER from a baseline of 31.10\\% (Raw Whisper) to 24.84\\%, significantly surpassing the Fine-tuned (No ELN) text-only baseline of 30.79\\%, whereas the original LLaMA-2-7B model increased the WER to 64.58\\%, demonstrating that it is unable to correct Persian errors on its own. This confirms the effectiveness of combining multiple hypotheses with noise-aware embeddings for robust Persian ASR in noisy real-world scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing evaluation practices often rely on static summary statistics or post-hoc value models, which fail to capture how a player's contribution adapts to a new tactical environment or different teammates. To address this gap, we introduce EventGPT, a player-conditioned, value-aware next-event prediction model built on a GPT-style autoregressive transformer. Our model treats match play as a sequence of discrete tokens, jointly learning to predict the next on-ball action's type, location, timing, and its estimated residual On-Ball Value (rOBV) based on the preceding context and player identity. A key contribution of this framework is the ability to perform counterfactual simulations. By substituting learned player embeddings into new event sequences, we can simulate how a player's behavioral distribution and value profile would change when placed in a different team or tactical structure. Evaluated on five seasons of Premier League event data, EventGPT outperforms existing sequence-based baselines in next-event prediction accuracy and spatial precision. Furthermore, we demonstrate the model's practical utility for transfer analysis through case studies-such as comparing striker performance across different systems and identifying stylistic replacements for specific roles-showing that our approach provides a principled method for evaluating transfer fit.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This work examines whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as competent battle agents, capable of both making tactically sound decisions and generating novel, balanced game content. We developed a turn-based Pok\u00e9mon battle system where LLMs select moves based on battle state rather than pre-programmed logic. The framework captures essential Pok\u00e9mon mechanics: type effectiveness multipliers, stat-based damage calculations, and multi-Pok\u00e9mon team management.

One challenge is that human concepts themselves are fluid: conceptual boundaries can shift, split, and merge as inquiry progresses (e.g., Pluto is no longer considered a planet). To make progress, we need a definition of \"concept\" that is not merely a dictionary label, but a structure that can be revised, compared, and aligned across agents. We propose an algorithmic-information viewpoint that treats a concept as an information object defined only through its structural relation to an agent's total experience. The core constraint is determination: a set of parts forms a reversible consistency relation if any missing part is recoverable from the others (up to the standard logarithmic slack in Kolmogorov-style identities). This reversibility prevents \"concepts\" from floating free of experience and turns concept existence into a checkable structural claim. To judge whether a decomposition is natural, we define excess information, measuring the redundancy overhead introduced by splitting experience into multiple separately described parts. On top of these definitions, we formulate dialectics as an optimization dynamics: as new patches of information appear (or become contested), competing concepts bid to explain them via shorter conditional descriptions, driving systematic expansion, contraction, splitting, and merging. Finally, we formalize low-cost concept transmission and multi-agent alignment using small grounds/seeds that allow another agent to reconstruct the same concept under a shared protocol, making communication a concrete compute-bits trade-off.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this paper, we translate the Rashomon effect to sequential decision-making. We define it as multiple policies that exhibit identical behavior, visiting the same states and selecting the same actions, while differing in their internal structure, such as feature attributions. Verifying identical behavior in sequential decision-making differs from classification. In classification, predictions can be directly compared to ground-truth labels. In sequential decision-making with stochastic transitions, the same policy may succeed or fail on any single trajectory due to randomness. We address this using formal verification methods that construct and compare the complete probabilistic behavior of each policy in the environment. Our experiments demonstrate that the Rashomon effect exists in sequential decision-making. We further show that ensembles constructed from the Rashomon set exhibit greater robustness to distribution shifts than individual policies.

This shift has triggered urgent debate regarding Anthropomorphism, the attribution of human characteristics to synthetic agents, and its potential to induce misplaced trust or emotional dependency. However, the causal link between more humanlike AI design and subsequent effects on engagement and trust has not been tested in realistic human-AI interactions with a global user pool. Prevailing safety frameworks continue to rely on theoretical assumptions derived from Western populations, overlooking the global diversity of AI users. Here, we address these gaps through two large-scale cross-national experiments (N=3,500) across 10 diverse nations, involving real-time and open-ended interactions with an AI system. We find that when evaluating an AI's human-likeness, users focus less on the kind of theoretical aspects often cited in policy (e.g., sentience or consciousness), but rather applied, interactional cues like conversation flow or understanding the user's perspective. We also experimentally demonstrate that humanlike design levers can causally increase anthropomorphism among users; however, we do not find that humanlike design universally increases behavioral measures for user engagement and trust, as previous theoretical work suggests. Instead, part of the connection between human-likeness and behavioral outcomes is fractured by culture: specific design choices that foster self-reported trust in AI-systems in some populations (e.g., Brazil) may trigger the opposite result in others (e.g., Japan). Our findings challenge prevailing narratives of inherent risk in humanlike AI design.

To theoretically formalize the desired reasoning behaviors, this paper presents the Laws of Reasoning (LoRe), a unified framework that characterizes intrinsic reasoning patterns in LRMs. We first propose compute law with the hypothesis that the reasoning compute should scale linearly with question complexity. Beyond compute, we extend LoRe with a supplementary accuracy law. Since the question complexity is difficult to quantify in practice, we examine these hypotheses by two properties of the laws, monotonicity and compositionality. We therefore introduce LoRe-Bench, a benchmark that systematically measures these two tractable properties for large reasoning models. Evaluation shows that most reasoning models exhibit reasonable monotonicity but lack compositionality. In response, we develop an effective finetuning approach that enforces compute-law compositionality. Extensive empirical studies demonstrate that better compliance with compute laws yields consistently improved reasoning performance on multiple benchmarks, and uncovers synergistic effects across properties and laws.

With only 595M parameters in total, our small LLMs ensemble proves more parameter-efficient and robust than models up to 7B parameters, establishing that carefully designed ensembles of small, fine-tuned models can outperform much larger LLMs in specialized natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as emotion detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eCondorcet\u966a\u5ba1\u56e2\u5b9a\u7406\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u68c0\u6d4b\u96c6\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684sLLMs\u548c\u53cc\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u6295\u7968\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5927\u578bLLMs\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u60c5\u611f\u68c0\u6d4b\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u540c\u6784\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002\u53d7Condorcet\u966a\u5ba1\u56e2\u5b9a\u7406\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u7684sLLMs\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u60c5\u611f\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408BERT\u3001RoBERTa\u3001DistilBERT\u3001DeBERTa\u548cELECTRA\u4e94\u79cdsLLMs\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u6295\u7968\u673a\u5236\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u5168\u5c40\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff09\u6765\u52a8\u6001\u52a0\u6743\u6a21\u578b\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "\u5728DAIR-AI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8693.5%\u7684\u5b8f\u89c2F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eFalcon\u3001Mistral\u3001Qwen\u548cPhi\u7b49\u5927\u578bLLMs\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b49\u4e13\u4e1aNLP\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u66f4\u5927\u7684LLMs\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

While this means that personality frameworks would be highly valuable tools to characterize and control LLMs' behavior, current approaches remain either costly (post-training) or brittle (prompt engineering). Probing and steering via linear directions has recently emerged as a cheap and efficient alternative. In this paper, we investigate whether linear directions aligned with the Big Five personality traits can be used for probing and steering model behavior. Using Llama 3.3 70B, we generate descriptions of 406 fictional characters and their Big Five trait scores. We then prompt the model with these descriptions and questions from the Alpaca questionnaire, allowing us to sample hidden activations that vary along personality traits in known, quantifiable ways. Using linear regression, we learn a set of per-layer directions in activation space, and test their effectiveness for probing and steering model behavior. Our results suggest that linear directions aligned with trait-scores are effective probes for personality detection, while their steering capabilities strongly depend on context, producing reliable effects in forced-choice tasks but limited influence in open-ended generation or when additional context is present in the prompt.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u5411\u4e0e\u4e94\u5927\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63a2\u6d4b\u548c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7528\u4e8e\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u63a7\u5236LLMs\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4e0d\u591f\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u5ec9\u4ef7\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Llama 3.3 70B\u751f\u6210406\u4e2a\u865a\u6784\u4eba\u7269\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u4e94\u5927\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u5f97\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7Alpaca\u95ee\u5377\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u6837\u9690\u85cf\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u6bcf\u5c42\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "result": "\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u5411\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63a2\u6d4b\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5f15\u5bfc\u884c\u4e3a\u65f6\uff0c\u5176\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u60c5\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u9009\u62e9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u6216\u9644\u52a0\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u5f71\u54cd\u6709\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u5411\u662f\u63a2\u6d4bLLMs\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5f15\u5bfc\u80fd\u529b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002"}}

In addition, it has been designed for simulating the processing of short segments, rather than long-form audio streams, and it does not provide an easy method to showcase systems in a demo. As a solution, we introduce simulstream, the first open-source framework dedicated to unified evaluation and demonstration of StreamST systems.

Moreover, our approach leverages the multi-token prediction logits directly without requiring additional entity encoders or cross-attention layers, significantly reducing architectural complexity.

This makes evaluating UGC translation particularly challenging: what counts as a \"good\" translation depends on the level of standardness desired in the output. To explore this, we examine the human translation guidelines of four UGC datasets, and derive a taxonomy of twelve non-standard phenomena and five translation actions (NORMALISE, COPY, TRANSFER, OMIT, CENSOR). Our analysis reveals notable differences in how UGC is treated, resulting in a spectrum of standardness in reference translations. Through a case study on large language models (LLMs), we show that translation scores are highly sensitive to prompts with explicit translation instructions for UGC, and that they improve when these align with the dataset's guidelines. We argue that when preserving UGC style is important, fair evaluation requires both models and metrics to be aware of translation guidelines. Finally, we call for clear guidelines during dataset creation and for the development of controllable, guideline-aware evaluation frameworks for UGC translation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The rapid development of large language models needs benchmarks that can evaluate their comprehension of ancient characters. Existing Chinese benchmarks are mostly targeted at modern Chinese and transmitted documents in ancient Chinese, but the part of excavated documents in ancient Chinese is not covered. To meet this need, we propose the AncientBench, which aims to evaluate the comprehension of ancient characters, especially in the scenario of excavated documents. The AncientBench is divided into four dimensions, which correspond to the four competencies of ancient character comprehension: glyph comprehension, pronunciation comprehension, meaning comprehension, and contextual comprehension. The benchmark also contains ten tasks, including radical, phonetic radical, homophone, cloze, translation, and more, providing a comprehensive framework for evaluation. We convened archaeological researchers to conduct experimental evaluations, proposed an ancient model as baseline, and conducted extensive experiments on the currently best-performing large language models. The experimental results reveal the great potential of large language models in ancient textual scenarios as well as the gap with humans. Our research aims to promote the development and application of large language models in the field of archaeology and ancient Chinese language.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Nowadays, MedER-based research outcomes can remarkably contribute to the development of automated systems in the medical sector, ultimately enhancing patient care and outcomes. While extensive research has been conducted on MedER in English, low-resource languages like Bangla remain underexplored. Our work aims to bridge this gap. For Bangla medical entity recognition, this study first examined a number of transformer models, including BERT, DistilBERT, ELECTRA, and RoBERTa. We also propose a novel Multi-BERT Ensemble approach that outperformed all baseline models with the highest accuracy of 89.58%. Notably, it provides an 11.80% accuracy improvement over the single-layer BERT model, demonstrating its effectiveness for this task. A major challenge in MedER for low-resource languages is the lack of annotated datasets. To address this issue, we developed a high-quality dataset tailored for the Bangla MedER task. The dataset was used to evaluate the effectiveness of our model through multiple performance metrics, demonstrating its robustness and applicability. Our findings highlight the potential of Multi-BERT Ensemble models in improving MedER for Bangla and set the foundation for further advancements in low-resource medical NLP.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed\u533b\u5b66\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578bMulti-BERT\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u82f1\u8bed\u533b\u5b66\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u7814\u7a76\u4e30\u5bcc\uff0c\u4f46\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed\u7b49\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86BERT\u3001DistilBERT\u3001ELECTRA\u548cRoBERTa\u7b49Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faMulti-BERT\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed\u533b\u5b66\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "Multi-BERT\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8689.58%\u7684\u6700\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6bd4\u5355\u5c42BERT\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8611.80%\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6307\u6807\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Multi-BERT\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed\u533b\u5b66\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u533b\u5b66NLP\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Existing benchmarks often lack systematic criteria for expert reporting, evaluations that rely heavily on LLM judges can fail to capture issues that require expert judgment, and source verification typically covers only a limited subset of explicitly cited statements rather than report-wide factual reliability. We introduce DEER, a benchmark for evaluating expert-level deep research reports. DEER comprises 50 report-writing tasks spanning 13 domains and an expert-grounded evaluation taxonomy (7 dimensions, 25 sub-dimension) operationalized into 130 fine-grained rubric items. DEER further provides task-specific expert guidance to help LLM judges assess expert-level report quality more consistently. Complementing rubric-based assessment, we propose a document-level fact-checking architecture that extracts and verifies all claims across the entire report, including both cited and uncited ones, and quantifies external-evidence quality. DEER correlates closely with human expert judgments and yields interpretable diagnostics of system strengths and weaknesses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86DEER\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7\u6df1\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u4e0d\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e13\u5bb6\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLMs)\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u751f\u6210\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u4f46\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u62a5\u544a\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e13\u5bb6\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6807\u51c6\uff0cLLM\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u5bb6\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6765\u6e90\u9a8c\u8bc1\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u8986\u76d6\u6709\u9650\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u4e8b\u5b9e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "DEER\u5305\u542b50\u4e2a\u62a5\u544a\u64b0\u5199\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6db5\u76d613\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u4e13\u5bb6\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff087\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c25\u4e2a\u5b50\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u7ec6\u5316\u4e3a130\u4e2a\u8bc4\u5206\u7ec6\u5219\u3002DEER\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9LLM\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6587\u6863\u7ea7\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6574\u4e2a\u62a5\u544a\u4e2d\u7684\u6240\u6709\u58f0\u660e\uff0c\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u5916\u90e8\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "DEER\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u4eba\u5de5\u5224\u65ad\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u52bf\u548c\u52a3\u52bf\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u8bca\u65ad\u3002", "conclusion": "DEER\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7\u6df1\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u62a5\u544a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u5316\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u7ec6\u5219\u548c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}
