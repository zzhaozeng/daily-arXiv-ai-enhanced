Recent machine learning-based text spotters (e.g., for scene\nimages) have the potential to solve these challenges because of their\nflexibility in supporting various types of text instances. However, these\nmethods remain challenges in extracting precise image features for predicting\nevery sub-component (boundary points and characters) in a text instance.

A key challenge\nis achieving robust cross-lingual lexical alignment, crucial for tasks like\ntranslation and cross-lingual information retrieval. This paper introduces\nTargeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel and efficient fine-tuning approach.\nWe first demonstrate that Lugha-Llama-8B-wura, a Swahili-centric LLM, exhibits\nstrong, near-perfect lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs in its\nearly internal layers (specifically Layer 2, with ~0.99998 average cosine\nsimilarity based on a pilot study), a capability not fully reflected in its\nfinal output representations (baseline ~0.32 similarity on our evaluation set).\nTLI leverages this insight by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a\ncontrastive learning objective to fine-tune the model, specifically targeting\nembeddings from this empirically identified optimal early layer. Our\nexperiments show that TLI significantly improves the output-level lexical\nalignment for 623 trained Swahili-English word pairs, increasing average cosine\nsimilarity from 0.3211 to 0.4113 (+28.08%, p < 1.33 x 10^-240). More\nimportantly, these improvements generalize remarkably well to 63 unseen control\nword pairs, with similarity increasing from 0.3143 to 0.4033 (+28.32%, p < 7.17\nx 10^-27).
