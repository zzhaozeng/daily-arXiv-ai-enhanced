### [2] [Learning Latent Representations for Image Translation using Frequency Distributed CycleGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03415)
*Shivangi Nigam,Adarsh Prasad Behera,Shekhar Verma,P. Nagabhushan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fd-CycleGAN通过结合局部邻域编码和频率感知监督，改进了图像到图像翻译的潜在表示学习，提升了生成图像的质量和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在图像翻译任务中难以同时捕捉局部细节和全局结构，且生成结果缺乏多样性。Fd-CycleGAN旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 基于CycleGAN，引入局部邻域编码（LNE）和频率感知监督，使用KL/JS散度和对数相似度度量来量化生成图像与真实图像的分布对齐。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，Fd-CycleGAN在感知质量、收敛速度和模式多样性上优于基线方法，尤其在低数据量情况下表现突出。

Conclusion: Fd-CycleGAN通过频率引导的潜在学习，显著提升了图像翻译任务的泛化能力，适用于文档修复、艺术风格迁移和医学图像合成等应用。

Abstract: This paper presents Fd-CycleGAN, an image-to-image (I2I) translation
framework that enhances latent representation learning to approximate real data
distributions. Building upon the foundation of CycleGAN, our approach
integrates Local Neighborhood Encoding (LNE) and frequency-aware supervision to
capture fine-grained local pixel semantics while preserving structural
coherence from the source domain. We employ distribution-based loss metrics,
including KL/JS divergence and log-based similarity measures, to explicitly
quantify the alignment between real and generated image distributions in both
spatial and frequency domains. To validate the efficacy of Fd-CycleGAN, we
conduct experiments on diverse datasets -- Horse2Zebra, Monet2Photo, and a
synthetically augmented Strike-off dataset. Compared to baseline CycleGAN and
other state-of-the-art methods, our approach demonstrates superior perceptual
quality, faster convergence, and improved mode diversity, particularly in
low-data regimes. By effectively capturing local and global distribution
characteristics, Fd-CycleGAN achieves more visually coherent and semantically
consistent translations. Our results suggest that frequency-guided latent
learning significantly improves generalization in image translation tasks, with
promising applications in document restoration, artistic style transfer, and
medical image synthesis. We also provide comparative insights with
diffusion-based generative models, highlighting the advantages of our
lightweight adversarial approach in terms of training efficiency and
qualitative output.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DreamVVT是一个基于扩散变换器（DiTs）的两阶段框架，旨在解决视频虚拟试穿（VVT）中细粒度服装细节保留和时间一致性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖稀缺的配对数据集，且未能充分利用预训练模型和测试输入的先验知识，导致在无约束场景中效果不佳。

Method: 第一阶段使用多帧试穿模型和视觉语言模型（VLM）生成高质量关键帧试穿图像；第二阶段利用骨架图和动态描述，结合预训练视频生成模型（带LoRA适配器）生成连贯视频。

Result: 实验表明，DreamVVT在服装细节保留和时间稳定性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DreamVVT通过两阶段设计和预训练模型的有效利用，显著提升了视频虚拟试穿的效果。

Abstract: Video virtual try-on (VVT) technology has garnered considerable academic
interest owing to its promising applications in e-commerce advertising and
entertainment. However, most existing end-to-end methods rely heavily on scarce
paired garment-centric datasets and fail to effectively leverage priors of
advanced visual models and test-time inputs, making it challenging to
accurately preserve fine-grained garment details and maintain temporal
consistency in unconstrained scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose
DreamVVT, a carefully designed two-stage framework built upon Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs), which is inherently capable of leveraging diverse unpaired
human-centric data to enhance adaptability in real-world scenarios. To further
leverage prior knowledge from pretrained models and test-time inputs, in the
first stage, we sample representative frames from the input video and utilize a
multi-frame try-on model integrated with a vision-language model (VLM), to
synthesize high-fidelity and semantically consistent keyframe try-on images.
These images serve as complementary appearance guidance for subsequent video
generation. \textbf{In the second stage}, skeleton maps together with
fine-grained motion and appearance descriptions are extracted from the input
content, and these along with the keyframe try-on images are then fed into a
pretrained video generation model enhanced with LoRA adapters. This ensures
long-term temporal coherence for unseen regions and enables highly plausible
dynamic motions. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate
that DreamVVT surpasses existing methods in preserving detailed garment content
and temporal stability in real-world scenarios. Our project page

### [5] [Elucidating the Role of Feature Normalization in IJEPA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02829)
*Adam Colton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出在IJEPA架构中用DynTanh激活替代层归一化（LN），以保留视觉标记的自然能量层级，从而提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 层归一化（LN）破坏了视觉标记的自然能量层级，导致模型无法优先处理语义丰富的区域，并产生棋盘状伪影。

Method: 用DynTanh激活替代LN，以更好地保留标记能量，并让高能量标记对预测损失贡献更大。

Result: 改进后的模型在ImageNet线性探测准确率从38%提升至42.7%，并在NYU Depth V2深度估计任务中降低RMSE 0.08。

Conclusion: 保留标记的自然能量层级对自监督视觉表示学习至关重要。

Abstract: In the standard image joint embedding predictive architecture (IJEPA),
features at the output of the teacher encoder are layer normalized (LN) before
serving as a distillation target for the student encoder and predictor. We
propose that this feature normalization disrupts the natural energy hierarchy
of visual tokens, where high-energy tokens (those with larger L2 norms) encode
semantically important image regions. LN forces all features to have identical
L2 norms, effectively equalizing their energies and preventing the model from
prioritizing semantically rich regions. We find that IJEPA models trained with
feature LN exhibit loss maps with significant checkerboard-like artifacts. We
propose that feature LN be replaced with a DynTanh activation as the latter
better preserves token energies and allows high-energy tokens to greater
contribute to the prediction loss. We show that IJEPA trained with feature
DynTanh exhibits a longer-tailed loss distribution and fixes the checkerboard
artifacts in the loss map. Our empirical results show that our simple
modification improves ImageNet linear probe accuracy from 38% to 42.7% for
ViT-Small and reduces RMSE by 0.08 on NYU Depth V2 monocular depth estimation.
These results suggest that preserving natural token energies is crucial for
effective self-supervised visual representation learning.

### [6] [GENIE: Gaussian Encoding for Neural Radiance Fields Interactive Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02831)
*Mikołaj Zieliński,Krzysztof Byrski,Tomasz Szczepanik,Przemysław Spurek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GENIE结合了NeRF的高保真渲染和GS的可编辑性，通过高斯特征嵌入和高效邻近搜索实现实时编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决NeRF难以编辑和GS渲染质量不足的问题，结合两者的优势。

Method: 使用高斯特征嵌入和RT-GPS邻近搜索，结合多分辨率哈希网格。

Result: 实现了实时、局部感知的编辑，支持动态交互和物理模拟。

Conclusion: GENIE在几何编辑和神经渲染之间架起桥梁，提供直观的场景操作。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting (GS) have recently
transformed 3D scene representation and rendering. NeRF achieves high-fidelity
novel view synthesis by learning volumetric representations through neural
networks, but its implicit encoding makes editing and physical interaction
challenging. In contrast, GS represents scenes as explicit collections of
Gaussian primitives, enabling real-time rendering, faster training, and more
intuitive manipulation. This explicit structure has made GS particularly
well-suited for interactive editing and integration with physics-based
simulation. In this paper, we introduce GENIE (Gaussian Encoding for Neural
Radiance Fields Interactive Editing), a hybrid model that combines the
photorealistic rendering quality of NeRF with the editable and structured
representation of GS. Instead of using spherical harmonics for appearance
modeling, we assign each Gaussian a trainable feature embedding. These
embeddings are used to condition a NeRF network based on the k nearest
Gaussians to each query point. To make this conditioning efficient, we
introduce Ray-Traced Gaussian Proximity Search (RT-GPS), a fast nearest
Gaussian search based on a modified ray-tracing pipeline. We also integrate a
multi-resolution hash grid to initialize and update Gaussian features.
Together, these components enable real-time, locality-aware editing: as
Gaussian primitives are repositioned or modified, their interpolated influence
is immediately reflected in the rendered output. By combining the strengths of
implicit and explicit representations, GENIE supports intuitive scene
manipulation, dynamic interaction, and compatibility with physical simulation,
bridging the gap between geometry-based editing and neural rendering. The code

### [7] [RefineSeg: Dual Coarse-to-Fine Learning for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02844)
*Anghong Du,Nay Aung,Theodoros N. Arvanitis,Stefan K. Piechnik,Joao A C Lima,Steffen E. Petersen,Le Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于粗标注的医学图像分割框架，通过建模粗标注中的噪声，逐步优化分割结果，性能接近全监督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像的高质量像素级标注成本高且需专业知识，粗标注虽易获取但存在噪声，需解决这一问题。

Method: 引入转移矩阵建模粗标注中的噪声，通过多组粗标注联合训练，逐步优化网络输出，推断真实分割分布。

Result: 在ACDC、MSCMRseg和UK Biobank数据集上验证，性能优于弱监督方法，接近全监督方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效利用粗标注，无需精确标注即可实现高质量分割，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: High-quality pixel-level annotations of medical images are essential for
supervised segmentation tasks, but obtaining such annotations is costly and
requires medical expertise. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
coarse-to-fine segmentation framework that relies entirely on coarse-level
annotations, encompassing both target and complementary drawings, despite their
inherent noise. The framework works by introducing transition matrices in order
to model the inaccurate and incomplete regions in the coarse annotations. By
jointly training on multiple sets of coarse annotations, it progressively
refines the network's outputs and infers the true segmentation distribution,
achieving a robust approximation of precise labels through matrix-based
modeling. To validate the flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed method,
we demonstrate the results on two public cardiac imaging datasets, ACDC and
MSCMRseg, and further evaluate its performance on the UK Biobank dataset.
Experimental results indicate that our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art
weakly supervised methods and closely matches the fully supervised approach.

### [8] [MIDAR: Mimicking LiDAR Detection for Traffic Applications with a Lightweight Plug-and-Play Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02858)
*Tianheng Zhu,Yiheng Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MIDAR模型，通过微观交通模拟器生成近似真实LiDAR检测的数据，解决了多AV场景下模拟器的可扩展性和感知建模能力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大规模真实AV部署不现实，现有模拟器在可扩展性或感知建模能力上存在局限，需要一种方法结合两者的优势。

Method: 提出MIDAR模型，利用车辆级特征预测真实LiDAR检测结果，构建RM-LoS图编码遮挡关系，并采用GRU增强的APPNP架构进行特征传播。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，MIDAR的AUC达到0.909，验证了其近似主流LiDAR检测模型的能力，并在CP应用中展示了实用性。

Conclusion: MIDAR填补了模拟器的感知建模空白，可无缝集成到交通模拟器和轨迹数据集中，为需要精确车辆观测的任务提供了支持。

Abstract: As autonomous driving (AD) technology advances, increasing research has
focused on leveraging cooperative perception (CP) data collected from multiple
AVs to enhance traffic applications. Due to the impracticality of large-scale
real-world AV deployments, simulation has become the primary approach in most
studies. While game-engine-based simulators like CARLA generate high-fidelity
raw sensor data (e.g., LiDAR point clouds) which can be used to produce
realistic detection outputs, they face scalability challenges in multi-AV
scenarios. In contrast, microscopic traffic simulators such as SUMO scale
efficiently but lack perception modeling capabilities. To bridge this gap, we
propose MIDAR, a LiDAR detection mimicking model that approximates realistic
LiDAR detections using vehicle-level features readily available from
microscopic traffic simulators. Specifically, MIDAR predicts true positives
(TPs) and false negatives (FNs) from ideal LiDAR detection results based on the
spatial layouts and dimensions of surrounding vehicles. A Refined Multi-hop
Line-of-Sight (RM-LoS) graph is constructed to encode the occlusion
relationships among vehicles, upon which MIDAR employs a GRU-enhanced APPNP
architecture to propagate features from the ego AV and occluding vehicles to
the prediction target. MIDAR achieves an AUC of 0.909 in approximating the
detection results generated by CenterPoint, a mainstream 3D LiDAR detection
model, on the nuScenes AD dataset. Two CP-based traffic applications further
validate the necessity of such realistic detection modeling, particularly for
tasks requiring accurate individual vehicle observations (e.g., position,
speed, lane index). As demonstrated in the applications, MIDAR can be
seamlessly integrated into traffic simulators and trajectory datasets and will
be open-sourced upon publication.

Result: 展示了Transformer架构在遥感图像目标检测中的先进性能。

Conclusion: Transformer在高分辨率卫星图像目标检测中表现优异，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: In 2012, AlexNet established deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) as
the state-of-the-art in CV, as these networks soon led in visual tasks for many
domains, including remote sensing. With the publication of Visual Transformers,
we are witnessing the second modern leap in computational vision, and as such,
it is imperative to understand how various transformer-based neural networks
perform on satellite imagery. While transformers have shown high levels of
performance in natural language processing and CV applications, they have yet
to be compared on a large scale to modern remote sensing data. In this paper,
we explore the use of transformer-based neural networks for object detection in
high-resolution electro-optical satellite imagery, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance on a variety of publicly available benchmark data
sets. We compare eleven distinct bounding-box detection and localization
algorithms in this study, of which seven were published since 2020, and all
eleven since 2015. The performance of five transformer-based architectures is
compared with six convolutional networks on three state-of-the-art opensource
high-resolution remote sensing imagery datasets ranging in size and complexity.
Following the training and evaluation of thirty-three deep neural models, we
then discuss and analyze model performance across various feature extraction
methodologies and detection algorithms.

### [10] [VisuCraft: Enhancing Large Vision-Language Models for Complex Visual-Guided Creative Content Generation via Structured Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02890)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisuCraft是一个新框架，通过多模态结构化信息提取器和动态提示生成模块，显著提升大型视觉语言模型在复杂视觉引导创意内容生成中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在生成长文本时难以保持高视觉保真度、真实创意和精确遵循用户指令。

Method: VisuCraft整合了多模态结构化信息提取器（E）和动态提示生成模块（G），提取图像细粒度属性并生成优化提示。

Result: 在ImageStoryGen-500K数据集上评估，VisuCraft在故事生成和诗歌创作任务中表现优于基线模型，尤其在创意和指令遵循方面。

Conclusion: VisuCraft有效提升了大型视觉语言模型在创意内容生成中的表现，为高级创意AI应用开辟了新潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces VisuCraft, a novel framework designed to significantly
enhance the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in complex
visual-guided creative content generation. Existing LVLMs often exhibit
limitations in maintaining high visual fidelity, genuine creativity, and
precise adherence to nuanced user instructions when generating long-form texts.
VisuCraft addresses these challenges by integrating a multimodal structured
information extractor (E) and a dynamic prompt generation module (G). The
extractor distills fine-grained visual attributes from input images into a
rich, structured representation, which the dynamic prompt module then combines
with user instructions to create highly optimized prompts for underlying LVLMs
(e.g., LLaVA, InstructBLIP). Evaluated on the self-constructed
ImageStoryGen-500K dataset using VisuGen Metrics (Visual Grounding, Creativity,
and Instruction Adherence), VisuCraft consistently outperforms baseline LVLMs
across tasks like story generation and poetry composition. Our results
demonstrate remarkable improvements, particularly in creativity and instruction
adherence, validating VisuCraft's effectiveness in producing imaginative,
visually grounded, and user-aligned long-form creative text. This work unlocks
new potential for LVLMs in sophisticated creative AI applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的鲁棒去噪扩散模型，适用于仅含污染（正常与异常混合）未标记数据的场景，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型依赖正常数据训练，限制了实际应用。本文旨在解决仅含污染数据时的异常分割问题。

Method: 通过将数据最大似然估计转化为非线性回归问题，利用鲁棒回归推导出鲁棒版本的扩散模型。

Result: 在MVTec数据集上，AUROC和AUPRC分别提升8.08%和10.37%。

Conclusion: 提出的鲁棒扩散模型在污染数据场景下表现优异，为异常分割提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have demonstrated significant success
in unsupervised anomaly segmentation. For anomaly segmentation, these models
are first trained on normal data; then, an anomalous image is noised to an
intermediate step, and the normal image is reconstructed through backward
diffusion. Unlike traditional statistical methods, diffusion models do not rely
on specific assumptions about the data or target anomalies, making them
versatile for use across different domains. However, diffusion models typically
assume access to normal data for training, limiting their applicability in
realistic settings. In this paper, we propose novel robust denoising diffusion
models for scenarios where only contaminated (i.e., a mix of normal and
anomalous) unlabeled data is available. By casting maximum likelihood
estimation of the data as a nonlinear regression problem, we reinterpret the
denoising diffusion probabilistic model through a regression lens. Using robust
regression, we derive a robust version of denoising diffusion probabilistic
models. Our novel framework offers flexibility in constructing various robust
diffusion models. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms current
state of the art diffusion models, for unsupervised anomaly segmentation when
only contaminated data is available. Our method outperforms existing
diffusion-based approaches, achieving up to 8.08\% higher AUROC and 10.37\%
higher AUPRC on MVTec datasets. The implementation code is available at:

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效地编码材料信息并生成高保真RIR，为声学环境设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: How would the sound in a studio change with a carpeted floor and acoustic
tiles on the walls? We introduce the task of material-controlled acoustic
profile generation, where, given an indoor scene with specific audio-visual
characteristics, the goal is to generate a target acoustic profile based on a
user-defined material configuration at inference time. We address this task
with a novel encoder-decoder approach that encodes the scene's key properties
from an audio-visual observation and generates the target Room Impulse Response
(RIR) conditioned on the material specifications provided by the user. Our
model enables the generation of diverse RIRs based on various material
configurations defined dynamically at inference time. To support this task, we
create a new benchmark, the Acoustic Wonderland Dataset, designed for
developing and evaluating material-aware RIR prediction methods under diverse
and challenging settings. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model
effectively encodes material information and generates high-fidelity RIRs,
outperforming several baselines and state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨了现成的大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在视觉与语言导航（VLN）任务中的潜力，发现其虽能完成任务，但效果不如专门设计的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究现成LVLMs在VLN任务中的适用性，并探索其是否支持低级和全景动作范式。

Method: 微调开源模型Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct，在Room-to-Room数据集上评估其在低级和全景动作空间中的表现。

Result: 最佳模型在R2R测试集上达到41%的成功率，表明现成LVLMs虽能完成任务，但效果不如专门设计的模型。

Conclusion: 现成LVLMs在VLN任务中具有一定潜力，但仍需进一步优化以匹敌专门设计的模型。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) refers to the task of enabling
autonomous robots to navigate unfamiliar environments by following natural
language instructions. While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have
shown promise in this task, most current VLM systems rely on models
specifically designed and optimized for navigation, leaving the potential of
off-the-shelf LVLMs underexplored. Furthermore, while older VLN approaches used
low-level action spaces with egocentric views and atomic actions (such as "turn
left" or "move forward"), newer models tend to favor panoramic action spaces
with discrete navigable viewpoints. This paper investigates (1) whether
off-the-shelf LVLMs (fine-tuned without architectural modifications or
simulator-based training) can effectively support VLN tasks and (2) whether
such models can support both low-level and panoramic action paradigms. To this
end, we fine-tune the open-source model Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct on the
Room-to-Room (R2R) dataset and evaluate its empirical performance across both
low-level and panoramic action spaces. The best resulting model achieves a 41%
success rate on the R2R test set, demonstrating that while off-the-shelf LVLMs
can learn to perform Vision-and-Language Navigation, they still lag behind
models specifically designed for this task.

Conclusion: 扩散先验揭示了盲去卷积问题的有效解，需优化初始化和先验设计以提升性能。

Abstract: The Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation is a widely used framework in blind
deconvolution to recover sharp images from blurred observations. The estimated
image and blur filter are defined as the maximizer of the posterior
distribution. However, when paired with sparsity-promoting image priors, MAP
estimation has been shown to favors blurry solutions, limiting its
effectiveness. In this paper, we revisit this result using diffusion-based
priors, a class of models that capture realistic image distributions. Through
an empirical examination of the prior's likelihood landscape, we uncover two
key properties: first, blurry images tend to have higher likelihoods; second,
the landscape contains numerous local minimizers that correspond to natural
images. Building on these insights, we provide a theoretical analysis of the
blind deblurring posterior. This reveals that the MAP estimator tends to
produce sharp filters (close to the Dirac delta function) and blurry solutions.
However local minimizers of the posterior, which can be obtained with gradient
descent, correspond to realistic, natural images, effectively solving the blind
deconvolution problem. Our findings suggest that overcoming MAP's limitations
requires good local initialization to local minima in the posterior landscape.
We validate our analysis with numerical experiments, demonstrating the
practical implications of our insights for designing improved priors and
optimization techniques.

Conclusion: 建议使用预训练并避免过小模型，因其在域外条件下表现脆弱。

Abstract: Many real-world applications require recognition models that are robust to
different operational conditions and modalities, but at the same time run on
small embedded devices, with limited hardware. While for normal size models,
pre-training is known to be very beneficial in accuracy and robustness, for
small models, that can be employed for embedded and edge devices, its effect is
not clear. In this work, we investigate the effect of ImageNet pretraining on
increasingly small backbone architectures (ultra-small models, with $<$1M
parameters) with respect to robustness in downstream object detection tasks in
the infrared visual modality. Using scaling laws derived from standard object
recognition architectures, we construct two ultra-small backbone families and
systematically study their performance. Our experiments on three different
datasets reveal that while ImageNet pre-training is still useful, beyond a
certain capacity threshold, it offers diminishing returns in terms of
out-of-distribution detection robustness. Therefore, we advise practitioners to
still use pre-training and, when possible avoid too small models as while they
might work well for in-domain problems, they are brittle when working
conditions are different.

TL;DR: X-Actor是一种新型音频驱动肖像动画框架，通过单张参考图像和音频生成逼真、情感丰富的说话头视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多关注唇部同步和短时视觉保真度，而X-Actor旨在实现演员级的长时肖像表演，捕捉动态情感变化。

Method: 采用两阶段解耦生成流程：音频条件自回归扩散模型预测面部运动潜在标记，扩散视频合成模块生成高保真动画。

Result: 实验表明X-Actor能生成超越标准说话头动画的表演，在长时音频驱动情感肖像表演中达到最优效果。

Conclusion: X-Actor通过解耦设计和扩散训练范式，实现了长时情感丰富的面部运动预测和高保真视频合成。

Abstract: We present X-Actor, a novel audio-driven portrait animation framework that
generates lifelike, emotionally expressive talking head videos from a single
reference image and an input audio clip. Unlike prior methods that emphasize
lip synchronization and short-range visual fidelity in constrained speaking
scenarios, X-Actor enables actor-quality, long-form portrait performance
capturing nuanced, dynamically evolving emotions that flow coherently with the
rhythm and content of speech. Central to our approach is a two-stage decoupled
generation pipeline: an audio-conditioned autoregressive diffusion model that
predicts expressive yet identity-agnostic facial motion latent tokens within a
long temporal context window, followed by a diffusion-based video synthesis
module that translates these motions into high-fidelity video animations. By
operating in a compact facial motion latent space decoupled from visual and
identity cues, our autoregressive diffusion model effectively captures
long-range correlations between audio and facial dynamics through a
diffusion-forcing training paradigm, enabling infinite-length emotionally-rich
motion prediction without error accumulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that X-Actor produces compelling, cinematic-style performances that go beyond
standard talking head animations and achieves state-of-the-art results in
long-range, audio-driven emotional portrait acting.

*Dawei Zhang,Xiaojie Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于尺度等变性的盲去噪框架，通过HNM和IGM模块提升模型对空间非均匀噪声的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去噪模型在空间非均匀噪声（OOD条件）下泛化能力不足，尺度等变性被提出作为核心归纳偏置以解决这一问题。

Method: 提出包含HNM（稳定特征分布）和IGM（信息调制）的盲去噪框架，利用尺度等变性提升模型适应性。

Result: 模型在合成和真实数据集上均优于现有方法，尤其在空间非均匀噪声下表现突出。

Conclusion: 尺度等变性是提升去噪模型OOD鲁棒性的有效方法，提出的框架具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Despite notable advances in image denoising, existing models often struggle
to generalize beyond in-distribution noise patterns, particularly when
confronted with out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions characterized by spatially
variant noise. This generalization gap remains a fundamental yet underexplored
challenge. In this work, we investigate \emph{scale equivariance} as a core
inductive bias for improving OOD robustness. We argue that incorporating
scale-equivariant structures enables models to better adapt from training on
spatially uniform noise to inference on spatially non-uniform degradations.
Building on this insight, we propose a robust blind denoising framework
equipped with two key components: a Heterogeneous Normalization Module (HNM)
and an Interactive Gating Module (IGM). HNM stabilizes feature distributions
and dynamically corrects features under varying noise intensities, while IGM
facilitates effective information modulation via gated interactions between
signal and feature paths. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our model
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and
real-world benchmarks, especially under spatially heterogeneous noise. Code
will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成高质量图像时，提示的遵从性和质量存在显著差异。负提示虽能改善提示遵从性，但需要外部资源且不完整。

Method: 提出ANSWER方法，利用扩散模型对否定的内部理解，结合CFG，从单一提示中同时满足正负条件。

Result: ANSWER在多个基准测试中优于基线方法，人类评价显示其受欢迎度是其他方法的2倍。

Conclusion: ANSWER是一种通用且高效的训练免费技术，显著提升了扩散模型生成图像的提示遵从性。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated an unparalleled ability to create
diverse and high-fidelity images from text prompts. However, they are also
well-known to vary substantially regarding both prompt adherence and quality.
Negative prompting was introduced to improve prompt compliance by specifying
what an image must not contain. Previous works have shown the existence of an
ideal negative prompt that can maximize the odds of the positive prompt. In
this work, we explore relations between negative prompting and classifier-free
guidance (CFG) to develop a sampling procedure, {\it Adaptive Negative Sampling
Without External Resources} (ANSWER), that accounts for both positive and
negative conditions from a single prompt. This leverages the internal
understanding of negation by the diffusion model to increase the odds of
generating images faithful to the prompt. ANSWER is a training-free technique,
applicable to any model that supports CFG, and allows for negative grounding of
image concepts without an explicit negative prompts, which are lossy and
incomplete. Experiments show that adding ANSWER to existing DMs outperforms the
baselines on multiple benchmarks and is preferred by humans 2x more over the
other methods.

Abstract: Existing architectures of multi-domain learning have two types of adapters:
shared LoRA for all domains and domain-specific LoRA for each particular
domain. However, it remains unclear whether this structure effectively captures
domain-specific information. In this paper, we propose a method that ensures
that shared and domain-specific LoRAs exist in different subspaces;
specifically, the column and left null subspaces of the pre-trained weights. We
apply the proposed method to action recognition with three datasets (UCF101,

with the analysis of the dimensions of LoRA weights.

TL;DR: AFOG是一种针对目标检测变换器的对抗性攻击方法，通过注意力机制聚焦于脆弱区域，提升攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗性扰动方法对基于变换器的检测器效果有限，AFOG旨在填补这一空白。

Method: AFOG结合可学习注意力机制和特征损失，迭代注入对抗性扰动。

Result: AFOG在12个大型检测变换器上表现优异，攻击效果提升83%，速度快且隐蔽。

Conclusion: AFOG是一种高效、隐蔽且通用的对抗性攻击方法，适用于多种检测器。

Abstract: Adversarial perturbations are useful tools for exposing vulnerabilities in
neural networks. Existing adversarial perturbation methods for object detection
are either limited to attacking CNN-based detectors or weak against
transformer-based detectors. This paper presents an Attention-Focused Offensive
Gradient (AFOG) attack against object detection transformers. By design, AFOG
is neural-architecture agnostic and effective for attacking both large
transformer-based object detectors and conventional CNN-based detectors with a
unified adversarial attention framework. This paper makes three original
contributions. First, AFOG utilizes a learnable attention mechanism that
focuses perturbations on vulnerable image regions in multi-box detection tasks,
increasing performance over non-attention baselines by up to 30.6%. Second,
AFOG's attack loss is formulated by integrating two types of feature loss
through learnable attention updates with iterative injection of adversarial
perturbations. Finally, AFOG is an efficient and stealthy adversarial
perturbation method. It probes the weak spots of detection transformers by
adding strategically generated and visually imperceptible perturbations which
can cause well-trained object detection models to fail. Extensive experiments
conducted with twelve large detection transformers on COCO demonstrate the
efficacy of AFOG. Our empirical results also show that AFOG outperforms
existing attacks on transformer-based and CNN-based object detectors by up to
83% with superior speed and imperceptibility. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的生成过程中检测NSFW内容的方法（IGD），利用预测噪声作为信号，实验显示其检测准确率优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型生成高质量图像的同时可能被滥用生成NSFW内容，现有方法主要关注生成前或生成后的检测，而生成过程中的检测尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出In-Generation Detection（IGD），利用扩散过程中预测的噪声作为内部信号来识别NSFW内容。

Result: 在七类NSFW内容上，IGD的平均检测准确率为91.32%，优于七种基线方法。

Conclusion: IGD是一种简单有效的生成过程中检测NSFW内容的方法，尤其在对抗性提示下表现优异。

Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models enable high-quality image
generation but also pose significant risks of misuse, particularly in producing
not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content. While prior detection methods have focused on
filtering prompts before generation or moderating images afterward, the
in-generation phase of diffusion models remains largely unexplored for NSFW
detection. In this paper, we introduce In-Generation Detection (IGD), a simple
yet effective approach that leverages the predicted noise during the diffusion
process as an internal signal to identify NSFW content. This approach is
motivated by preliminary findings suggesting that the predicted noise may
capture semantic cues that differentiate NSFW from benign prompts, even when
the prompts are adversarially crafted. Experiments conducted on seven NSFW
categories show that IGD achieves an average detection accuracy of 91.32% over
naive and adversarial NSFW prompts, outperforming seven baseline methods.

Motivation: 现有方法在域泛化语义分割中主要关注全局特征微调，而忽略了跨特征层次的分层适配，这对密集预测任务至关重要。

Method: MGFC框架通过粗到细的特征校准，依次调整粗粒度、中粒度和细粒度特征，以增强模型在域偏移下的鲁棒性。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，MGFC优于现有方法，验证了多粒度适配的有效性。

Conclusion: MGFC通过分层和粒度感知的特征校准，成功将视觉基础模型的泛化能力迁移到域泛化语义分割任务中。

Abstract: Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) aims to improve the
generalization ability of models across unseen domains without access to target
data during training. Recent advances in DGSS have increasingly exploited
vision foundation models (VFMs) via parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies.
However, most existing approaches concentrate on global feature fine-tuning,
while overlooking hierarchical adaptation across feature levels, which is
crucial for precise dense prediction. In this paper, we propose
Multi-Granularity Feature Calibration (MGFC), a novel framework that performs
coarse-to-fine alignment of VFM features to enhance robustness under domain
shifts. Specifically, MGFC first calibrates coarse-grained features to capture
global contextual semantics and scene-level structure. Then, it refines
medium-grained features by promoting category-level feature discriminability.
Finally, fine-grained features are calibrated through high-frequency spatial
detail enhancement. By performing hierarchical and granularity-aware
calibration, MGFC effectively transfers the generalization strengths of VFMs to
the domain-specific task of DGSS. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art DGSS approaches,
highlighting the effectiveness of multi-granularity adaptation for the semantic
segmentation task of domain generalization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的视频问答任务SceneQA，强调场景细节感知与推理能力，并开发了LVSQA数据集。引入SLFG方法，通过将帧组合成语义连贯的场景帧，提升多模态大语言模型在长视频中的理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在长视频理解中表现不佳，主要因资源限制无法处理所有帧信息，且现有框架与任务不符合实际需求。

Method: 提出SLFG方法，结合场景定位与动态帧重组机制，将帧组合成语义连贯的场景帧。

Result: SLFG在多个长视频基准测试中表现优异，且无需修改原模型架构。

Conclusion: SLFG方法显著提升了多模态大语言模型在长视频中的理解能力，具有即插即用性。

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often perform poorly in long
video understanding, primarily due to resource limitations that prevent them
from processing all video frames and their associated information. Efficiently
extracting relevant information becomes a challenging task. Existing frameworks
and evaluation tasks focus on identifying specific frames containing core
objects from a large number of irrelevant frames, which does not align with the
practical needs of real-world applications. To address this issue, we propose a
new scenario under the video question-answering task, SceneQA, which emphasizes
scene-based detail perception and reasoning abilities. And we develop the LVSQA
dataset to support the SceneQA task, which is built upon carefully selected
videos from LVBench and contains a new collection of question-answer pairs to
promote a more fair evaluation of MLLMs' scene perception abilities in long
videos. Inspired by human cognition, we introduce a novel method called SLFG.
The core idea of SLFG is to combine individual frames into semantically
coherent scene frames. By leveraging scene localization methods and dynamic
frame reassembly mechanisms, SLFG significantly enhances the understanding
capabilities of existing MLLMs in long videos. SLFG requires no modification to
the original model architecture and boasts excellent plug-and-play usability.
Experimental results show that this method performs exceptionally well in
several long video benchmark tests. Code and dataset will be released at
http://www.slfg.pkuzwh.cn.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以识别场景中真正不重要的高斯点，导致压缩质量和渲染性能下降。

Method: SA-3DGS学习重要性评分以自动识别不重要的高斯点，结合重要性感知聚类和代码本修复模块优化压缩。

Result: 实验显示，该方法实现了高达66倍的压缩，同时保持或提升渲染质量。

Conclusion: SA-3DGS在压缩和性能上表现优异，并具有强泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting have enhanced efficient and
high-quality novel view synthesis. However, representing scenes requires a
large number of Gaussian points, leading to high storage demands and limiting
practical deployment. The latest methods facilitate the compression of Gaussian
models but struggle to identify truly insignificant Gaussian points in the
scene, leading to a decline in subsequent Gaussian pruning, compression
quality, and rendering performance. To address this issue, we propose SA-3DGS,
a method that significantly reduces storage costs while maintaining rendering
quality. SA-3DGS learns an importance score to automatically identify the least
significant Gaussians in scene reconstruction, thereby enabling effective
pruning and redundancy reduction. Next, the importance-aware clustering module
compresses Gaussians attributes more accurately into the codebook, improving
the codebook's expressive capability while reducing model size. Finally, the
codebook repair module leverages contextual scene information to repair the
codebook, thereby recovering the original Gaussian point attributes and
mitigating the degradation in rendering quality caused by information loss.
Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our method
achieves up to 66x compression while maintaining or even improving rendering
quality. The proposed Gaussian pruning approach is not only adaptable to but
also improves other pruning-based methods (e.g., LightGaussian), showcasing
excellent performance and strong generalization ability.

Conclusion: MoCA通过改进的架构和损失函数，显著提升了文本到视频生成中的身份一致性。

Abstract: Achieving ID-preserving text-to-video (T2V) generation remains challenging
despite recent advances in diffusion-based models. Existing approaches often
fail to capture fine-grained facial dynamics or maintain temporal identity
coherence. To address these limitations, we propose MoCA, a novel Video
Diffusion Model built on a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone, incorporating
a Mixture of Cross-Attention mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts
paradigm. Our framework improves inter-frame identity consistency by embedding
MoCA layers into each DiT block, where Hierarchical Temporal Pooling captures
identity features over varying timescales, and Temporal-Aware Cross-Attention
Experts dynamically model spatiotemporal relationships. We further incorporate
a Latent Video Perceptual Loss to enhance identity coherence and fine-grained
details across video frames. To train this model, we collect CelebIPVid, a
dataset of 10,000 high-resolution videos from 1,000 diverse individuals,
promoting cross-ethnicity generalization. Extensive experiments on CelebIPVid
show that MoCA outperforms existing T2V methods by over 5% across Face
similarity.

Abstract: Cross-video question answering presents significant challenges beyond
traditional single-video understanding, particularly in establishing meaningful
connections across video streams and managing the complexity of multi-source
information retrieval. We introduce VideoForest, a novel framework that
addresses these challenges through person-anchored hierarchical reasoning. Our
approach leverages person-level features as natural bridge points between
videos, enabling effective cross-video understanding without requiring
end-to-end training. VideoForest integrates three key innovations: 1) a
human-anchored feature extraction mechanism that employs ReID and tracking
algorithms to establish robust spatiotemporal relationships across multiple
video sources; 2) a multi-granularity spanning tree structure that
hierarchically organizes visual content around person-level trajectories; and
3) a multi-agent reasoning framework that efficiently traverses this
hierarchical structure to answer complex cross-video queries. To evaluate our
approach, we develop CrossVideoQA, a comprehensive benchmark dataset
specifically designed for person-centric cross-video analysis. Experimental
results demonstrate VideoForest's superior performance in cross-video reasoning
tasks, achieving 71.93% accuracy in person recognition, 83.75% in behavior
analysis, and 51.67% in summarization and reasoning, significantly
outperforming existing methods. Our work establishes a new paradigm for
cross-video understanding by unifying multiple video streams through
person-level features, enabling sophisticated reasoning across distributed
visual information while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Existing studies on talking video generation have predominantly focused on
single-person monologues or isolated facial animations, limiting their
applicability to realistic multi-human interactions. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MIT, a large-scale dataset specifically designed for multi-human
talking video generation. To this end, we develop an automatic pipeline that
collects and annotates multi-person conversational videos. The resulting
dataset comprises 12 hours of high-resolution footage, each featuring two to
four speakers, with fine-grained annotations of body poses and speech
interactions. It captures natural conversational dynamics in multi-speaker
scenario, offering a rich resource for studying interactive visual behaviors.
To demonstrate the potential of MIT, we furthur propose CovOG, a baseline model
for this novel task. It integrates a Multi-Human Pose Encoder (MPE) to handle
varying numbers of speakers by aggregating individual pose embeddings, and an
Interactive Audio Driver (IAD) to modulate head dynamics based on
speaker-specific audio features. Together, these components showcase the
feasibility and challenges of generating realistic multi-human talking videos,
establishing MIT as a valuable benchmark for future research. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面部滤镜在遮挡情况下性能下降，现有方法依赖辅助输入（如trimap或分割掩码），限制了实时应用。

Method: 提出FaceMat框架，采用两阶段训练：教师模型预测alpha遮罩和像素级不确定性，学生模型通过自适应知识蒸馏学习。

Result: FaceMat在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，提升了真实视频场景中的视觉质量和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FaceMat无需辅助输入，适用于实时应用，并通过新数据集CelebAMat支持遮挡感知的面部遮罩任务。

Abstract: Face filters have become a key element of short-form video content, enabling
a wide array of visual effects such as stylization and face swapping. However,
their performance often degrades in the presence of occlusions, where objects
like hands, hair, or accessories obscure the face. To address this limitation,
we introduce the novel task of face matting, which estimates fine-grained alpha
mattes to separate occluding elements from facial regions. We further present
FaceMat, a trimap-free, uncertainty-aware framework that predicts high-quality
alpha mattes under complex occlusions. Our approach leverages a two-stage
training pipeline: a teacher model is trained to jointly estimate alpha mattes
and per-pixel uncertainty using a negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss, and this
uncertainty is then used to guide the student model through spatially adaptive
knowledge distillation. This formulation enables the student to focus on
ambiguous or occluded regions, improving generalization and preserving semantic
consistency. Unlike previous approaches that rely on trimaps or segmentation
masks, our framework requires no auxiliary inputs making it well-suited for
real-time applications. In addition, we reformulate the matting objective by
explicitly treating skin as foreground and occlusions as background, enabling
clearer compositing strategies. To support this task, we newly constructed
CelebAMat, a large-scale synthetic dataset specifically designed for
occlusion-aware face matting. Extensive experiments show that FaceMat
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, enhancing the
visual quality and robustness of face filters in real-world, unconstrained
video scenarios. The source code and CelebAMat dataset are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过显式特征对齐实现模态同质化，但削弱了各模态的独特优势和互补性。

Method: 提出CHARM框架，包含Mutual Perception Unit（MPU）实现隐式对齐，以及双路径优化策略（CoL和InE）。

Result: 在多个数据集和骨干网络上，CHARM显著优于基线，尤其在脆弱模态上表现突出。

Conclusion: CHARM将重点从同质化转向协同优化，实现了多模态互补的多样性和谐。

Abstract: Modality-agnostic Semantic Segmentation (MaSS) aims to achieve robust scene
understanding across arbitrary combinations of input modality. Existing methods
typically rely on explicit feature alignment to achieve modal homogenization,
which dilutes the distinctive strengths of each modality and destroys their
inherent complementarity. To achieve cooperative harmonization rather than
homogenization, we propose CHARM, a novel complementary learning framework
designed to implicitly align content while preserving modality-specific
advantages through two components: (1) Mutual Perception Unit (MPU), enabling
implicit alignment through window-based cross-modal interaction, where
modalities serve as both queries and contexts for each other to discover
modality-interactive correspondences; (2) A dual-path optimization strategy
that decouples training into Collaborative Learning Strategy (CoL) for
complementary fusion learning and Individual Enhancement Strategy (InE) for
protected modality-specific optimization. Experiments across multiple datasets
and backbones indicate that CHARM consistently outperform the baselines, with
significant increment on the fragile modalities. This work shifts the focus
from model homogenization to harmonization, enabling cross-modal
complementarity for true harmony in diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无监督域自适应（UDA）在行人重识别（ReID）中因图像特征差异和多伪标签模糊性带来的挑战。

Method: 使用CycleGAN生成数据，师生网络结合多级聚类生成伪标签，引入集成融合组件优化全局和局部特征。

Abstract: This study introduces a novel framework, "Comprehensive Optimization and
Refinement through Ensemble Fusion in Domain Adaptation for Person
Re-identification (CORE-ReID)", to address an Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
(UDA) for Person Re-identification (ReID). The framework utilizes CycleGAN to
generate diverse data that harmonizes differences in image characteristics from
different camera sources in the pre-training stage. In the fine-tuning stage,
based on a pair of teacher-student networks, the framework integrates
multi-view features for multi-level clustering to derive diverse pseudo labels.
A learnable Ensemble Fusion component that focuses on fine-grained local
information within global features is introduced to enhance learning
comprehensiveness and avoid ambiguity associated with multiple pseudo-labels.
Experimental results on three common UDAs in Person ReID demonstrate
significant performance gains over state-of-the-art approaches. Additional
enhancements, such as Efficient Channel Attention Block and Bidirectional Mean
Feature Normalization mitigate deviation effects and adaptive fusion of global
and local features using the ResNet-based model, further strengthening the
framework. The proposed framework ensures clarity in fusion features, avoids
ambiguity, and achieves high ac-curacy in terms of Mean Average Precision,
Top-1, Top-5, and Top-10, positioning it as an advanced and effective solution
for the UDA in Person ReID. Our codes and models are available at

TL;DR: SSFMamba是一种基于Mamba的对称驱动空间-频率特征融合网络，用于3D医学图像分割，通过双分支架构和Mamba块融合空间和频率域特征，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在3D医学图像分割中未能充分利用频率域信息的独特性质（如共轭对称性）及其与空间域数据的分布差异，导致全局上下文建模不足。

Method: 提出SSFMamba，采用双分支架构分别提取空间和频率域特征，利用Mamba块融合异构特征，并结合3D多方向扫描机制增强局部与全局线索融合。

Result: 在BraTS2020和BraTS2023数据集上的实验表明，SSFMamba在多项评估指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SSFMamba通过有效融合空间和频率域特征，显著提升了3D医学图像分割的性能，证明了频率域信息在全局建模中的重要性。

Abstract: In light of the spatial domain's limited capacity for modeling global context
in 3D medical image segmentation, emerging approaches have begun to incorporate
frequency domain representations. However, straightforward feature extraction
strategies often overlook the unique properties of frequency domain
information, such as conjugate symmetry. They also fail to account for the
fundamental differences in data distribution between the spatial and frequency
domains, which can ultimately dilute or obscure the complementary strengths
that frequency-based representations offer. In this paper, we propose SSFMamba,
a Mamba based Symmetry-driven Spatial-Frequency feature fusion network for 3D
medical image segmentation. SSFMamba employs a complementary dual-branch
architecture that extracts features from both the spatial and frequency
domains, and leverages a Mamba block to fuse these heterogeneous features to
preserve global context while reinforcing local details. In the frequency
domain branch, we harness Mamba's exceptional capability to extract global
contextual information in conjunction with the synergistic effect of frequency
domain features to further enhance global modeling. Moreover, we design a 3D
multi-directional scanning mechanism to strengthen the fusion of local and
global cues. Extensive experiments on the BraTS2020 and BraTS2023 datasets
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: 提出RobustGS模块，提升3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）在恶劣成像条件下的鲁棒性，实现高质量3D重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有前馈3DGS方法假设输入多视图图像干净高质量，但实际场景中图像常受噪声、低光或雨等影响，导致重建质量下降。

Method: 引入通用退化学习器和语义感知状态空间模型，增强退化感知能力并聚合语义相似信息。

Result: 实验表明，RobustGS模块以即插即用方式集成现有方法，在各种退化条件下均实现最优重建质量。

Conclusion: RobustGS显著提升了前馈3DGS在恶劣成像条件下的鲁棒性和重建质量。

Abstract: Feedforward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) overcomes the limitations of
optimization-based 3DGS by enabling fast and high-quality reconstruction
without the need for per-scene optimization. However, existing feedforward
approaches typically assume that input multi-view images are clean and
high-quality. In real-world scenarios, images are often captured under
challenging conditions such as noise, low light, or rain, resulting in
inaccurate geometry and degraded 3D reconstruction. To address these
challenges, we propose a general and efficient multi-view feature enhancement
module, RobustGS, which substantially improves the robustness of feedforward
3DGS methods under various adverse imaging conditions, enabling high-quality 3D
reconstruction. The RobustGS module can be seamlessly integrated into existing
pretrained pipelines in a plug-and-play manner to enhance reconstruction
robustness. Specifically, we introduce a novel component, Generalized
Degradation Learner, designed to extract generic representations and
distributions of multiple degradations from multi-view inputs, thereby
enhancing degradation-awareness and improving the overall quality of 3D
reconstruction. In addition, we propose a novel semantic-aware state-space
model. It first leverages the extracted degradation representations to enhance
corrupted inputs in the feature space. Then, it employs a semantic-aware
strategy to aggregate semantically similar information across different views,
enabling the extraction of fine-grained cross-view correspondences and further
improving the quality of 3D representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach, when integrated into existing methods in a plug-and-play
manner, consistently achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across
various types of degradations.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注人口统计属性（如种族、性别），而更广泛的属性公平性尚未充分探索。

Method: 利用大型语言模型（LLMs）构建开放集偏见属性知识库，评估LVLMs在细粒度属性上的公平性。

Result: LVLMs在多种属性上表现出偏见，且文化、环境、行为因素对决策的影响比传统人口统计属性更显著。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LVLMs的广泛偏见问题，强调了非人口统计因素的重要性，为未来公平性研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of applications using Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs), such as GPT-4o, has raised significant concerns about their fairness.
While existing studies primarily focus on demographic attributes such as race
and gender, fairness across a broader range of attributes remains largely
unexplored. In this study, we construct an open-set knowledge base of bias
attributes leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and evaluate the fairness of
LVLMs across finer-grained attributes. Our experimental results reveal that
LVLMs exhibit biased outputs across a diverse set of attributes and further
demonstrate that cultural, environmental, and behavioral factors have a more
pronounced impact on LVLM decision-making than traditional demographic
attributes.

Motivation: 现有伪袋增强方法因采样实例来源有限导致多样性不足，且引入新实例可能增加关键实例数量，影响模型在肿瘤区域较小的测试切片上的表现。

Method: 提出$C^2Aug$方法，从所有同类袋中采样实例；引入袋级和组级对比学习框架，增强特征区分能力。

Result: 实验表明$C^2Aug$在多个评估指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: $C^2Aug$通过增加伪袋多样性和对比学习框架，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Recent pseudo-bag augmentation methods for Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL)-based Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification sample instances from a
limited number of bags, resulting in constrained diversity. To address this
issue, we propose Contrastive Cross-Bag Augmentation ($C^2Aug$) to sample
instances from all bags with the same class to increase the diversity of
pseudo-bags. However, introducing new instances into the pseudo-bag increases
the number of critical instances (e.g., tumor instances). This increase results
in a reduced occurrence of pseudo-bags containing few critical instances,
thereby limiting model performance, particularly on test slides with small
tumor areas. To address this, we introduce a bag-level and group-level
contrastive learning framework to enhance the discrimination of features with
distinct semantic meanings, thereby improving model performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that $C^2Aug$ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches across multiple evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分类系统需要适应动态变化的临床环境，现有方法仅依赖简单的文本模板，忽略了更丰富的语义信息。

Method: 动态构建视觉概念池，使用相似性过滤机制避免冗余，通过跨模态图像-概念注意力模块和注意力损失整合语义知识。

Result: 在医学和自然图像数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效且优越，代码将公开。

Abstract: Continual learning is essential for medical image classification systems to
adapt to dynamically evolving clinical environments. The integration of
multimodal information can significantly enhance continual learning of image
classes. However, while existing approaches do utilize textual modality
information, they solely rely on simplistic templates with a class name,
thereby neglecting richer semantic information. To address these limitations,
we propose a novel framework that harnesses visual concepts generated by large
language models (LLMs) as discriminative semantic guidance. Our method
dynamically constructs a visual concept pool with a similarity-based filtering
mechanism to prevent redundancy. Then, to integrate the concepts into the
continual learning process, we employ a cross-modal image-concept attention
module, coupled with an attention loss. Through attention, the module can
leverage the semantic knowledge from relevant visual concepts and produce
class-representative fused features for classification. Experiments on medical
and natural image datasets show our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of our method. We
will release the code publicly.

TL;DR: AVATAR框架通过离策略训练和时序优势塑造解决了多模态视频推理中的数据效率、优势消失和信用分配问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法（如GRPO）在数据效率、优势消失和信用分配方面的不足。

Method: 采用离策略训练架构提高样本效率，并引入时序优势塑造（TAS）策略优化信用分配。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，性能提升显著（如MMVU +5.4），样本效率提高35%以上。

Conclusion: AVATAR通过创新方法有效解决了多模态视频推理中的关键问题，性能显著优于基线。

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning over long-horizon video is challenging due to the need
for precise spatiotemporal fusion and alignment across modalities. While recent
methods such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have shown promise in
this domain, they suffer from three key limitations: (1) data inefficiency from
their on-policy design, (2) a vanishing advantage problem, where identical or
near-identical rewards within a group eliminate the learning signal by
producing zero-valued advantages, and (3) uniform credit assignment that fails
to emphasize critical reasoning steps. We introduce AVATAR (Audio-Video Agent
for Alignment and Reasoning), a framework that addresses these limitations
through two core components: (1) an off-policy training architecture that
improves sample efficiency and resolves vanishing advantages by reusing past
experiences with greater reward diversity, and (2) Temporal Advantage Shaping
(TAS), a novel credit assignment strategy that upweights key reasoning phases
during learning. AVATAR achieves strong performance across various benchmarks,
outperforming the Qwen2.5-Omni baseline by +5.4on MMVU, +4.9 on OmniBench, and
+4.5 on Video-Holmes, while demonstrating over 35% higher sample efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Causal CLIP Adapter (CCA)的新框架，通过无监督独立成分分析(ICA)显式解耦CLIP提取的视觉特征，减少可训练参数并避免过拟合，同时利用CLIP的跨模态对齐提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有少样本学习(FSL)方法依赖纠缠表示，需要模型隐式恢复解混过程，限制了有效适应。基于CLIP的多模态对比学习理论表明其可解耦潜在表示，因此提出CCA框架。

Method: CCA通过ICA显式解耦CLIP视觉特征，减少训练参数；同时通过单向（微调文本分类器）和双向（跨注意力机制）增强CLIP的跨模态对齐，结合单模态和跨模态分类输出提升准确性。

Result: 在11个基准数据集上的实验表明，CCA在少样本性能和分布偏移鲁棒性上均优于现有方法，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: CCA通过显式解耦和跨模态对齐增强，显著提升了少样本学习的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) often requires effective adaptation of models using
limited labeled data. However, most existing FSL methods rely on entangled
representations, requiring the model to implicitly recover the unmixing process
to obtain disentangled representations using only limited supervision, which
hinders effective adaptation. Recent theoretical studies show that multimodal
contrastive learning methods, such as CLIP, can disentangle latent
representations up to linear transformations. In light of this, we propose the
Causal CLIP Adapter (CCA), a novel framework that explicitly disentangles
visual features extracted from CLIP using unsupervised Independent Component
Analysis (ICA). This removes the need to learn the unmixing process from the
labeled data, thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters and
mitigating overfitting. Taking a step further, while ICA can obtain visual
disentangled representations, it may also disrupt CLIP's intra- and inter-modal
alignment. To counteract this, CCA further leverages CLIP's inherent
cross-modal alignment by enhancing it in two ways: unidirectionally, through
fine-tuning a CLIP-based text classifier, and bidirectionally, via a
cross-attention mechanism that enriches visual and textual representations
through mutual interaction. Both unimodal and cross-modal classification
outputs can be effectively combined linearly to improve classification
accuracy. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of
few-shot performance and robustness to distributional shifts, while maintaining
computational efficiency. Code will be available at

Motivation: 现有方法在3D重建中存在几何精度与鲁棒性的权衡问题，显式方法在模糊区域表现不佳，隐式方法收敛慢。

Method: H3R结合了体积潜在融合和基于注意力的特征聚合，包括几何一致的潜在体积和相机感知的Transformer。

Result: H3R在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能，PSNR显著提升，收敛速度快2倍。

Conclusion: H3R通过混合框架有效解决了3D重建中的关键问题，展示了强大的跨数据集泛化能力。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting, generalizable
3D reconstruction remains challenging, particularly in multi-view
correspondence modeling. Existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off:
explicit methods achieve geometric precision but struggle with ambiguous
regions, while implicit methods provide robustness but suffer from slow
convergence. We present H3R, a hybrid framework that addresses this limitation
by integrating volumetric latent fusion with attention-based feature
aggregation. Our framework consists of two complementary components: an
efficient latent volume that enforces geometric consistency through epipolar
constraints, and a camera-aware Transformer that leverages Pl\"ucker
coordinates for adaptive correspondence refinement. By integrating both
paradigms, our approach enhances generalization while converging 2$\times$
faster than existing methods. Furthermore, we show that spatial-aligned
foundation models (e.g., SD-VAE) substantially outperform semantic-aligned
models (e.g., DINOv2), resolving the mismatch between semantic representations
and spatial reconstruction requirements. Our method supports variable-number
and high-resolution input views while demonstrating robust cross-dataset
generalization. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, with significant PSNR
improvements of 0.59 dB, 1.06 dB, and 0.22 dB on the RealEstate10K, ACID, and
DTU datasets, respectively. Code is available at

Result: 现成模型表现不佳，但微调Qwen2.5-VL-7B后，性能显著提升（SPIDEr从0.11到0.31，VQA准确率从0.74到0.87）。

Conclusion: Landsat30-AU为卫星图像语言模型提供了新基准，微调方法展示了改进潜力。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) that enable natural language interaction with
satellite imagery can democratize Earth observation by accelerating expert
workflows, making data accessible to non-specialists, and enabling planet-scale
automation. However, existing datasets focus mainly on short-term,
high-resolution imagery from a limited number of satellites, overlooking
low-resolution, multi-satellite, long-term archives, such as Landsat, that are
essential for affordable and bias-robust global monitoring. We address this gap
with Landsat30-AU, a large-scale vision-language dataset built from 30-meter
resolution imagery collected by four Landsat satellites (5, 7, 8, and 9) over
Australia, spanning more than 36 years. The dataset includes two components:
Landsat30-AU-Cap, containing 196,262 image-caption pairs, and Landsat30-AU-VQA,
comprising 17,725 human-verified visual question answering (VQA) samples across
eight remote sensing domains. Both datasets are curated through a bootstrapped
pipeline that leverages generic VLMs with iterative refinement and human
verification to ensure quality. Our evaluation of eight VLMs on our benchmark
reveals that off-the-shelf models struggle to understand satellite imagery. The
open-source remote-sensing VLM EarthDial achieves only 0.07 SPIDEr in
captioning and a VQA accuracy of 0.48, highlighting the limitations of current
approaches. Encouragingly, lightweight fine-tuning of Qwen2.5-VL-7B on
Landsat30-AU improves captioning performance from 0.11 to 0.31 SPIDEr and
boosts VQA accuracy from \textbf{0.74} to 0.87. Code and data are available at

Result: COFFEE在合成数据和Apophis小行星渲染数据上表现优于传统方法，速度快且无偏。

Abstract: The accurate state estimation of unknown bodies in space is a critical
challenge with applications ranging from the tracking of space debris to the
shape estimation of small bodies. A necessary enabler to this capability is to
find and track features on a continuous stream of images. Existing methods,
such as SIFT, ORB and AKAZE, achieve real-time but inaccurate pose estimates,
whereas modern deep learning methods yield higher quality features at the cost
of more demanding computational resources which might not be available on
space-qualified hardware. Additionally, both classical and data-driven methods
are not robust to the highly opaque self-cast shadows on the object of
interest. We show that, as the target body rotates, these shadows may lead to
large biases in the resulting pose estimates. For these objects, a bias in the
real-time pose estimation algorithm may mislead the spacecraft's state
estimator and cause a mission failure, especially if the body undergoes a
chaotic tumbling motion. We present COFFEE, the Celestial Occlusion Fast
FEature Extractor, a real-time pose estimation framework for asteroids designed
to leverage prior information on the sun phase angle given by sun-tracking
sensors commonly available onboard spacecraft. By associating salient contours
to their projected shadows, a sparse set of features are detected, invariant to
the motion of the shadows. A Sparse Neural Network followed by an
attention-based Graph Neural Network feature matching model are then jointly
trained to provide a set of correspondences between successive frames. The
resulting pose estimation pipeline is found to be bias-free, more accurate than
classical pose estimation pipelines and an order of magnitude faster than other
state-of-the-art deep learning pipelines on synthetic data as well as on
renderings of the tumbling asteroid Apophis.

Abstract: Fire scene datasets are crucial for training robust computer vision models,
particularly in tasks such as fire early warning and emergency rescue
operations. However, among the currently available fire-related data, there is
a significant shortage of annotated data specifically targeting building
units.To tackle this issue, we introduce an annotated dataset of building units
captured by drones, which incorporates multiple enhancement techniques. We
construct backgrounds using real multi-story scenes, combine motion blur and
brightness adjustment to enhance the authenticity of the captured images,
simulate drone shooting conditions under various circumstances, and employ
large models to generate fire effects at different locations.The synthetic
dataset generated by this method encompasses a wide range of building
scenarios, with a total of 1,978 images. This dataset can effectively improve
the generalization ability of fire unit detection, providing multi-scenario and
scalable data while reducing the risks and costs associated with collecting
real fire data. The dataset is available at

Abstract: In recent years, unified vision-language models (VLMs) have rapidly advanced,
effectively tackling both visual understanding and generation tasks within a
single design. While many unified VLMs have explored various design choices,
the recent hypothesis from OpenAI's GPT-4o suggests a promising generation
pipeline: Understanding VLM->Visual Feature->Projector->Diffusion Model->Image.
The understanding VLM is frozen, and only the generation-related modules are
trained. This pipeline maintains the strong capability of understanding VLM
while enabling the image generation ability of the unified VLM. Although this
pipeline has shown very promising potential for the future development of
unified VLM, how to easily enable image editing capability is still unexplored.
In this paper, we introduce a novel training-free framework named UniEdit-I to
enable the unified VLM with image editing capability via three iterative steps:
understanding, editing, and verifying. 1. The understanding step analyzes the
source image to create a source prompt through structured semantic analysis and
makes minimal word replacements to form the target prompt based on the editing
instruction. 2. The editing step introduces a time-adaptive offset, allowing
for coherent editing from coarse to fine throughout the denoising process. 3.
The verification step checks the alignment between the target prompt and the
intermediate edited image, provides automatic consistency scores and corrective
feedback, and determines whether to stop early or continue the editing loop.
This understanding, editing, and verifying loop iterates until convergence,
delivering high-fidelity editing in a training-free manner. We implemented our
method based on the latest BLIP3-o and achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on the GEdit-Bench benchmark.

complex defect patterns, they often struggle with spatial controllability and
fail to maintain fine-grained regional fidelity. To overcome these limitations,
we propose SARD (Segmentation-Aware anomaly synthesis via Region-constrained
Diffusion with discriminative mask Guidance), a novel diffusion-based framework
specifically designed for anomaly generation. Our approach introduces a
Region-Constrained Diffusion (RCD) process that preserves the background by
freezing it and selectively updating only the foreground anomaly regions during
the reverse denoising phase, thereby effectively reducing background artifacts.
Additionally, we incorporate a Discriminative Mask Guidance (DMG) module into
the discriminator, enabling joint evaluation of both global realism and local
anomaly fidelity, guided by pixel-level masks. Extensive experiments on the
MVTec-AD and BTAD datasets show that SARD surpasses existing methods in
segmentation accuracy and visual quality, setting a new state-of-the-art for
pixel-level anomaly synthesis.

### [45] [LORE: Latent Optimization for Precise Semantic Control in Rectified Flow-based Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03144)
*Liangyang Ouyang,Jiafeng Mao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出LORE方法，通过优化反转噪声解决现有文本驱动图像编辑方法中的语义偏差问题，无需训练或模型调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于反转流的图像编辑方法在源和目标语义差异大时，因语义偏差导致编辑失败或非目标区域修改。

Method: LORE直接优化反转噪声，提升泛化性和可控性，无需架构修改或微调。

Result: 在PIEBench、SmartEdit和GapEdit基准测试中，LORE在语义对齐、图像质量和背景保真度上显著优于基线。

Conclusion: LORE通过潜在空间优化实现了稳定、可控且通用的图像编辑，展示了其有效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Text-driven image editing enables users to flexibly modify visual content
through natural language instructions, and is widely applied to tasks such as
semantic object replacement, insertion, and removal. While recent
inversion-based editing methods using rectified flow models have achieved
promising results in image quality, we identify a structural limitation in
their editing behavior: the semantic bias toward the source concept encoded in
the inverted noise tends to suppress attention to the target concept. This
issue becomes particularly critical when the source and target semantics are
dissimilar, where the attention mechanism inherently leads to editing failure
or unintended modifications in non-target regions. In this paper, we
systematically analyze and validate this structural flaw, and introduce LORE, a
training-free and efficient image editing method. LORE directly optimizes the
inverted noise, addressing the core limitations in generalization and
controllability of existing approaches, enabling stable, controllable, and
general-purpose concept replacement, without requiring architectural
modification or model fine-tuning. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on
three challenging benchmarks: PIEBench, SmartEdit, and GapEdit. Experimental
results show that LORE significantly outperforms strong baselines in terms of
semantic alignment, image quality, and background fidelity, demonstrating the
effectiveness and scalability of latent-space optimization for general-purpose
image editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了ChartCap数据集，解决了现有图表数据集的问题，并引入了一种新的评估指标Visual Consistency Score，实验证明基于ChartCap微调的模型能生成更准确、信息丰富的图表描述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图表数据集存在无关信息过多、未能充分捕捉结构元素和关键见解的问题，导致视觉语言模型难以生成准确且无幻觉的图表描述。

Method: 设计了一个四阶段流程生成仅基于图表可辨识数据的描述，并采用循环一致性人工验证加速质量控制。提出了Visual Consistency Score评估描述质量。

Result: 实验表明，基于ChartCap微调的模型生成的描述更准确、信息丰富，幻觉减少，优于开源、专有模型及人工标注描述。

Conclusion: ChartCap数据集和Visual Consistency Score为生成高质量图表描述提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generating accurate, informative, and hallucination-free captions for charts
remains challenging for vision language models, primarily due to the lack of
large-scale, high-quality datasets of real-world charts. However, existing
real-world chart datasets suffer from the inclusion of extraneous information
that cannot be inferred from the chart and failure to sufficiently capture
structural elements and key insights. Therefore, we introduce ChartCap, a
large-scale dataset of 565K real-world chart images paired with type-specific,
dense captions that exclude extraneous information and highlight both
structural elements and key insights in detail. To build ChartCap, we design a
four-stage pipeline that generates captions using only the discernible data
from the chart and employ a cycle consistency-based human verification, which
accelerates quality control without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, we
propose a novel metric, the Visual Consistency Score, which evaluates caption
quality by measuring the similarity between the chart regenerated from a
caption and the original chart, independent of reference captions. Extensive
experiments confirms that models fine-tuned on ChartCap consistently generate
more accurate and informative captions with reduced hallucinations, surpassing
both open-source and proprietary models and even human-annotated captions.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在处理风格化图像时的幻觉问题，提出了Style-Aware Visual Early Revision（SAVER）机制，显著减少了幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LVLMs在复杂视觉文本理解上取得突破，但幻觉问题限制了其实际应用，尤其是在风格化图像场景中。

Method: 构建了包含摄影图像和风格化图像的数据集，并提出了SAVER机制，通过动态调整模型输出来减少幻觉。

Result: 实验表明，风格化图像比摄影图像更容易引发幻觉，SAVER在多种模型和任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: SAVER有效解决了风格化图像引发的幻觉问题，为LVLMs的实际应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) recently achieve significant
breakthroughs in understanding complex visual-textual contexts. However,
hallucination issues still limit their real-world applicability. Although
previous mitigation methods effectively reduce hallucinations in photographic
images, they largely overlook the potential risks posed by stylized images,
which play crucial roles in critical scenarios such as game scene
understanding, art education, and medical analysis. In this work, we first
construct a dataset comprising photographic images and their corresponding
stylized versions with carefully annotated caption labels. We then conduct
head-to-head comparisons on both discriminative and generative tasks by
benchmarking 13 advanced LVLMs on the collected datasets. Our findings reveal
that stylized images tend to induce significantly more hallucinations than
their photographic counterparts. To address this issue, we propose Style-Aware
Visual Early Revision SAVER, a novel mechanism that dynamically adjusts LVLMs'
final outputs based on the token-level visual attention patterns, leveraging
early-layer feedback to mitigate hallucinations caused by stylized images.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAVER achieves state-of-the-art
performance in hallucination mitigation across various models, datasets, and
tasks.

Motivation: 现有3D高斯泼溅方法依赖计算密集的顺序alpha混合操作，导致资源受限平台上的性能瓶颈。

Method: 提出Duplex-GS框架，结合代理高斯表示和顺序无关渲染技术，引入单元代理和单元搜索光栅化以加速。

Result: 实验显示，该方法在多种场景下表现稳健，渲染速度提升1.5至4倍，排序开销减少52.2%至86.9%。

Conclusion: Duplex-GS验证了顺序无关渲染在高斯泼溅中的优势，实现了高质量渲染和显著性能提升。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated remarkable
rendering fidelity and efficiency. However, these methods still rely on
computationally expensive sequential alpha-blending operations, resulting in
significant overhead, particularly on resource-constrained platforms. In this
paper, we propose Duplex-GS, a dual-hierarchy framework that integrates proxy
Gaussian representations with order-independent rendering techniques to achieve
photorealistic results while sustaining real-time performance. To mitigate the
overhead caused by view-adaptive radix sort, we introduce cell proxies for
local Gaussians management and propose cell search rasterization for further
acceleration. By seamlessly combining our framework with Order-Independent
Transparency (OIT), we develop a physically inspired weighted sum rendering
technique that simultaneously eliminates "popping" and "transparency"
artifacts, yielding substantial improvements in both accuracy and efficiency.
Extensive experiments on a variety of real-world datasets demonstrate the
robustness of our method across diverse scenarios, including multi-scale
training views and large-scale environments. Our results validate the
advantages of the OIT rendering paradigm in Gaussian Splatting, achieving
high-quality rendering with an impressive 1.5 to 4 speedup over existing OIT
based Gaussian Splatting approaches and 52.2% to 86.9% reduction of the radix
sort overhead without quality degradation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合局部和全局线索的单目深度估计方法，通过GLKAM和GBPM模块提升精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目深度估计存在固有的模糊性，需要结合多尺度局部信息和全局分布来提升准确性。

Method: 使用GLKAM模块捕捉多尺度局部结构信息，GBPM模块预测全局深度分布。

Result: 在NYU-V2和KITTI数据集上表现优异，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过局部和全局线索的结合，显著提升了单目深度估计的准确性。

Abstract: Accurate monocular depth estimation remains a challenging problem due to the
inherent ambiguity that stems from the ill-posed nature of recovering 3D
structure from a single view, where multiple plausible depth configurations can
produce identical 2D projections. In this paper, we present a novel depth
estimation method that combines both local and global cues to improve
prediction accuracy. Specifically, we propose the Gated Large Kernel Attention
Module (GLKAM) to effectively capture multi-scale local structural information
by leveraging large kernel convolutions with a gated mechanism. To further
enhance the global perception of the network, we introduce the Global Bin
Prediction Module (GBPM), which estimates the global distribution of depth bins
and provides structural guidance for depth regression. Extensive experiments on
the NYU-V2 and KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive
performance and outperforms existing approaches, validating the effectiveness
of each proposed component.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于KAN的持续人脸伪造检测框架（KAN-CFD），通过改进KAN的局部可塑性和特征分离策略，解决了持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸伪造技术的快速发展要求检测器持续适应新方法，但现有方法在学习新任务时会导致对旧任务的性能快速下降（灾难性遗忘）。KAN因其局部可塑性适合解决这一问题，但存在高维图像建模和特征重叠的局限性。

Method: 提出KAN-CFD框架，包括Domain-Group KAN Detector（DG-KD）和数据无关的特征分离策略FS-KDCP。DG-KD改进KAN以适应高维图像并保持局部可塑性，FS-KDCP避免输入空间重叠。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在减少遗忘的同时实现了优越的性能。

Conclusion: KAN-CFD通过改进KAN的局部可塑性和特征分离策略，有效解决了持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，为人脸伪造检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in face forgery techniques necessitate that detectors
continuously adapt to new forgery methods, thus situating face forgery
detection within a continual learning paradigm. However, when detectors learn
new forgery types, their performance on previous types often degrades rapidly,
a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(KANs) utilize locally plastic splines as their activation functions, enabling
them to learn new tasks by modifying only local regions of the functions while
leaving other areas unaffected. Therefore, they are naturally suitable for
addressing catastrophic forgetting. However, KANs have two significant
limitations: 1) the splines are ineffective for modeling high-dimensional
images, while alternative activation functions that are suitable for images
lack the essential property of locality; 2) in continual learning, when
features from different domains overlap, the mapping of different domains to
distinct curve regions always collapses due to repeated modifications of the
same regions. In this paper, we propose a KAN-based Continual Face Forgery
Detection (KAN-CFD) framework, which includes a Domain-Group KAN Detector
(DG-KD) and a data-free replay Feature Separation strategy via KAN Drift
Compensation Projection (FS-KDCP). DG-KD enables KANs to fit high-dimensional
image inputs while preserving locality and local plasticity. FS-KDCP avoids the
overlap of the KAN input spaces without using data from prior tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior
performance while notably reducing forgetting.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的多边图卷积交互增强的CNV分割网络（MTG-Net），并构建了首个公开的CNV数据集（CNVSeg），用于湿性年龄相关性黄斑变性（wet AMD）的临床评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于CNV形状不规则和成像限制（如投影伪影、噪声和边界模糊），以及缺乏公开数据集，准确分割OCTA图像中的CNV区域和血管具有挑战性。

Method: MTG-Net通过多任务框架和两个基于图的跨任务模块（MIGR和MRGR）整合区域和血管形态信息，利用图机制推理任务间的高阶关系，并提出不确定性加权损失以减少伪影和噪声的影响。

Result: MTG-Net在区域分割和血管分割上的Dice分数分别为87.21%和88.12%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MTG-Net和CNVSeg数据集为CNV分割提供了有效的解决方案，有助于wet AMD的临床评估。

Abstract: Choroidal neovascularization (CNV), a primary characteristic of wet
age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), represents a leading cause of
blindness worldwide. In clinical practice, optical coherence tomography
angiography (OCTA) is commonly used for studying CNV-related pathological
changes, due to its micron-level resolution and non-invasive nature. Thus,
accurate segmentation of CNV regions and vessels in OCTA images is crucial for
clinical assessment of wet AMD. However, challenges existed due to irregular
CNV shapes and imaging limitations like projection artifacts, noises and
boundary blurring. Moreover, the lack of publicly available datasets
constraints the CNV analysis. To address these challenges, this paper
constructs the first publicly accessible CNV dataset (CNVSeg), and proposes a
novel multilateral graph convolutional interaction-enhanced CNV segmentation
network (MTG-Net). This network integrates both region and vessel morphological
information, exploring semantic and geometric duality constraints within the
graph domain. Specifically, MTG-Net consists of a multi-task framework and two
graph-based cross-task modules: Multilateral Interaction Graph Reasoning (MIGR)
and Multilateral Reinforcement Graph Reasoning (MRGR). The multi-task framework
encodes rich geometric features of lesion shapes and surfaces, decoupling the
image into three task-specific feature maps. MIGR and MRGR iteratively reason
about higher-order relationships across tasks through a graph mechanism,
enabling complementary optimization for task-specific objectives. Additionally,
an uncertainty-weighted loss is proposed to mitigate the impact of artifacts
and noise on segmentation accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that
MTG-Net outperforms existing methods, achieving a Dice socre of 87.21\% for
region segmentation and 88.12\% for vessel segmentation.

Motivation: 现有方法在区分文本表达的细微语义差异上表现不足，尤其是类别和属性模糊性导致的干扰。

Method: 提出AlignCAT框架，包含粗粒度对齐模块（利用类别信息和全局上下文）和细粒度对齐模块（利用描述性信息和词级文本特征）。

Result: 在RefCOCO、RefCOCO+和RefCOCOg三个基准测试中表现优于现有弱监督方法。

Conclusion: AlignCAT通过充分利用语言线索，有效过滤未对齐的视觉查询并提升对比学习效率。

Abstract: Weakly supervised visual grounding (VG) aims to locate objects in images
based on text descriptions. Despite significant progress, existing methods lack
strong cross-modal reasoning to distinguish subtle semantic differences in text
expressions due to category-based and attribute-based ambiguity. To address
these challenges, we introduce AlignCAT, a novel query-based semantic matching
framework for weakly supervised VG. To enhance visual-linguistic alignment, we
propose a coarse-grained alignment module that utilizes category information
and global context, effectively mitigating interference from
category-inconsistent objects. Subsequently, a fine-grained alignment module
leverages descriptive information and captures word-level text features to
achieve attribute consistency. By exploiting linguistic cues to their fullest
extent, our proposed AlignCAT progressively filters out misaligned visual
queries and enhances contrastive learning efficiency. Extensive experiments on
three VG benchmarks, namely RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, verify the
superiority of AlignCAT against existing weakly supervised methods on two VG
tasks. Our code is available at: https://github.com/I2-Multimedia-Lab/AlignCAT.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖视觉语言模型，但图像级预训练与细粒度区域级交互检测不匹配，且文本描述编码效果不佳。

Method: 提出交互感知提示生成器和语言模型引导的概念校准，结合负采样策略优化跨模态相似性建模。

Result: 在SWIG-HOI和HICO-DET数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: INP-CC通过动态提示和概念校准有效提升了开放词汇人-物交互检测的性能。

Abstract: Open Vocabulary Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to detect
interactions between humans and objects while generalizing to novel interaction
classes beyond the training set. Current methods often rely on Vision and
Language Models (VLMs) but face challenges due to suboptimal image encoders, as
image-level pre-training does not align well with the fine-grained region-level
interaction detection required for HOI. Additionally, effectively encoding
textual descriptions of visual appearances remains difficult, limiting the
model's ability to capture detailed HOI relationships. To address these issues,
we propose INteraction-aware Prompting with Concept Calibration (INP-CC), an
end-to-end open-vocabulary HOI detector that integrates interaction-aware
prompts and concept calibration. Specifically, we propose an interaction-aware
prompt generator that dynamically generates a compact set of prompts based on
the input scene, enabling selective sharing among similar interactions. This
approach directs the model's attention to key interaction patterns rather than
generic image-level semantics, enhancing HOI detection. Furthermore, we refine
HOI concept representations through language model-guided calibration, which
helps distinguish diverse HOI concepts by investigating visual similarities
across categories. A negative sampling strategy is also employed to improve
inter-modal similarity modeling, enabling the model to better differentiate
visually similar but semantically distinct actions. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that INP-CC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
models on the SWIG-HOI and HICO-DET datasets. Code is available at

TL;DR: FastInit提出了一种快速噪声初始化方法，通过单次前向传播生成高质量视频噪声，显著提升了视频生成的效率和时间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如FreeInit）通过迭代优化噪声提高时间一致性，但计算成本高。FastInit旨在解决这一问题，提供高效且一致的视频生成方案。

Method: FastInit训练了一个视频噪声预测网络（VNPNet），输入随机噪声和文本提示，单次生成优化后的噪声，无需迭代。

Result: 实验表明，FastInit显著提升了视频生成的质量和时间一致性，且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: FastInit为视频生成提供了一种高效实用的解决方案，可直接应用于推理阶段。

Abstract: Video generation has made significant strides with the development of
diffusion models; however, achieving high temporal consistency remains a
challenging task. Recently, FreeInit identified a training-inference gap and
introduced a method to iteratively refine the initial noise during inference.
However, iterative refinement significantly increases the computational cost
associated with video generation. In this paper, we introduce FastInit, a fast
noise initialization method that eliminates the need for iterative refinement.
FastInit learns a Video Noise Prediction Network (VNPNet) that takes random
noise and a text prompt as input, generating refined noise in a single forward
pass. Therefore, FastInit greatly enhances the efficiency of video generation
while achieving high temporal consistency across frames. To train the VNPNet,
we create a large-scale dataset consisting of pairs of text prompts, random
noise, and refined noise. Extensive experiments with various text-to-video
models show that our method consistently improves the quality and temporal
consistency of the generated videos. FastInit not only provides a substantial
improvement in video generation but also offers a practical solution that can
be applied directly during inference. The code and dataset will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型（如GPT-4o）能够从公开共享的图像中推断用户位置，地理隐私面临重大风险。现有对抗性扰动方法在高分辨率图像和低扰动预算下效果不佳，且可能引入无关语义内容。

Method: GeoShield包含三个模块：特征解耦模块分离地理和非地理信息；曝光元素识别模块定位图像中的地理泄露区域；尺度自适应增强模块联合优化全局和局部扰动。

Result: 在挑战性基准测试中，GeoShield在黑盒设置下表现优于现有方法，以最小的视觉或语义质量影响实现强隐私保护。

Conclusion: GeoShield是首个探索对抗性扰动防御高级视觉语言模型地理定位推断的工作，为解决日益增长的隐私问题提供了实用有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as GPT-4o now demonstrate a remarkable
ability to infer users' locations from public shared images, posing a
substantial risk to geoprivacy. Although adversarial perturbations offer a
potential defense, current methods are ill-suited for this scenario: they often
perform poorly on high-resolution images and low perturbation budgets, and may
introduce irrelevant semantic content. To address these limitations, we propose
GeoShield, a novel adversarial framework designed for robust geoprivacy
protection in real-world scenarios. GeoShield comprises three key modules: a
feature disentanglement module that separates geographical and non-geographical
information, an exposure element identification module that pinpoints
geo-revealing regions within an image, and a scale-adaptive enhancement module
that jointly optimizes perturbations at both global and local levels to ensure
effectiveness across resolutions. Extensive experiments on challenging
benchmarks show that GeoShield consistently surpasses prior methods in
black-box settings, achieving strong privacy protection with minimal impact on
visual or semantic quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first to explore
adversarial perturbations for defending against geolocation inference by
advanced VLMs, providing a practical and effective solution to escalating
privacy concerns.

Motivation: 对抗性扰动对深度学习模型构成重大威胁，现有防御方法如对抗训练计算成本高且影响标准性能，数据增强方法则效果有限或训练开销大。因此，开发高效且鲁棒的防御机制至关重要。

Conclusion: UAA为构建鲁棒模型提供了一种实用且高效的途径，其代码已在补充材料中提供。

Abstract: Adversarial perturbations pose a significant threat to deep learning models.
Adversarial Training (AT), the predominant defense method, faces challenges of
high computational costs and a degradation in standard performance. While data
augmentation offers an alternative path, existing techniques either yield
limited robustness gains or incur substantial training overhead. Therefore,
developing a defense mechanism that is both highly efficient and strongly
robust is of paramount importance.In this work, we first conduct a systematic
analysis of existing augmentation techniques, revealing that the synergy among
diverse strategies -- rather than any single method -- is crucial for enhancing
robustness. Based on this insight, we propose the Universal Adversarial
Augmenter (UAA) framework, which is characterized by its plug-and-play nature
and training efficiency. UAA decouples the expensive perturbation generation
process from model training by pre-computing a universal transformation
offline, which is then used to efficiently generate unique adversarial
perturbations for each sample during training.Extensive experiments conducted
on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of UAA. The results
demonstrate that UAA establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for
data-augmentation-based adversarial defense strategies , without requiring the
online generation of adversarial examples during training. This framework
provides a practical and efficient pathway for building robust models,Our code

Conclusion: ActionSink通过自监督的动作流和动态集成技术，显著提升了机器人操作的动作估计精度，为学习型机器人操作提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Language-instructed robot manipulation has garnered significant interest due
to the potential of learning from collected data. While the challenges in
high-level perception and planning are continually addressed along the progress
of general large pre-trained models, the low precision of low-level action
estimation has emerged as the key limiting factor in manipulation performance.
To this end, this paper introduces a novel robot manipulation framework, i.e.,
ActionSink, to pave the way toward precise action estimations in the field of
learning-based robot manipulation. As the name suggests, ActionSink
reformulates the actions of robots as action-caused optical flows from videos,
called "action flow", in a self-supervised manner, which are then used to be
retrieved and integrated to enhance the action estimation. Specifically,
ActionSink incorporates two primary modules. The first module is a
coarse-to-fine action flow matcher, which continuously refines the accuracy of
action flow via iterative retrieval and denoising process. The second module is
a dynamic action flow integrator, which employs a working memory pool that
dynamically and efficiently manages the historical action flows that should be
used to integrate to enhance the current action estimation. In this module, a
multi-layer fusion module is proposed to integrate direct estimation and action
flows from both the current and the working memory, achieving highly accurate
action estimation through a series of estimation-integration processes. Our
ActionSink framework outperformed prior SOTA on the LIBERO benchmark by a 7.9\%
success rate, and obtained nearly an 8\% accuracy gain on the challenging
long-horizon visual task LIBERO-Long.

Abstract: We address the challenge of lifting 2D visual segmentation to 3D in Gaussian
Splatting. Existing methods often suffer from inconsistent 2D masks across
viewpoints and produce noisy segmentation boundaries as they neglect these
semantic cues to refine the learned Gaussians. To overcome this, we introduce
Gaussian Instance Tracing (GIT), which augments the standard Gaussian
representation with an instance weight matrix across input views. Leveraging
the inherent consistency of Gaussians in 3D, we use this matrix to identify and
correct 2D segmentation inconsistencies. Furthermore, since each Gaussian
ideally corresponds to a single object, we propose a GIT-guided adaptive
density control mechanism to split and prune ambiguous Gaussians during
training, resulting in sharper and more coherent 2D and 3D segmentation
boundaries. Experimental results show that our method extracts clean 3D assets
and consistently improves 3D segmentation in both online (e.g., self-prompting)
and offline (e.g., contrastive lifting) settings, enabling applications such as
hierarchical segmentation, object extraction, and scene editing.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉基础模型的零样本分类方法，用于SEM图像中纳米颗粒形态的高效表征，无需大量标注数据和计算资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法需要大量标注数据和计算资源，限制了纳米颗粒研究的普及性。

Method: 结合Segment Anything Model（SAM）和DINOv2进行目标分割和特征嵌入，再通过轻量级分类器实现形态分类。

Result: 该方法在三个数据集上表现优于微调的YOLOv11和ChatGPT o4-mini-high基线，对小数据集和形态变化具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 基础模型为自动化显微镜图像分析提供了高效且易用的替代方案，推动了纳米颗粒研究的发展。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient characterization of nanoparticle morphology in
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images is critical for ensuring product
quality in nanomaterial synthesis and accelerating development. However,
conventional deep learning methods for shape classification require extensive
labeled datasets and computationally demanding training, limiting their
accessibility to the typical nanoparticle practitioner in research and
industrial settings. In this study, we introduce a zero-shot classification
pipeline that leverages two vision foundation models: the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) for object segmentation and DINOv2 for feature embedding. By
combining these models with a lightweight classifier, we achieve high-precision
shape classification across three morphologically diverse nanoparticle datasets
- without the need for extensive parameter fine-tuning. Our methodology
outperforms a fine-tuned YOLOv11 and ChatGPT o4-mini-high baselines,
demonstrating robustness to small datasets, subtle morphological variations,
and domain shifts from natural to scientific imaging. Quantitative clustering
metrics on PCA plots of the DINOv2 features are discussed as a means of
assessing the progress of the chemical synthesis. This work highlights the
potential of foundation models to advance automated microscopy image analysis,
offering an alternative to traditional deep learning pipelines in nanoparticle
research which is both more efficient and more accessible to the user.

TL;DR: 论文提出FFHQ-Makeup数据集，通过改进的化妆迁移方法生成高质量配对的素颜-化妆图像，填补了现有数据集的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有素颜-化妆配对数据集难以获取，且合成方法存在失真或一致性差的问题，亟需高质量数据集支持美容相关研究。

Method: 基于FFHQ数据集，改进化妆迁移方法，分离身份与化妆风格，生成18K身份的90K高质量配对图像。

Result: 构建了FFHQ-Makeup数据集，每个身份配对5种化妆风格，确保身份和表情一致性。

Conclusion: FFHQ-Makeup填补了高质量配对数据集的空白，为美容相关任务提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Paired bare-makeup facial images are essential for a wide range of
beauty-related tasks, such as virtual try-on, facial privacy protection, and
facial aesthetics analysis. However, collecting high-quality paired makeup
datasets remains a significant challenge. Real-world data acquisition is
constrained by the difficulty of collecting large-scale paired images, while
existing synthetic approaches often suffer from limited realism or
inconsistencies between bare and makeup images. Current synthetic methods
typically fall into two categories: warping-based transformations, which often
distort facial geometry and compromise the precision of makeup; and
text-to-image generation, which tends to alter facial identity and expression,
undermining consistency. In this work, we present FFHQ-Makeup, a high-quality
synthetic makeup dataset that pairs each identity with multiple makeup styles
while preserving facial consistency in both identity and expression. Built upon
the diverse FFHQ dataset, our pipeline transfers real-world makeup styles from
existing datasets onto 18K identities by introducing an improved makeup
transfer method that disentangles identity and makeup. Each identity is paired
with 5 different makeup styles, resulting in a total of 90K high-quality
bare-makeup image pairs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work
that focuses specifically on constructing a makeup dataset. We hope that
FFHQ-Makeup fills the gap of lacking high-quality bare-makeup paired datasets
and serves as a valuable resource for future research in beauty-related tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对视觉语言模型（VLMs）的重要性感知后训练量化框架VLMQ，解决了模态差异问题，并在低比特量化下取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Hessian的LLM后训练量化方法在应用于VLMs时性能下降严重，主要原因是模态差异（文本标记有限而视觉标记冗余）。

Method: VLMQ通过优化重要性感知目标生成增强的Hessian矩阵，并利用单次轻量级块级反向传播计算重要性因子，同时保持并行化权重更新的兼容性。

Result: 在8个基准测试中，VLMQ在0.5B~32B规模的VLMs上表现出色，尤其在低比特量化下（如2比特量化下MME-RealWorld任务提升16.45%）。

Conclusion: VLMQ为VLMs的后训练量化提供了高效且有效的解决方案，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as an effective approach for
compressing large models and accelerating their inference without retraining.
While PTQ has been extensively studied in the context of large language models
(LLMs), its applicability to vision-language models (VLMs) remains
underexplored. In this paper, we identify a modality discrepancy (\emph{i.e.},
limited text tokens \emph{vs.} excessive and redundant vision tokens) of VLMs.
However, existing Hessian-based LLM PTQ methods treat all tokens equally during
quantization, resulting in severe performance drops when applied to VLMs.
Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel importance-aware PTQ
framework tailored for VLMs, dubbed VLMQ. Specifically, to address vision token
redundancy, VLMQ 1) optimizes an importance-aware objective that yields an
enhanced Hessian with token-level importance factors, while retaining
compatibility with parallelized weight updates, and 2) ensures efficiency and
effectiveness by computing these factors via a single lightweight block-wise
backward pass, guided by a theoretical connection to token-level perturbations.
Extensive evaluations on 8 benchmarks across 0.5B$\sim$32B VLMs demonstrate the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of our VLMQ, particularly under low-bit
settings. For example, it achieves a substantial \textbf{16.45\%} improvement
on MME-RealWorld under 2-bit quantization.

*Lukas Ranftl,Felix Brendel,Bertram Drost,Carsten Steger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVTOP是一种基于Transformer的多视角刚性物体姿态估计方法，通过早期融合视角特征解决单视角无法处理的姿态模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单视角或后处理单视角姿态无法解决的多视角姿态模糊问题。

Method: 利用视线建模多视角几何，假设相机内部和相对方向已知，但每次推理时可变化。

Result: 在合成数据集上优于单视角和现有多视角方法，在YCB-V数据集上表现竞争性。

Conclusion: MVTOP是一种端到端可训练的、无需额外数据的全多视角方法，能可靠解决姿态模糊问题。

Abstract: We present MVTOP, a novel transformer-based method for multi-view rigid
object pose estimation. Through an early fusion of the view-specific features,
our method can resolve pose ambiguities that would be impossible to solve with
a single view or with a post-processing of single-view poses. MVTOP models the
multi-view geometry via lines of sight that emanate from the respective camera
centers. While the method assumes the camera interior and relative orientations
are known for a particular scene, they can vary for each inference. This makes
the method versatile. The use of the lines of sight enables MVTOP to correctly
predict the correct pose with the merged multi-view information. To show the
model's capabilities, we provide a synthetic data set that can only be solved
with such holistic multi-view approaches since the poses in the dataset cannot
be solved with just one view. Our method outperforms single-view and all
existing multi-view approaches on our dataset and achieves competitive results
on the YCB-V dataset. To the best of our knowledge, no holistic multi-view
method exists that can resolve such pose ambiguities reliably. Our model is
end-to-end trainable and does not require any additional data, e.g., depth.

Result: 在多个数据集上实现了竞争性的超分辨率性能，同时显著减小模型大小和推理时间。

Conclusion: 轻量化设计使其可嵌入事件相机或作为下游视觉任务的高效前端预处理模块。

Abstract: Event cameras offer unparalleled advantages such as high temporal resolution,
low latency, and high dynamic range. However, their limited spatial resolution
poses challenges for fine-grained perception tasks. In this work, we propose an
ultra-lightweight, stream-based event-to-event super-resolution method based on
Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), designed for real-time deployment on
resource-constrained devices. To further reduce model size, we introduce a
novel Dual-Forward Polarity-Split Event Encoding strategy that decouples
positive and negative events into separate forward paths through a shared SNN.
Furthermore, we propose a Learnable Spatio-temporal Polarity-aware Loss
(LearnSTPLoss) that adaptively balances temporal, spatial, and polarity
consistency using learnable uncertainty-based weights. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves competitive super-resolution performance
on multiple datasets while significantly reducing model size and inference
time. The lightweight design enables embedding the module into event cameras or
using it as an efficient front-end preprocessing for downstream vision tasks.

Motivation: 现有研究主要依赖提示级建模和大规模模型，导致个性化生成不准确，因此需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: 提出DrUM，结合用户画像和基于Transformer的适配器，通过潜在空间中的条件级建模实现个性化生成。

Result: DrUM在大规模数据集上表现优异，并能与开源文本编码器无缝集成，兼容主流T2I模型。

Conclusion: DrUM为T2I扩散模型提供了一种高效、兼容性强的个性化生成解决方案。

Abstract: Personalized generation in T2I diffusion models aims to naturally incorporate
individual user preferences into the generation process with minimal user
intervention. However, existing studies primarily rely on prompt-level modeling
with large-scale models, often leading to inaccurate personalization due to the
limited input token capacity of T2I diffusion models. To address these
limitations, we propose DrUM, a novel method that integrates user profiling
with a transformer-based adapter to enable personalized generation through
condition-level modeling in the latent space. DrUM demonstrates strong
performance on large-scale datasets and seamlessly integrates with open-source
text encoders, making it compatible with widely used foundation T2I models
without requiring additional fine-tuning.

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have shown success in robust
3D object detection tasks. Existing methods often rely on the score matching
from 3D boxes or pre-trained diffusion priors. However, they typically require
multi-step iterations in inference, which limits efficiency. To address this,
we propose a \textbf{R}obust single-stage fully \textbf{S}parse 3D object
\textbf{D}etection \textbf{Net}work with a Detachable Latent Framework (DLF) of
DDPMs, named RSDNet. Specifically, RSDNet learns the denoising process in
latent feature spaces through lightweight denoising networks like multi-level
denoising autoencoders (DAEs). This enables RSDNet to effectively understand
scene distributions under multi-level perturbations, achieving robust and
reliable detection. Meanwhile, we reformulate the noising and denoising
mechanisms of DDPMs, enabling DLF to construct multi-type and multi-level noise
samples and targets, enhancing RSDNet robustness to multiple perturbations.
Furthermore, a semantic-geometric conditional guidance is introduced to
perceive the object boundaries and shapes, alleviating the center feature
missing problem in sparse representations, enabling RSDNet to perform in a
fully sparse detection pipeline. Moreover, the detachable denoising network
design of DLF enables RSDNet to perform single-step detection in inference,
further enhancing detection efficiency. Extensive experiments on public
benchmarks show that RSDNet can outperform existing methods, achieving
state-of-the-art detection.

Motivation: 现有模因匹配方法仅基于模板背景，忽略了非模板模因，限制了自动化分析的准确性和对当代网络模因词典的链接能力。

Method: 提出了一种广义的模因匹配方法，测试了传统相似性度量（包括分段计算）和基于预训练多模态大语言模型的提示方法。

Result: 传统方法在模板模因上表现良好，但对非模板模因效果有限；分段方法在非模板模因上优于整体图像度量。

Conclusion: 模因匹配需要更复杂的技术，尤其是针对非模板模因的共享视觉元素匹配仍是一个开放挑战。

Abstract: Internet memes, now a staple of digital communication, play a pivotal role in
how users engage within online communities and allow researchers to gain
insight into contemporary digital culture. These engaging user-generated
content are characterised by their reuse of visual elements also found in other
memes. Matching instances of memes via these shared visual elements, called
Meme Matching, is the basis of a wealth of meme analysis approaches. However,
most existing methods assume that every meme consists of a shared visual
background, called a Template, with some overlaid text, thereby limiting meme
matching to comparing the background image alone. Current approaches exclude
the many memes that are not template-based and limit the effectiveness of
automated meme analysis and would not be effective at linking memes to
contemporary web-based meme dictionaries. In this work, we introduce a broader
formulation of meme matching that extends beyond template matching. We show
that conventional similarity measures, including a novel segment-wise
computation of the similarity measures, excel at matching template-based memes
but fall short when applied to non-template-based meme formats. However, the
segment-wise approach was found to consistently outperform the whole-image
measures on matching non-template-based memes. Finally, we explore a
prompting-based approach using a pretrained Multimodal Large Language Model for
meme matching. Our results highlight that accurately matching memes via shared
visual elements, not just background templates, remains an open challenge that
requires more sophisticated matching techniques.

Conclusion: ReDPO和V.I.P.框架能高效生成高质量视频，代码已开源。

Abstract: With growing interest in deploying text-to-video (T2V) models in
resource-constrained environments, reducing their high computational cost has
become crucial, leading to extensive research on pruning and knowledge
distillation methods while maintaining performance. However, existing
distillation methods primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which
often leads to mode collapse as pruned models with reduced capacity fail to
directly match the teacher's outputs, ultimately resulting in degraded quality.
To address this challenge, we propose an effective distillation method, ReDPO,
that integrates DPO and SFT. Our approach leverages DPO to guide the student
model to focus on recovering only the targeted properties, rather than
passively imitating the teacher, while also utilizing SFT to enhance overall
performance. We additionally propose V.I.P., a novel framework for filtering
and curating high-quality pair datasets, along with a step-by-step online
approach for calibrated training. We validate our method on two leading T2V
models, VideoCrafter2 and AnimateDiff, achieving parameter reduction of 36.2%
and 67.5% each, while maintaining or even surpassing the performance of full
models. Further experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of both ReDPO and
V.I.P. framework in enabling efficient and high-quality video generation. Our

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注孤立单词，而真实手写文本需要处理单词间关系（如垂直对齐和水平间距），生成整行文本更具挑战性。

Method: DiffBrush采用内容解耦风格学习（通过列和行掩码分离风格与内容）和多尺度内容学习（使用行和单词判别器确保内容准确性）。

Result: 实验表明，DiffBrush在生成高质量文本行方面表现优异，尤其在风格再现和内容保留上。

Conclusion: DiffBrush为手写文本行生成提供了一种有效解决方案，解决了风格和内容建模的复杂问题。

Abstract: Existing handwritten text generation methods primarily focus on isolated
words. However, realistic handwritten text demands attention not only to
individual words but also to the relationships between them, such as vertical
alignment and horizontal spacing. Therefore, generating entire text lines
emerges as a more promising and comprehensive task. However, this task poses
significant challenges, including the accurate modeling of complex style
patterns encompassing both intra- and inter-word relationships, and maintaining
content accuracy across numerous characters. To address these challenges, we
propose DiffBrush, a novel diffusion-based model for handwritten text-line
generation. Unlike existing methods, DiffBrush excels in both style imitation
and content accuracy through two key strategies: (1) content-decoupled style
learning, which disentangles style from content to better capture intra-word
and inter-word style patterns by using column- and row-wise masking; and (2)
multi-scale content learning, which employs line and word discriminators to
ensure global coherence and local accuracy of textual content. Extensive
experiments show that DiffBrush excels in generating high-quality text lines,
particularly in style reproduction and content preservation. Code is available

Conclusion: EgoPrompt通过统一表示和优化训练目标，显著提升了第一人称动作识别的性能。

Abstract: Driven by the increasing demand for applications in augmented and virtual
reality, egocentric action recognition has emerged as a prominent research
area. It is typically divided into two subtasks: recognizing the performed
behavior (i.e., verb component) and identifying the objects being acted upon
(i.e., noun component) from the first-person perspective. However, most
existing approaches treat these two components as independent classification
tasks, focusing on extracting component-specific knowledge while overlooking
their inherent semantic and contextual relationships, leading to fragmented
representations and sub-optimal generalization capability. To address these
challenges, we propose a prompt learning-based framework, EgoPrompt, to conduct
the egocentric action recognition task. Building on the existing prompting
strategy to capture the component-specific knowledge, we construct a Unified
Prompt Pool space to establish interaction between the two types of component
representations. Specifically, the component representations (from verbs and
nouns) are first decomposed into fine-grained patterns with the prompt pair
form. Then, these pattern-level representations are fused through an
attention-based mechanism to facilitate cross-component interaction. To ensure
the prompt pool is informative, we further introduce a novel training
objective, Diverse Pool Criteria. This objective realizes our goals from two
perspectives: Prompt Selection Frequency Regularization and Prompt Knowledge
Orthogonalization. Extensive experiments are conducted on the Ego4D,
EPIC-Kitchens, and EGTEA datasets. The results consistently show that EgoPrompt
achieves state-of-the-art performance across within-dataset, cross-dataset, and
base-to-novel generalization benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of placental diseases via whole slide images (WSIs) is
critical for preventing severe maternal and fetal complications. However, WSI
analysis presents significant computational challenges due to the massive data
volume. Existing WSI classification methods encounter critical limitations: (1)
inadequate patch selection strategies that either compromise performance or
fail to sufficiently reduce computational demands, and (2) the loss of global
histological context resulting from patch-level processing approaches. To
address these challenges, we propose an Efficient multimodal framework for
Patient-level placental disease Diagnosis, named EmmPD. Our approach introduces
a two-stage patch selection module that combines parameter-free and learnable
compression strategies, optimally balancing computational efficiency with
critical feature preservation. Additionally, we develop a hybrid multimodal
fusion module that leverages adaptive graph learning to enhance pathological
feature representation and incorporates textual medical reports to enrich
global contextual understanding. Extensive experiments conducted on both a
self-constructed patient-level Placental dataset and two public datasets
demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic performance.

Abstract: Deep learning-based semantic segmentation models achieve impressive results
yet remain limited in handling distribution shifts between training and test
data. In this paper, we present SDGPA (Synthetic Data Generation and
Progressive Adaptation), a novel method that tackles zero-shot domain adaptive
semantic segmentation, in which no target images are available, but only a text
description of the target domain's style is provided. To compensate for the
lack of target domain training data, we utilize a pretrained off-the-shelf
text-to-image diffusion model, which generates training images by transferring
source domain images to target style. Directly editing source domain images
introduces noise that harms segmentation because the layout of source images
cannot be precisely maintained. To address inaccurate layouts in synthetic
data, we propose a method that crops the source image, edits small patches
individually, and then merges them back together, which helps improve spatial
precision. Recognizing the large domain gap, SDGPA constructs an augmented
intermediate domain, leveraging easier adaptation subtasks to enable more
stable model adaptation to the target domain. Additionally, to mitigate the
impact of noise in synthetic data, we design a progressive adaptation strategy,
ensuring robust learning throughout the training process. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot
semantic segmentation. The code is available at

Conclusion: BaroPoser通过结合气压计数据，显著提升了非平坦地形下的人体姿态估计和全局平移预测能力。

Abstract: In recent years, tracking human motion using IMUs from everyday devices such
as smartphones and smartwatches has gained increasing popularity. However, due
to the sparsity of sensor measurements and the lack of datasets capturing human
motion over uneven terrain, existing methods often struggle with pose
estimation accuracy and are typically limited to recovering movements on flat
terrain only. To this end, we present BaroPoser, the first method that combines
IMU and barometric data recorded by a smartphone and a smartwatch to estimate
human pose and global translation in real time. By leveraging barometric
readings, we estimate sensor height changes, which provide valuable cues for
both improving the accuracy of human pose estimation and predicting global
translation on non-flat terrain. Furthermore, we propose a local thigh
coordinate frame to disentangle local and global motion input for better pose

Conclusion: 该分类法和分析旨在澄清KD在目标检测中的发展现状，突出当前挑战，并指导未来研究开发高效、可扩展的检测系统。

Abstract: Object detection has achieved remarkable accuracy through deep learning, yet
these improvements often come with increased computational cost, limiting
deployment on resource-constrained devices. Knowledge Distillation (KD)
provides an effective solution by enabling compact student models to learn from
larger teacher models. However, adapting KD to object detection poses unique
challenges due to its dual objectives-classification and localization-as well
as foreground-background imbalance and multi-scale feature representation. This
review introduces a novel architecture-centric taxonomy for KD methods,
distinguishing between CNN-based detectors (covering backbone-level,
neck-level, head-level, and RPN/RoI-level distillation) and Transformer-based
detectors (including query-level, feature-level, and logit-level distillation).
We further evaluate representative methods using the MS COCO and PASCAL VOC
datasets with mAP@0.5 as performance metric, providing a comparative analysis
of their effectiveness. The proposed taxonomy and analysis aim to clarify the
evolving landscape of KD in object detection, highlight current challenges, and
guide future research toward efficient and scalable detection systems.

Motivation: 传统雷达手势识别系统需要持续采样和处理数据，导致高功耗和计算开销，而生物启发的神经形态方法可以显著降低这些开销。

Method: 系统包括24 GHz多普勒雷达前端和神经形态采样器，将中频信号转换为稀疏的基于脉冲的表示，并通过轻量级神经网络在Cortex-M0微控制器上进行实时处理。

Result: 在七名用户的五种手势数据集上，系统实现了超过85%的实时准确率。

Conclusion: 这是首个将生物启发的异步Sigma-Delta编码和事件驱动处理框架用于雷达手势识别的研究，显著降低了功耗和计算需求。

Abstract: We present a neuromorphic radar framework for real-time, low-power hand
gesture recognition (HGR) using an event-driven architecture inspired by
biological sensing. Our system comprises a 24 GHz Doppler radar front-end and a
custom neuromorphic sampler that converts intermediate-frequency (IF) signals
into sparse spike-based representations via asynchronous sigma-delta encoding.
These events are directly processed by a lightweight neural network deployed on
a Cortex-M0 microcontroller, enabling low-latency inference without requiring
spectrogram reconstruction. Unlike conventional radar HGR pipelines that
continuously sample and process data, our architecture activates only when
meaningful motion is detected, significantly reducing memory, power, and
computation overhead. Evaluated on a dataset of five gestures collected from
seven users, our system achieves > 85% real-time accuracy. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work that employs bio-inspired asynchronous
sigma-delta encoding and an event-driven processing framework for radar-based
HGR.

Abstract: The exponential growth in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) usage underscores
the critical need of detecting them at extended distances to ensure safe
operations, especially in densely populated areas. Despite the tremendous
advances made in computer vision through deep learning, the detection of these
small airborne objects remains a formidable challenge. While several datasets
have been developed specifically for drone detection, the need for a more
extensive and diverse collection of drone image data persists, particularly for
long-range detection under varying environmental conditions. We introduce here
the Long Range Drone Detection (LRDD) Version 2 dataset, comprising 39,516
meticulously annotated images, as a second release of the LRDD dataset released
previously. The LRDDv2 dataset enhances the LRDDv1 by incorporating a greater
variety of images, providing a more diverse and comprehensive resource for
drone detection research. What sets LRDDv2 apart is its inclusion of target
range information for over 8,000 images, making it possible to develop
algorithms for drone range estimation. Tailored for long-range aerial object
detection, the majority of LRDDv2's dataset consists of images capturing drones
with 50 or fewer pixels in 1080p resolution. For access to the complete

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归扩散模型在长视频生成中存在时间漂移和并行化限制，影响生成质量和效率。

Method: 通过Micro Planning预测关键帧提供运动与外观先验，Macro Planning确保长期一致性，并行填充中间帧。

Result: 实验表明该方法在质量和稳定性上优于现有长视频生成模型。

Conclusion: MMPL框架有效解决了长视频生成中的时间漂移问题，并实现了高效并行化。

Abstract: Current autoregressive diffusion models excel at video generation but are
generally limited to short temporal durations. Our theoretical analysis
indicates that the autoregressive modeling typically suffers from temporal
drift caused by error accumulation and hinders parallelization in long video
synthesis. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
planning-then-populating framework centered on Macro-from-Micro Planning (MMPL)
for long video generation. MMPL sketches a global storyline for the entire
video through two hierarchical stages: Micro Planning and Macro Planning.
Specifically, Micro Planning predicts a sparse set of future keyframes within
each short video segment, offering motion and appearance priors to guide
high-quality video segment generation. Macro Planning extends the in-segment
keyframes planning across the entire video through an autoregressive chain of
micro plans, ensuring long-term consistency across video segments.
Subsequently, MMPL-based Content Populating generates all intermediate frames
in parallel across segments, enabling efficient parallelization of
autoregressive generation. The parallelization is further optimized by Adaptive
Workload Scheduling for balanced GPU execution and accelerated autoregressive
video generation. Extensive experiments confirm that our method outperforms
existing long video generation models in quality and stability. Generated
videos and comparison results are in our project page.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种双阶段方法，用于恢复极暗图像中的细节，包括频率域全局光照恢复和纹理结构细化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有增强方法在保留细节和锐利边缘方面效果有限，影响了下游应用（如文本和边缘检测）。

Method: 第一阶段使用残差傅里叶引导模块（RFGM）恢复全局光照；第二阶段通过Patch Mamba和Grad Mamba细化纹理结构。

Result: 在多个基准数据集和下游应用中显著提升了细节恢复性能，且模块轻量高效。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效恢复暗图像中的细节，且易于集成到现有框架中。

Abstract: Recovering fine-grained details in extremely dark images remains challenging
due to severe structural information loss and noise corruption. Existing
enhancement methods often fail to preserve intricate details and sharp edges,
limiting their effectiveness in downstream applications like text and edge
detection. To address these deficiencies, we propose an efficient dual-stage
approach centered on detail recovery for dark images. In the first stage, we
introduce a Residual Fourier-Guided Module (RFGM) that effectively restores
global illumination in the frequency domain. RFGM captures inter-stage and
inter-channel dependencies through residual connections, providing robust
priors for high-fidelity frequency processing while mitigating error
accumulation risks from unreliable priors. The second stage employs
complementary Mamba modules specifically designed for textural structure
refinement: (1) Patch Mamba operates on channel-concatenated non-downsampled
patches, meticulously modeling pixel-level correlations to enhance fine-grained
details without resolution loss. (2) Grad Mamba explicitly focuses on
high-gradient regions, alleviating state decay in state space models and
prioritizing reconstruction of sharp edges and boundaries. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets and downstream applications
demonstrate that our method significantly improves detail recovery performance
while maintaining efficiency. Crucially, the proposed modules are lightweight
and can be seamlessly integrated into existing Fourier-based frameworks with
minimal computational overhead. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视频问答（Video-QA）中因高令牌成本和处理过多帧导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 采用自适应层次聚类算法在融合的ResNet-50和CLIP特征空间上识别并合并冗余帧，辅以轻量级文本语义图补充信息。

Result: 在LongVideoBench和VideoMME基准测试中，帧数减少86.9%，令牌开销降低83.2%，且性能优于基线。

Conclusion: AFP方法显著提升了效率和准确性，为视频问答任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The practical application of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to
Video Question Answering (Video-QA) is severely hindered by the high token cost
of processing numerous video frames. While increasing the number of sampled
frames is a common strategy, we observe a "less is more" phenomenon where
excessive frames can paradoxically degrade performance due to context dilution.
Concurrently, state-of-the-art keyframe selection methods, while effective,
still yield significant temporal redundancy, which we term 'visual echoes'. To
address these dual challenges, we propose Adaptive Frame-Pruning (AFP), a novel
post-processing method that intelligently prunes the selected keyframes. AFP
employs an adaptive hierarchical clustering algorithm on a fused ResNet-50 and
CLIP feature space to identify and merge these echoes into single
representatives. To compensate for information loss, we then introduce a
lightweight, text-based semantic graph that provides critical context with
minimal token overhead. Conducting extensive experiments on the LongVideoBench
and VideoMME benchmarks across multiple leading MLLMs, our full approach
demonstrates a drastic reduction in required frames by up to 86.9% and total
input tokens by up to 83.2%. Crucially, by providing a concise, high-quality
set of frames, our method not only enhances efficiency but often improves
accuracy over baselines that use more frames. The code will be released upon
publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CIVQLLIE框架，通过离散表示学习和因果干预解决低光图像增强问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夜间图像可见性差，现有方法缺乏解释性或依赖不可靠先验，物理方法假设过于简化。

Method: 利用向量量化（VQ）学习离散视觉标记，通过多级因果干预（PCI、FCI、HDRM）校正分布偏移。

Result: 框架能有效增强低光图像，提升细节重建能力。

Conclusion: CIVQLLIE结合离散表示与因果干预，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Images captured in nighttime scenes suffer from severely reduced visibility,
hindering effective content perception. Current low-light image enhancement
(LLIE) methods face significant challenges: data-driven end-to-end mapping
networks lack interpretability or rely on unreliable prior guidance, struggling
under extremely dark conditions, while physics-based methods depend on
simplified assumptions that often fail in complex real-world scenarios. To
address these limitations, we propose CIVQLLIE, a novel framework that
leverages the power of discrete representation learning through causal
reasoning. We achieve this through Vector Quantization (VQ), which maps
continuous image features to a discrete codebook of visual tokens learned from
large-scale high-quality images. This codebook serves as a reliable prior,
encoding standardized brightness and color patterns that are independent of
degradation. However, direct application of VQ to low-light images fails due to
distribution shifts between degraded inputs and the learned codebook.
Therefore, we propose a multi-level causal intervention approach to
systematically correct these shifts. First, during encoding, our Pixel-level
Causal Intervention (PCI) module intervenes to align low-level features with
the brightness and color distributions expected by the codebook. Second, a
Feature-aware Causal Intervention (FCI) mechanism with Low-frequency Selective
Attention Gating (LSAG) identifies and enhances channels most affected by
illumination degradation, facilitating accurate codebook token matching while
enhancing the encoder's generalization performance through flexible
feature-level intervention. Finally, during decoding, the High-frequency Detail
Reconstruction Module (HDRM) leverages structural information preserved in the
matched codebook representations to reconstruct fine details using deformable
convolution techniques.

TL;DR: WaMo提出了一种基于小波的多频率特征提取框架，用于文本-动作检索，通过捕捉局部和全局运动细节实现细粒度对齐，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理3D动作与文本匹配时，忽视了人体结构的复杂性和时空动态性，导致语义对齐不精确。

Method: WaMo包含三个关键组件：轨迹小波分解、轨迹小波重建和乱序动作序列预测，分别用于多分辨率特征提取、信息保留和时间一致性学习。

Result: 在HumanML3D和KIT-ML数据集上，WaMo的Rsum分别提升了17.0%和18.2%，优于现有SOTA方法。

Conclusion: WaMo通过多频率特征提取和时空信息保留，显著提升了文本-动作检索的性能。

Abstract: Text-Motion Retrieval (TMR) aims to retrieve 3D motion sequences semantically
relevant to text descriptions. However, matching 3D motions with text remains
highly challenging, primarily due to the intricate structure of human body and
its spatial-temporal dynamics. Existing approaches often overlook these
complexities, relying on general encoding methods that fail to distinguish
different body parts and their dynamics, limiting precise semantic alignment.
To address this, we propose WaMo, a novel wavelet-based multi-frequency feature
extraction framework. It fully captures part-specific and time-varying motion
details across multiple resolutions on body joints, extracting discriminative
motion features to achieve fine-grained alignment with texts. WaMo has three
key components: (1) Trajectory Wavelet Decomposition decomposes motion signals
into frequency components that preserve both local kinematic details and global
motion semantics. (2) Trajectory Wavelet Reconstruction uses learnable inverse
wavelet transforms to reconstruct original joint trajectories from extracted
features, ensuring the preservation of essential spatial-temporal information.
(3) Disordered Motion Sequence Prediction reorders shuffled motion sequences to
improve the learning of inherent temporal coherence, enhancing motion-text
alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate WaMo's superiority, achieving
17.0\% and 18.2\% improvements in $Rsum$ on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets,
respectively, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉模型中风格与内容的显式解缠因语义重叠和主观性而困难，现有方法仍面临概念交织的模糊性。

Method: SCFlow通过流匹配框架学习双向映射，利用合成数据集训练风格与内容的可逆合并，无需显式监督。

Result: SCFlow在ImageNet-1k和WikiArt上零样本泛化，性能竞争，表明解缠可从可逆合并中自然涌现。

Conclusion: 可逆合并风格与内容的方法能自然实现解缠，为视觉模型提供新思路。

Abstract: Explicitly disentangling style and content in vision models remains
challenging due to their semantic overlap and the subjectivity of human
perception. Existing methods propose separation through generative or
discriminative objectives, but they still face the inherent ambiguity of
disentangling intertwined concepts. Instead, we ask: Can we bypass explicit
disentanglement by learning to merge style and content invertibly, allowing
separation to emerge naturally? We propose SCFlow, a flow-matching framework
that learns bidirectional mappings between entangled and disentangled
representations. Our approach is built upon three key insights: 1) Training
solely to merge style and content, a well-defined task, enables invertible
disentanglement without explicit supervision; 2) flow matching bridges on
arbitrary distributions, avoiding the restrictive Gaussian priors of diffusion
models and normalizing flows; and 3) a synthetic dataset of 510,000 samples (51
styles $\times$ 10,000 content samples) was curated to simulate disentanglement
through systematic style-content pairing. Beyond controllable generation tasks,
we demonstrate that SCFlow generalizes to ImageNet-1k and WikiArt in zero-shot
settings and achieves competitive performance, highlighting that
disentanglement naturally emerges from the invertible merging process.

Motivation: 传统联邦学习在大模型上计算资源需求高，不适用于资源有限的客户端设备。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：服务器端知识蒸馏对齐大模型和小模型表示，客户端训练轻量级分类器并聚合。

Result: 在五个图像分类基准测试中，FedPromo表现优于现有方法，适用于资源有限的客户端。

Conclusion: FedPromo在性能、隐私和资源效率之间取得了平衡，适用于多领域学习。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an established paradigm for training deep learning
models on decentralized data. However, as the size of the models grows,
conventional FL approaches often require significant computational resources on
client devices, which may not be feasible. We introduce FedPromo, a novel
framework that enables efficient adaptation of large-scale foundation models
stored on a central server to new domains encountered only by remote clients.
Instead of directly training the large model on client devices, FedPromo
optimizes lightweight proxy models via FL, significantly reducing computational
overhead while maintaining privacy. Our method follows a two-stage process:
first, server-side knowledge distillation aligns the representations of a
large-scale foundation model (e.g., a transformer) with those of a compact
counterpart (e.g., a CNN). Then, the compact model encoder is deployed to
client devices, where trainable classifiers are learned locally. These
classifiers are subsequently aggregated and seamlessly transferred back to the
foundation model, facilitating personalized adaptation without requiring direct
access to user data. Through novel regularization strategies, our framework
enables decentralized multi-domain learning, balancing performance, privacy,
and resource efficiency. Extensive experiments on five image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that FedPromo outperforms existing methods while
assuming limited-resource clients.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在参数规模、自校正能力和复杂推理任务中表现不足，尤其在长视觉上下文和文档任务中。

Method: MACT包含四个小规模智能体（规划、执行、判断和回答），通过混合奖励建模和智能体级测试时扩展优化协作。

Result: MACT在15个基准测试中的13个领先，且在长视觉上下文和复杂推理任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: MACT以较小参数规模实现高性能，适用于文档和非文档任务，尤其在复杂推理和长视觉上下文中表现优异。

Abstract: Existing vision-language models (VLMs), whether generalists or specialists,
remain constrained by their parameter scale, lack robust self-correction
capabilities, and underperform in tasks involving long visual contexts and
complex reasoning, resulting in suboptimal performance on document-based tasks.
To address this, we propose MACT, a Multi-Agent Collaboration framework with
Test-Time scaling, tailored for visual document understanding and visual
question answering (VQA). It comprises four distinct small-scale agents, i.e.,
planning, execution, judgment, and answer agents, with clearly defined roles
and effective collaboration. Notably, the judgment agent exclusively verifies
correctness and redirects to prior agents for revisions, outperforming
conventional correction strategies. To further expand the capability boundaries
of the framework, we propose mixed reward modeling that balances agent-specific
abilities and global collaboration, as well as agent-wise hybrid test-time
scaling, which customizes different scaling strategies for each agent based on
their functions. Evaluated on benchmarks spanning both document-based and
non-document-based settings, our MACT shows superior performance with a smaller
parameter scale without sacrificing the ability of general and mathematical
tasks. Especially, it stands out in benchmarks involving long visual contexts
and complicated reasoning. The three variants of MACT consistently hold the top
three positions in average scores, leading in 13 of the 15 benchmarks. Code

Result: 实验表明，DOD在视觉质量和推理效率上优于现有基于扩散的修复方法。

Conclusion: DOD方法通过高效的单步采样实现了高性能图像修复，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion models have revealed powerful potential in all-in-one image
restoration (AiOIR), which is talented in generating abundant texture details.
The existing AiOIR methods either retrain a diffusion model or fine-tune the
pretrained diffusion model with extra conditional guidance. However, they often
suffer from high inference costs and limited adaptability to diverse
degradation types. In this paper, we propose an efficient AiOIR method,
Diffusion Once and Done (DOD), which aims to achieve superior restoration
performance with only one-step sampling of Stable Diffusion (SD) models.
Specifically, multi-degradation feature modulation is first introduced to
capture different degradation prompts with a pretrained diffusion model. Then,
parameter-efficient conditional low-rank adaptation integrates the prompts to
enable the fine-tuning of the SD model for adapting to different degradation
types. Besides, a high-fidelity detail enhancement module is integrated into
the decoder of SD to improve structural and textural details. Experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing diffusion-based restoration
approaches in both visual quality and inference efficiency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无监督视频分割任务中缺乏监督信号和复杂视觉场景的挑战，同时避免依赖大型计算密集型模型。

Method: 通过余弦相似度对齐教师和学生模型的slot表示，无需额外损失或辅助监督。

Result: 实验表明，基于SlotMatch的学生模型在性能上匹配甚至超越教师模型，参数减少3.6倍，速度提升1.9倍。

Conclusion: SlotMatch框架简单高效，优于现有无监督视频分割模型。

Abstract: Unsupervised video segmentation is a challenging computer vision task,
especially due to the lack of supervisory signals coupled with the complexity
of visual scenes. To overcome this challenge, state-of-the-art models based on
slot attention often have to rely on large and computationally expensive neural
architectures. To this end, we propose a simple knowledge distillation
framework that effectively transfers object-centric representations to a
lightweight student. The proposed framework, called SlotMatch, aligns
corresponding teacher and student slots via the cosine similarity, requiring no
additional distillation objectives or auxiliary supervision. The simplicity of
SlotMatch is confirmed via theoretical and empirical evidence, both indicating
that integrating additional losses is redundant. We conduct experiments on two
datasets to compare the state-of-the-art teacher model, SlotContrast, with our
distilled student. The results show that our student based on SlotMatch matches
and even outperforms its teacher, while using 3.6x less parameters and running
1.9x faster. Moreover, our student surpasses previous unsupervised video
segmentation models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习方法忽视解剖背景，GRASP旨在通过整合解剖知识提升病理分割的准确性。

Method: GRASP采用伪标签输入通道和基于transformer的特征融合策略，结合解剖上下文。

Result: 在多个评估指标和架构中，GRASP表现优异，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: GRASP通过双解剖注入策略成功整合解剖背景，显著提升病理分割性能。

Abstract: Radiologists rely on anatomical understanding to accurately delineate
pathologies, yet most current deep learning approaches use pure pattern
recognition and ignore the anatomical context in which pathologies develop. To
narrow this gap, we introduce GRASP (Guided Representation Alignment for the
Segmentation of Pathologies), a modular plug-and-play framework that enhances
pathology segmentation models by leveraging existing anatomy segmentation
models through pseudolabel integration and feature alignment. Unlike previous
approaches that obtain anatomical knowledge via auxiliary training, GRASP
integrates into standard pathology optimization regimes without retraining
anatomical components. We evaluate GRASP on two PET/CT datasets, conduct
systematic ablation studies, and investigate the framework's inner workings. We
find that GRASP consistently achieves top rankings across multiple evaluation
metrics and diverse architectures. The framework's dual anatomy injection
strategy, combining anatomical pseudo-labels as input channels with
transformer-guided anatomical feature fusion, effectively incorporates
anatomical context.

Method: 提出GaitAdapter方法，结合GPAK模块和EDSM方法，利用图神经网络聚合步态模式并保持特征空间分布。

Result: 实验表明GaitAdapter能有效保留多任务知识，显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: GaitAdapter通过持续学习和特征优化，显著提升了步态识别的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Current gait recognition methodologies generally necessitate retraining when
encountering new datasets. Nevertheless, retrained models frequently encounter
difficulties in preserving knowledge from previous datasets, leading to a
significant decline in performance on earlier test sets. To tackle these
challenges, we present a continual gait recognition task, termed GaitAdapt,
which supports the progressive enhancement of gait recognition capabilities
over time and is systematically categorized according to various evaluation
scenarios. Additionally, we propose GaitAdapter, a non-replay continual
learning approach for gait recognition. This approach integrates the
GaitPartition Adaptive Knowledge (GPAK) module, employing graph neural networks
to aggregate common gait patterns from current data into a repository
constructed from graph vectors. Subsequently, this repository is used to
improve the discriminability of gait features in new tasks, thereby enhancing
the model's ability to effectively recognize gait patterns. We also introduce a
Euclidean Distance Stability Method (EDSN) based on negative pairs, which
ensures that newly added gait samples from different classes maintain similar
relative spatial distributions across both previous and current gait tasks,
thereby alleviating the impact of task changes on the distinguishability of
original domain features. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that GaitAdapter
effectively retains gait knowledge acquired from diverse tasks, exhibiting
markedly superior discriminative capability compared to alternative methods.

Abstract: X-ray medical report generation is one of the important applications of
artificial intelligence in healthcare. With the support of large foundation
models, the quality of medical report generation has significantly improved.
However, challenges such as hallucination and weak disease diagnostic
capability still persist. In this paper, we first construct a large-scale
multi-modal medical knowledge graph (termed M3KG) based on the ground truth
medical report using the GPT-4o. It contains 2477 entities, 3 kinds of
relations, 37424 triples, and 6943 disease-aware vision tokens for the CheXpert
Plus dataset. Then, we sample it to obtain multi-granularity semantic graphs
and use an R-GCN encoder for feature extraction. For the input X-ray image, we
adopt the Swin-Transformer to extract the vision features and interact with the
knowledge using cross-attention. The vision tokens are fed into a Q-former and
retrieved the disease-aware vision tokens using another cross-attention.
Finally, we adopt the large language model to map the semantic knowledge graph,
input X-ray image, and disease-aware vision tokens into language descriptions.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets fully validated the effectiveness of
our proposed knowledge graph and X-ray report generation framework. The source
code of this paper will be released on

Motivation: 现有测试时适应（TTA）方法在资源受限场景中计算开销大，且令牌聚合方法直接集成会导致性能下降。

Method: 提出NAVIA方法，通过增强[CLS]令牌嵌入和在浅层引入自适应偏置，优化熵最小化以恢复信息损失。

Result: NAVIA在多个分布外基准测试中性能提升超过2.5%，推理延迟降低20%以上。

Conclusion: NAVIA有效解决了高效测试时适应（ETTA）问题，平衡了性能与效率。

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as an effective solution for adapting
Vision Transformers (ViT) to distribution shifts without additional training
data. However, existing TTA methods often incur substantial computational
overhead, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained real-world
scenarios. To reduce inference cost, plug-and-play token aggregation methods
merge redundant tokens in ViTs to reduce total processed tokens. Albeit
efficient, it suffers from significant performance degradation when directly
integrated with existing TTA methods. We formalize this problem as Efficient
Test-Time Adaptation (ETTA), seeking to preserve the adaptation capability of
TTA while reducing inference latency. In this paper, we first provide a
theoretical analysis from a novel mutual information perspective, showing that
token aggregation inherently leads to information loss, which cannot be fully
mitigated by conventional norm-tuning-based TTA methods. Guided by this
insight, we propose to \textbf{N}eutralize Token \textbf{A}ggregation
\textbf{v}ia \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{A}ugmentation (\textbf{NAVIA}).
Specifically, we directly augment the [CLS] token embedding and incorporate
adaptive biases into the [CLS] token in shallow layers of ViTs. We
theoretically demonstrate that these augmentations, when optimized via entropy
minimization, recover the information lost due to token aggregation. Extensive
experiments across various out-of-distribution benchmarks demonstrate that
NAVIA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 2.5\%, while
achieving an inference latency reduction of more than 20\%, effectively
addressing the ETTA challenge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号分类面临因电极配置、采集协议和硬件差异导致的跨域数据分布偏移问题，需要一种鲁棒的对齐方法。

Method: IMAC采用3D到2D位置统一映射标准化电极布局，提出通道依赖掩码和重建任务，模拟跨域变化，并通过解耦结构分别建模时空信息。

Result: 在10个公开EEG数据集上，IMAC在跨主体和跨中心验证中达到最优分类准确率，并在分布偏移下表现鲁棒。

Conclusion: IMAC通过创新的自监督框架有效解决了EEG信号跨域对齐问题，显著提升了分类性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification faces significant challenges
due to data distribution shifts caused by heterogeneous electrode
configurations, acquisition protocols, and hardware discrepancies across
domains. This paper introduces IMAC, a novel channel-dependent mask and
imputation self-supervised framework that formulates the alignment of
cross-domain EEG data shifts as a spatial time series imputation task. To
address heterogeneous electrode configurations in cross-domain scenarios, IMAC
first standardizes different electrode layouts using a 3D-to-2D positional
unification mapping strategy, establishing unified spatial representations.
Unlike previous mask-based self-supervised representation learning methods,
IMAC introduces spatio-temporal signal alignment. This involves constructing a
channel-dependent mask and reconstruction task framed as a low-to-high
resolution EEG spatial imputation problem. Consequently, this approach
simulates cross-domain variations such as channel omissions and temporal
instabilities, thus enabling the model to leverage the proposed imputer for
robust signal alignment during inference. Furthermore, IMAC incorporates a
disentangled structure that separately models the temporal and spatial
information of the EEG signals separately, reducing computational complexity
while enhancing flexibility and adaptability. Comprehensive evaluations across
10 publicly available EEG datasets demonstrate IMAC's superior performance,
achieving state-of-the-art classification accuracy in both cross-subject and
cross-center validation scenarios. Notably, IMAC shows strong robustness under
both simulated and real-world distribution shifts, surpassing baseline methods
by up to $35$\% in integrity scores while maintaining consistent classification
accuracy.

Motivation: 现有2D轮廓和骨架表示无法充分捕捉视角变化和步态细节，需要更丰富的模态。

Method: 提出DepthGait框架，从RGB序列估计深度图作为新模态，并开发多尺度跨层融合方案。

Result: 在标准基准测试中达到最先进性能，并在挑战性数据集上取得高排名准确率。

Conclusion: DepthGait通过多模态融合显著提升了步态识别的表现。

Abstract: Robust gait recognition requires highly discriminative representations, which
are closely tied to input modalities. While binary silhouettes and skeletons
have dominated recent literature, these 2D representations fall short of
capturing sufficient cues that can be exploited to handle viewpoint variations,
and capture finer and meaningful details of gait. In this paper, we introduce a
novel framework, termed DepthGait, that incorporates RGB-derived depth maps and
silhouettes for enhanced gait recognition. Specifically, apart from the 2D
silhouette representation of the human body, the proposed pipeline explicitly
estimates depth maps from a given RGB image sequence and uses them as a new
modality to capture discriminative features inherent in human locomotion. In
addition, a novel multi-scale and cross-level fusion scheme has also been
developed to bridge the modality gap between depth maps and silhouettes.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed
DepthGait achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to peer methods and
attains an impressive mean rank-1 accuracy on the challenging datasets.

Motivation: 高光谱解混是许多应用的关键预处理步骤，现有方法在精度和空间相似性考虑上存在不足。

Method: 基于多层矩阵分解模型，引入全变分约束考虑空间相似性，采用L1/2范数稀疏约束表征丰度矩阵的稀疏性，并使用ADMM优化模型。

Result: 实验结果表明，STVMLU方法优于其他算法。

Conclusion: STVMLU方法通过结合空间相似性和稀疏性约束，显著提升了高光谱解混的精度。

Abstract: Hyperspectral unmixing aims at estimating material signatures (known as
endmembers) and the corresponding proportions (referred to abundances), which
is a critical preprocessing step in various hyperspectral imagery applications.
This study develops a novel approach called sparsity and total variation (TV)
constrained multilayer linear unmixing (STVMLU) for hyperspectral imagery.
Specifically, based on a multilayer matrix factorization model, to improve the
accuracy of unmixing, a TV constraint is incorporated to consider adjacent
spatial similarity. Additionally, a L1/2-norm sparse constraint is adopted to
effectively characterize the sparsity of the abundance matrix. For optimizing
the STVMLU model, the method of alternating direction method of multipliers
(ADMM) is employed, which allows for the simultaneous extraction of endmembers
and their corresponding abundance matrix. Experimental results illustrate the
enhanced performance of the proposed STVMLU when compared to other algorithms.

Result: 实验结果表明，VideoGuard的保护性能优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: VideoGuard能有效防止视频被未经授权的恶意编辑，填补了视频保护领域的空白。

Abstract: With the rapid development of generative technology, current generative
models can generate high-fidelity digital content and edit it in a controlled
manner. However, there is a risk that malicious individuals might misuse these
capabilities for misleading activities. Although existing research has
attempted to shield photographic images from being manipulated by generative
models, there remains a significant disparity in the protection offered to
video content editing. To bridge the gap, we propose a protection method named
VideoGuard, which can effectively protect videos from unauthorized malicious
editing. This protection is achieved through the subtle introduction of nearly
unnoticeable perturbations that interfere with the functioning of the intended
generative diffusion models. Due to the redundancy between video frames, and
inter-frame attention mechanism in video diffusion models, simply applying
image-based protection methods separately to every video frame can not shield
video from unauthorized editing. To tackle the above challenge, we adopt joint
frame optimization, treating all video frames as an optimization entity.
Furthermore, we extract video motion information and fuse it into optimization
objectives. Thus, these alterations can effectively force the models to produce
outputs that are implausible and inconsistent. We provide a pipeline to
optimize this perturbation. Finally, we use both objective metrics and
subjective metrics to demonstrate the efficacy of our method, and the results
show that the protection performance of VideoGuard is superior to all the
baseline methods.

Motivation: 探讨文本到图像生成中对象的人口统计偏见，揭示模型中的隐性偏见及其对社会的影响。

Method: 提出SODA框架，通过比较中性提示和人口统计提示生成的2700张图像，分析三种先进模型的视觉属性差异。

Result: 发现模型生成的图像中存在与人口统计相关的视觉属性偏见，某些模型输出多样性较低，加剧了视觉差异。

Conclusion: SODA框架为揭示生成模型中的偏见提供了实用方法，是迈向更系统、负责任AI开发的重要一步。

Abstract: While prior research on text-to-image generation has predominantly focused on
biases in human depictions, we investigate a more subtle yet pervasive
phenomenon: demographic bias in generated objects (e.g., cars). We introduce
SODA (Stereotyped Object Diagnostic Audit), a novel framework for
systematically measuring such biases. Our approach compares visual attributes
of objects generated with demographic cues (e.g., "for young people'') to those
from neutral prompts, across 2,700 images produced by three state-of-the-art
models (GPT Image-1, Imagen 4, and Stable Diffusion) in five object categories.
Through a comprehensive analysis, we uncover strong associations between
specific demographic groups and visual attributes, such as recurring color
patterns prompted by gender or ethnicity cues. These patterns reflect and
reinforce not only well-known stereotypes but also more subtle and unintuitive
biases. We also observe that some models generate less diverse outputs, which
in turn amplifies the visual disparities compared to neutral prompts. Our
proposed auditing framework offers a practical approach for testing, revealing
how stereotypes still remain embedded in today's generative models. We see this
as an essential step toward more systematic and responsible AI development.

Abstract: Retinal microvascular imaging is increasingly recognised as a non invasive
method for evaluating systemic vascular and metabolic health. However, the
association between lipidomics and retinal vasculature remains inadequate. This
study investigates the relationships between serum lipid subclasses, free fatty
acids (FA), diacylglycerols (DAG), triacylglycerols (TAG), and cholesteryl
esters (CE), and retinal microvascular characteristics in a large
population-based cohort. Using Spearman correlation analysis, we examined the
interconnection between lipid subclasses and ten retinal microvascular traits,
applying the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (BH-FDR) to adjust for
statistical significance.
  Results indicated that FA were linked to retinal vessel twistiness, while CE
correlated with the average widths of arteries and veins. Conversely, DAG and
TAG showed negative correlations with the width and complexity of arterioles
and venules. These findings suggest that retinal vascular architecture reflects
distinct circulating lipid profiles, supporting its role as a non-invasive
marker of systemic metabolic health. This study is the first to integrate deep
learning (DL)derived retinal traits with lipidomic subclasses in a healthy
cohort, thereby providing insights into microvascular structural changes
independent of disease status or treatment effects.

Conclusion: MetaScope成功填补了金属透镜内窥镜的研究空白，为超微成像提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Miniaturized endoscopy has advanced accurate visual perception within the
human body. Prevailing research remains limited to conventional cameras
employing convex lenses, where the physical constraints with millimetre-scale
thickness impose serious impediments on the micro-level clinical. Recently,
with the emergence of meta-optics, ultra-micro imaging based on metalenses
(micron-scale) has garnered great attention, serving as a promising solution.
However, due to the physical difference of metalens, there is a large gap in
data acquisition and algorithm research. In light of this, we aim to bridge
this unexplored gap, advancing the novel metalens endoscopy. First, we
establish datasets for metalens endoscopy and conduct preliminary optical
simulation, identifying two derived optical issues that physically adhere to
strong optical priors. Second, we propose MetaScope, a novel optics-driven
neural network tailored for metalens endoscopy driven by physical optics.
MetaScope comprises two novel designs: Optics-informed Intensity Adjustment
(OIA), rectifying intensity decay by learning optical embeddings, and
Optics-informed Chromatic Correction (OCC), mitigating chromatic aberration by
learning spatial deformations informed by learned Point Spread Function (PSF)
distributions. To enhance joint learning, we further deploy a gradient-guided
distillation to transfer knowledge from the foundational model adaptively.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MetaScope not only outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both metalens segmentation and restoration but also
achieves impressive generalized ability in real biomedical scenes.

Motivation: 冷启动主动学习在医学图像分析中缺乏高效的特征提取方法，现有方法依赖自监督学习，效率低且特征表示不足。基础模型（FMs）具有强大特征提取能力，但缺乏相关研究。

Method: 提出MedCAL-Bench基准，评估14种FMs和7种CSAL策略在7个数据集上的表现，涵盖分类和分割任务。

Result: 1）FMs在CSAL中表现良好，DINO家族在分割任务中最佳；2）FMs在分割任务中差异较大，分类任务中差异较小；3）不同数据集需采用不同样本选择策略。

Conclusion: MedCAL-Bench为医学图像分析中的CSAL提供了首个系统性基准，展示了FMs的潜力，并强调了策略选择的重要性。

Abstract: Cold-Start Active Learning (CSAL) aims to select informative samples for
annotation without prior knowledge, which is important for improving annotation
efficiency and model performance under a limited annotation budget in medical
image analysis. Most existing CSAL methods rely on Self-Supervised Learning
(SSL) on the target dataset for feature extraction, which is inefficient and
limited by insufficient feature representation. Recently, pre-trained
Foundation Models (FMs) have shown powerful feature extraction ability with a
potential for better CSAL. However, this paradigm has been rarely investigated,
with a lack of benchmarks for comparison of FMs in CSAL tasks. To this end, we
propose MedCAL-Bench, the first systematic FM-based CSAL benchmark for medical
image analysis. We evaluate 14 FMs and 7 CSAL strategies across 7 datasets
under different annotation budgets, covering classification and segmentation
tasks from diverse medical modalities. It is also the first CSAL benchmark that
evaluates both the feature extraction and sample selection stages. Our
experimental results reveal that: 1) Most FMs are effective feature extractors
for CSAL, with DINO family performing the best in segmentation; 2) The
performance differences of these FMs are large in segmentation tasks, while
small for classification; 3) Different sample selection strategies should be
considered in CSAL on different datasets, with Active Learning by Processing
Surprisal (ALPS) performing the best in segmentation while RepDiv leading for
classification. The code is available at

Attention Zoom on multiple CNN backbones using CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet,
showing consistent improvements in Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy.
Visual analyses using Grad-CAM and spatial warping reveal that our method
encourages fine-grained and diverse attention patterns. Our results confirm the
effectiveness and generality of the proposed layer for improving CCNs with

Conclusion: 自适应指导调度是释放快速流式生成模型潜力的关键。

Abstract: Flow-based generative models have recently achieved remarkable progress in
image and video synthesis, with classifier-free guidance (CFG) becoming the
standard tool for high-fidelity, controllable generation. However, despite
their practical success, little is known about how guidance interacts with
different stages of the sampling process-especially in the fast, low-step
regimes typical of modern flow-based pipelines. In this work, we uncover and
analyze a fundamental instability: the earliest reverse steps are acutely
sensitive to the guidance scale, owing to a pronounced spike in the relative
strength (RATIO) of conditional to unconditional predictions. Through rigorous
theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we show that this RATIO spike is
intrinsic to the data distribution, independent of the model architecture, and
causes exponential error amplification when paired with strong guidance. To
address this, we propose a simple, theoretically grounded, RATIO-aware adaptive
guidance schedule that automatically dampens the guidance scale at early steps
based on the evolving RATIO, using a closed-form exponential decay. Our method
is lightweight, requires no additional inference overhead, and is compatible
with standard flow frameworks. Experiments across state-of-the-art image
(SD3.5, Lumina) and video (WAN2.1) models demonstrate that our approach enables
up to 3x faster sampling while maintaining or improving generation quality,
robustness, and semantic alignment. Extensive ablation studies further confirm
the generality and stability of our schedule across models, datasets, and
hyperparameters. Our findings highlight the critical role of stepwise guidance
adaptation in unlocking the full potential of fast flow-based generative
models.

challenges: (i) static learnable tokens struggle to capture the continuous and
diverse patterns of normal and anomalous states, limiting generalization to
unseen categories; (ii) fixed textual labels provide overly sparse category
information, making the model prone to overfitting to a specific semantic
subspace. To address these issues, we propose Conditional Prompt Synthesis
(CoPS), a novel framework that synthesizes dynamic prompts conditioned on
visual features to enhance ZSAD performance. Specifically, we extract
representative normal and anomaly prototypes from fine-grained patch features
and explicitly inject them into prompts, enabling adaptive state modeling.
Given the sparsity of class labels, we leverage a variational autoencoder to
model semantic image features and implicitly fuse varied class tokens into
prompts. Additionally, integrated with our spatially-aware alignment mechanism,
extensive experiments demonstrate that CoPS surpasses state-of-the-art methods
by 2.5% AUROC in both classification and segmentation across 13 industrial and
medical datasets. Code will be available at https://github.com/cqylunlun/CoPS.

Conclusion: 双摄像头框架有效解决了去摩尔纹中的关键挑战，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Moire patterns, unwanted color artifacts in images and videos, arise from the
interference between spatially high-frequency scene contents and the spatial
discrete sampling of digital cameras. Existing demoireing methods primarily
rely on single-camera image/video processing, which faces two critical
challenges: 1) distinguishing moire patterns from visually similar real
textures, and 2) preserving tonal consistency and temporal coherence while
removing moire artifacts. To address these issues, we propose a dual-camera
framework that captures synchronized videos of the same scene: one in focus
(retaining high-quality textures but may exhibit moire patterns) and one
defocused (with significantly reduced moire patterns but blurred textures). We
use the defocused video to help distinguish moire patterns from real texture,
so as to guide the demoireing of the focused video. We propose a frame-wise
demoireing pipeline, which begins with an optical flow based alignment step to
address any discrepancies in displacement and occlusion between the focused and
defocused frames. Then, we leverage the aligned defocused frame to guide the
demoireing of the focused frame using a multi-scale CNN and a multi-dimensional
training loss. To maintain tonal and temporal consistency, our final step
involves a joint bilateral filter to leverage the demoireing result from the
CNN as the guide to filter the input focused frame to obtain the final output.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework largely
outperforms state-of-the-art image and video demoireing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结肠镜视频的动态性和快速相机移动导致背景噪声和误检风险增加，需要一种鲁棒的检测方法。

Result: 在多个公开基准测试中表现优异，验证了方法的有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: AVPDN在视频息肉检测任务中具有竞争性性能，解决了动态视频中的噪声和误检问题。

Abstract: Accurate detection of polyps is of critical importance for the early and
intermediate stages of colorectal cancer diagnosis. Compared to static images,
dynamic colonoscopy videos provide more comprehensive visual information, which
can facilitate the development of effective treatment plans. However, unlike
fixed-camera recordings, colonoscopy videos often exhibit rapid camera
movement, introducing substantial background noise that disrupts the structural
integrity of the scene and increases the risk of false positives. To address
these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Video Polyp Detection Network
(AVPDN), a robust framework for multi-scale polyp detection in colonoscopy
videos. AVPDN incorporates two key components: the Adaptive Feature Interaction
and Augmentation (AFIA) module and the Scale-Aware Context Integration (SACI)
module. The AFIA module adopts a triple-branch architecture to enhance feature
representation. It employs dense self-attention for global context modeling,
sparse self-attention to mitigate the influence of low query-key similarity in
feature aggregation, and channel shuffle operations to facilitate inter-branch
information exchange. In parallel, the SACI module is designed to strengthen
multi-scale feature integration. It utilizes dilated convolutions with varying
receptive fields to capture contextual information at multiple spatial scales,
thereby improving the model's denoising capability. Experiments conducted on
several challenging public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization ability of the proposed method, achieving competitive
performance in video-based polyp detection tasks.

Result: 实验表明IKOD能有效减少幻觉并提升模型综合能力，且不增加额外计算成本。

Conclusion: IKOD是一种轻量高效的解码策略，适用于多种LVLM，无需额外训练即可显著改善模型性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
significant progress across multiple domains. However, these models still face
the inherent challenge of integrating vision and language for collaborative
inference, which often leads to "hallucinations", outputs that are not grounded
in the corresponding images. Many efforts have been made to address these
issues, but each comes with its own limitations, such as high computational
cost or expensive dataset annotation. Recent research shows that LVLMs exhibit
a long-term bias where hallucinations increase as the sequence length grows,
yet the underlying cause remains poorly understood. Building on extensive
research into attention mechanisms in LVLMs, we analyze the relationship
between this long-term bias and visual attention. In our research, we identify
a consistent phenomenon in current LVLMs: the model's attention to visual input
diminishes as the generated sequence grows, which we hypothesize to be a key
factor contributing to observed increasing hallucinations. Based on these
insights, we propose Image attention-guided Key-value merging cOllaborative
Decoding (IKOD), a collaborative decoding strategy generating more
image-focused sequences. This method derives logits from shorter sequences with
higher image attention through key-value merging and combines them with those
from the original decoding, effectively mitigating attention degradation and
suppressing hallucinations while not incurring too much inference cost.
Extensive experiments on both hallucination and comprehensive benchmarks
demonstrate IKOD's superior effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations and
improving comprehensive capacities for LVLMs. Importantly, IKOD requires no
additional training or external tools, making it a lightweight and efficient
framework applicable to various models.

Motivation: DiT模型在文本到图像生成中表现出色，但高计算成本和参数量限制了其在资源受限场景的应用。现有PTQ方法在极低比特设置下性能下降严重。

Method: 提出LRQ-DiT框架，包括Twin-Log量化（TLQ）和自适应旋转方案（ARS），分别解决权重分布不均和激活异常问题。

Result: 在PixArt和FLUX等数据集上验证，LRQ-DiT在低比特量化下保持了图像质量，优于现有PTQ基线。

Conclusion: LRQ-DiT为DiT模型提供了一种高效的低比特量化解决方案，显著减少了计算资源需求，同时保持了生成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved impressive performance in
text-to-image generation. However, their high computational cost and large
parameter sizes pose significant challenges for usage in resource-constrained
scenarios. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution to reduce
memory usage and accelerate inference, but existing PTQ methods suffer from
severe performance degradation under extreme low-bit settings. We identify two
key obstacles to low-bit post-training quantization for DiT models: (1) model
weights follow a Gaussian-like distribution with long tails, causing uniform
quantization to poorly allocate intervals and leading to significant errors;
(2) two types of activation outliers: (i) Mild Outliers with slightly elevated
values, and (ii) Salient Outliers with large magnitudes concentrated in
specific channels, which disrupt activation quantization. To address these
issues, we propose LRQ-DiT, an efficient and accurate PTQ framework. We
introduce Twin-Log Quantization (TLQ), a log-based method that aligns well with
the weight distribution and reduces quantization errors. We also propose an
Adaptive Rotation Scheme (ARS) that dynamically applies Hadamard or
outlier-aware rotations based on activation fluctuation, effectively mitigating
the impact of both types of outliers. We evaluate LRQ-DiT on PixArt and FLUX
under various bit-width settings, and validate the performance on COCO, MJHQ,
and sDCI datasets. LRQ-DiT achieves low-bit quantization of DiT models while
preserving image quality, outperforming existing PTQ baselines.

Motivation: 建筑行业资源消耗大，回收材料质量监控仍依赖人工，需更高效的视觉机器学习方法。

Result: 实验证明ParticleSAM优于原SAM方法，定量定性均有效。

Conclusion: ParticleSAM在建筑颗粒分割中表现优异，具广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: The construction industry represents a major sector in terms of resource
consumption. Recycled construction material has high reuse potential, but
quality monitoring of the aggregates is typically still performed with manual
methods. Vision-based machine learning methods could offer a faster and more
efficient solution to this problem, but existing segmentation methods are by
design not directly applicable to images with hundreds of small particles. In
this paper, we propose ParticleSAM, an adaptation of the segmentation
foundation model to images with small and dense objects such as the ones often
encountered in construction material particles. Moreover, we create a new dense
multi-particle dataset simulated from isolated particle images with the
assistance of an automated data generation and labeling pipeline. This dataset
serves as a benchmark for visual material quality control automation while our
segmentation approach has the potential to be valuable in application areas
beyond construction where small-particle segmentation is needed. Our
experimental results validate the advantages of our method by comparing to the
original SAM method both in quantitative and qualitative experiments.

TL;DR: 论文研究了稀疏字典学习（SDL）中稀疏性对图像恢复质量的影响，发现不同优化方法会导致不同的稀疏性模式，且高稀疏性通常不会损害恢复质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏性是SDL中关键属性，但如何在保证恢复质量的同时实现高稀疏性尚不明确。本文旨在探讨不同优化方法下稀疏性与恢复质量的关系。

Method: 通过多种优化方法（如迭代收缩算法）解决SDL的非光滑优化问题，分析不同方法产生的稀疏性模式。

Result: 研究发现不同优化方法会导致不同的稀疏性模式，且高稀疏性通常不会损害恢复质量，即使恢复图像与学习数据库差异较大。

Conclusion: 高稀疏性在SDL中是可实现的，且不会显著影响恢复质量，为图像处理任务提供了灵活性。

Abstract: Sparse dictionary learning (SDL) is a fundamental technique that is useful
for many image processing tasks. As an example we consider here image recovery,
where SDL can be cast as a nonsmooth optimization problem. For this kind of
problems, iterative shrinkage methods represent a powerful class of algorithms
that are subject of ongoing research. Sparsity is an important property of the
learned solutions, as exactly the sparsity enables efficient further processing
or storage. The sparsity implies that a recovered image is determined as a
combination of a number of dictionary elements that is as low as possible.
Therefore, the question arises, to which degree sparsity should be enforced in
SDL in order to not compromise recovery quality. In this paper we focus on the
sparsity of solutions that can be obtained using a variety of optimization
methods. It turns out that there are different sparsity regimes depending on
the method in use. Furthermore, we illustrate that high sparsity does in
general not compromise recovery quality, even if the recovered image is quite
different from the learning database.

Motivation: 现有模型难以捕捉医学数据中的多级语义关系，导致检索结果不可靠。

Method: PECM框架引入多级原型和双流置信度估计，利用原型相似性分布和自适应权重机制控制高不确定性数据的影响。

Result: 在多个数据集和任务中，PECM实现了最高10.17%的性能提升，达到新的SOTA。

Conclusion: PECM有效解决了医学数据中的模糊性问题，提升了复杂临床场景下的检索可靠性。

Abstract: In cross-modal retrieval tasks, such as image-to-report and report-to-image
retrieval, accurately aligning medical images with relevant text reports is
essential but challenging due to the inherent ambiguity and variability in
medical data. Existing models often struggle to capture the nuanced,
multi-level semantic relationships in radiology data, leading to unreliable
retrieval results. To address these issues, we propose the Prototype-Enhanced
Confidence Modeling (PECM) framework, which introduces multi-level prototypes
for each modality to better capture semantic variability and enhance retrieval
robustness. PECM employs a dual-stream confidence estimation that leverages
prototype similarity distributions and an adaptive weighting mechanism to
control the impact of high-uncertainty data on retrieval rankings. Applied to
radiology image-report datasets, our method achieves significant improvements
in retrieval precision and consistency, effectively handling data ambiguity and
advancing reliability in complex clinical scenarios. We report results on
multiple different datasets and tasks including fully supervised and zero-shot
retrieval obtaining performance gains of up to 10.17%, establishing in new
state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: 提出的自动化管道和评估指标为服装编辑任务提供了可靠的数据支持。

Abstract: Instruction-based garment editing enables precise image modifications via
natural language, with broad applications in fashion design and customization.
Unlike general editing tasks, it requires understanding garment-specific
semantics and attribute dependencies. However, progress is limited by the
scarcity of high-quality instruction-image pairs, as manual annotation is
costly and hard to scale. While MLLMs have shown promise in automated data
synthesis, their application to garment editing is constrained by imprecise
instruction modeling and a lack of fashion-specific supervisory signals. To
address these challenges, we present an automated pipeline for constructing a
garment editing dataset. We first define six editing instruction categories
aligned with real-world fashion workflows to guide the generation of balanced
and diverse instruction-image triplets. Second, we introduce Fashion Edit
Score, a semantic-aware evaluation metric that captures semantic dependencies
between garment attributes and provides reliable supervision during
construction. Using this pipeline, we construct a total of 52,257 candidate
triplets and retain 20,596 high-quality triplets to build EditGarment, the
first instruction-based dataset tailored to standalone garment editing. The

Conclusion: MAUP为跨域少样本医学图像分割提供了一种高效且无需训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-domain Few-shot Medical Image Segmentation (CD-FSMIS) is a potential
solution for segmenting medical images with limited annotation using knowledge
from other domains. The significant performance of current CD-FSMIS models
relies on the heavily training procedure over other source medical domains,
which degrades the universality and ease of model deployment. With the
development of large visual models of natural images, we propose a
training-free CD-FSMIS model that introduces the Multi-center Adaptive
Uncertainty-aware Prompting (MAUP) strategy for adapting the foundation model
Segment Anything Model (SAM), which is trained with natural images, into the
CD-FSMIS task. To be specific, MAUP consists of three key innovations: (1)
K-means clustering based multi-center prompts generation for comprehensive
spatial coverage, (2) uncertainty-aware prompts selection that focuses on the
challenging regions, and (3) adaptive prompt optimization that can dynamically
adjust according to the target region complexity. With the pre-trained DINOv2
feature encoder, MAUP achieves precise segmentation results across three
medical datasets without any additional training compared with several
conventional CD-FSMIS models and training-free FSMIS model. The source code is

Motivation: 终身行人重识别（LReID）的关键挑战是平衡旧知识的保留与新信息的适应。现有方法通常忽略特定分布感知和跨域统一知识学习。

Method: 提出DKUA框架，包括分布感知模型、自适应知识巩固（AKC）、统一知识关联（UKA）机制和基于分布的知识转移（DKT）。

Result: 实验显示DKUA在抗遗忘和泛化能力上分别平均提升7.6%/5.3%（mAP/R@1）。

Conclusion: DKUA通过域风格建模和跨域知识统一，显著提升了LReID的性能。

Abstract: Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) encounters a key challenge:
balancing the preservation of old knowledge with adaptation to new information.
Existing LReID methods typically employ knowledge distillation to enforce
representation alignment. However, these approaches ignore two crucial aspects:
specific distribution awareness and cross-domain unified knowledge learning,
both of which are essential for addressing this challenge. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel distribution-aware knowledge unification and
association (DKUA) framework where domain-style modeling is performed for each
instance to propagate domain-specific representations, enhancing
anti-forgetting and generalization capacity. Specifically, we design a
distribution-aware model to transfer instance-level representations of the
current domain into the domain-specific representations with the different
domain styles, preserving learned knowledge without storing old samples. Next,
we propose adaptive knowledge consolidation (AKC) to dynamically generate the
unified representation as a cross-domain representation center. To further
mitigate forgetting, we develop a unified knowledge association (UKA)
mechanism, which explores the unified representation as a bridge to explicitly
model inter-domain associations, reducing inter-domain gaps. Finally,
distribution-based knowledge transfer (DKT) is proposed to prevent the current
domain distribution from deviating from the cross-domain distribution center,
improving adaptation capacity. Experimental results show our DKUA outperforms
the existing methods by 7.6%/5.3% average mAP/R@1 improvement on
anti-forgetting and generalization capacity, respectively. Our code will be
publicly released.

Result: 在三个数据集上验证，SemanticStitcher在边界匹配上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SemanticStitcher为组织病理学提供了鲁棒的自动拼接解决方案。

Abstract: In histopathology, tissue samples are often larger than a standard microscope
slide, making stitching of multiple fragments necessary to process entire
structures such as tumors. Automated stitching is a prerequisite for scaling
analysis, but is challenging due to possible tissue loss during preparation,
inhomogeneous morphological distortion, staining inconsistencies, missing
regions due to misalignment on the slide, or frayed tissue edges. This limits
state-of-the-art stitching methods using boundary shape matching algorithms to
reconstruct artificial whole mount slides (WMS). Here, we introduce
SemanticStitcher using latent feature representations derived from a visual
histopathology foundation model to identify neighboring areas in different
fragments. Robust pose estimation based on a large number of semantic matching
candidates derives a mosaic of multiple fragments to form the WMS. Experiments
on three different histopathology datasets demonstrate that SemanticStitcher
yields robust WMS mosaicing and consistently outperforms the state of the art
in correct boundary matches.

Conclusion: CoEmoGen为情感驱动的艺术创作提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案，并发布了EmoArt数据集以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Emotional Image Content Generation (EICG) aims to generate semantically clear
and emotionally faithful images based on given emotion categories, with broad
application prospects. While recent text-to-image diffusion models excel at
generating concrete concepts, they struggle with the complexity of abstract
emotions. There have also emerged methods specifically designed for EICG, but
they excessively rely on word-level attribute labels for guidance, which suffer
from semantic incoherence, ambiguity, and limited scalability. To address these
challenges, we propose CoEmoGen, a novel pipeline notable for its semantic
coherence and high scalability. Specifically, leveraging multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), we construct high-quality captions focused on
emotion-triggering content for context-rich semantic guidance. Furthermore,
inspired by psychological insights, we design a Hierarchical Low-Rank
Adaptation (HiLoRA) module to cohesively model both polarity-shared low-level
features and emotion-specific high-level semantics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate CoEmoGen's superiority in emotional faithfulness and semantic
coherence from quantitative, qualitative, and user study perspectives. To
intuitively showcase scalability, we curate EmoArt, a large-scale dataset of
emotionally evocative artistic images, providing endless inspiration for
emotion-driven artistic creation. The dataset and code are available at

Abstract: Despite substantial progress in anomaly synthesis methods, existing
diffusion-based and coarse inpainting pipelines commonly suffer from structural
deficiencies such as micro-structural discontinuities, limited semantic
controllability, and inefficient generation. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce ARAS, a language-conditioned, auto-regressive anomaly synthesis
approach that precisely injects local, text-specified defects into normal
images via token-anchored latent editing. Leveraging a hard-gated
auto-regressive operator and a training-free, context-preserving masked
sampling kernel, ARAS significantly enhances defect realism, preserves
fine-grained material textures, and provides continuous semantic control over
synthesized anomalies. Integrated within our Quality-Aware Re-weighted Anomaly
Detection (QARAD) framework, we further propose a dynamic weighting strategy
that emphasizes high-quality synthetic samples by computing an image-text
similarity score with a dual-encoder model. Extensive experiments across three
benchmark datasets-MVTec AD, VisA, and BTAD, demonstrate that our QARAD
outperforms SOTA methods in both image- and pixel-level anomaly detection
tasks, achieving improved accuracy, robustness, and a 5 times synthesis speedup
compared to diffusion-based alternatives. Our complete code and synthesized
dataset will be publicly available.

Abstract: Conversion of spoken mathematical expressions is a challenging task that
involves transcribing speech into a strictly structured symbolic representation
while addressing the ambiguity inherent in the pronunciation of equations.
Although significant progress has been achieved in automatic speech recognition
(ASR) and language models (LM), the problem of converting spoken mathematics
into LaTeX remains underexplored. This task directly applies to educational and
research domains, such as lecture transcription or note creation. Based on ASR
post-correction, prior work requires 2 transcriptions, focuses only on isolated
equations, has a limited test set, and provides neither training data nor
multilingual coverage. To address these issues, we present the first fully
open-source large-scale dataset, comprising over 66,000 human-annotated audio
samples of mathematical equations and sentences in both English and Russian,
drawn from diverse scientific domains. In addition to the ASR post-correction
models and few-shot prompting, we apply audio language models, demonstrating
comparable character error rate (CER) results on the MathSpeech benchmark (28%
vs. 30%) for the equations conversion. In contrast, on the proposed
S2L-equations benchmark, our models outperform the MathSpeech model by a
substantial margin of more than 40 percentage points, even after accounting for
LaTeX formatting artifacts (27% vs. 64%). We establish the first benchmark for
mathematical sentence recognition (S2L-sentences) and achieve an equation CER
of 40%. This work lays the groundwork for future advances in multimodal AI,
with a particular focus on mathematical content recognition.

TL;DR: 使用无人机和热成像技术估算奥地利东南部野生动物密度，与传统相机陷阱方法对比，结果显示无人机方法更高效且结果相似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统野生动物密度估算方法（如捕获-重捕、距离采样或相机陷阱）劳动密集或空间受限，无人机提供了一种高效、非侵入性的替代方案。

Method: 在无叶期使用无人机进行航测，结合热成像和RGB图像，采用多种密度外推方法（如朴素面积外推、自举法和零膨胀负二项模型），并与相机陷阱的随机遭遇模型（REM）对比。

Result: 无人机方法估算的密度与REM相似，但通常更高，反映了白天开放和森林区域的活动，而REM更反映长期森林区域活动。

Conclusion: 无人机是一种有前景、可扩展的野生动物密度估算方法，提供了与传统方法不同的视角。

Abstract: We use unmanned aerial drones to estimate wildlife density in southeastern
Austria and compare these estimates to camera trap data. Traditional methods
like capture-recapture, distance sampling, or camera traps are well-established
but labour-intensive or spatially constrained. Using thermal (IR) and RGB
imagery, drones enable efficient, non-intrusive animal counting. Our surveys
were conducted during the leafless period on single days in October and
November 2024 in three areas of a sub-Illyrian hill and terrace landscape.
Flight transects were based on predefined launch points using a 350 m grid and
an algorithm that defined the direction of systematically randomized transects.
This setup allowed surveying large areas in one day using multiple drones,
minimizing double counts. Flight altitude was set at 60 m to avoid disturbing
roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) while ensuring detection. Animals were manually
annotated in the recorded imagery and extrapolated to densities per square
kilometer. We applied three extrapolation methods with increasing complexity:
naive area-based extrapolation, bootstrapping, and zero-inflated negative
binomial modelling. For comparison, a Random Encounter Model (REM) estimate was
calculated using camera trap data from the flight period. The drone-based
methods yielded similar results, generally showing higher densities than REM,
except in one area in October. We hypothesize that drone-based density reflects
daytime activity in open and forested areas, while REM estimates average
activity over longer periods within forested zones. Although both approaches
estimate density, they offer different perspectives on wildlife presence. Our
results show that drones offer a promising, scalable method for wildlife
density estimation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对农村历史地图的可扩展高效建筑提取方法，通过分层机器学习减少计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在分析广阔农村地区时的计算密集问题，支持历史人口普查验证和废弃聚落定位。

Method: 采用分层机器学习方法，先用CNN分类器过滤无建筑区域，再用CNN分割算法提取建筑特征。

Result: 在爱尔兰历史地图上验证，性能高效，发现了一个可能在大饥荒时期废弃的聚落。

Conclusion: 该方法为历史和考古研究提供了高效工具，有助于发现历史变迁。

Abstract: Historical maps offer a valuable lens through which to study past landscapes
and settlement patterns. While prior research has leveraged machine learning
based techniques to extract building footprints from historical maps, such
approaches have largely focused on urban areas and tend to be computationally
intensive. This presents a challenge for research questions requiring analysis
across extensive rural regions, such as verifying historical census data or
locating abandoned settlements. In this paper, this limitation is addressed by
proposing a scalable and efficient pipeline tailored to rural maps with sparse
building distributions. The method described employs a hierarchical machine
learning based approach: convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers are
first used to progressively filter out map sections unlikely to contain
buildings, significantly reducing the area requiring detailed analysis. The
remaining high probability sections are then processed using CNN segmentation
algorithms to extract building features. The pipeline is validated using test
sections from the Ordnance Survey Ireland historical 25 inch map series and 6
inch map series, demonstrating both high performance and improved efficiency
compared to conventional segmentation-only approaches. Application of the
technique to both map series, covering the same geographic region, highlights
its potential for historical and archaeological discovery. Notably, the
pipeline identified a settlement of approximately 22 buildings in Tully, Co.
Galway, present in the 6 inch map, produced in 1839, but absent from the 25
inch map, produced in 1899, suggesting it may have been abandoned during the
Great Famine period.

Abstract: Recent studies have highlighted the potential of adapting the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) for various downstream tasks. However, constructing a more
powerful and generalizable encoder to further enhance performance remains an
open challenge. In this work, we propose SAM2-UNeXT, an advanced framework that
builds upon the core principles of SAM2-UNet while extending the
representational capacity of SAM2 through the integration of an auxiliary
DINOv2 encoder. By incorporating a dual-resolution strategy and a dense glue
layer, our approach enables more accurate segmentation with a simple
architecture, relaxing the need for complex decoder designs. Extensive
experiments conducted on four benchmarks, including dichotomous image
segmentation, camouflaged object detection, marine animal segmentation, and
remote sensing saliency detection, demonstrate the superior performance of our
proposed method. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 雷达姿态估计具有隐私保护和光照不变性优势，但受噪声和多路径效应影响。RadProPoser旨在解决这些问题并提供可解释的不确定性量化。

Method: 采用概率编码-解码架构，结合变分推理和关键点回归，处理3发4收MIMO雷达数据，预测26个三维关节位置及不确定性。

Result: 在光学动捕数据集上，平均关节位置误差为6.425 cm，45度视角下为5.678 cm。不确定性校准误差低至0.021，数据增强效果显著。

Conclusion: RadProPoser是首个端到端雷达姿态估计系统，为可靠的人体运动分析奠定了基础。

Abstract: Radar-based human pose estimation (HPE) provides a privacy-preserving,
illumination-invariant sensing modality but is challenged by noisy,
multipath-affected measurements. We introduce RadProPoser, a probabilistic
encoder-decoder architecture that processes complex-valued radar tensors from a
compact 3-transmitter, 4-receiver MIMO radar. By incorporating variational
inference into keypoint regression, RadProPoser jointly predicts 26
three-dimensional joint locations alongside heteroscedastic aleatoric
uncertainties and can be recalibrated to predict total uncertainty. We explore
different probabilistic formulations using both Gaussian and Laplace
distributions for latent priors and likelihoods. On our newly released dataset
with optical motion-capture ground truth, RadProPoser achieves an overall mean
per-joint position error (MPJPE) of 6.425 cm, with 5.678 cm at the 45 degree
aspect angle. The learned uncertainties exhibit strong alignment with actual
pose errors and can be calibrated to produce reliable prediction intervals,
with our best configuration achieving an expected calibration error of 0.021.
As an additional demonstration, sampling from these latent distributions
enables effective data augmentation for downstream activity classification,
resulting in an F1 score of 0.870. To our knowledge, this is the first
end-to-end radar tensor-based HPE system to explicitly model and quantify
per-joint uncertainty from raw radar tensor data, establishing a foundation for
explainable and reliable human motion analysis in radar applications.

Result: 在13个基准测试中显著提升精度和mAP，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: DyCAF-Net是动态场景中鲁棒的检测解决方案，适用于医疗、监控和自动驾驶等领域。

Abstract: Recent advancements in object detection rely on modular architectures with
multi-scale fusion and attention mechanisms. However, static fusion heuristics
and class-agnostic attention limit performance in dynamic scenes with
occlusions, clutter, and class imbalance. We introduce Dynamic Class-Aware
Fusion Network (DyCAF-Net) that addresses these challenges through three
innovations: (1) an input-conditioned equilibrium-based neck that iteratively
refines multi-scale features via implicit fixed-point modeling, (2) a dual
dynamic attention mechanism that adaptively recalibrates channel and spatial
responses using input- and class-dependent cues, and (3) class-aware feature
adaptation that modulates features to prioritize discriminative regions for
rare classes. Through comprehensive ablation studies with YOLOv8 and related
architectures, alongside benchmarking against nine state-of-the-art baselines,
DyCAF-Net achieves significant improvements in precision, mAP@50, and mAP@50-95
across 13 diverse benchmarks, including occlusion-heavy and long-tailed
datasets. The framework maintains computational efficiency ($\sim$11.1M
parameters) and competitive inference speeds, while its adaptability to scale
variance, semantic overlaps, and class imbalance positions it as a robust
solution for real-world detection tasks in medical imaging, surveillance, and
autonomous systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云层和夜间条件限制了多光谱卫星图像的可用性和可靠性，而Sentinel-1雷达数据不受这些限制。

Method: 采用基于条件潜在流匹配的多阶段训练方法，并首次将余弦调度与流匹配结合。

Result: CloudBreaker在生成的光学图像中表现出高保真度（FID为0.7432），NDWI和NDVI的结构相似性指数分别为0.6156和0.6874。

Conclusion: CloudBreaker为多光谱数据不可靠或不可用的遥感应用提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Cloud cover and nighttime conditions remain significant limitations in
satellite-based remote sensing, often restricting the availability and
usability of multi-spectral imagery. In contrast, Sentinel-1 radar images are
unaffected by cloud cover and can provide consistent data regardless of weather
or lighting conditions. To address the challenges of limited satellite imagery,
we propose CloudBreaker, a novel framework that generates high-quality
multi-spectral Sentinel-2 signals from Sentinel-1 data. This includes the
reconstruction of optical (RGB) images as well as critical vegetation and water
indices such as NDVI and NDWI.We employed a novel multi-stage training approach
based on conditional latent flow matching and, to the best of our knowledge,
are the first to integrate cosine scheduling with flow matching. CloudBreaker
demonstrates strong performance, achieving a Frechet Inception Distance (FID)
score of 0.7432, indicating high fidelity and realism in the generated optical
imagery. The model also achieved Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of
0.6156 for NDWI and 0.6874 for NDVI, indicating a high degree of structural
similarity. This establishes CloudBreaker as a promising solution for a wide
range of remote sensing applications where multi-spectral data is typically
unavailable or unreliable

Motivation: 事件相机具有高动态范围和微秒级延迟的特性，适合捕捉人脸表情的动态变化，但现有方法性能有限。

Method: 使用对抗生成方法预训练编码器，迁移至表情识别系统；结合LSTM和TIE表示捕捉长期动态。

Result: 在e-CK+数据库上达到93.6%的识别率，比现有方法提升25.9%以上。

Conclusion: evTransFER框架显著提升了事件相机的人脸表情识别性能，证明了迁移学习和动态特征提取的有效性。

Abstract: Event-based cameras are bio-inspired vision sensors that asynchronously
capture per-pixel intensity changes with microsecond latency, high temporal
resolution, and high dynamic range, providing valuable information about the
spatio-temporal dynamics of the scene. In the present work, we propose
evTransFER, a transfer learning-based framework and architecture for face
expression recognition using event-based cameras. The main contribution is a
feature extractor designed to encode the spatio-temporal dynamics of faces,
built by training an adversarial generative method on a different problem
(facial reconstruction) and then transferring the trained encoder weights to
the face expression recognition system. We show that this proposed transfer
learning method greatly improves the ability to recognize facial expressions
compared to training a network from scratch. In addition, we propose an
architecture that incorporates an LSTM to capture longer-term facial expression
dynamics, and we introduce a new event-based representation, referred to as
TIE, both of which further improve the results. We evaluate the proposed
framework on the event-based facial expression database e-CK+ and compare it to
state-of-the-art methods. The results show that the proposed framework
evTransFER achieves a 93.6\% recognition rate on the e-CK+ database,
significantly improving the accuracy (25.9\% points or more) when compared to
state-of-the-art performance for similar problems.

Conclusion: FPG-NAS是首个专为6DoF姿态估计设计的可微分NAS框架，显著提升了效率与性能。

Abstract: We introduce FPG-NAS, a FLOPs-aware Gated Differentiable Neural Architecture
Search framework for efficient 6DoF object pose estimation. Estimating 3D
rotation and translation from a single image has been widely investigated yet
remains computationally demanding, limiting applicability in
resource-constrained scenarios. FPG-NAS addresses this by proposing a
specialized differentiable NAS approach for 6DoF pose estimation, featuring a
task-specific search space and a differentiable gating mechanism that enables
discrete multi-candidate operator selection, thus improving architectural
diversity. Additionally, a FLOPs regularization term ensures a balanced
trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. The framework explores a vast search
space of approximately 10\textsuperscript{92} possible architectures.
Experiments on the LINEMOD and SPEED+ datasets demonstrate that FPG-NAS-derived
models outperform previous methods under strict FLOPs constraints. To the best
of our knowledge, FPG-NAS is the first differentiable NAS framework
specifically designed for 6DoF object pose estimation.

Conclusion: Uni3R为可泛化、统一的3D场景重建与理解提供了新范式。

Abstract: Reconstructing and semantically interpreting 3D scenes from sparse 2D views
remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Conventional methods often
decouple semantic understanding from reconstruction or necessitate costly
per-scene optimization, thereby restricting their scalability and
generalizability. In this paper, we introduce Uni3R, a novel feed-forward
framework that jointly reconstructs a unified 3D scene representation enriched
with open-vocabulary semantics, directly from unposed multi-view images. Our
approach leverages a Cross-View Transformer to robustly integrate information
across arbitrary multi-view inputs, which then regresses a set of 3D Gaussian
primitives endowed with semantic feature fields. This unified representation
facilitates high-fidelity novel view synthesis, open-vocabulary 3D semantic
segmentation, and depth prediction, all within a single, feed-forward pass.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Uni3R establishes a new state-of-the-art
across multiple benchmarks, including 25.07 PSNR on RE10K and 55.84 mIoU on
ScanNet. Our work signifies a novel paradigm towards generalizable, unified 3D

Abstract: We would like to estimate the pose and full shape of an object from a single

propose OmniShape, the first method of its kind to enable probabilistic pose

completion can be decoupled into two multi-modal distributions: one capturing
how measurements project into a normalized object reference frame defined by
the dataset and the other modelling a prior over object geometries represented
as triplanar neural fields. By training separate conditional diffusion models
for these two distributions, we enable sampling multiple hypotheses from the
joint pose and shape distribution. OmniShape demonstrates compelling
performance on challenging real world datasets. Project website:

TL;DR: Veila提出了一种基于条件扩散框架的方法，通过RGB图像生成可控的全景LiDAR数据，解决了现有方法在空间控制和模态对齐上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成全景LiDAR数据时，要么缺乏可控性，要么依赖文本引导而缺乏细粒度空间控制。利用单目RGB图像作为控制信号是一种低成本且可扩展的替代方案，但仍面临语义深度不一致、模态差异和结构一致性等挑战。

Method: Veila框架包含三个核心组件：置信感知条件机制（CACM）平衡语义和深度线索；几何跨模态对齐（GCMA）增强RGB-LiDAR对齐；全景特征一致性（PFC）确保全局结构一致性。还提出了两个评估指标。

Result: 在nuScenes、SemanticKITTI和KITTI-Weather基准测试中，Veila实现了最先进的生成保真度和跨模态一致性，并能通过生成数据增强提升下游LiDAR语义分割性能。

Conclusion: Veila通过创新的条件扩散框架，成功解决了RGB图像生成全景LiDAR数据的核心挑战，为自动驾驶和机器人领域的3D感知提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Realistic and controllable panoramic LiDAR data generation is critical for
scalable 3D perception in autonomous driving and robotics. Existing methods
either perform unconditional generation with poor controllability or adopt
text-guided synthesis, which lacks fine-grained spatial control. Leveraging a
monocular RGB image as a spatial control signal offers a scalable and low-cost
alternative, which remains an open problem. However, it faces three core
challenges: (i) semantic and depth cues from RGB are vary spatially,
complicating reliable conditioning generation; (ii) modality gaps between RGB
appearance and LiDAR geometry amplify alignment errors under noisy diffusion;
and (iii) maintaining structural coherence between monocular RGB and panoramic
LiDAR is challenging, particularly in non-overlap regions between images and
LiDAR. To address these challenges, we propose Veila, a novel conditional
diffusion framework that integrates: a Confidence-Aware Conditioning Mechanism
(CACM) that strengthens RGB conditioning by adaptively balancing semantic and
depth cues according to their local reliability; a Geometric Cross-Modal
Alignment (GCMA) for robust RGB-LiDAR alignment under noisy diffusion; and a
Panoramic Feature Coherence (PFC) for enforcing global structural consistency
across monocular RGB and panoramic LiDAR. Additionally, we introduce two
metrics, Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency and Cross-Modal Depth Consistency, to
evaluate alignment quality across modalities. Experiments on nuScenes,
SemanticKITTI, and our proposed KITTI-Weather benchmark demonstrate that Veila
achieves state-of-the-art generation fidelity and cross-modal consistency,
while enabling generative data augmentation that improves downstream LiDAR
semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Controllable generation of realistic LiDAR scenes is crucial for applications
such as autonomous driving and robotics. While recent diffusion-based models
achieve high-fidelity LiDAR generation, they lack explicit control over
foreground objects and spatial relationships, limiting their usefulness for
scenario simulation and safety validation. To address these limitations, we
propose Large-scale Layout-guided LiDAR generation model ("La La LiDAR"), a
novel layout-guided generative framework that introduces semantic-enhanced
scene graph diffusion with relation-aware contextual conditioning for
structured LiDAR layout generation, followed by foreground-aware control
injection for complete scene generation. This enables customizable control over
object placement while ensuring spatial and semantic consistency. To support
our structured LiDAR generation, we introduce Waymo-SG and nuScenes-SG, two
large-scale LiDAR scene graph datasets, along with new evaluation metrics for
layout synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that La La LiDAR achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both LiDAR generation and downstream perception
tasks, establishing a new benchmark for controllable 3D scene generation.

Abstract: Generative world models have become essential data engines for autonomous
driving, yet most existing efforts focus on videos or occupancy grids,
overlooking the unique LiDAR properties. Extending LiDAR generation to dynamic
4D world modeling presents challenges in controllability, temporal coherence,
and evaluation standardization. To this end, we present LiDARCrafter, a unified
framework for 4D LiDAR generation and editing. Given free-form natural language
inputs, we parse instructions into ego-centric scene graphs, which condition a
tri-branch diffusion network to generate object structures, motion
trajectories, and geometry. These structured conditions enable diverse and
fine-grained scene editing. Additionally, an autoregressive module generates
temporally coherent 4D LiDAR sequences with smooth transitions. To support
standardized evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark with diverse
metrics spanning scene-, object-, and sequence-level aspects. Experiments on
the nuScenes dataset using this benchmark demonstrate that LiDARCrafter
achieves state-of-the-art performance in fidelity, controllability, and
temporal consistency across all levels, paving the way for data augmentation

Abstract: Controllable ultra-long video generation is a fundamental yet challenging
task. Although existing methods are effective for short clips, they struggle to
scale due to issues such as temporal inconsistency and visual degradation. In
this paper, we initially investigate and identify three key factors: separate
noise initialization, independent control signal normalization, and the
limitations of single-modality guidance. To address these issues, we propose
LongVie, an end-to-end autoregressive framework for controllable long video
generation. LongVie introduces two core designs to ensure temporal consistency:
1) a unified noise initialization strategy that maintains consistent generation
across clips, and 2) global control signal normalization that enforces
alignment in the control space throughout the entire video. To mitigate visual
degradation, LongVie employs 3) a multi-modal control framework that integrates
both dense (e.g., depth maps) and sparse (e.g., keypoints) control signals,
complemented by 4) a degradation-aware training strategy that adaptively
balances modality contributions over time to preserve visual quality. We also
introduce LongVGenBench, a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 100
high-resolution videos spanning diverse real-world and synthetic environments,
each lasting over one minute. Extensive experiments show that LongVie achieves
state-of-the-art performance in long-range controllability, consistency, and
quality.

TL;DR: Trokens是一种新颖的方法，将轨迹点转化为语义感知的关系标记，用于动作识别，通过语义感知采样和运动建模框架提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频理解需要有效建模运动和外观信息，特别是在少样本动作识别中。现有方法在点跟踪方面有进展，但仍面临选择信息点和建模运动模式的挑战。

Method: 提出语义感知采样策略和运动建模框架（HoD），结合轨迹标记与语义特征增强外观特征。

Result: 在六个少样本动作识别基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: Trokens通过结合语义和运动信息，显著提升了少样本动作识别的效果。

Abstract: Video understanding requires effective modeling of both motion and appearance
information, particularly for few-shot action recognition. While recent
advances in point tracking have been shown to improve few-shot action
recognition, two fundamental challenges persist: selecting informative points
to track and effectively modeling their motion patterns. We present Trokens, a
novel approach that transforms trajectory points into semantic-aware relational
tokens for action recognition. First, we introduce a semantic-aware sampling
strategy to adaptively distribute tracking points based on object scale and
semantic relevance. Second, we develop a motion modeling framework that
captures both intra-trajectory dynamics through the Histogram of Oriented
Displacements (HoD) and inter-trajectory relationships to model complex action
patterns. Our approach effectively combines these trajectory tokens with
semantic features to enhance appearance features with motion information,
achieving state-of-the-art performance across six diverse few-shot action
recognition benchmarks: Something-Something-V2 (both full and small splits),
Kinetics, UCF101, HMDB51, and FineGym. For project page see

TL;DR: ICARE是一个基于大型语言模型代理的动态多选问答框架，用于评估放射学报告生成的质量，提供可解释的临床评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标缺乏可解释性，无法可靠评估生成的放射学报告。

Method: 利用两个代理（分别基于真实报告和生成报告）生成临床问题并互相测试，通过答案一致性评估报告的临床精确性和召回率。

Result: ICARE与专家判断更一致，对临床内容敏感且可重复，能揭示可解释的错误模式。

Conclusion: ICARE为放射学报告生成提供了透明、可解释的评估框架，优于现有指标。

Abstract: Radiological imaging is central to diagnosis, treatment planning, and
clinical decision-making. Vision-language foundation models have spurred
interest in automated radiology report generation (RRG), but safe deployment
requires reliable clinical evaluation of generated reports. Existing metrics
often rely on surface-level similarity or behave as black boxes, lacking
interpretability. We introduce ICARE (Interpretable and Clinically-grounded
Agent-based Report Evaluation), an interpretable evaluation framework
leveraging large language model agents and dynamic multiple-choice question
answering (MCQA). Two agents, each with either the ground-truth or generated
report, generate clinically meaningful questions and quiz each other. Agreement
on answers captures preservation and consistency of findings, serving as
interpretable proxies for clinical precision and recall. By linking scores to
question-answer pairs, ICARE enables transparent, and interpretable assessment.
Clinician studies show ICARE aligns significantly more with expert judgment
than prior metrics. Perturbation analyses confirm sensitivity to clinical
content and reproducibility, while model comparisons reveal interpretable error
patterns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决主观NLP任务中标注者分歧的问题，尤其是如何更好地表示不同人口统计群体的观点。

Method: 提出DEM-MoE模型，基于标注者人口统计数据路由输入到专家子网络；使用LLM生成合成标注数据并进行数据填充。

Result: DEM-MoE在人口统计群体中表现优异，尤其在标注分歧高的数据集上；合成标注与人类标注有一定一致性。

Conclusion: 通过DEM-MoE和合成数据填充，能更好地表示多样化的观点，具体策略需根据数据集结构调整。

Abstract: We present an approach to modeling annotator disagreement in subjective NLP
tasks through both architectural and data-centric innovations. Our model,
DEM-MoE (Demographic-Aware Mixture of Experts), routes inputs to expert
subnetworks based on annotator demographics, enabling it to better represent
structured, group-level variation compared to prior models. DEM-MoE
consistently performs competitively across demographic groups, and shows
especially strong results on datasets with high annotator disagreement. To
address sparse demographic coverage, we test whether LLM-generated synthetic
annotations via zero-shot persona prompting can be used for data imputation. We
show these synthetic judgments align moderately well with human annotations on
our data and offer a scalable way to potentially enrich training data. We then
propose and evaluate approaches for blending real and synthetic data using
strategies tailored to dataset structure. We find that the optimal strategies
depend on dataset structure. Together, these contributions improve the
representation of diverse perspectives.

*Giovanni Cherubin,Andrew Paverd*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Highlight & Summarize（H&S）的设计模式，通过分离高亮和总结两个步骤，防止大型语言模型（LLMs）被越狱或劫持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 防止LLMs被恶意用户通过特殊提示词攻击，生成不良内容或偏离其设计目的的任务。现有方法依赖系统提示强化或内容分类器，但易被绕过。

Method: 提出H&S设计模式，将检索增强生成（RAG）流程分为高亮器（提取相关段落）和总结器（生成答案），避免直接暴露用户问题给LLM。

Result: 实验表明，基于LLM的高亮器生成的H&S响应在正确性、相关性和质量上优于标准RAG流程。

Conclusion: H&S通过设计防止攻击，同时提升响应质量，为LLM安全提供新思路。

Abstract: Preventing jailbreaking and model hijacking of Large Language Models (LLMs)
is an important yet challenging task. For example, when interacting with a
chatbot, malicious users can input specially crafted prompts to cause the LLM
to generate undesirable content or perform a completely different task from its
intended purpose. Existing mitigations for such attacks typically rely on
hardening the LLM's system prompt or using a content classifier trained to
detect undesirable content or off-topic conversations. However, these
probabilistic approaches are relatively easy to bypass due to the very large
space of possible inputs and undesirable outputs. In this paper, we present and
evaluate Highlight & Summarize (H&S), a new design pattern for
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that prevents these attacks by
design. The core idea is to perform the same task as a standard RAG pipeline
(i.e., to provide natural language answers to questions, based on relevant
sources) without ever revealing the user's question to the generative LLM. This
is achieved by splitting the pipeline into two components: a highlighter, which
takes the user's question and extracts relevant passages ("highlights") from
the retrieved documents, and a summarizer, which takes the highlighted passages
and summarizes them into a cohesive answer. We describe several possible
instantiations of H&S and evaluate their generated responses in terms of
correctness, relevance, and response quality. Surprisingly, when using an
LLM-based highlighter, the majority of H&S responses are judged to be better
than those of a standard RAG pipeline.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了句法操作'Merge'的神经认知机制，发现不同复杂度的Merge结构可能由不同的认知机制支持。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Merge操作在句法中的核心作用及其潜在的神经认知基础，探索不同Merge结构的行为表现。

Method: 通过系统研究参与者对句法复杂度递增的句子的理解，进行聚类分析。

Result: 聚类分析揭示了三种不同的结构类型，可能与不同发展阶段和选择性损伤相关。

Conclusion: Merge可能在进化中突然出现，但不同类型的Merge对象可能由不同的认知机制支持。

Abstract: In the modern language sciences, the core computational operation of syntax,
'Merge', is defined as an operation that combines two linguistic units (e.g.,
'brown', 'cat') to form a categorized structure ('brown cat', a Noun Phrase).
This can then be further combined with additional linguistic units based on
this categorial information, respecting non-associativity such that abstract
grouping is respected. Some linguists have embraced the view that Merge is an
elementary, indivisible operation that emerged in a single evolutionary step.
From a neurocognitive standpoint, different mental objects constructed by Merge
may be supported by distinct mechanisms: (1) simple command constructions
(e.g., "eat apples"); (2) the merging of adjectives and nouns ("red boat"); and
(3) the merging of nouns with spatial prepositions ("laptop behind the sofa").
Here, we systematically investigate participants' comprehension of sentences
with increasing levels of syntactic complexity. Clustering analyses revealed
behavioral evidence for three distinct structural types, which we discuss as
potentially emerging at different developmental stages and subject to selective
impairment. While a Merge-based syntax may still have emerged suddenly in
evolutionary time, responsible for the structured symbolic turn our species
took, different cognitive mechanisms seem to underwrite the processing of
various types of Merge-based objects.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CMRF的新框架，通过迭代自评估推理机制提升多模态模型的常识推理能力，显著优于现有开源模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型和视觉语言模型在复杂、多步骤、跨模态的常识推理任务中表现不佳，缺乏深度推理能力，依赖表面关联。

Method: CMRF框架包含三个关键模块：RDU分解问题，CIE进行上下文推理，CAM评估逻辑一致性。结合自适应迭代优化策略，提升推理路径。

Result: 在VCR、A-OKVQA等基准测试中，CMRF平均准确率达69.4%，优于最佳开源基线2.4个百分点。

Conclusion: CMRF通过模块化设计和迭代优化，显著提升了多模态模型的推理能力，尤其在复杂场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements, current large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (LVLMs) continue to struggle with complex, multi-step,
cross-modal common sense reasoning tasks, often exhibiting a lack of
"deliberative thinking." They tend to rely on superficial associations rather
than deep, chained inference, particularly when integrating visual information
with abstract concepts. To address this, we propose the Coherent Multimodal
Reasoning Framework (CMRF), a novel approach that enhances LVLMs' common sense
reasoning capabilities through an iterative, self-evaluating inference
mechanism. CMRF mimics human problem-solving by decomposing complex queries,
generating step-by-step inferences, and self-correcting errors. Our framework
integrates three key modules: a Reasoning Decomposition Unit (RDU) for breaking
down problems into sub-questions, a Contextual Inference Engine (CIE) for
contextual inference, and a Coherence Assessment Module (CAM) for evaluating
logical consistency and confidence. Coupled with an Adaptive Iterative
Refinement strategy, CMRF systematically refines its reasoning paths. Built
upon LLaVA-1.6-34B and trained on a novel Multimodal Daily Activity Reasoning
(MDAR) dataset, CMRF achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source
LVLMs on challenging benchmarks like VCR, A-OKVQA, and DailyLife-MRC. It
attains an average accuracy of 69.4%, surpassing the best open-source baseline
by +2.4 percentage points, with particular strength in complex reasoning
scenarios. Extensive ablation studies and human evaluations confirm the
critical contributions of each module and the effectiveness of iterative
refinement in fostering more coherent and accurate reasoning.

Motivation: 探索感官语言与LIWC等传统风格特征的关系，以更高效的方式捕捉语言风格。

Method: 使用Reduced-Rank Ridge Regression（R4）提取低维特征，并引入SLIM-LLMs模型建模非线性关系。

Result: 低秩特征（r=24）在感官语言预测中表现与全特征（r=74）相当，SLIM-LLMs减少参数达80%且性能不降。

Conclusion: 低秩特征和SLIM-LLMs为高效语言风格建模提供了新方法，适用于多类文本。

Abstract: Sensorial language -- the language connected to our senses including vision,
sound, touch, taste, smell, and interoception, plays a fundamental role in how
we communicate experiences and perceptions. We explore the relationship between
sensorial language and traditional stylistic features, like those measured by
LIWC, using a novel Reduced-Rank Ridge Regression (R4) approach. We demonstrate
that low-dimensional latent representations of LIWC features r = 24 effectively
capture stylistic information for sensorial language prediction compared to the
full feature set (r = 74). We introduce Stylometrically Lean Interpretable
Models (SLIM-LLMs), which model non-linear relationships between these style
dimensions. Evaluated across five genres, SLIM-LLMs with low-rank LIWC features
match the performance of full-scale language models while reducing parameters
by up to 80%.

Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）的复杂性和难以理解性使其容易受到攻击，尤其是越狱攻击，因此需要开发强健的检测方法以确保其安全可靠的使用。

Method: 利用上下文共现矩阵和张量的潜在空间特性，提出了一种新颖的检测方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在数据稀缺环境下表现出色，为LLMs的安全使用提供了高效解决方案，并公开了实现以支持未来研究。

Abstract: The widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in many applications marks
a significant advance in research and practice. However, their complexity and
hard-to-understand nature make them vulnerable to attacks, especially
jailbreaks designed to produce harmful responses. To counter these threats,
developing strong detection methods is essential for the safe and reliable use
of LLMs. This paper studies this detection problem using the Contextual
Co-occurrence Matrix, a structure recognized for its efficacy in data-scarce
environments. We propose a novel method leveraging the latent space
characteristics of Contextual Co-occurrence Matrices and Tensors for the
effective identification of adversarial and jailbreak prompts. Our evaluations
show that this approach achieves a notable F1 score of 0.83 using only 0.5% of
labeled prompts, which is a 96.6% improvement over baselines. This result
highlights the strength of our learned patterns, especially when labeled data
is scarce. Our method is also significantly faster, speedup ranging from 2.3 to
128.4 times compared to the baseline models. To support future research and
reproducibility, we have made our implementation publicly available.

Abstract: As generative AI continues to reshape artistic production and alternate modes
of human expression, artists whose livelihoods are most directly affected have
raised urgent concerns about consent, transparency, and the future of creative
labor. However, the voices of artists are often marginalized in dominant public
and scholarly discourse. This study presents a twelve-year analysis, from 2013
to 2025, of English-language discourse surrounding AI-generated art. It draws
from 439 curated 500-word excerpts sampled from opinion articles, news reports,
blogs, legal filings, and spoken-word transcripts. Through a reproducible
methodology, we identify five stable thematic clusters and uncover a
misalignment between artists' perceptions and prevailing media narratives. Our
findings highlight how the use of technical jargon can function as a subtle
form of gatekeeping, often sidelining the very issues artists deem most urgent.
Our work provides a BERTopic-based methodology and a multimodal baseline for
future research, alongside a clear call for deeper, transparency-driven
engagement with artist perspectives in the evolving AI-creative landscape.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了Privacy-Aware Decoding (PAD)，一种轻量级的推理时防御方法，通过向生成过程中的token logits注入校准的高斯噪声来保护隐私，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAG系统中涉及敏感数据时的隐私泄露问题，避免提取攻击。

Method: PAD结合了基于置信度的筛选、高效敏感性估计和上下文感知噪声校准，并通过RDP会计严格跟踪隐私损失。

Result: 实验表明，PAD显著减少隐私信息泄露，同时保持响应实用性，优于现有防御方法。

Conclusion: PAD为敏感领域的RAG系统提供了一种通用且可扩展的隐私保护解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the factual accuracy of large
language models (LLMs) by conditioning outputs on external knowledge sources.
However, when retrieval involves private or sensitive data, RAG systems are
susceptible to extraction attacks that can leak confidential information
through generated responses. We propose Privacy-Aware Decoding (PAD), a
lightweight, inference-time defense that adaptively injects calibrated Gaussian
noise into token logits during generation. PAD integrates confidence-based
screening to selectively protect high-risk tokens, efficient sensitivity
estimation to minimize unnecessary noise, and context-aware noise calibration
to balance privacy with generation quality. A \renyi Differential Privacy (RDP)
accountant rigorously tracks cumulative privacy loss, enabling explicit
per-response $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP guarantees for sensitive outputs.
Unlike prior approaches requiring retraining or corpus-level filtering, PAD is
model-agnostic and operates entirely at decoding time with minimal
computational overhead. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate
that PAD substantially reduces private information leakage while preserving
response utility, outperforming existing retrieval- and post-processing-based
defenses. Our work takes an important step toward mitigating privacy risks in
RAG via decoding strategies, paving the way for universal and scalable privacy
solutions in sensitive domains. Our code is available:

Result: 在开放域QA数据集上，TPARAG在检索和端到端攻击效果上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 揭示了RAG系统的关键漏洞，为提升其鲁棒性提供了新思路。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
providing trustworthy responses for knowledge-intensive tasks, they still face
critical limitations such as hallucinations and outdated knowledge. To address
these issues, the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework enhances LLMs
with access to external knowledge via a retriever, enabling more accurate and
real-time outputs about the latest events. However, this integration brings new
security vulnerabilities: the risk that malicious content in the external
database can be retrieved and used to manipulate model outputs. Although prior
work has explored attacks on RAG systems, existing approaches either rely
heavily on access to the retriever or fail to jointly consider both retrieval
and generation stages, limiting their effectiveness, particularly in black-box
scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose Token-level Precise Attack
on the RAG (TPARAG), a novel framework that targets both white-box and
black-box RAG systems. TPARAG leverages a lightweight white-box LLM as an
attacker to generate and iteratively optimize malicious passages at the token
level, ensuring both retrievability and high attack success in generation.
Extensive experiments on open-domain QA datasets demonstrate that TPARAG
consistently outperforms previous approaches in retrieval-stage and end-to-end
attack effectiveness. These results further reveal critical vulnerabilities in
RAG pipelines and offer new insights into improving their robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可比文本是多语言中对齐的主题文档，有助于理解不同语言对同一主题的讨论方式。研究旨在填补英语-阿拉伯语可比文档中情感和情绪差异分析的空白。

Method: 首先标注情感和情绪标签，使用跨语言方法标注观点类别（主观/客观），并手动翻译英语情感词典为阿拉伯语。通过统计方法评估文档对中情感和情绪的一致性。

Result: 结果显示，来自同一新闻机构的情感与情绪标注一致，而来自不同机构的则存在差异。

Conclusion: 该方法具有语言独立性，可推广至其他语言对。

Abstract: Comparable texts are topic-aligned documents in multiple languages that are
not direct translations. They are valuable for understanding how a topic is
discussed across languages. This research studies differences in sentiments and
emotions across English-Arabic comparable documents. First, texts are annotated
with sentiment and emotion labels. We apply a cross-lingual method to label
documents with opinion classes (subjective/objective), avoiding reliance on
machine translation. To annotate with emotions (anger, disgust, fear, joy,
sadness, surprise), we manually translate the English WordNet-Affect (WNA)
lexicon into Arabic, creating bilingual emotion lexicons used to label the
comparable corpora. We then apply a statistical measure to assess the agreement
of sentiments and emotions in each source-target document pair. This comparison
is especially relevant when the documents originate from different sources. To
our knowledge, this aspect has not been explored in prior literature. Our study
includes English-Arabic document pairs from Euronews, BBC, and Al-Jazeera
(JSC). Results show that sentiment and emotion annotations align when articles
come from the same news agency and diverge when they come from different ones.
The proposed method is language-independent and generalizable to other language
pairs.

Conclusion: 多智能体结构和记忆存储模型有效提升了长篇故事生成的逻辑连贯性和吸引力。

Abstract: The generation of a long story consisting of several thousand words is a
sub-task in the field of long text generation~(LTG). Previous research has
addressed this challenge through outline-based generation, which employs a
multi-stage method for generating outlines into stories. However, this approach
suffers from two common issues: almost inevitable theme drift caused by the
loss of memory of previous outlines, and tedious plots with incoherent logic
that are less appealing to human readers.
  In this paper, we propose the multi-agent Story Generator structure to
improve the multi-stage method, using large language models~(LLMs) as the core
components of agents. To avoid theme drift, we introduce a memory storage model
comprising two components: a long-term memory storage that identifies the most
important memories, thereby preventing theme drift; and a short-term memory
storage that retains the latest outlines from each generation round. To
incorporate engaging elements into the story, we design a story theme obstacle
framework based on literary narratology theory that introduces uncertain
factors and evaluation criteria to generate outline. This framework calculates
the similarity of the former storyline and enhances the appeal of the story by
building a knowledge graph and integrating new node content. Additionally, we
establish a multi-agent interaction stage to simulate writer-reader interaction
through dialogue and revise the story text according to feedback, to ensure it
remains consistent and logical. Evaluations against previous methods
demonstrate that our approach can generate higher-quality long stories.

resource-efficient method. However, significant challenges lie in merging
domain-specific LLMs with long CoT ones since nowadays merging methods suffer
from reasoning capability degradation, even gibberish output and output
collapse. To overcome this, we introduce RCP-Merging: Merging Long
Chain-of-Thought Models with Domain-Specific Models by Considering Reasoning
Capability as Prior, a novel merging framework designed to integrate
domain-specific LLMs with long CoT capability, meanwhile maintaining model
performance in the original domain. Treating reasoning model weights as
foundational prior, our method utilizes a reasoning capability indicator to
preserve core long CoT capability model weights while selectively merging
essential domain-specific weights. We conducted extensive experiments on
Qwen2.5-7B, Llama3.1-8B, and Qwen2.5-1.5B models in BioMedicine and Finance
domains. Our results show that RCP-Merging successfully merges a reasoning
model with domain-specific ones, improving domain task performance by 9.5% and
9.2% over state-of-the-art methods, without significantly harming the original
long CoT reasoning capability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种解决LLMs在复杂指令下推理懒惰问题的框架，通过预览和自检机制提升指令遵循能力，实验表明其模型性能优于开源和闭源模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在复杂指令下的推理能力不足，尤其是懒惰推理导致指令遵循不准确，需改进其推理机制。

Method: 提出包含预览和自检的推理框架，生成复杂指令数据集，采用拒绝采样和熵保持的微调策略（Entropy-SFT与TEA-RL）。

Result: 实验显示模型性能显著提升，Light-IF-32B超越DeepSeek-R1和Doubao-1.6等模型。

Conclusion: 通过改进推理机制，LLMs在复杂指令下的表现显著提升，具有通用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: While advancements in the reasoning abilities of LLMs have significantly
enhanced their performance in solving mathematical problems, coding tasks, and
general puzzles, their effectiveness in accurately adhering to instructions
remains inconsistent, particularly with more complex directives. Our
investigation identifies lazy reasoning during the thinking stage as the
primary factor contributing to poor instruction adherence. To mitigate this
issue, we propose a comprehensive framework designed to enable rigorous
reasoning processes involving preview and self-checking, essential for
satisfying strict instruction constraints. Specifically, we first generate
instructions with complex constraints and apply a filtering process to obtain
valid prompts, resulting in three distinct prompt datasets categorized as hard,
easy, and pass. Then, we employ rejection sampling on the pass prompts to
curate a small yet high-quality dataset, enabling a cold-start initialization
of the model and facilitating its adaptation to effective reasoning patterns.
Subsequently, we employ an entropy-preserving supervised fine-tuning
(Entropy-SFT) strategy coupled with token-wise entropy-adaptive (TEA-RL)
reinforcement learning guided by rule-based dense rewards. This approach
encourages the model to transform its reasoning mechanism, ultimately fostering
generalizable reasoning abilities that encompass preview and self-checking.
Extensive experiments conducted on instruction-following benchmarks demonstrate
remarkable performance improvements across various model scales. Notably, our
Light-IF-32B model surpasses both larger open-source models such as DeepSeek-R1
and closed-source models like Doubao-1.6.

Result: 模型表现优异（话题分类AUROC 0.94，情感分类0.89），分析显示政党角色变化影响话语风格。

Conclusion: 意识形态和执政责任共同塑造政治话语，研究为议会话题和情感动态提供了新见解。

Abstract: This study investigates political discourse in the German parliament, the
Bundestag, by analyzing approximately 28,000 parliamentary speeches from the
last five years. Two machine learning models for topic and sentiment
classification were developed and trained on a manually labeled dataset. The
models showed strong classification performance, achieving an area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.94 for topic
classification (average across topics) and 0.89 for sentiment classification.
Both models were applied to assess topic trends and sentiment distributions
across political parties and over time. The analysis reveals remarkable
relationships between parties and their role in parliament. In particular, a
change in style can be observed for parties moving from government to
opposition. While ideological positions matter, governing responsibilities also
shape discourse. The analysis directly addresses key questions about the
evolution of topics, sentiment dynamics, and party-specific discourse
strategies in the Bundestag.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注人口统计和刻板印象，忽略了语法性别对视觉表现的影响。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 构建跨语言基准数据集，涵盖五种性别语言和两种中性语言，生成28,800张图像，分析语法性别对图像生成的影响。

Result: 语法性别显著影响图像生成，男性语法标记使男性形象比例升至73%，女性语法标记使女性形象比例升至38%。

Conclusion: 语言结构本身（而不仅是内容）影响AI生成的视觉输出，为多语言、多模态系统的偏见和公平性研究提供了新维度。

Abstract: Research on bias in Text-to-Image (T2I) models has primarily focused on
demographic representation and stereotypical attributes, overlooking a
fundamental question: how does grammatical gender influence visual
representation across languages? We introduce a cross-linguistic benchmark
examining words where grammatical gender contradicts stereotypical gender
associations (e.g., ``une sentinelle'' - grammatically feminine in French but
referring to the stereotypically masculine concept ``guard''). Our dataset
spans five gendered languages (French, Spanish, German, Italian, Russian) and
two gender-neutral control languages (English, Chinese), comprising 800 unique
prompts that generated 28,800 images across three state-of-the-art T2I models.
Our analysis reveals that grammatical gender dramatically influences image
generation: masculine grammatical markers increase male representation to 73\%
on average (compared to 22\% with gender-neutral English), while feminine
grammatical markers increase female representation to 38\% (compared to 28\% in
English). These effects vary systematically by language resource availability
and model architecture, with high-resource languages showing stronger effects.
Our findings establish that language structure itself, not just content, shapes
AI-generated visual outputs, introducing a new dimension for understanding bias
and fairness in multilingual, multimodal systems.

Motivation: 隐私是基本人权，但大型语言模型需要大量数据，其中可能包含私人信息，因此匿名化至关重要。

Method: 研究了几种用于文本数据匿名化的预处理方法，如掩码化和假名化。

Result: 尽管完全匿名化可能不可行，但现有方法可以有效减少隐私泄露风险。

Conclusion: 报告强调了在NLP任务中采用匿名化预处理方法的重要性，以保护数据隐私。

Abstract: Privacy is a fundamental human right. Data privacy is protected by different
regulations, such as GDPR. However, modern large language models require a huge
amount of data to learn linguistic variations, and the data often contains
private information. Research has shown that it is possible to extract private
information from such language models. Thus, anonymizing such private and
sensitive information is of utmost importance. While complete anonymization may
not be possible, a number of different pre-processing approaches exist for
masking or pseudonymizing private information in textual data. This report
focuses on a few of such approaches for domain-agnostic NLP tasks.

Result: 结构探针受词距和语言特性影响，但对词的可预测性不敏感。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了结构探针的局限性，并提供了受控基准以改进评估。

Abstract: The syntactic structures of sentences can be readily read-out from the
activations of large language models (LLMs). However, the ``structural probes''
that have been developed to reveal this phenomenon are typically evaluated on
an indiscriminate set of sentences. Consequently, it remains unclear whether
structural and/or statistical factors systematically affect these syntactic
representations. To address this issue, we conduct an in-depth analysis of
structural probes on three controlled benchmarks. Our results are three-fold.
First, structural probes are biased by a superficial property: the closer two
words are in a sentence, the more likely structural probes will consider them
as syntactically linked. Second, structural probes are challenged by linguistic
properties: they poorly represent deep syntactic structures, and get interfered
by interacting nouns or ungrammatical verb forms. Third, structural probes do
not appear to be affected by the predictability of individual words. Overall,
this work sheds light on the current challenges faced by structural probes.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否能复现东西方文化在抑郁症症状报告上的差异，以评估其在心理健康应用中的文化敏感性。

Method: 通过用西方或东方角色提示LLMs，测试其在英语和东方语言（中文、日语、印地语）下的表现。

Result: LLMs在英语提示下未能复现文化差异，但在东方语言提示下部分对齐。模型对文化角色的敏感性低，且存在文化不变的症状层级。

Conclusion: 当前通用LLMs缺乏文化感知能力，限制了其在心理健康应用中的安全性和有效性。

Abstract: Prior clinical psychology research shows that Western individuals with
depression tend to report psychological symptoms, while Eastern individuals
report somatic ones. We test whether Large Language Models (LLMs), which are
increasingly used in mental health, reproduce these cultural patterns by
prompting them with Western or Eastern personas. Results show that LLMs largely
fail to replicate the patterns when prompted in English, though prompting in
major Eastern languages (i.e., Chinese, Japanese, and Hindi) improves alignment
in several configurations. Our analysis pinpoints two key reasons for this
failure: the models' low sensitivity to cultural personas and a strong,
culturally invariant symptom hierarchy that overrides cultural cues. These
findings reveal that while prompt language is important, current
general-purpose LLMs lack the robust, culture-aware capabilities essential for
safe and effective mental health applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 政治辩论和讨论的增加需要新的计算方法来自动分析内容，以促进公民的政治参与。然而，政治语言的复杂性和隐含的论证形式使得这一任务极具挑战性。

Method: 通过在大规模政治辩论和演讲语料库（8K辩论）上预训练RooseBERT模型，并针对四项下游任务（如命名实体识别、情感分析等）进行微调。

Result: RooseBERT在四项任务上显著优于通用语言模型，证明了领域特定预训练的有效性。

Conclusion: RooseBERT为政治辩论分析提供了高效工具，并已向研究社区发布。

Abstract: The increasing amount of political debates and politics-related discussions
calls for the definition of novel computational methods to automatically
analyse such content with the final goal of lightening up political
deliberation to citizens. However, the specificity of the political language
and the argumentative form of these debates (employing hidden communication
strategies and leveraging implicit arguments) make this task very challenging,
even for current general-purpose pre-trained Language Models. To address this
issue, we introduce a novel pre-trained Language Model for political discourse
language called RooseBERT. Pre-training a language model on a specialised
domain presents different technical and linguistic challenges, requiring
extensive computational resources and large-scale data. RooseBERT has been
trained on large political debate and speech corpora (8K debates, each composed
of several sub-debates on different topics) in English. To evaluate its
performances, we fine-tuned it on four downstream tasks related to political
debate analysis, i.e., named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, argument
component detection and classification, and argument relation prediction and
classification. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over
general-purpose Language Models on these four tasks, highlighting how
domain-specific pre-training enhances performance in political debate analysis.
We release the RooseBERT language model for the research community.

Motivation: 现有CNER方法过度依赖知识蒸馏，导致模型稳定性过强但可塑性不足。

Method: SPT方法结合表示维度的池化操作和动态权重融合，并引入置信度伪标签处理非实体类型的语义偏移。

Result: 在三个基准数据集的十种CNER设置中，SPT方法优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SPT方法有效平衡了稳定性和可塑性，提升了CNER性能。

Abstract: Continual Named Entity Recognition (CNER) is an evolving field that focuses
on sequentially updating an existing model to incorporate new entity types.
Previous CNER methods primarily utilize Knowledge Distillation (KD) to preserve
prior knowledge and overcome catastrophic forgetting, strictly ensuring that
the representations of old and new models remain consistent. Consequently, they
often impart the model with excessive stability (i.e., retention of old
knowledge) but limited plasticity (i.e., acquisition of new knowledge). To
address this issue, we propose a Stability-Plasticity Trade-off (SPT) method
for CNER that balances these aspects from both representation and weight
perspectives. From the representation perspective, we introduce a pooling
operation into the original KD, permitting a level of plasticity by
consolidating representation dimensions. From the weight perspective, we
dynamically merge the weights of old and new models, strengthening old
knowledge while maintaining new knowledge. During this fusion, we implement a
weight-guided selective mechanism to prioritize significant weights. Moreover,
we develop a confidence-based pseudo-labeling approach for the current
non-entity type, which predicts entity types using the old model to handle the
semantic shift of the non-entity type, a challenge specific to CNER that has
largely been ignored by previous methods. Extensive experiments across ten CNER
settings on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our SPT method surpasses
previous CNER approaches, highlighting its effectiveness in achieving a
suitable stability-plasticity trade-off.

Conclusion: 研究为计算社会科学中基于人物的模拟提供了实证指导，揭示了LLMs的局限性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have generated significant
interest in their capacity to simulate human-like behaviors, yet most studies
rely on fictional personas rather than actual human data. We address this
limitation by evaluating LLMs' ability to predict individual economic
decision-making using Pay-What-You-Want (PWYW) pricing experiments with real
522 human personas. Our study systematically compares three state-of-the-art
multimodal LLMs using detailed persona information from 522 Korean participants
in cultural consumption scenarios. We investigate whether LLMs can accurately
replicate individual human choices and how persona injection methods affect
prediction performance. Results reveal that while LLMs struggle with precise
individual-level predictions, they demonstrate reasonable group-level
behavioral tendencies. Also, we found that commonly adopted prompting
techniques are not much better than naive prompting methods; reconstruction of
personal narrative nor retrieval augmented generation have no significant gain
against simple prompting method. We believe that these findings can provide the
first comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' capabilities on simulating economic
behavior using real human data, offering empirical guidance for persona-based
simulation in computational social science.

\textbf{C}oncept-based \textbf{T}est-\textbf{O}riented \textbf{R}epetition), a
novel adaptive scheduling algorithm specifically designed for test-oriented

paramount. LECTOR leverages large language models for semantic analysis while
incorporating personalized learning profiles, addressing the critical challenge
of semantic confusion in vocabulary learning by utilizing LLM-powered semantic
similarity assessment and integrating it with established spaced repetition
principles. Our comprehensive evaluation against six baseline algorithms
(SSP-MMC, SM2, HLR, FSRS, ANKI, THRESHOLD) across 100 simulated learners over
100 days demonstrates significant improvements: LECTOR achieves a 90.2\%
success rate compared to 88.4\% for the best baseline (SSP-MMC), representing a
2.0\% relative improvement. The algorithm shows particular strength in handling
semantically similar concepts, reducing confusion-induced errors while
maintaining computational efficiency. Our results establish LECTOR as a
promising direction for intelligent tutoring systems and adaptive learning

Result: 模型强烈趋同于对话风格，但指令调优和更大模型趋同性较低，且机制与人类不同。

Conclusion: 模型的语言趋同行为与人类存在显著差异，表明其机制可能不同。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are generally considered proficient in
generating language, how similar their language usage is to that of humans
remains understudied. In this paper, we test whether models exhibit linguistic
convergence, a core pragmatic element of human language communication, asking:
do models adapt, or converge, to the linguistic patterns of their user? To
answer this, we systematically compare model completions of exisiting dialogues
to the original human responses across sixteen language models, three dialogue
corpora, and a variety of stylometric features. We find that models strongly
converge to the conversation's style, often significantly overfitting relative
to the human baseline. While convergence patterns are often feature-specific,
we observe consistent shifts in convergence across modeling settings, with
instruction-tuned and larger models converging less than their pretrained
counterparts. Given the differences between human and model convergence
patterns, we hypothesize that the underlying mechanisms for these behaviors are
very different.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs广泛应用，其可能放大性别偏见的问题引发关注，现有研究多关注显性偏见，而忽略了生成内容中的隐性偏见。

Method: 使用心理学中的性别刻板印象（如攻击性或八卦）在开放式叙事生成任务中评估偏见，并引入新数据集StereoBias-Stories。

Result: 发现模型在无条件提示下偏向男性；多属性组合会强化偏见；模型偏见与心理学分类一致，且模型越大偏见越明显。

Conclusion: 强调基于心理学评估LLMs的重要性。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used across different
applications, concerns about their potential to amplify gender biases in
various tasks are rising. Prior research has often probed gender bias using
explicit gender cues as counterfactual, or studied them in sentence completion
and short question answering tasks. These formats might overlook more implicit
forms of bias embedded in generative behavior of longer content. In this work,
we investigate gender bias in LLMs using gender stereotypes studied in
psychology (e.g., aggressiveness or gossiping) in an open-ended task of
narrative generation. We introduce a novel dataset called StereoBias-Stories
containing short stories either unconditioned or conditioned on (one, two, or
six) random attributes from 25 psychological stereotypes and three task-related
story endings. We analyze how the gender contribution in the overall story
changes in response to these attributes and present three key findings: (1)
While models, on average, are highly biased towards male in unconditioned
prompts, conditioning on attributes independent from gender stereotypes
mitigates this bias. (2) Combining multiple attributes associated with the same
gender stereotype intensifies model behavior, with male ones amplifying bias
and female ones alleviating it. (3) Model biases align with psychological
ground-truth used for categorization, and alignment strength increases with
model size. Together, these insights highlight the importance of
psychology-grounded evaluation of LLMs.

Abstract: Estimating the difficulty of exam questions is essential for developing good

Large Language Model-based methods with three professors in their ability to
estimate what percentage of students will give correct answers on True/False
exam questions in the areas of Neural Networks and Machine Learning. Our
results show that the professors have limited ability to distinguish between
easy and difficult questions and that they are outperformed by directly asking
Gemini 2.5 to solve this task. Yet, we obtained even better results using
uncertainties of the LLMs solving the questions in a supervised learning
setting, using only 42 training samples. We conclude that supervised learning
using LLM uncertainty can help professors better estimate the difficulty of
exam questions, improving the quality of assessment.

Result: 实验和实际部署表明，Hi-Guard在分类准确性、泛化性和可解释性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: Hi-Guard为可扩展、透明且可信的内容安全系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Social platforms have revolutionized information sharing, but also
accelerated the dissemination of harmful and policy-violating content. To
ensure safety and compliance at scale, moderation systems must go beyond
efficiency and offer accuracy and interpretability. However, current approaches
largely rely on noisy, label-driven learning, lacking alignment with moderation
rules and producing opaque decisions that hinder human review. Therefore, we
propose Hierarchical Guard (Hi-Guard), a multimodal moderation framework that
introduces a new policy-aligned decision paradigm. The term "Hierarchical"
reflects two key aspects of our system design: (1) a hierarchical moderation
pipeline, where a lightweight binary model first filters safe content and a
stronger model handles fine-grained risk classification; and (2) a hierarchical
taxonomy in the second stage, where the model performs path-based
classification over a hierarchical taxonomy ranging from coarse to fine-grained
levels. To ensure alignment with evolving moderation policies, Hi-Guard
directly incorporates rule definitions into the model prompt. To further
enhance structured prediction and reasoning, we introduce a multi-level
soft-margin reward and optimize with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),
penalizing semantically adjacent misclassifications and improving explanation
quality. Extensive experiments and real-world deployment demonstrate that
Hi-Guard achieves superior classification accuracy, generalization, and
interpretability, paving the way toward scalable, transparent, and trustworthy
content safety systems. Code is available at:

Method: 设计了三种集体测试时间扩展范式（SA-MR、MA-SR、MA-MR），并提出CTTS-MM框架，包括Agent Collaboration Search（ACS）和Mixture of Reward Models（MoR）。

Result: 实验表明MA-MR表现最佳，CTTS-MM在七个主流基准测试中均取得优越性能。

Conclusion: CTTS-MM通过多智能体和多奖励模型的协作显著提升了推理性能，为测试时间扩展提供了新方向。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has emerged as a promising research field for
enhancing the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) without extra
training. However, most existing approaches, e.g., Best-of-N and
Self-Consistency rely on a single agent interacting with a reward model
(SA-SR), constrained by limited capabilities of a single test-time scaling
(STTS) paradigm. On the other hand, recent works demonstrate that
collective-agent methods can break through the upper bound of single-agent
systems by orchestrating diverse models. Thus, in this paper, we take a first
step towards exploring Collective Test-Time Scaling (CTTS). Consider the
different interaction types of single and multiple models, we design three
primary paradigms to investigate the optimal paradigm of CTTS: (1) single agent
to multiple reward models (SA-MR); (2) multiple agents to single reward model
(MA-SR); and (3) multiple agents to multiple reward models (MA-MR). Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MA-MR consistently achieves the best performance.
Based on this, we propose a novel framework named CTTS-MM that effectively
leverages both multi-agent and multi-reward-model collaboration for enhanced
inference. Specifically, for multi-agent collaboration, we propose an Agent
Collaboration Search (ACS), which searches for the most effective combination
of LLM agents from a large candidate pool; for multi-reward-model
collaboration, we propose Mixture of Reword Models (MoR), which consists of a
curated question pool and a Prior Reward model Ensemble Selection (PRES) to
select the optimal combinations of reward models via Pair-wise Reward Ranking
(PRR) metric. Experiments across seven mainstream benchmarks demonstrate that
the proposed CTTS-MM consistently obtains superior performance. Code will be
released at https://github.com/magent4aci/CTTS-MM.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Taggus的管道，用于从葡萄牙语文学作品中提取社交网络，相比现有工具在识别角色和互动检测任务上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NLP方法（如NER和POS标注）在构建角色社交网络任务上表现不佳，尤其是在小语种（如葡萄牙语）中缺乏标注数据。

Method: Taggus管道结合POS标注和启发式方法，用于角色识别、共指消解和互动检测。

Result: Taggus在角色识别和互动检测任务上的F1分数分别为94.1%和75.9%，比现有工具分别提高了50.7%和22.3%。

Conclusion: Taggus在葡萄牙语文学作品中表现优异，未来可进一步优化角色关系检测。管道已公开以促进相关研究。

Abstract: Automatically identifying characters and their interactions from fiction
books is, arguably, a complex task that requires pipelines that leverage
multiple Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, such as Named Entity
Recognition (NER) and Part-of-speech (POS) tagging. However, these methods are
not optimized for the task that leads to the construction of Social Networks of
Characters. Indeed, the currently available methods tend to underperform,
especially in less-represented languages, due to a lack of manually annotated
data for training. Here, we propose a pipeline, which we call Taggus, to
extract social networks from literary fiction works in Portuguese. Our results
show that compared to readily available State-of-the-Art tools -- off-the-shelf
NER tools and Large Language Models (ChatGPT) -- the resulting pipeline, which
uses POS tagging and a combination of heuristics, achieves satisfying results
with an average F1-Score of $94.1\%$ in the task of identifying characters and
solving for co-reference and $75.9\%$ in interaction detection. These
represent, respectively, an increase of $50.7\%$ and $22.3\%$ on results
achieved by the readily available State-of-the-Art tools. Further steps to
improve results are outlined, such as solutions for detecting relationships
between characters. Limitations on the size and scope of our testing samples
are acknowledged. The Taggus pipeline is publicly available to encourage
development in this field for the Portuguese language.2

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的上下文学习范式JointThinking，通过结合Thinking和Nothinking两种推理模式，显著提高了推理准确性，并在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注大型语言模型的训练和推理策略，但其在上下文学习中的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出JointThinking方法，通过并行生成Thinking和Nothinking模式的答案，并在不一致时触发第二轮推理。

Result: JointThinking在多个推理基准测试中显著优于少样本思维链和多数投票方法，并在分布外任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: JointThinking通过利用不同推理模式的结构差异，降低了错误率，并展示了良好的可扩展性，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Reasoning large language models (RLLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable
capabilities through structured and multi-step reasoning. While prior research
has primarily focused on improving their training and inference strategies,
their potential for in-context learning (ICL) remains largely underexplored. To
fill this gap, we propose Thinking with Nothinking Calibration (JointThinking),
a new ICL paradigm that leverages the structured difference between two
reasoning modes, i.e., Thinking and Nothinking, to improve reasoning accuracy.
Specifically, our method prompts the model to generate two answers in parallel:
one in Thinking mode and the other in Nothinking mode. A second round of
Thinking is triggered only when the two initial responses are inconsistent,
using a single prompt that incorporates the original question and both
candidate answers. Since such disagreement occurs infrequently (e.g., only 6\%
in GSM8K), our method performs just one round of reasoning in most cases,
resulting in minimal latency overhead. Extensive experiments across multiple
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that JointThinking significantly outperforms
few-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) and majority voting with improved answer
robustness. Moreover, It achieves comparable in-distribution performance to
training-based SOTA method, while substantially outperforming on
out-of-distribution tasks. We further conduct a systematic analysis of the
calibration mechanism, showing that leveraging different reasoning modes
consistently lowers the error rate and highlights the value of structural
thinking diversity. Additionally, we observe that the performance gap between
actual and ideal reasoning narrows as model size increases in the second round
of thinking, indicating the strong scalability of our approach. Finally, we
discuss current limitations and outline promising directions for future ICL
research in RLLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出ReDSM5，一个标注了DSM-5抑郁症状的Reddit语料库，用于提升抑郁检测的临床相关性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统抑郁检测方法缺乏与DSM-5标准的关联，限制了临床意义和可解释性。

Method: 构建ReDSM5语料库，包含1484篇长文，每句由心理学家标注DSM-5症状及临床依据。

Result: 分析了症状表达的语言模式，建立了多标签症状分类和解释生成的基准。

Conclusion: ReDSM5为抑郁检测和可解释性研究提供了新资源和方法。

Abstract: Depression is a pervasive mental health condition that affects hundreds of
millions of individuals worldwide, yet many cases remain undiagnosed due to
barriers in traditional clinical access and pervasive stigma. Social media
platforms, and Reddit in particular, offer rich, user-generated narratives that
can reveal early signs of depressive symptomatology. However, existing
computational approaches often label entire posts simply as depressed or not
depressed, without linking language to specific criteria from the DSM-5, the
standard clinical framework for diagnosing depression. This limits both
clinical relevance and interpretability. To address this gap, we introduce
ReDSM5, a novel Reddit corpus comprising 1484 long-form posts, each
exhaustively annotated at the sentence level by a licensed psychologist for the
nine DSM-5 depression symptoms. For each label, the annotator also provides a
concise clinical rationale grounded in DSM-5 methodology. We conduct an
exploratory analysis of the collection, examining lexical, syntactic, and
emotional patterns that characterize symptom expression in social media
narratives. Compared to prior resources, ReDSM5 uniquely combines
symptom-specific supervision with expert explanations, facilitating the
development of models that not only detect depression but also generate
human-interpretable reasoning. We establish baseline benchmarks for both
multi-label symptom classification and explanation generation, providing
reference results for future research on detection and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚假信息在社交媒体上的传播对学术和工业界造成严重影响，传统静态检测方法难以适应动态变化的社交环境。

Method: MISDER通过学习每个时期的社会环境表示，并利用LSTM、连续动态方程或预训练动态系统预测未来表示，提出了三种变体MISDER-LSTM、MISDER-ODE和MISDER-PT。

Result: 在两种流行数据集上的实验表明，MISDER优于多种基线方法。

Conclusion: MISDER框架有效解决了虚假信息检测中的动态环境问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation across diverse social media platforms has
drawn significant attention from both academic and industrial communities due
to its detrimental effects. Accordingly, automatically distinguishing
misinformation, dubbed as Misinformation Detection (MD), has become an
increasingly active research topic. The mainstream methods formulate MD as a
static learning paradigm, which learns the mapping between the content, links,
and propagation of news articles and the corresponding manual veracity labels.
However, the static assumption is often violated, since in real-world
scenarios, the veracity of news articles may vacillate within the dynamically
evolving social environment. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel
framework, namely Misinformation detection with Dynamic Environmental
Representations (MISDER). The basic idea of MISDER lies in learning a social
environmental representation for each period and employing a temporal model to
predict the representation for future periods. In this work, we specify the
temporal model as the LSTM model, continuous dynamics equation, and pre-trained
dynamics system, suggesting three variants of MISDER, namely MISDER-LSTM,
MISDER-ODE, and MISDER-PT, respectively. To evaluate the performance of MISDER,
we compare it to various MD baselines across 2 prevalent datasets, and the
experimental results can indicate the effectiveness of our proposed model.

Method: 通过探测技术分析LLM内部行为，发现其依赖软输入的主要部分。为解决这一问题，引入随机性策略（如Dirichlet重采样和Gumbel-Softmax技巧）。

Result: 实验表明，引入随机性可以缓解软思考的限制，其中Gumbel-Softmax技巧在八个推理基准测试中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 随机性策略能有效释放软思考的潜力，Gumbel-Softmax技巧因其可控平滑性表现突出。

Abstract: Human cognition naturally engages with abstract and fluid concepts, whereas
existing reasoning models often rely on generating discrete tokens, potentially
constraining their expressive capabilities. Recent advancements aim to address
this limitation by enabling large language models (LLMs) to generate soft,
abstract tokens, thus facilitating reasoning within a continuous concept space.
This paper explores the `Soft Thinking' capabilities of various LLMs by
examining the models' internal behavior using a suite of probing techniques.
Contrary to the common belief that Soft Thinking enables the simultaneous
exploration of diverse reasoning paths, our findings reveal that LLMs
predominantly rely on the most influential component of the soft inputs during
subsequent decoding steps. This reliance hinders the exploration of different
reasoning paths and reduces vanilla Soft Thinking to a form of greedy decoding,
obscuring the advantage of transmitting more information through Soft Tokens.
To tackle this issue, we explore sampling strategies to introduce
\emph{randomness}, employing methods such as Dirichlet resampling and the
Gumbel-Softmax trick. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating randomness
can alleviate the limitations of vanilla approaches and unleash the potential
of Soft Thinking. Notably, the Gumbel-Softmax trick provides adequate
randomness with controlled smoothness, resulting in superior performance across
eight reasoning benchmarks.

Motivation: 研究文本嵌入的自监督学习方法，以弥补当前主要依赖监督学习的不足，尤其是在计算机视觉中自监督学习的成功背景下。

Method: 系统比较了裁剪增强和基于dropout的增强策略，通过MTEB和领域内评估测试嵌入质量。

Result: 裁剪增强表现更优，特定领域接近监督学习的性能，但跨领域表现较差；仅微调最后几层即可达到类似效果。

Conclusion: 自监督学习在特定领域可高效生成高质量文本嵌入，且仅需微调最后几层即可实现。

Abstract: Text embeddings, i.e. vector representations of entire texts, play an
important role in many NLP applications, such as retrieval-augmented
generation, sentiment analysis, clustering, or visualizing collections of texts
for data exploration. Currently, top-performing embedding models are derived
from pre-trained language models via extensive supervised fine-tuning using
curated text pairs. This contrasts with computer vision, where self-supervised
training based on data augmentations has demonstrated remarkable success. Here
we systematically compare the two most well-known augmentation strategies for
positive pair generation in contrastive learning of text embeddings. We assess
embedding quality on MTEB and additional in-domain evaluations and show that
cropping augmentation strongly outperforms the dropout-based approach. We find
that on out-of-domain data, the quality of resulting embeddings is below the
supervised SOTA models, but for in-domain data, self-supervised fine-tuning
produces high-quality text embeddings after very short fine-tuning, sometimes
only marginally below the supervised SOTA. Finally, we show that representation
quality increases towards the last transformer layers, which undergo the
largest change during fine-tuning; and that fine-tuning only those last layers
is sufficient to reach similar embedding quality.

Conclusion: CarbonPDF技术有效解决了非结构化PDF报告中碳足迹问题回答的挑战。

Abstract: Product sustainability reports provide valuable insights into the
environmental impacts of a product and are often distributed in PDF format.
These reports often include a combination of tables and text, which complicates
their analysis. The lack of standardization and the variability in reporting
formats further exacerbate the difficulty of extracting and interpreting
relevant information from large volumes of documents. In this paper, we tackle
the challenge of answering questions related to carbon footprints within
sustainability reports available in PDF format. Unlike previous approaches, our
focus is on addressing the difficulties posed by the unstructured and
inconsistent nature of text extracted from PDF parsing. To facilitate this
analysis, we introduce CarbonPDF-QA, an open-source dataset containing
question-answer pairs for 1735 product report documents, along with
human-annotated answers. Our analysis shows that GPT-4o struggles to answer
questions with data inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we propose
CarbonPDF, an LLM-based technique specifically designed to answer carbon
footprint questions on such datasets. We develop CarbonPDF by fine-tuning Llama
3 with our training data. Our results show that our technique outperforms
current state-of-the-art techniques, including question-answering (QA) systems
finetuned on table and text data.

Result: 在两个公共基准测试中取得最佳性能（Pearson相关系数提升），并通过合成噪声注入验证了其分离噪声样本的能力。

Conclusion: UPLME在共情检测回归任务中有效处理标签噪声，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Supervised learning for empathy regression is challenged by noisy
self-reported empathy scores. While many algorithms have been proposed for
learning with noisy labels in textual classification problems, the regression
counterpart is relatively under-explored. We propose UPLME, an
uncertainty-aware probabilistic language modelling framework to capture label
noise in the regression setting of empathy detection. UPLME includes a
probabilistic language model that predicts both empathy score and
heteroscedastic uncertainty and is trained using Bayesian concepts with
variational model ensembling. We further introduce two novel loss components:
one penalises degenerate Uncertainty Quantification (UQ), and another enforces
the similarity between the input pairs on which we predict empathy. UPLME
provides state-of-the-art performance (Pearson Correlation Coefficient:
$0.558\rightarrow0.580$ and $0.629\rightarrow0.634$) in terms of the
performance reported in the literature in two public benchmarks, having label
noise. Through synthetic label noise injection, we show that UPLME is effective
in separating noisy and clean samples based on the predicted uncertainty. UPLME
further outperform (Calibration error: $0.571\rightarrow0.376$) a recent
variational model ensembling-based UQ method designed for regression problems.

Conclusion: FilBench凸显了语言特定基准测试的价值，有助于推动菲律宾语言的NLP研究和LLM开发包容性。

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of LLMs on English-based tasks, little is
known about their capabilities in specific languages such as Filipino. In this
work, we address this gap by introducing FilBench, a Filipino-centric benchmark
designed to evaluate LLMs across a diverse set of tasks and capabilities in
Filipino, Tagalog, and Cebuano. We carefully curate the tasks in FilBench to
reflect the priorities and trends of NLP research in the Philippines such as
Cultural Knowledge, Classical NLP, Reading Comprehension, and Generation. By
evaluating 27 state-of-the-art LLMs on FilBench, we find that several LLMs
suffer from reading comprehension and translation capabilities. Our results
indicate that FilBench is challenging, with the best model, GPT-4o, achieving
only a score of 72.23%. Moreover, we also find that models trained specifically
for Southeast Asian languages tend to underperform on FilBench, with the
highest-performing model, SEA-LION v3 70B, achieving only a score of 61.07%.
Our work demonstrates the value of curating language-specific LLM benchmarks to
aid in driving progress on Filipino NLP and increasing the inclusion of
Philippine languages in LLM development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（离散提示优化和连续参数适应）在精度和复杂性上存在不足，需要一种更高效的任务适应范式。

Method: 提出EmbedGrad框架，通过梯度优化文本提示嵌入，分离训练与部署阶段，实现精细校准。

Result: 在数学推理、情感分析和因果判断任务中，EmbedGrad显著提升模型性能，例如数学问题准确率从14.74%提升至58.96%。

Conclusion: EmbedGrad为任务适应提供了新范式，结合了提示工程和参数效率的优势。

Abstract: Effectively adapting powerful pretrained foundation models to diverse tasks
remains a key challenge in AI deployment. Current approaches primarily follow
two paradigms:discrete optimization of text prompts through prompt engineering,
or continuous adaptation via additional trainable parameters. Both exhibit
limitations-discrete methods lack refinement precision while parameter-based
techniques increase complexity and reduce interpretability. To address these
constraints, we propose EmbedGrad, a novel framework that optimizes text prompt
embeddings through gradient-based refinement. Our approach uniquely decouples
training from deployment:during optimization,labeled examples guide precise
embedding adjustments while preserving semantic meaning; during inference, only
optimized embeddings integrate with user queries. This enables fine-grained
calibration impossible in text space, such as enhancing the reasoning
capability of prompts like please reason step by step. Comprehensive
evaluations across mathematical reasoning, sentiment analysis, and causal
judgment tasks demonstrate EmbedGrad's effectiveness:optimizing this reasoning
prompt for Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B increased accuracy from 14.74\% to 58.96\% on
mathematical problems. Consistent improvements were observed across model
scales (0.5B-14B) and all tasks, with particularly significant gains for
smaller models on complex problems like causal judgment. By bridging prompt
engineering and parameter efficiency without architectural changes, our work
establishes embedding refinement as a powerful new paradigm for task
adaptation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模评估任务中，LLM作为评判者（LLM-as-a-judge）的对齐性提升仍具挑战性。研究发现中间层到上层编码的语义和任务相关表示更符合人类判断，因此提出LAGER框架。

Method: LAGER通过聚合跨层分数标记逻辑和计算软最大值分布中的期望分数，利用不同层的互补信息，保持LLM主干冻结。

Result: 在标准对齐基准测试中，LAGER相比最佳基线提升高达7.5%，无需推理步骤即可匹配或超越基于推理的方法。下游应用实验进一步验证其有效性。

Conclusion: LAGER通过利用内部表示提升LLM作为评判者的对齐性，是一种轻量且高效的方法。

Abstract: The growing scale of evaluation tasks has led to the widespread adoption of
automated evaluation using large language models, a paradigm known as
"LLMas-a-judge." However, improving its alignment with human preferences
without complex prompts or fine-tuning remains challenging. In this work,
motivated by preliminary findings that middle-to-upper layers encode
semantically and taskrelevant representations that are often more aligned with
human judgments than the final layer, we propose LAGER, a lightweight and
efficient framework for enhancing LLM-as-a-Judge alignment with human scoring,
via internal representations. LAGER produces fine-grained judgment scores by
aggregating cross-layer scoretoken logits and computing the expected score from
a softmax-based distribution, with the LLM backbone kept frozen. LAGER fully
leverages the complementary information across different layers, overcoming the
limitations of relying solely on the final layer. We evaluate our method on the
standard alignment benchmarks Flask, HelpSteer, and BIGGen using Spearman
correlation, and find that LAGER achieves improvements of up to 7.5% over the
best baseline across these benchmarks. Without reasoning steps, LAGER matches
or outperforms reasoning-based methods. Experiments on downstream applications,
such as data selection and emotional understanding, further show the
effectiveness of our method.

Result: 在BioASQ、SciQ、TweetEval和MIND四个领域上，KILO在反向转移、前向转移、F1分数、保留率和训练效率上均优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 结合结构化知识检索和指令提示能有效解决持续学习中的领域转移挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often suffer from performance degradation when
faced with domain shifts, primarily due to catastrophic forgetting. In this
work, we propose KILO (Knowledge-Instructed Learning for Continual Adaptation),
a novel continual learning framework that integrates dynamic knowledge graphs
with instruction tuning. By leveraging retrieved domain-specific knowledge as
guidance during training, KILO enhances both adaptability to new domains and
retention of previously acquired knowledge. We pretrain our model on
WikiText-103 and evaluate sequential adaptation across four diverse target
domains: BioASQ, SciQ, TweetEval, and MIND. Our experiments demonstrate that
KILO consistently outperforms strong baselines, including continual
fine-tuning, ERNIE 2.0, and CPT, in terms of backward transfer, forward
transfer, F1 score, retention rate, and training efficiency. These results
highlight the effectiveness of combining structured knowledge retrieval and
instruction prompting to overcome domain shift challenges in continual learning
scenarios.

TL;DR: Double-Bench是一个新的大规模、多语言、多模态评估系统，用于全面评估文档RAG系统的各个组件，填补了现有基准的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准对文档RAG系统的评估不全面，且使用合成数据，无法反映真实世界的挑战。

Method: 开发了包含3,276份文档（72,880页）和5,168个查询的Double-Bench，支持多语言和多模态，并提供动态更新支持。

Result: 实验表明文本和视觉嵌入模型的差距在缩小，但现有RAG框架存在过度自信的问题。

Conclusion: Double-Bench为未来文档RAG系统研究提供了严格的基础，并计划定期更新。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) show great promise for complex document understanding, yet their
development is critically hampered by inadequate evaluation. Current benchmarks
often focus on specific part of document RAG system and use synthetic data with
incomplete ground truth and evidence labels, therefore failing to reflect
real-world bottlenecks and challenges. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce Double-Bench: a new large-scale, multilingual, and multimodal
evaluation system that is able to produce fine-grained assessment to each
component within document RAG systems. It comprises 3,276 documents (72,880
pages) and 5,168 single- and multi-hop queries across 6 languages and 4
document types with streamlined dynamic update support for potential data
contamination issues. Queries are grounded in exhaustively scanned evidence
pages and verified by human experts to ensure maximum quality and completeness.
Our comprehensive experiments across 9 state-of-the-art embedding models, 4
MLLMs and 4 end-to-end document RAG frameworks demonstrate the gap between text
and visual embedding models is narrowing, highlighting the need in building
stronger document retrieval models. Our findings also reveal the
over-confidence dilemma within current document RAG frameworks that tend to
provide answer even without evidence support. We hope our fully open-source
Double-Bench provide a rigorous foundation for future research in advanced
document RAG systems. We plan to retrieve timely corpus and release new
benchmarks on an annual basis.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在多模态讽刺分析（MSA）中的应用，提出了一种无需训练的新框架，结合深度对象提取和外部概念知识，提升了模型在多模态讽刺检测和解释中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 讽刺是一种复杂的语言现象，传统方法主要依赖文本，而多模态信息的应用尚未充分探索。LVLMs在MSA中的潜力仍有待挖掘。

Method: 提出了一种无需训练的框架，整合深度对象提取和外部概念知识，以增强模型对多模态讽刺的理解和解释能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架在多个模型上有效提升了多模态讽刺检测和解释的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为LVLMs在多模态讽刺分析中的应用提供了新思路，并展示了其潜力。

Abstract: Sarcasm is a complex linguistic phenomenon that involves a disparity between
literal and intended meanings, making it challenging for sentiment analysis and
other emotion-sensitive tasks. While traditional sarcasm detection methods
primarily focus on text, recent approaches have incorporated multimodal
information. However, the application of Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs)
in Multimodal Sarcasm Analysis (MSA) remains underexplored. In this paper, we
evaluate LVLMs in MSA tasks, specifically focusing on Multimodal Sarcasm
Detection and Multimodal Sarcasm Explanation. Through comprehensive
experiments, we identify key limitations, such as insufficient visual
understanding and a lack of conceptual knowledge. To address these issues, we
propose a training-free framework that integrates in-depth object extraction
and external conceptual knowledge to improve the model's ability to interpret
and explain sarcasm in multimodal contexts. The experimental results on
multiple models show the effectiveness of our proposed framework. The code is
available at https://github.com/cp-cp/LVLM-MSA.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CTR-Sink的新框架，通过引入行为级别的注意力汇聚点来解决用户行为序列与语言模型预训练之间的结构不匹配问题，从而提升点击率预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户行为序列由离散动作组成，与语言模型预训练的自然语言结构不匹配，导致语义碎片化，影响预测性能。

Method: 提出CTR-Sink框架，通过插入汇聚点令牌并设计两阶段训练策略和注意力汇聚机制，动态调节注意力。

Result: 在工业数据集和开源数据集（MovieLens、Kuairec）上的实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: CTR-Sink通过优化注意力机制，显著提升了点击率预测的性能。

Abstract: Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, a core task in recommendation systems,
estimates user click likelihood using historical behavioral data. Modeling user
behavior sequences as text to leverage Language Models (LMs) for this task has
gained traction, owing to LMs' strong semantic understanding and contextual
modeling capabilities. However, a critical structural gap exists: user behavior
sequences consist of discrete actions connected by semantically empty
separators, differing fundamentally from the coherent natural language in LM
pre-training. This mismatch causes semantic fragmentation, where LM attention
scatters across irrelevant tokens instead of focusing on meaningful behavior
boundaries and inter-behavior relationships, degrading prediction performance.
To address this, we propose $\textit{CTR-Sink}$, a novel framework introducing
behavior-level attention sinks tailored for recommendation scenarios. Inspired
by attention sink theory, it constructs attention focus sinks and dynamically
regulates attention aggregation via external information. Specifically, we
insert sink tokens between consecutive behaviors, incorporating
recommendation-specific signals such as temporal distance to serve as stable
attention sinks. To enhance generality, we design a two-stage training strategy
that explicitly guides LM attention toward sink tokens and a attention sink
mechanism that amplifies inter-sink dependencies to better capture behavioral
correlations. Experiments on one industrial dataset and two open-source
datasets (MovieLens, Kuairec), alongside visualization results, validate the
method's effectiveness across scenarios.

Result: FairLangProc提供了一个集中化的实现平台，促进了偏见缓解技术的广泛应用。

Conclusion: FairLangProc有望推动NLP公平性技术的普及和标准化。

Abstract: The rise in usage of Large Language Models to near ubiquitousness in recent
years has risen societal concern about their applications in decision-making
contexts, such as organizational justice or healthcare. This, in turn, poses
questions about the fairness of these models in critical settings, which leads
to the developement of different procedures to address bias in Natural Language
Processing. Although many datasets, metrics and algorithms have been proposed
to measure and mitigate harmful prejudice in Natural Language Processing, their
implementation is diverse and far from centralized. As a response, this paper
presents FairLangProc, a comprehensive Python package providing a common
implementation of some of the more recent advances in fairness in Natural
Language Processing providing an interface compatible with the famous Hugging
Face transformers library, aiming to encourage the widespread use and
democratization of bias mitigation techniques. The implementation can be found

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs在专用基准上表现不佳的原因是缺乏领域知识还是提示细节不足。

Method: 引入PartialOrderEval工具，为代码生成基准提供从最小到最大细节的提示部分顺序，并应用于HumanEval和ParEval。

Result: 实验显示不同任务对提示细节的敏感度不同，明确I/O规范、边缘案例处理和逐步分解是关键改进因素。

Conclusion: 提示细节的优化能显著提升LLMs在专用任务上的表现。

Abstract: State-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve high pass@1 on general
benchmarks like HumanEval but underperform on specialized suites such as
ParEval. Is this due to LLMs missing domain knowledge or insufficient prompt
detail is given? To answer this, we introduce PartialOrderEval, which augments
any code generation benchmark with a partial order of prompts from minimal to
maximally detailed. Applying it to HumanEval and both serial and OpenMP subsets
of ParEval, we measure how pass@1 scales with prompt specificity. Our
experiments with Llama-3.x and Qwen2.5-Coder demonstrate varying degrees of
prompt sensitivity across different tasks, and a qualitative analysis
highlights explicit I/O specifications, edge-case handling, and stepwise
breakdowns as the key drivers of prompt detail improvement.

Motivation: 当前验证方法缺乏全面基准和鲁棒性，CompassVerifier旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 开发CompassVerifier模型，并引入VerifierBench基准数据集。

Result: CompassVerifier在多领域任务中表现优异，能处理复杂答案类型并识别异常响应。

Conclusion: CompassVerifier和VerifierBench将推动答案验证、评估协议和强化学习研究。

Abstract: Answer verification is crucial not only for evaluating large language models
(LLMs) by matching their unstructured outputs against standard answers, but
also serves as the reward model to guide LLM optimization. Most evaluation
frameworks rely on regularized matching or employ general LLMs for answer
verification, which demands extensive, repetitive customization for regex rules
or evaluation prompts. Two fundamental limitations persist in current
methodologies: 1) the absence of comprehensive benchmarks that systematically
evaluate verification capabilities across different LLMs; and 2) the nascent
stage of verifier development, where existing approaches lack both the
robustness to handle complex edge cases and the generalizability across
different domains. In this work, we develop CompassVerifier, an accurate and
robust lightweight verifier model for evaluation and outcome reward. It
demonstrates multi-domain competency spanning math, knowledge, and diverse
reasoning tasks, with the capability to process various answer types, including
multi-subproblems, formulas, and sequence answers, while effectively
identifying abnormal/invalid responses. We introduce VerifierBench benchmark
comprising model outputs collected from multiple data sources, augmented
through manual analysis of metaerror patterns to enhance CompassVerifier. We
anticipate that CompassVerifier and VerifierBench will facilitate answer
verification, evaluation protocols, and reinforcement learning research. Code

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于数据相似性的Voronoi树图算法，通过预处理、匹配和优化步骤生成保留邻域关系的树图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Voronoi树图仅展示层次结构，但数据常包含相似性等属性，需要一种方法同时保留层次和邻域关系。

Method: 扩展树图布局流程，利用Kuhn-Munkres匹配和贪婪交换优化邻域，迭代调整单元格大小。

Result: 通过实际案例验证了方法的实用性，并定量评估了邻域保留效果。

Conclusion: 该算法能有效生成保留数据相似性的Voronoi树图，适用于信息图表和语言学等领域。

Abstract: Voronoi treemaps are used to depict nodes and their hierarchical
relationships simultaneously. However, in addition to the hierarchical
structure, data attributes, such as co-occurring features or similarities,
frequently exist. Examples include geographical attributes like shared borders
between countries or contextualized semantic information such as embedding
vectors derived from large language models. In this work, we introduce a
Voronoi treemap algorithm that leverages data similarity to generate
neighborhood-preserving treemaps. First, we extend the treemap layout pipeline
to consider similarity during data preprocessing. We then use a Kuhn-Munkres
matching of similarities to centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) cells to
create initial Voronoi diagrams with equal cell sizes for each level. Greedy
swapping is used to improve the neighborhoods of cells to match the data's
similarity further. During optimization, cell areas are iteratively adjusted to
their respective sizes while preserving the existing neighborhoods. We
demonstrate the practicality of our approach through multiple real-world
examples drawn from infographics and linguistics. To quantitatively assess the
resulting treemaps, we employ treemap metrics and measure neighborhood
preservation.

TL;DR: READ是一个基于扩散变换器的实时说话头生成框架，通过压缩视频和语音潜在空间以及异步噪声调度器，显著提高了生成速度和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在说话头生成中取得了进展，但推理速度慢限制了实际应用。

Method: 使用时间VAE压缩视频潜在空间，预训练SpeechAE生成语音潜在代码，设计A2V-DiT模型，并引入异步噪声调度器（ANS）。

Result: READ在生成质量和速度上优于现有方法，并在长时间生成中保持稳定性。

Conclusion: READ在说话头生成中实现了速度与质量的平衡，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The introduction of diffusion models has brought significant advances to the
field of audio-driven talking head generation. However, the extremely slow
inference speed severely limits the practical implementation of diffusion-based
talking head generation models. In this study, we propose READ, the first
real-time diffusion-transformer-based talking head generation framework. Our
approach first learns a spatiotemporal highly compressed video latent space via
a temporal VAE, significantly reducing the token count to accelerate
generation. To achieve better audio-visual alignment within this compressed
latent space, a pre-trained Speech Autoencoder (SpeechAE) is proposed to
generate temporally compressed speech latent codes corresponding to the video
latent space. These latent representations are then modeled by a carefully
designed Audio-to-Video Diffusion Transformer (A2V-DiT) backbone for efficient
talking head synthesis. Furthermore, to ensure temporal consistency and
accelerated inference in extended generation, we propose a novel asynchronous
noise scheduler (ANS) for both the training and inference process of our
framework. The ANS leverages asynchronous add-noise and asynchronous
motion-guided generation in the latent space, ensuring consistency in generated
video clips. Experimental results demonstrate that READ outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by generating competitive talking head videos with
significantly reduced runtime, achieving an optimal balance between quality and
speed while maintaining robust metric stability in long-time generation.

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents have
enabled sophisticated systems to tackle complex, multi-step tasks, but their
escalating costs threaten scalability and accessibility. This work presents the
first systematic study of the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off in modern
agent systems, addressing the critical need for cost-effective designs without
sacrificing performance. We investigate three key questions: (1) How much
complexity do agentic tasks inherently require? (2) When do additional modules
yield diminishing returns? (3) How much efficiency can be gained through the
design of efficient agent frameworks? Through an empirical analysis on the GAIA
benchmark, we evaluate the impact of LLM backbone selection, agent framework
designs, and test-time scaling strategies. Using the cost-of-pass metric, we
quantify the efficiency-performance trade-off across these dimensions. Our
findings inform the development of Efficient Agents , a novel agent framework
that has an optimal complexity to task requirements. Efficient Agents retains
96.7% of the performance of OWL, one leading open-source agent framework, while
reducing operational costs from $0.398 to $0.228, resulting in a 28.4%
improvement in cost-of-pass. Our work provides actionable insights for
designing efficient, high-performing agent systems, advancing the accessibility

Result: 方法在有限长度计划下完备且正确，适用于特定类型的广义规划和一致规划问题。

Conclusion: 该方法为动态对象规划问题提供了理论基础，并通过概念验证实现展示了可行性。

Abstract: In classical planning and conformant planning, it is assumed that there are
finitely many named objects given in advance, and only they can participate in
actions and in fluents. This is the Domain Closure Assumption (DCA). However,
there are practical planning problems where the set of objects changes
dynamically as actions are performed; e.g., new objects can be created, old
objects can be destroyed. We formulate the planning problem in first-order
logic, assume an initial theory is a finite consistent set of fluent literals,
discuss when this guarantees that in every situation there are only finitely
many possible actions, impose a finite integer bound on the length of the plan,
and propose to organize search over sequences of actions that are grounded at
planning time. We show the soundness and completeness of our approach. It can
be used to solve the bounded planning problems without DCA that belong to the
intersection of sequential generalized planning (without sensing actions) and
conformant planning, restricted to the case without the disjunction over fluent
literals. We discuss a proof-of-the-concept implementation of our planner.

Conclusion: VSNIT在活动序列恢复任务中表现出色，为未来基于位置的研究和应用提供了有前景的框架。

Abstract: Location-Based Service (LBS) data provides critical insights into human
mobility, yet its sparsity often yields incomplete trip and activity sequences,
making accurate inferences about trips and activities difficult. We raise a
research problem: Can we use activity sequences derived from high-quality LBS
data to recover incomplete activity sequences at the individual level? This
study proposes a new solution, the Variable Selection Network-fused Insertion
Transformer (VSNIT), integrating the Insertion Transformer's flexible sequence
construction with the Variable Selection Network's dynamic covariate handling
capability, to recover missing segments in incomplete activity sequences while
preserving existing data. The findings show that VSNIT inserts more diverse,
realistic activity patterns, more closely matching real-world variability, and
restores disrupted activity transitions more effectively aligning with the
target. It also performs significantly better than the baseline model across
all metrics. These results highlight VSNIT's superior accuracy and diversity in
activity sequence recovery tasks, demonstrating its potential to enhance LBS
data utility for mobility analysis. This approach offers a promising framework
for future location-based research and applications.

Conclusion: CLIO为科学决策提供了透明和可控的推理工具，展示了动态优化在AI科学发现中的潜力。

Abstract: The capacity for artificial intelligence (AI) to formulate, evolve, and test
altered thought patterns under dynamic conditions indicates advanced cognition
that is crucial for scientific discovery. The existing AI development landscape
falls into two categories: 1) frameworks over non-reasoning models that
natively incorporate opinions on how humans think, and 2) reasoning models that
abstract precise control of the reasoning intuition away from end users. While
powerful, for scientists to maximize utility of AI in scientific discovery,
they not only require accuracy and transparency in reasoning, but also
steerability. Hence, we introduce an alternative approach that enables deep and
precise control over the reasoning process called: a cognitive loop via in-situ
optimization (CLIO). CLIO enables large language models (LLMs) to
self-formulate ways of approaching a problem, adapt behavior when
self-confidence is low, and ultimately provide scientists with a final belief
or answer. Through CLIO's open design, scientists can observe uncertainty
levels, understand how final belief states are formulated using graph
structures, and interject corrections. Without any further post-training,
OpenAI's GPT-4.1 with CLIO yields an accuracy of 22.37\% in text-based biology
and medicine questions on Humanity's Last Exam (HLE). This yields a 13.82\% net
or 161.64\% relative increase when compared to the base GPT-4.1 model and
surpasses OpenAI's o3 performance in high and low reasoning effort modes. We
further discovered that oscillations within internal uncertainty measures are
key in determining the accuracy of CLIO's results, revealing how its open
design and internal mechanisms can provide insight and control into scientific
decision-making processes.

Abstract: Radiology visual question answering (RVQA) provides precise answers to

recent methods based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have shown promising progress in RVQA,
they still face challenges in factual accuracy, hallucinations, and cross-modal
misalignment. We introduce a multi-agent system (MAS) designed to support
complex reasoning in RVQA, with specialized agents for context understanding,
multimodal reasoning, and answer validation. We evaluate our system on a
challenging RVQA set curated via model disagreement filtering, comprising
consistently hard cases across multiple MLLMs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our system over strong MLLM
baselines, with a case study illustrating its reliability and interpretability.
This work highlights the potential of multi-agent approaches to support
explainable and trustworthy clinical AI applications that require complex

Conclusion: Countdown游戏是一种理想的规划能力评测基准，能有效评估模型的规划能力。

Abstract: There is a broad consensus that the inability to form long-term plans is one
of the key limitations of current foundational models and agents. However, the
existing planning benchmarks remain woefully inadequate to truly measure their
planning capabilities. Most existing benchmarks either focus on loosely defined
tasks like travel planning or end up leveraging existing domains and problems
from international planning competitions. While the former tasks are hard to
formalize and verify, the latter were specifically designed to test and
challenge the weaknesses of existing automated planners. To address these
shortcomings, we propose a procedure for creating a planning benchmark centered
around the game called Countdown, where a player is expected to form a target
number from a list of input numbers through arithmetic operations. We discuss
how this problem meets many of the desiderata associated with an ideal
benchmark for planning capabilities evaluation. Specifically, the domain allows
for an intuitive, natural language description for each problem instance, it is
computationally challenging (NP-complete), and the instance space is rich
enough that we do not have to worry about memorization. We perform an extensive
theoretical analysis, establishing the computational complexity result and
demonstrate the advantage of our instance generation procedure over public
benchmarks. We evaluate a variety of existing LLM-assisted planning methods on
instances generated using our procedure. Our results show that, unlike other
domains like 24 Game (a special case of Countdown), our proposed dynamic
benchmark remains extremely challenging for existing LLM-based approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于资源限制，日语LLMs的性能提升和推理能力增强具有挑战性。

Method: 从推理LLMs中提取任务向量（推理向量），并将其应用于日语LLMs。

Result: 提出了一种简单有效的方法，显著提升了日语LLMs的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于日语LLMs，还可为其他语言提供启发。

Abstract: Post-training methods have improved the performance and enhanced the
reasoning capability for mainstream large language models (LLMs), but the same
is challenging for Japanese LLMs to achieve due to the amount of resources
required. Inspired by task vectors that extract the change of weights before
and after training, specifically for a certain task, we obtain reasoning
vectors from reasoning LLMs and apply them to Japanese LLMs to boost their
performance. While the resources available present a challenge to improve
Japanese LLMs, we present a simple and effective way to obtain high improvement
and hope to inspire for other languages.

*Shane Caldwell,Max Harley,Michael Kouremetis,Vincent Abruzzo,Will Pearce*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PentestJudge是一个基于大型语言模型（LLM）的系统，用于评估渗透测试代理的操作，通过分层任务分解和工具调用历史，实现对代理行为的自动化评判。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估渗透测试代理的操作通常难以通过编程实现，因此需要一种自动化且可扩展的方法来确保其符合操作标准。

Method: 开发了基于树结构的评分标准，将渗透测试任务分解为更小的子任务和简单的是非标准，利用LLM作为评判者，并与人类专家评分进行对比。

Result: 最佳模型的F1分数达到0.83，工具使用能力强的模型表现更接近人类专家。较弱且便宜的模型可以评判更强模型的测试轨迹。

Conclusion: PentestJudge提供了一种可扩展的方法，用于评估AI安全代理的操作质量，为敏感生产环境中的使用提供了信心。

Abstract: We introduce PentestJudge, a system for evaluating the operations of
penetration testing agents. PentestJudge is a large language model
(LLM)-as-judge with access to tools that allow it to consume arbitrary
trajectories of agent states and tool call history to determine whether a
security agent's actions meet certain operating criteria that would be
impractical to evaluate programmatically. We develop rubrics that use a tree
structure to hierarchically collapse the penetration testing task for a
particular environment into smaller, simpler, and more manageable sub-tasks and
criteria until each leaf node represents simple yes-or-no criteria for
PentestJudge to evaluate. Task nodes are broken down into different categories
related to operational objectives, operational security, and tradecraft.
LLM-as-judge scores are compared to human domain experts as a ground-truth
reference, allowing us to compare their relative performance with standard
binary classification metrics, such as F1 scores. We evaluate several frontier
and open-source models acting as judge agents, with the best model reaching an
F1 score of 0.83. We find models that are better at tool-use perform more
closely to human experts. By stratifying the F1 scores by requirement type, we
find even models with similar overall scores struggle with different types of
questions, suggesting certain models may be better judges of particular
operating criteria. We find that weaker and cheaper models can judge the
trajectories of pentests performed by stronger and more expensive models,
suggesting verification may be easier than generation for the penetration
testing task. We share this methodology to facilitate future research in
understanding the ability of judges to holistically and scalably evaluate the
process quality of AI-based information security agents so that they may be
confidently used in sensitive production environments.

TL;DR: AQUAH是一个基于语言的端到端水文建模代理，通过自然语言提示自动完成数据检索、模型配置、模拟运行和报告生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在简化复杂的环境建模流程，降低地球观测数据、物理工具和决策者之间的门槛。

Method: 利用视觉支持的大型语言模型驱动工作流，实时解析地图和栅格数据，指导关键决策如出口选择、参数初始化和不确定性分析。

Result: 初步实验表明，AQUAH能完成冷启动模拟并生成分析师就绪的文档，结果被专家评为清晰、透明且物理合理。

Conclusion: 尽管需进一步校准和验证，但AQUAH展示了以LLM为中心的视觉代理在环境建模中的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce AQUAH, the first end-to-end language-based agent designed
specifically for hydrologic modeling. Starting from a simple natural-language
prompt (e.g., 'simulate floods for the Little Bighorn basin from 2020 to
2022'), AQUAH autonomously retrieves the required terrain, forcing, and gauge
data; configures a hydrologic model; runs the simulation; and generates a
self-contained PDF report. The workflow is driven by vision-enabled large
language models, which interpret maps and rasters on the fly and steer key
decisions such as outlet selection, parameter initialization, and uncertainty
commentary. Initial experiments across a range of U.S. basins show that AQUAH
can complete cold-start simulations and produce analyst-ready documentation
without manual intervention. The results are judged by hydrologists as clear,
transparent, and physically plausible. While further calibration and validation
are still needed for operational deployment, these early outcomes highlight the
promise of LLM-centered, vision-grounded agents to streamline complex
environmental modeling and lower the barrier between Earth observation data,
physics-based tools, and decision makers.

TL;DR: Medblink是一个评估多模态语言模型在临床图像感知任务中表现的基准测试，发现当前模型在简单感知任务上表现不佳，准确率远低于人类。


<details>

Motivation: 临床医生对AI工具的采用非常谨慎，模型在简单感知任务上的错误会阻碍其临床应用。

Method: 引入Medblink基准测试，涵盖8个临床任务，共1,429道多选题和1,605张图像，评估19种先进MLM模型。

Result: 人类标注者准确率为96.4%，最佳模型仅65%，显示当前模型在视觉基础任务上存在不足。

Conclusion: 需加强多模态语言模型的视觉基础能力，以支持其临床采用。

Abstract: Multimodal language models (MLMs) show promise for clinical decision support
and diagnostic reasoning, raising the prospect of end-to-end automated medical
image interpretation. However, clinicians are highly selective in adopting AI
tools; a model that makes errors on seemingly simple perception tasks such as
determining image orientation or identifying whether a CT scan is
contrast-enhance are unlikely to be adopted for clinical tasks. We introduce
Medblink, a benchmark designed to probe these models for such perceptual
abilities. Medblink spans eight clinically meaningful tasks across multiple
imaging modalities and anatomical regions, totaling 1,429 multiple-choice
questions over 1,605 images. We evaluate 19 state-of-the-art MLMs, including
general purpose (GPT4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet) and domain specific (Med Flamingo,
LLaVA Med, RadFM) models. While human annotators achieve 96.4% accuracy, the
best-performing model reaches only 65%. These results show that current MLMs
frequently fail at routine perceptual checks, suggesting the need to strengthen
their visual grounding to support clinical adoption. Data is available on our
project page.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖标签数据，难以解决动态问题，需自动化优化工作流。

Method: 结合任务流图和代码表示，采用多网格图优化和自反射进化算法。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上平均性能提升8.1%。

Conclusion: Polymath有效解决了无标签数据的动态问题，性能显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at solving complex tasks by executing
agentic workflows composed of detailed instructions and structured operations.
Yet, building general-purpose agents by manually embedding foundation models
into agentic systems such as Chain-of-Thought, Self-Reflection, and ReACT
through text interfaces limits scalability and efficiency. Recently, many
researchers have sought to automate the generation and optimization of these
workflows through code-based representations. However, existing methods often
rely on labeled datasets to train and optimize workflows, making them
ineffective and inflexible for solving real-world, dynamic problems where
labeled data is unavailable. To address this challenge, we introduce Polymath,
a self-optimizing agent with dynamic hierarchical workflow that leverages the
flexibility of task flow graphs and the expressiveness of code-represented
workflows to solve a wide range of real-world, dynamic problems. The proposed
optimization methodology integrates multi-grid-inspired graph optimization with
a self-reflection-guided evolutionary algorithm to refine workflows without
labeled data. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets across coding,
math, and multi-turn QA tasks show that Polymath achieves 8.1% average
improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖外部分类器，无法充分利用LLM的内在能力，因此提出一种自主评估和调节输出的方法。

Method: 结合元认知和仲裁模块，使LLM能够自主评估和调节输出，并在七种先进LLM上测试。

Result: 在AdvBench和Prompt-Injection-Mixed-Techniques-2024数据集上，防御成功率显著提升，部分模型在增强模式下接近完美防御。

Conclusion: 该方法轻量且成本效益高，适用于提升LLM的伦理安全性，尤其适合GenAI应用。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel self-consciousness defense mechanism for Large
Language Models (LLMs) to combat prompt injection attacks. Unlike traditional
approaches that rely on external classifiers, our method leverages the LLM's
inherent reasoning capabilities to perform self-protection. We propose a
framework that incorporates Meta-Cognitive and Arbitration Modules, enabling
LLMs to evaluate and regulate their own outputs autonomously. Our approach is
evaluated on seven state-of-the-art LLMs using two datasets: AdvBench and
Prompt-Injection-Mixed-Techniques-2024. Experiment results demonstrate
significant improvements in defense success rates across models and datasets,
with some achieving perfect and near-perfect defense in Enhanced Mode. We also
analyze the trade-off between defense success rate improvement and
computational overhead. This self-consciousness method offers a lightweight,
cost-effective solution for enhancing LLM ethics, particularly beneficial for
GenAI use cases across various platforms.

Motivation: 解决工具增强型大语言模型生态碎片化问题，简化多协议、复杂执行流程的开发挑战。

Method: 采用协议无关设计，自动生成模式，双模式并发执行，多源工具无缝管理。

Result: 代码减少60-80%，性能提升3.1倍，兼容现有功能调用标准。

Conclusion: 为工具集成架构提供理论见解，并为实际LLM应用开发提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of tool-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) has created
a fragmented ecosystem where developers must navigate multiple protocols,
manual schema definitions, and complex execution workflows. We address this
challenge by proposing a unified approach to tool integration that abstracts
protocol differences while optimizing execution performance. Our solution
demonstrates how protocol-agnostic design principles can significantly reduce
development overhead through automated schema generation, dual-mode concurrent
execution, and seamless multi-source tool management. Experimental results show
60-80% code reduction across integration scenarios, performance improvements up
to 3.1x through optimized concurrency, and full compatibility with existing
function calling standards. This work contributes both theoretical insights
into tool integration architecture and practical solutions for real-world LLM
application development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs能力和自主性的提升，其输出的评估成为关键瓶颈，需要一种可扩展且细致的方法替代人工评估。

Method: 提出'代理即评委'概念，从单模型评委发展到动态多代理辩论框架，并分析其优缺点。

Result: 比较了不同方法在可靠性、成本和人类对齐方面的表现，并调查了在医疗、法律等领域的实际应用。

Conclusion: 代理评估可补充但无法取代人工监督，是迈向可信、可扩展评估的重要一步。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in capability and autonomy, evaluating
their outputs-especially in open-ended and complex tasks-has become a critical
bottleneck. A new paradigm is emerging: using AI agents as the evaluators
themselves. This "agent-as-a-judge" approach leverages the reasoning and
perspective-taking abilities of LLMs to assess the quality and safety of other
models, promising calable and nuanced alternatives to human evaluation. In this
review, we define the agent-as-a-judge concept, trace its evolution from
single-model judges to dynamic multi-agent debate frameworks, and critically
examine their strengths and shortcomings. We compare these approaches across
reliability, cost, and human alignment, and survey real-world deployments in
domains such as medicine, law, finance, and education. Finally, we highlight
pressing challenges-including bias, robustness, and meta evaluation-and outline
future research directions. By bringing together these strands, our review
demonstrates how agent-based judging can complement (but not replace) human
oversight, marking a step toward trustworthy, scalable evaluation for
next-generation LLMs.

Method: 提出BPO三阶段框架：引导（规划四元组与长短链思维融合）、外推（复杂度分层课程学习）、优化（奖励门控拒绝采样）。

Result: 在ALFWorld、ScienceWorld和WebShop上实现最优性能，并显著提高令牌效率。

Conclusion: BPO为代理规划中的推理模型提供了新方法，适用于长时程稀疏奖励环境。

Abstract: Large Language Reasoning Models have demonstrated remarkable success on
static tasks, yet their application to multi-round agentic planning in
interactive environments faces two fundamental challenges. First, the
intractable credit assignment problem renders conventional reinforcement
learning ineffective in sparse-reward settings. Second, the computational
overhead of verbose, step-by-step reasoning histories is prohibitive. To
address these challenges, we propose BPO, a three-stage framework
(bootstrapping, extrapolation, and refinement) that establishes a
self-improving data flywheel to develop robust reasoning models for
long-horizon, sparse-reward environments. Our framework first bootstraps
efficient reasoning using the proposed planning quaternions with long-short
chain-of-thought fusion. It then extrapolates to out-of-distribution tasks
through complexity-stratified curriculum learning. Finally, the model
iteratively refines itself by learning exclusively on experiences selected via
reward-gated rejection sampling. Experiments on ALFWorld, ScienceWorld, and
WebShop demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art with
significant token efficiency, providing a new recipe for reasoning models in
agentic planning.

<details>

Motivation: 现有基于学习的MILP方法独立处理各模块策略学习，忽视其相互依赖，影响求解速度和质量。

Method: 将割平面选择和分支协作建模为Stackelberg博弈，采用两阶段学习范式（数据通信预训练和模块策略协调）。

Result: 在合成和大规模真实MILP数据集上显著提升求解性能，且策略具有优秀的跨实例泛化能力。

Conclusion: Collab-Solver通过协作学习优化多模块策略，为MILP求解提供了高效且泛化性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) has been a fundamental problem in
combinatorial optimization. Previous works have designed a plethora of
hard-coded heuristics to accomplish challenging MILP solving with domain
knowledge. Driven by the high capability of neural networks, recent research is
devoted to replacing manually designed heuristics with learned policies.
Although learning-based MILP methods have shown great promise, existing
worksindependentlytreatthepolicylearningineachmoduleofMILPsolvers without
considering their interdependence, severely hurting the solving speed and
quality. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-agent-based policy
learning framework for MILP (Collab-Solver), which can collaboratively optimize
the policies for multiple modules. Specifically, we formulate the collaboration
of cut selection and branching in MILP solving as a Stackelberg game. Under
this formulation, we develop a two-phase learning paradigm to stabilize the
collaborative policy learning, where the first phase achieves the
data-communicated policy pretraining and the second phase further orchestrates
the policy learning for various modules. The jointly learned policy
significantly improves the solving performance on both synthetic and
large-scale real-world MILP datasets. Moreover, the policies learned by
Collab-Solver have also demonstrated excellent generalization abilities across
different instance sets.

Result: GPT-2能学习元ODE算法，性能优于欧拉方法，且随着示例增加精度呈指数提升，还能泛化到分布外问题。

Conclusion: 研究为理解ICL机制及其在非线性数值问题中的应用提供了新视角。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has emerged as a new paradigm in large language
models (LLMs), enabling them to perform novel tasks by conditioning on a few
examples embedded in the prompt. Yet, the highly nonlinear behavior of ICL for
NLP tasks remains poorly understood. To shed light on its underlying
mechanisms, this paper investigates whether LLMs can solve ordinary
differential equations (ODEs) under the ICL setting. We formulate standard ODE
problems and their solutions as sequential prompts and evaluate GPT-2 models on
these tasks. Experiments on two types of ODEs show that GPT-2 can effectively
learn a meta-ODE algorithm, with convergence behavior comparable to, or better
than, the Euler method, and achieve exponential accuracy gains with increasing
numbers of demonstrations. Moreover, the model generalizes to
out-of-distribution (OOD) problems, demonstrating robust extrapolation
capabilities. These empirical findings provide new insights into the mechanisms
of ICL in NLP and its potential for solving nonlinear numerical problems.

Result: 在真实医疗数据上的实验表明，ToR框架优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: ToR框架通过改进推理路径记录和多智能体一致性验证，显著提升了复杂医疗场景中的临床推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in the medical
domain. However, existing models still fall short when faced with complex
medical diagnosis task in the real world. This is mainly because they lack
sufficient reasoning depth, which leads to information loss or logical jumps
when processing a large amount of specialized medical data, leading to
diagnostic errors. To address these challenges, we propose Tree-of-Reasoning
(ToR), a novel multi-agent framework designed to handle complex scenarios.
Specifically, ToR introduces a tree structure that can clearly record the
reasoning path of LLMs and the corresponding clinical evidence. At the same
time, we propose a cross-validation mechanism to ensure the consistency of
multi-agent decision-making, thereby improving the clinical reasoning ability
of multi-agents in complex medical scenarios. Experimental results on
real-world medical data show that our framework can achieve better performance
than existing baseline methods.

Result: 实验表明CDD在防御性能和泛化能力上达到最优水平。

Conclusion: CDD框架为防御越狱攻击提供了有效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Defending large language models (LLMs) against jailbreak attacks is essential
for their safe and reliable deployment. Existing defenses often rely on shallow
pattern matching, which struggles to generalize to novel and unseen attack
strategies. To address this challenge, we propose the Cognitive-Driven Defense
(CDD) framework, which targets the underlying structure of jailbreak prompts by
applying meta-operations, defined as basic manipulations that conceal harmful
intent.CDD emulates human cognitive reasoning through a structured reasoning
chain. It begins with a global perception of the prompt and follows with a
localized analysis to uncover hidden manipulations. By applying supervised
fine-tuning on this structured chain, the model learns to identify and reason
about known manipulation patterns. To enhance generalization to unseen threats,
an entropy-guided reinforcement learning algorithm (EG-GRPO) is introduced to
encourage exploration of new types and variants of meta-operations. Experiments
demonstrate that CDD can achieve state-of-the-art defense performance and
exhibit strong generalization to unseen jailbreak attacks.

Result: 专有模型表现更优，开源模型在特定维度有竞争力；模型大小、推理模式、量化等影响性能。

Conclusion: 开源模型需针对性优化以提升正确性和有效性，ContractEval为法律领域LLM发展提供基准。

Abstract: The potential of large language models (LLMs) in specialized domains such as
legal risk analysis remains underexplored. In response to growing interest in
locally deploying open-source LLMs for legal tasks while preserving data
confidentiality, this paper introduces ContractEval, the first benchmark to
thoroughly evaluate whether open-source LLMs could match proprietary LLMs in
identifying clause-level legal risks in commercial contracts. Using the
Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset (CUAD), we assess 4 proprietary and 15
open-source LLMs. Our results highlight five key findings: (1) Proprietary
models outperform open-source models in both correctness and output
effectiveness, though some open-source models are competitive in certain
specific dimensions. (2) Larger open-source models generally perform better,
though the improvement slows down as models get bigger. (3) Reasoning
("thinking") mode improves output effectiveness but reduces correctness, likely
due to over-complicating simpler tasks. (4) Open-source models generate "no
related clause" responses more frequently even when relevant clauses are
present. This suggests "laziness" in thinking or low confidence in extracting
relevant content. (5) Model quantization speeds up inference but at the cost of
performance drop, showing the tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy. These
findings suggest that while most LLMs perform at a level comparable to junior
legal assistants, open-source models require targeted fine-tuning to ensure
correctness and effectiveness in high-stakes legal settings. ContractEval
offers a solid benchmark to guide future development of legal-domain LLMs.

Result: 在三个任务上的实验表明，EoH-S显著优于现有方法，性能提升高达60%。

Conclusion: AHSD和EoH-S有效解决了单一启发式泛化能力不足的问题，为自动化启发式设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: Automated Heuristic Design (AHD) using Large Language Models (LLMs) has
achieved notable success in recent years. Despite the effectiveness of existing
approaches, they only design a single heuristic to serve all problem instances,
often inducing poor generalization across different distributions or settings.
To address this issue, we propose Automated Heuristic Set Design (AHSD), a new
formulation for LLM-driven AHD. The aim of AHSD is to automatically generate a
small-sized complementary heuristic set to serve diverse problem instances,
such that each problem instance could be optimized by at least one heuristic in
this set. We show that the objective function of AHSD is monotone and
supermodular. Then, we propose Evolution of Heuristic Set (EoH-S) to apply the
AHSD formulation for LLM-driven AHD. With two novel mechanisms of complementary
population management and complementary-aware memetic search, EoH-S could
effectively generate a set of high-quality and complementary heuristics.
Comprehensive experimental results on three AHD tasks with diverse instances
spanning various sizes and distributions demonstrate that EoH-S consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art AHD methods and achieves up to 60\%
performance improvements.

TL;DR: MissDDIM是一种基于DDIM的表格数据填补方法，解决了传统DDPM方法的高延迟和输出不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于DDPM的缺失数据填补方法存在高推理延迟和输出不稳定性，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出MissDDIM，一种基于DDIM的条件扩散框架，用于表格数据填补。

Result: MissDDIM通过确定性采样减少了输出不稳定性，同时保持了填补的多样性。

Conclusion: MissDDIM在表格数据填补中表现出更高的效率和稳定性，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful tools for missing data
imputation by modeling the joint distribution of observed and unobserved
variables. However, existing methods, typically based on stochastic denoising
diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), suffer from high inference latency and
variable outputs, limiting their applicability in real-world tabular settings.
To address these deficiencies, we present in this paper MissDDIM, a conditional
diffusion framework that adapts Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for
tabular imputation. While stochastic sampling enables diverse completions, it
also introduces output variability that complicates downstream processing.

TL;DR: T2UE框架通过文本描述生成不可学习的示例，避免直接暴露原始图像数据，解决了隐私保护中的矛盾问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有不可学习示例生成方法需要暴露原始数据给第三方服务的隐私矛盾问题。

Method: 利用文本到图像模型将文本描述映射到图像噪声空间，结合误差最小化框架生成有效的不可学习噪声。

Result: T2UE保护的数据显著降低了最先进模型在下游任务中的性能，且保护效果泛化到多种架构和监督学习场景。

Conclusion: T2UE实现了“零接触数据保护”，仅通过文本描述即可保护个人数据，无需直接暴露数据。

Abstract: Large-scale pre-training frameworks like CLIP have revolutionized multimodal
learning, but their reliance on web-scraped datasets, frequently containing
private user data, raises serious concerns about misuse. Unlearnable Examples
(UEs) have emerged as a promising countermeasure against unauthorized model
training, employing carefully crafted unlearnable noise to disrupt the learning
of meaningful representations from protected data. Current approaches typically
generate UEs by jointly optimizing unlearnable noise for both images and their
associated text descriptions (or labels). However, this optimization process is
often computationally prohibitive for on-device execution, forcing reliance on
external third-party services. This creates a fundamental privacy paradox:
users must initially expose their data to these very services to achieve
protection, thereby compromising privacy in the process. Such a contradiction
has severely hindered the development of practical, scalable data protection
solutions. To resolve this paradox, we introduce \textbf{Text-to-Unlearnable
Example (T2UE)}, a novel framework that enables users to generate UEs using
only text descriptions. T2UE circumvents the need for original image data by
employing a text-to-image (T2I) model to map text descriptions into the image
(noise) space, combined with an error-minimization framework to produce
effective unlearnable noise. Extensive experiments show that T2UE-protected
data substantially degrades performance in downstream tasks (e.g., cross-modal
retrieval) for state-of-the-art models. Notably, the protective effect
generalizes across diverse architectures and even to supervised learning
settings. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of "zero-contact data
protection", where personal data can be safeguarded based solely on their
textual descriptions, eliminating the need for direct data exposure.

Abstract: With the proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs), the detection of
misinformation has become increasingly important and complex. This research
proposes an innovative verifiable misinformation detection LLM agent that goes
beyond traditional true/false binary judgments. The agent actively verifies
claims through dynamic interaction with diverse web sources, assesses
information source credibility, synthesizes evidence, and provides a complete
verifiable reasoning process. Our designed agent architecture includes three
core tools: precise web search tool, source credibility assessment tool and
numerical claim verification tool. These tools enable the agent to execute
multi-step verification strategies, maintain evidence logs, and form
comprehensive assessment conclusions. We evaluate using standard misinformation
datasets such as FakeNewsNet, comparing with traditional machine learning
models and LLMs. Evaluation metrics include standard classification metrics,
quality assessment of reasoning processes, and robustness testing against
rewritten content. Experimental results show that our agent outperforms
baseline methods in misinformation detection accuracy, reasoning transparency,
and resistance to information rewriting, providing a new paradigm for
trustworthy AI-assisted fact-checking.

Motivation: 智能教育中生成代理模型的发展不足，且教育场景复杂，需个性化人机交互。

Method: 提出AgentSME框架，采用三种通信模式（Solo、Mono、Echo），以准确性和多样性为指标，测试六种LLM。

Result: Echo模式准确率最高，DeepSeek多样性最佳。

Conclusion: 研究为提升代理学习能力和智能教育模型提供了有价值的信息。

Abstract: Generative agent models specifically tailored for smart education are
critical, yet remain relatively underdeveloped. A key challenge stems from the
inherent complexity of educational contexts: learners are human beings with
various cognitive behaviors, and pedagogy is fundamentally centered on
personalized human-to-human communication. To address this issue, this paper
proposes AgentSME, a unified generative agent framework powered by LLM. Three
directional communication modes are considered in the models, namely Solo,
Mono, and Echo, reflecting different types of agency autonomy and communicative
reciprocity. Accuracy is adopted as the primary evaluation metric, complemented
by three diversity indices designed to assess the diversity of reasoning
contents. Six widely used LLMs are tested to validate the robustness of
communication modes across different model tiers, which are equally divided
into base-capacity and high-capacity configurations. The results show that
generative agents that employ the Echo communication mode achieve the highest
accuracy scores, while DeepSeek exhibits the greatest diversity. This study
provides valuable information to improve agent learning capabilities and
inspire smart education models.

Abstract: We present a framework for training trustworthy large language model (LLM)
agents for optimization modeling via a verifiable synthetic data generation
pipeline. Focusing on linear and mixed-integer linear programming, our approach
begins with structured symbolic representations and systematically produces
natural language descriptions, mathematical formulations, and solver-executable
code. By programmatically constructing each instance with known optimal
solutions, the pipeline ensures full verifiability and enables automatic
filtering of low-quality demonstrations generated by teacher models. Each
dataset instance includes a structured representation of the optimization
problem, a corresponding natural language description, the verified optimal
solution, and step-by-step demonstrations - generated by a teacher model - that
show how to model and solve the problem across multiple optimization modeling
languages. This enables supervised fine-tuning of open-source LLMs specifically
tailored to optimization tasks. To operationalize this pipeline, we introduce
OptiTrust, a modular LLM agent that performs multi-stage translation from
natural language to solver-ready code, leveraging stepwise demonstrations,
multi-language inference, and majority-vote cross-validation. Our agent
achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks. Out of 7
datasets, it achieves the highest accuracy on six and outperforms the next-best
algorithm by at least 8 percentage on three of them. Our approach provides a
scalable, verifiable, and principled path toward building reliable LLM agents
for real-world optimization applications.

Abstract: This research investigates the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI)

students. By focusing on prominent large language models (LLMs) such as
GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o, Gemini, Claude Sonnet, and Llama 2, the study assesses
their effectiveness in conveying environmental concepts and, consequently,
facilitating environmental education. The investigation employs a standardized
tool, the Environmental Knowledge Test (EKT-19), supplemented by targeted
questions, to evaluate the environmental knowledge of university students in
comparison to the responses generated by the AI models. The results of this
study suggest that while AI models possess a vast, readily accessible, and
valid knowledge base with the potential to empower both students and academic
staff, a human discipline specialist in environmental sciences may still be
necessary to validate the accuracy of the information provided.

Conclusion: Geoint-R1为形式几何推理提供了有效解决方案，并通过基准测试验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Mathematical geometric reasoning is essential for scientific discovery and
educational development, requiring precise logic and rigorous formal
verification. While recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
have improved reasoning tasks, existing models typically struggle with formal
geometric reasoning, particularly when dynamically constructing and verifying
auxiliary geometric elements. To address these challenges, we introduce
Geoint-R1, a multimodal reasoning framework designed to generate formally
verifiable geometric solutions from textual descriptions and visual diagrams.
Geoint-R1 uniquely integrates auxiliary elements construction, formal reasoning
represented via Lean4, and interactive visualization. To systematically
evaluate and advance formal geometric reasoning, we propose the Geoint
benchmark, comprising 1,885 rigorously annotated geometry problems across
diverse topics such as plane, spatial, and solid geometry. Each problem
includes structured textual annotations, precise Lean4 code for auxiliary
constructions, and detailed solution steps verified by experts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Geoint-R1 significantly surpasses existing
multimodal and math-specific reasoning models, particularly on challenging
problems requiring explicit auxiliary element constructions.

<details>

Motivation: 传统时间序列方法无法有效捕捉实体间动态交互关系，需要一种能显式表示关系和演化的时间图模型。

Method: 引入全历史图，区分时间步内和时间步间边，并设计ETDNet网络，结合图注意力和时间注意力模块。

Result: 在Waymo和Elliptic++数据集上，ETDNet分别将联合准确率提升至75.6%和F1分数提升至88.1%，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过将结构和时间关系表示为图中的独立边，ETDNet显著提升了动态交互建模的效果。

Abstract: Modeling evolving interactions among entities is critical in many real-world
tasks. For example, predicting driver maneuvers in traffic requires tracking
how neighboring vehicles accelerate, brake, and change lanes relative to one
another over consecutive frames. Likewise, detecting financial fraud hinges on
following the flow of funds through successive transactions as they propagate
through the network. Unlike classic time-series forecasting, these settings
demand reasoning over who interacts with whom and when, calling for a
temporal-graph representation that makes both the relations and their evolution
explicit. Existing temporal-graph methods typically use snapshot graphs to
encode temporal evolution. We introduce a full-history graph that instantiates
one node for every entity at every time step and separates two edge sets: (i)
intra-time-step edges that capture relations within a single frame and (ii)
inter-time-step edges that connect an entity to itself at consecutive steps. To
learn on this graph we design an Edge-Type Decoupled Network (ETDNet) with
parallel modules: a graph-attention module aggregates information along
intra-time-step edges, a multi-head temporal-attention module attends over an
entity's inter-time-step history, and a fusion module combines the two messages
after every layer. Evaluated on driver-intention prediction (Waymo) and Bitcoin
fraud detection (Elliptic++), ETDNet consistently surpasses strong baselines,
lifting Waymo joint accuracy to 75.6\% (vs. 74.1\%) and raising Elliptic++
illicit-class F1 to 88.1\% (vs. 60.4\%). These gains demonstrate the benefit of
representing structural and temporal relations as distinct edges in a single
graph.

Result: 在ToolVQA上微调的7B LFMs在测试集和多个OOD数据集上表现优异，甚至超越GPT-3.5-turbo。

Conclusion: ToolVQA和ToolEngine为提升模型在真实世界工具使用中的能力提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Integrating external tools into Large Foundation Models (LFMs) has emerged as
a promising approach to enhance their problem-solving capabilities. While
existing studies have demonstrated strong performance in tool-augmented Visual
Question Answering (VQA), recent benchmarks reveal significant gaps in
real-world tool-use proficiency, particularly in functionally diverse
multimodal settings requiring multi-step reasoning. In this work, we introduce
ToolVQA, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising 23K instances, designed to
bridge this gap. Unlike previous datasets that rely on synthetic scenarios and
simplified queries, ToolVQA features real-world visual contexts and challenging
implicit multi-step reasoning tasks, better aligning with real user
interactions. To construct this dataset, we propose ToolEngine, a novel data
generation pipeline that employs Depth-First Search (DFS) with a dynamic
in-context example matching mechanism to simulate human-like tool-use
reasoning. ToolVQA encompasses 10 multimodal tools across 7 diverse task
domains, with an average inference length of 2.78 reasoning steps per instance.
The fine-tuned 7B LFMs on ToolVQA not only achieve impressive performance on
our test set but also surpass the large close-sourced model GPT-3.5-turbo on
various out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets, demonstrating strong
generalizability to real-world tool-use scenarios.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在长期交互中缺乏持久记忆，现有记忆系统依赖被动规则，无法实现真正学习和进化。

Method: Nemori采用两步对齐原则（事件分割理论）和预测校准原则（自由能原理），实现语义连贯的记忆组织和自适应知识进化。

Result: 在LoCoMo和LongMemEval基准测试中，Nemori显著优于现有系统，尤其在长上下文环境中表现突出。

Conclusion: Nemori为自主代理处理长期动态工作流提供了可行路径，解决了记忆粒度和知识进化的核心问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities, yet their
inability to maintain persistent memory in long contexts limits their
effectiveness as autonomous agents in long-term interactions. While existing
memory systems have made progress, their reliance on arbitrary granularity for
defining the basic memory unit and passive, rule-based mechanisms for knowledge
extraction limits their capacity for genuine learning and evolution. To address
these foundational limitations, we present Nemori, a novel self-organizing
memory architecture inspired by human cognitive principles. Nemori's core
innovation is twofold: First, its Two-Step Alignment Principle, inspired by
Event Segmentation Theory, provides a principled, top-down method for
autonomously organizing the raw conversational stream into semantically
coherent episodes, solving the critical issue of memory granularity. Second,
its Predict-Calibrate Principle, inspired by the Free-energy Principle, enables
the agent to proactively learn from prediction gaps, moving beyond pre-defined
heuristics to achieve adaptive knowledge evolution. This offers a viable path
toward handling the long-term, dynamic workflows of autonomous agents.
Extensive experiments on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks demonstrate that
Nemori significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art systems, with its
advantage being particularly pronounced in longer contexts.

Abstract: The rise of LLMs such as ChatGPT and Claude fuels the need for AI agents
capable of real-time task handling. However, migrating data-intensive,
multi-modal edge workloads to cloud data centers, traditionally used for agent
deployment, introduces significant latency. Deploying AI agents at the edge
improves efficiency and reduces latency. However, edge environments present
challenges due to limited and heterogeneous resources. Maintaining QoS for
mobile users necessitates agent migration, which is complicated by the
complexity of AI agents coordinating LLMs, task planning, memory, and external
tools. This paper presents the first systematic deployment and management
solution for LLM-based AI agents in dynamic edge environments. We propose a
novel adaptive framework for AI agent placement and migration in edge
intelligence systems. Our approach models resource constraints and
latency/cost, leveraging ant colony algorithms and LLM-based optimization for
efficient decision-making. It autonomously places agents to optimize resource
utilization and QoS and enables lightweight agent migration by transferring
only essential state. Implemented on a distributed system using AgentScope and
validated across globally distributed edge servers, our solution significantly
reduces deployment latency and migration costs.

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM实际部署提供了高效解决方案，并深化了对推理结构的理解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting excel at
complex reasoning but generate verbose thought processes with considerable
redundancy, leading to increased inference costs and reduced efficiency. We
introduce a novel CoT compression framework based on step entropy, a metric
that quantifies the informational contribution of individual reasoning steps to
identify redundancy. Through theoretical analysis and extensive empirical
validation on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we demonstrate that steps with
low entropy are indeed highly redundant. Our experiments reveal that an
astonishing 80\% of low-entropy intermediate steps can be pruned with minor
degradation in the final answer accuracy across DeepSeek-R1-7B, 14B and
Qwen3-8B. This finding sharply contrasts with random or high-entropy pruning,
which severely impairs reasoning performance. Building on this, we propose a
novel two-stage training strategy combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning. This approach
enables LLMs to autonomously learn to generate compressed COTs during inference
by strategically incorporating [SKIP] tokens. Our method significantly enhances
LLM inference efficiency while rigorously preserving accuracy, offering
profound implications for practical LLM deployment and a deeper understanding
of reasoning structures.

Abstract: Automatic assessment of cognitive impairment from spontaneous speech offers a
promising, non-invasive avenue for early cognitive screening. However, current
approaches often lack generalizability when deployed across different languages
and clinical settings, limiting their practical utility. In this study, we
propose CogBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the cross-lingual
and cross-site generalizability of large language models (LLMs) for
speech-based cognitive impairment assessment. Using a unified multimodal
pipeline, we evaluate model performance on three speech datasets spanning
English and Mandarin: ADReSSo, NCMMSC2021-AD, and a newly collected test set,
CIR-E. Our results show that conventional deep learning models degrade
substantially when transferred across domains. In contrast, LLMs equipped with
chain-of-thought prompting demonstrate better adaptability, though their
performance remains sensitive to prompt design. Furthermore, we explore
lightweight fine-tuning of LLMs via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which
significantly improves generalization in target domains. These findings offer a
critical step toward building clinically useful and linguistically robust
speech-based cognitive assessment tools.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了神经符号AI在通用逻辑推理中的潜力，比较了集成方法与混合方法，发现混合方法更具前景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在通用逻辑推理上表现不足，神经符号AI试图将逻辑融入神经网络以解决这一问题。

Method: 介绍了两种方法：集成方法（如LNN）和混合方法（如LLM-SS），并比较它们在通用逻辑推理上的表现。

Result: 混合方法在可解释性和保留LLM优势方面表现更好，更具潜力。

Conclusion: 提出基于LLM-SS的通用框架，支持未来混合方法的研究。

Abstract: General logical reasoning, defined as the ability to reason deductively on
domain-agnostic tasks, continues to be a challenge for large language models
(LLMs). Current LLMs fail to reason deterministically and are not
interpretable. As such, there has been a recent surge in interest in
neurosymbolic AI, which attempts to incorporate logic into neural networks. We
first identify two main neurosymbolic approaches to improving logical
reasoning: (i) the integrative approach comprising models where symbolic
reasoning is contained within the neural network, and (ii) the hybrid approach
comprising models where a symbolic solver, separate from the neural network,
performs symbolic reasoning. Both contain AI systems with promising results on
domain-specific logical reasoning benchmarks. However, their performance on
domain-agnostic benchmarks is understudied. To the best of our knowledge, there
has not been a comparison of the contrasting approaches that answers the
following question: Which approach is more promising for developing general
logical reasoning? To analyze their potential, the following best-in-class
domain-agnostic models are introduced: Logic Neural Network (LNN), which uses
the integrative approach, and LLM-Symbolic Solver (LLM-SS), which uses the
hybrid approach. Using both models as case studies and representatives of each
approach, our analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach is more promising
for developing general logical reasoning because (i) its reasoning chain is
more interpretable, and (ii) it retains the capabilities and advantages of
existing LLMs. To support future works using the hybrid approach, we propose a
generalizable framework based on LLM-SS that is modular by design,
model-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and requires little to no human input.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为UML2Dep的框架，通过形式化规范解决自然语言描述在代码生成中的模糊性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言描述在代码生成中存在模糊性，难以捕捉复杂需求和隐式数据依赖。

Method: 1. 引入增强的UML序列图，结合决策表和API规范；2. 提出数据依赖推断任务（DDI），构建显式数据依赖图。

Result: 通过形式化规范和DDI任务，显著减少了模糊性，提高了代码生成的准确性和效率。

Conclusion: UML2Dep框架有效解决了复杂需求下的代码生成问题，提升了LLMs在服务导向架构中的实用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating code from natural language
(NL) descriptions. However, the plain textual descriptions are inherently
ambiguous and often fail to capture complex requirements like intricate system
behaviors, conditional logic, and architectural constraints; implicit data
dependencies in service-oriented architectures are difficult to infer and
handle correctly. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel step-by-step code
generation framework named UML2Dep by leveraging unambiguous formal
specifications of complex requirements. First, we introduce an enhanced Unified
Modeling Language (UML) sequence diagram tailored for service-oriented
architectures. This diagram extends traditional visual syntax by integrating
decision tables and API specifications, explicitly formalizing structural
relationships and business logic flows in service interactions to rigorously
eliminate linguistic ambiguity. Second, recognizing the critical role of data
flow, we introduce a dedicated data dependency inference (DDI) task. DDI
systematically constructs an explicit data dependency graph prior to actual
code synthesis. To ensure reliability, we formalize DDI as a constrained
mathematical reasoning task through novel prompting strategies, aligning with
LLMs' excellent mathematical strengths. Additional static parsing and
dependency pruning further reduce context complexity and cognitive load
associated with intricate specifications, thereby enhancing reasoning accuracy
and efficiency.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态对抗框架HSG，用于生成和诊断复杂错误，显著提升了数学问题中的错误诊断能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在识别和诊断复杂错误方面表现不佳，主要因为训练目标偏向正确答案，缺乏对错误的学习。

Method: 提出HSG框架，包含两个对抗角色：Sneaky（生成隐蔽错误）和Diagnosis（检测错误），通过对抗协同进化提升能力。

Result: 在数学推理任务中，HSG比基线模型（如GPT-4o）的错误诊断准确率提高了16.8%--31.4%。

Conclusion: HSG框架有效提升了错误诊断能力，并发布了具有挑战性的数据集作为未来研究基准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning and generation across
domains, but still struggle with identifying and diagnosing complex errors.
This stems mainly from training objectives that prioritize correct answers,
limiting exposure to and learning from errors. While recent studies have begun
to address this by introducing error signals, most rely on shallow, static
errors, restricting improvement in deep diagnostic ability. To overcome this,
we propose Hide and Seek Game (HSG), a dynamic adversarial framework for error
generation and diagnosis, and evaluate it on mathematical problem-solving. HSG
involves two adversarial roles: Sneaky, which "hides" by generating subtle,
deceptive reasoning errors, and Diagnosis, which "seeks" to accurately detect
them. Through adversarial co-evolution, both error stealth and diagnostic
precision are enhanced. Experiments on several math reasoning tasks show that
HSG significantly boosts error diagnosis, achieving 16.8\%--31.4\% higher
accuracy than baselines like GPT-4o. We also release a challenging dataset of
deceptive errors and diagnostic annotations as a benchmark for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实路由问题中，用户常提出冲突或不合理需求，导致优化模型无解，现有LLM方法无法全面考虑多种调整可能。

Method: MOID结合LLM代理和多目标优化，生成权衡路径成本和约束违反的解决方案集，并通过LLM分析提供诊断建议。

Result: 在50类不可行路由问题上，MOID单次运行生成多种诊断建议，比现有方法更具实用性。

Conclusion: MOID通过多目标优化和LLM分析，有效诊断不可行模型并提供多样化建议，优于现有方法。

Abstract: In real-world routing problems, users often propose conflicting or
unreasonable requirements, which result in infeasible optimization models due
to overly restrictive or contradictory constraints, leading to an empty
feasible solution set. Existing Large Language Model (LLM)-based methods
attempt to diagnose infeasible models, but modifying such models often involves
multiple potential adjustments that these methods do not consider. To fill this
gap, we introduce Multi-Objective Infeasibility Diagnosis (MOID), which
combines LLM agents and multi-objective optimization within an automatic
routing solver, to provide a set of representative actionable suggestions.
Specifically, MOID employs multi-objective optimization to consider both path
cost and constraint violation, generating a set of trade-off solutions, each
encompassing varying degrees of model adjustments. To extract practical
insights from these solutions, MOID utilizes LLM agents to generate a solution
analysis function for the infeasible model. This function analyzes these
distinct solutions to diagnose the original infeasible model, providing users
with diverse diagnostic insights and suggestions. Finally, we compare MOID with
several LLM-based methods on 50 types of infeasible routing problems. The
results indicate that MOID automatically generates multiple diagnostic
suggestions in a single run, providing more practical insights for restoring
model feasibility and decision-making compared to existing methods.

Motivation: 解决医学数据快速增长导致的知识鸿沟问题，帮助医学专业人员系统化理解和应用最新研究成果。

Method: 使用LLM代理分解PubMed摘要为语义命题，提取KG三元组，并通过上下文变量增强为四元组，结合开放领域和本体论方法。

Result: 提取准确率平均余弦相似度为0.874，上下文变量显著提升生成句子的相似度。

Conclusion: 该方法为医学从业者提供了实时更新的集中知识源，并可能推广到其他领域。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of publicly-available medical data presents a challenge
for clinicians and researchers alike, increasing the gap between the volume of
scientific literature and its applications. The steady growth of studies and
findings overwhelms medical professionals at large, hindering their ability to
systematically review and understand the latest knowledge. This paper presents
an approach to information extraction and automatic knowledge graph (KG)
generation to identify and connect biomedical knowledge. Through a pipeline of
large language model (LLM) agents, the system decomposes 44 PubMed abstracts
into semantically meaningful proposition sentences and extracts KG triples from
these sentences. The triples are enhanced using a combination of open domain
and ontology-based information extraction methodologies to incorporate
ontological categories. On top of this, a context variable is included during
extraction to allow the triple to stand on its own - thereby becoming
`quadruples'. The extraction accuracy of the LLM is validated by comparing
natural language sentences generated from the enhanced triples to the original
propositions, achieving an average cosine similarity of 0.874. The similarity
for generated sentences of enhanced triples were compared with generated
sentences of ordinary triples showing an increase as a result of the context
variable. Furthermore, this research explores the ability for LLMs to infer new
relationships and connect clusters in the knowledge base of the knowledge
graph. This approach leads the way to provide medical practitioners with a
centralised, updated in real-time, and sustainable knowledge source, and may be
the foundation of similar gains in a wide variety of fields.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统信念表示方法（如概率分布或逻辑命题）忽略了信念的内部结构，无法处理矛盾或碎片化的认知状态。

Method: 采用有向加权图表示信念系统，节点为信念，边为认知关系（支持或矛盾），并分别赋予可信度和信心值。

Result: 该模型无需先验一致性或信念更新，支持细粒度结构表示，避免了传统方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 该形式为信念系统的内部组织分析提供了基础，区分了结构强度与信念强度，扩展了认知状态的分类能力。

Abstract: Belief systems are often treated as globally consistent sets of propositions
or as scalar-valued probability distributions. Such representations tend to
obscure the internal structure of belief, conflate external credibility with
internal coherence, and preclude the modeling of fragmented or contradictory
epistemic states. This paper introduces a minimal formalism for belief systems
as directed, weighted graphs. In this framework, nodes represent individual
beliefs, edges encode epistemic relationships (e.g., support or contradiction),
and two distinct functions assign each belief a credibility (reflecting source
trust) and a confidence (derived from internal structural support). Unlike
classical probabilistic models, our approach does not assume prior coherence or
require belief updating. Unlike logical and argumentation-based frameworks, it
supports fine-grained structural representation without committing to binary
justification status or deductive closure. The model is purely static and
deliberately excludes inference or revision procedures. Its aim is to provide a
foundational substrate for analyzing the internal organization of belief
systems, including coherence conditions, epistemic tensions, and
representational limits. By distinguishing belief structure from belief
strength, this formalism enables a richer classification of epistemic states
than existing probabilistic, logical, or argumentation-based approaches.

TL;DR: SmartGen是一个基于LLM的框架，用于生成上下文感知的用户行为数据，以支持智能家居模型的持续适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能家居模型通常基于静态数据集训练，难以应对行为漂移（如季节变化或生活习惯改变）。新数据收集成本高且涉及隐私问题。

Method: SmartGen包含四个组件：时间和语义感知分割、语义感知序列压缩、图引导序列合成和两阶段异常值过滤。

Result: 实验表明，SmartGen显著提升了行为漂移下的异常检测（85.43%）和行为预测（70.51%）性能。

Conclusion: SmartGen通过生成高质量合成数据，有效解决了智能家居模型的行为漂移问题。

Abstract: As smart homes become increasingly prevalent, intelligent models are widely
used for tasks such as anomaly detection and behavior prediction. These models
are typically trained on static datasets, making them brittle to behavioral
drift caused by seasonal changes, lifestyle shifts, or evolving routines.
However, collecting new behavior data for retraining is often impractical due
to its slow pace, high cost, and privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose
SmartGen, an LLM-based framework that synthesizes context-aware user behavior
data to support continual adaptation of downstream smart home models. SmartGen
consists of four key components. First, we design a Time and Semantic-aware
Split module to divide long behavior sequences into manageable, semantically
coherent subsequences under dual time-span constraints. Second, we propose
Semantic-aware Sequence Compression to reduce input length while preserving
representative semantics by clustering behavior mapping in latent space. Third,
we introduce Graph-guided Sequence Synthesis, which constructs a behavior
relationship graph and encodes frequent transitions into prompts, guiding the
LLM to generate data aligned with contextual changes while retaining core
behavior patterns. Finally, we design a Two-stage Outlier Filter to identify
and remove implausible or semantically inconsistent outputs, aiming to improve
the factual coherence and behavioral validity of the generated sequences.
Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that SmartGen
significantly enhances model performance on anomaly detection and behavior
prediction tasks under behavioral drift, with anomaly detection improving by
85.43% and behavior prediction by 70.51% on average. The code is available at

providing feedback. The results show a suitable accuracy rates, validating the
tool's potential to bridge the gap in Arabic language education and
highlighting the tool's promise as a reliable, AI-powered resource for Arabic

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多步推理中常出现错误传播和幻觉问题，尤其是在生成精确数学表达式时，需要一种方法来检测和纠正这些错误。

Method: EDCIM结合轻量级开源LLM和强大专有模型，生成方程组并通过符号化框架检测错误，提供针对性反馈以修正。

Result: 实验表明，EDCIM显著降低了计算和财务成本，同时在正确配置时保持甚至提高了预测准确性。

Conclusion: EDCIM通过平衡成本与准确性，有效解决了LLM在数学任务中的错误问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to perform
explicit multi-step reasoning such as chain-of-thought prompting. However,
their intermediate steps often contain errors that can propagate leading to
inaccurate final predictions. Additionally, LLMs still struggle with
hallucinations and often fail to adhere to prescribed output formats, which is
particularly problematic for tasks like generating mathematical expressions or
source code. This work introduces EDCIM (Error Detection and Correction for
Interpretable Mathematics), a method for detecting and correcting these errors
in interpretable mathematics tasks, where the model must generate the exact
functional form that explicitly solve the problem (expressed in natural
language) rather than a black-box solution. EDCIM uses LLMs to generate a
system of equations for a given problem, followed by a symbolic error-detection
framework that identifies errors and provides targeted feedback for LLM-based
correction. To optimize efficiency, EDCIM integrates lightweight, open-source
LLMs with more powerful proprietary models, balancing cost and accuracy. This
balance is controlled by a single hyperparameter, allowing users to control the
trade-off based on their cost and accuracy requirements. Experimental results
across different datasets show that EDCIM significantly reduces both
computational and financial costs, while maintaining, and even improving,
prediction accuracy when the balance is properly configured.

Conclusion: 大规模激活值的出现受模型设计影响，可通过设计选择预测和控制，对模型稳定性、训练周期和优化有重要意义。

Abstract: Massive activations are scalar values in transformer hidden states that
achieve values orders of magnitude larger than typical activations and have
been shown to be critical for model functionality. While prior work has
characterized these phenomena in fully trained models, the temporal dynamics of
their emergence during training remain poorly understood. We present the first
comprehensive analysis of massive activation development throughout transformer
training, using the Pythia model family as our testbed. Through systematic
analysis of various model sizes across multiple training checkpoints, we
demonstrate that massive activation emergence follows predictable mathematical
patterns that can be accurately modeled using an exponentially-modulated
logarithmic function with five key parameters. We develop a machine learning
framework to predict these mathematical parameters from architectural
specifications alone, achieving high accuracy for steady-state behavior and
moderate accuracy for emergence timing and magnitude. These findings enable
architects to predict and potentially control key aspects of massive activation
emergence through design choices, with significant implications for model
stability, training cycle length, interpretability, and optimization. Our
findings demonstrate that the emergence of massive activations is governed by
model design and can be anticipated, and potentially controlled, before
training begins.

Conclusion: 研究强调了LLM主动验证前提的紧迫性，FPBench为开发可靠、以人为本的代码生成模型提供了理论和实践基础。

Abstract: With the advancement of code generation capabilities in large language models
(LLMs), their reliance on input premises has intensified. When users provide
inputs containing faulty premises, the probability of code generation
hallucinations rises significantly, exposing deficiencies in their
self-scrutiny capabilities. This paper proposes Faulty Premises Bench
(FPBench), the first code generation evaluation framework targeting faulty
premises. By systematically constructing three categories of faulty premises
and integrating multi-dimensional evaluation metrics, it conducts in-depth
assessments of 15 representative LLMs. The key findings are as follows: (1)
Most models exhibit poor reasoning abilities and suboptimal code generation
performance under faulty premises, heavily relying on explicit prompts for
error detection, with limited self-scrutiny capabilities; (2) Faulty premises
trigger a point of diminishing returns in resource investment, leading to
blindly increasing length fails to enhance quality; (3) The three types of
faulty premises respectively activate distinct defect patterns in models,
revealing a triple dissociation in the cognitive mechanisms of code generation
models. This study not only highlights the urgent need for LLMs to proactively
verify premises in code generation but also, through the proposed FPBench
framework and multi-dimensional evaluation system, provides a theoretical
foundation and practical pathway for developing reliable, human-centric code
generation models.

Conclusion: Evo-MCTS不仅提升了性能，还发现了新的算法组合，为计算科学领域的自动化算法发现提供了可转移的方法。

Abstract: Computational scientific discovery increasingly relies on algorithms to
process complex data and identify meaningful patterns - yet faces persistent
challenges in gravitational-wave signal identification. While existing
algorithmic approaches like matched filtering (MF) and deep neural networks
(DNNs) have achieved partial success, their limitations directly stem from
fundamental limitations: MF's excessive computational demands arise from its
reliance on predefined theoretical waveform templates, while DNNs' black-box
architectures obscure decision logic and introduce hidden biases. We propose
Evolutionary Monte Carlo Tree Search (Evo-MCTS), a framework that addresses
these limitations through systematic algorithm space exploration guided by
domain-aware physical constraints. Our approach combines tree-structured search
with evolutionary optimization and large language model heuristics to create
interpretable algorithmic solutions. Our Evo-MCTS framework demonstrates
substantial improvements, achieving a 20.2\% improvement over state-of-the-art
gravitational wave detection algorithms on the MLGWSC-1 benchmark dataset.
High-performing algorithm variants consistently exceed thresholds. The
framework generates human-interpretable algorithmic pathways that reveal
distinct performance patterns. Beyond performance improvements, our framework
discovers novel algorithmic combinations, thereby establishing a transferable
methodology for automated algorithmic discovery across computational science
domains.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将RL训练与代理紧密耦合或依赖序列拼接与掩码，限制了灵活性和扩展性。

Conclusion: Agent Lightning为现实世界代理训练和部署提供了潜力巨大的解决方案。

Abstract: We present Agent Lightning, a flexible and extensible framework that enables
Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based training of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
any AI agent. Unlike existing methods that tightly couple RL training with
agent or rely on sequence concatenation with masking, Agent Lightning achieves
complete decoupling between agent execution and training, allowing seamless
integration with existing agents developed via diverse ways (e.g., using
frameworks like LangChain, OpenAI Agents SDK, AutoGen, and building from
scratch) with almost ZERO code modifications. By formulating agent execution as
Markov decision process, we define an unified data interface and propose a
hierarchical RL algorithm, LightningRL, which contains a credit assignment
module, allowing us to decompose trajectories generated by ANY agents into
training transition. This enables RL to handle complex interaction logic, such
as multi-agent scenarios and dynamic workflows. For the system design, we
