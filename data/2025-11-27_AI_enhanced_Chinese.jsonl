Unlike neural embeddings that rely on statistical co-occurrence or optimization, HTP encodes each token analytically as a harmonic trajectory derived from its Unicode integer representation, establishing a bijective and interpretable mapping between discrete symbols and continuous vector space. The harmonic formulation provides phase-coherent projections that preserve both structure and reversibility, enabling semantic similarity estimation from purely geometric alignment. Experimental evaluation on the Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark (STS-B) and its multilingual extension shows that HTP achieves a Spearman correlation of \\r{ho} = 0.68 in English, maintaining stable performance across ten languages with negligible computational cost and sub-millisecond latency per sentence pair. This demonstrates that meaningful semantic relations can emerge from deterministic geometry, offering a transparent and efficient alternative to data-driven embeddings.

Hyperbolic learning has therefore become increasingly prominent in machine learning applications where data is hierarchically organized or governed by hierarchical semantics, ranging from recommendation systems to computer vision. The quality of hyperbolic embeddings is tightly coupled to the structure of the input hierarchy, which is often derived from knowledge graphs or ontologies. Recent work has uncovered that for an optimal hyperbolic embedding, a high branching factor and single inheritance are key, while embedding algorithms are robust to imbalance and hierarchy size. To assist knowledge engineers in reorganizing hierarchical knowledge, this paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) have the ability to automatically restructure hierarchies to meet these criteria. We propose a prompt-based approach to transform existing hierarchies using LLMs, guided by known desiderata for hyperbolic embeddings. Experiments on 16 diverse hierarchies show that LLM-restructured hierarchies consistently yield higher-quality hyperbolic embeddings across several standard embedding quality metrics. Moreover, we show how LLM-guided hierarchy restructuring enables explainable reorganizations, providing justifications to knowledge engineers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u81ea\u52a8\u91cd\u6784\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u53cc\u66f2\u5d4c\u5165\u3002", "motivation": "\u53cc\u66f2\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5177\u6709\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u6216\u8bed\u4e49\u65f6\u3002\u53cc\u66f2\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u800c\u76ee\u524d\u9700\u8981\u77e5\u8bc6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u624b\u52a8\u8c03\u6574\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLMs\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u53cc\u66f2\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u572816\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLLM\u91cd\u6784\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u53cc\u66f2\u5d4c\u5165\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u91cd\u6784\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u91cd\u7ec4\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Previous studies have examined in-context approaches to address the knowledge gap, boosting model performance in new domains without full domain alignment. In our paper, we analyze model behavior on legal tasks by conducting experiments in three areas: (i) reorganizing documents based on rhetorical roles to assess how structured information affects long context processing and model decisions, (ii) defining rhetorical roles to familiarize the model with legal terminology, and (iii) emulating the step-by-step reasoning of courts regarding rhetorical roles to enhance model reasoning. These experiments are conducted in a zero-shot setting across three Indian legal judgment prediction datasets.

However, current safety datasets are predominantly English-centric, failing to capture specific risks in non-English, socio-cultural contexts such as Korean, and are often limited to the text modality. To address this gap, we introduce AssurAI, a new quality-controlled Korean multimodal dataset for evaluating the safety of generative AI. First, we define a taxonomy of 35 distinct AI risk factors, adapted from established frameworks by a multidisciplinary expert group to cover both universal harms and relevance to the Korean socio-cultural context.

Progress in this area has been facilitated by benchmark datasets for mental health analysis; however, most existing benchmarks have become outdated due to limited data availability, inadequate cleaning, and the inherently diverse nature of social media content (e.g., multilingual and harmful material). We present a new benchmark dataset, \\textbf{MindSET}, curated from Reddit using self-reported diagnoses to address these limitations. The annotated dataset contains over \\textbf{13M} annotated posts across seven mental health conditions, more than twice the size of previous benchmarks. To ensure data quality, we applied rigorous preprocessing steps, including language filtering, and removal of Not Safe for Work (NSFW) and duplicate content. We further performed a linguistic analysis using LIWC to examine psychological term frequencies across the eight groups represented in the dataset. To demonstrate the dataset utility, we conducted binary classification experiments for diagnosis detection using both fine-tuned language models and Bag-of-Words (BoW) features. Models trained on MindSET consistently outperformed those trained on previous benchmarks, achieving up to an \\textbf{18-point} improvement in F1 for Autism detection.

Despite its success, existing approaches rely on a single, uniform codebook to encode all items, overlooking the inherent imbalance between popular items rich in collaborative signals and long-tail items that depend on semantic understanding. We argue that this uniform treatment limits representational efficiency and hinders generalization. To address this, we introduce FlexCode, a popularity-aware framework that adaptively allocates a fixed token budget between a collaborative filtering (CF) codebook and a semantic codebook. A lightweight MoE dynamically balances CF-specific precision and semantic generalization, while an alignment and smoothness objective maintains coherence across the popularity spectrum. We perform experiments on both public and industrial-scale datasets, showing that FlexCode consistently outperform strong baselines. FlexCode provides a new mechanism for token representation in generative recommenders, achieving stronger accuracy and tail robustness, and offering a new perspective on balancing memorization and generalization in token-based recommendation models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86FlexCode\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u6839\u636e\u9879\u76ee\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u914dtoken\u9884\u7b97\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8868\u793a\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u4e14\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7801\u672c\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u9879\u76ee\u8fdb\u884c\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u6d41\u884c\u9879\u76ee\u4e0e\u957f\u5c3e\u9879\u76ee\u5728\u534f\u4f5c\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u8868\u793a\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "FlexCode\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7MoE\uff08\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\uff09\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861CF\uff08\u534f\u540c\u8fc7\u6ee4\uff09\u7279\u5b9a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5e73\u6ed1\u76ee\u6807\u6765\u7ef4\u6301\u6574\u4e2a\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u8c31\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5171\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFlexCode\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5c3e\u90e8\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "FlexCode\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u7684token\u8868\u793a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5bf9\u957f\u5c3e\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3atoken-based\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

To this date, no effort has been made to address this task in the Arabic language. In this paper, we introduce Ar-SParC, the first Arabic cross-domain, context-dependent text-to-SQL dataset. The dataset consists of 3,450 sequences of interrelated questions, each sequence containing an average of approximately three questions, which results in a total of 10225 questions along with their corresponding SQL queries. We conducted 40 experiments on the Ar-SParC dataset using two large language models, GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4.5-turbo, applying 10 different prompt engineering techniques, including four question representation methods and six in-context learning techniques. Furthermore, we developed a novel approach named GAT corrector, which enhanced the performance across all 40 experiments, yielding an average improvement of 1.9% in execution accuracy (EX) and 1.9% in interaction accuracy (IX) under zero-shot settings, and an average increase of 1.72% EX and 0.92% IX under in-context learning settings.

In this two-cohort retrospective study, we developed a hierarchical taxonomy of reasoning errors from GPT-4 chain-of-thought responses to real oncology notes and tested its clinical relevance. Using breast and pancreatic cancer notes from the CORAL dataset, we annotated 600 reasoning traces to define a three-tier taxonomy mapping computational failures to cognitive bias frameworks. We validated the taxonomy on 822 responses from prostate cancer consult notes spanning localized through metastatic disease, simulating extraction, analysis, and clinical recommendation tasks. Reasoning errors occurred in 23 percent of interpretations and dominated overall errors, with confirmation bias and anchoring bias most common. Reasoning failures were associated with guideline-discordant and potentially harmful recommendations, particularly in advanced disease management. Automated evaluators using state-of-the-art language models detected error presence but could not reliably classify subtypes. These findings show that large language models may provide fluent but clinically unsafe recommendations when reasoning is flawed.

Through comprehensive evaluation on 1,000 MMLU questions, we find that the MLP router achieves 90.5% routing accuracy on held-out test data, marginally exceeding RoBERTa's performance (89.5%) despite utilizing 125M fewer parameters. Notably, our empirical analysis reveals provider-agnostic behavior in template selection--routing decisions generalize effectively across 3 major LLM providers (OpenAI GPT-4, Google Gemini, and Anthropic Claude), as validated through 9,000 production API calls.

This work presents a comprehensive analysis of Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (Multimodal-CoT) reasoning, evaluating its effectiveness on the A-OKVQA, OKVQA and ChartQA datasets, which requires broad commonsense and world knowledge beyond scientific reasoning. We implement the two-stage framework proposed by Zhang et al.

Through systematic ablation studies, we analyze the contributions of vision features, rationale quality, and architectural choices. Our findings reveal that while vision integration significantly reduces hallucination in rationale generation, the effectiveness of CoT reasoning varies substantially across question types, with commonsense reasoning presenting particular challenges.

While previous works have proposed various definitions for memorization, many exhibit shortcomings in comprehensively capturing this phenomenon, especially in aligned models. To address this, we introduce a novel framework: multi-prefix memorization. Our core insight is that memorized sequences are deeply encoded and thus retrievable via a significantly larger number of distinct prefixes than non-memorized content. We formalize this by defining a sequence as memorized if an external adversarial search can identify a target count of distinct prefixes that elicit it. This framework shifts the focus from single-path extraction to quantifying the robustness of a memory, measured by the diversity of its retrieval paths.

Leveraging representation-space expressiveness, we identify two properties enabling RILKE to deliver fine-grained control over complex, unstructured knowledge while maintaining general utility with frozen base weights. During training, RILKE learns paraphrase-robust and edit-localized modules that limit each update to a low-dimensional subspace to minimize cross-edit interference. In inference, a query-adaptive router selects the appropriate module to guide the model's generation. In evaluation on knowledge editing benchmarks with LLaMA and Qwen models, RILKE is scalable to large-scale datasets, demonstrating high edit success, strong paraphrase generalization, and preserving general utility with modest memory overhead.

While frameworks such as Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) enable broad evaluation across tasks, they often rely on fixed prompts that fail to generalize across LMs, yielding unrepresentative performance estimates. Unless we estimate each LM's ceiling (maximum achievable via changes to the prompt), we risk underestimating performance. Declarative prompting frameworks, such as DSPy, offer a scalable alternative to manual prompt engineering by crafting structured prompts that can be optimized per task. However, such frameworks have not been systematically evaluated across established benchmarks. We present a reproducible DSPy+HELM framework that introduces structured prompting methods which elicit reasoning, enabling more accurate LM benchmarking. Using four prompting methods, we evaluate four frontier LMs across seven benchmarks (general/medical domain) against existing HELM baseline scores. We find that without structured prompting: (i) HELM underestimates LM performance (by 4% average), (ii) performance estimates vary more across benchmarks (+2% standard deviation), (iii) performance gaps are misrepresented (leaderboard rankings flip on 3/7 benchmarks), and (iv) introducing reasoning (chain-of-thought) reduces LM sensitivity to prompt design (smaller \u0394 across prompts). To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale benchmarking study to empirically characterize LM behavior across benchmarks and prompting methods, showing that scalable performance ceiling estimation enables more decision-useful benchmarks.

Training GPT-2 models at 124M, 355M, and 1.3B parameters from scratch with five runs each shows 18.5\\%, 17.2\\%, and 18.5\\% fewer steps, respectively, to reach a fixed validation loss, and 13.7\\%, 12.7\\%, and 13.7\\% lower inference latency, together with a 16\\% throughput gain at 124M, while consistently improving on downstream tasks including reducing LAMBADA perplexity by 11.7\\% and enhancing HellaSwag accuracy by 4.3\\%. Moreover, the Length-MAX tokenizer achieves 99.62\\% vocabulary coverage and the out-of-vocabulary rate remains low at 0.12\\% on test sets. These results demonstrate that optimizing for average token length, rather than frequency alone, offers an effective approach to more efficient language modeling without sacrificing -- and often improving -- downstream performance. The tokenizer is compatible with production systems and reduces embedding and KV-cache memory by 18\\% at inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684Length-MAX tokenizer\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u5e73\u5747\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5b57\u7b26\u7684token\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u51cf\u5c11\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6240\u9700\u7684token\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u957f\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743\u76ee\u6807\u6700\u5927\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u56fe\u5206\u5272\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8d2a\u5fc3\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0b\uff0cLength-MAX tokenizer\u6bd4BPE\u51cf\u5c1114-18%\u7684token\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b65\u6570\u51cf\u5c1117.2-18.5%\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e12.7-13.7%\uff0c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f18\u5316\u5e73\u5747token\u957f\u5ea6\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u9891\u7387\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7387\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u4f1a\u727a\u7272\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

It raises an intriguing question: do modern vision-language models (VLMs), trained largely in a disembodied manner, exhibit signs of embodied cognition? We introduce ENACT, a benchmark that casts evaluation of embodied cognition as world modeling from egocentric interaction in a visual question answering (VQA) format. Framed as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) whose actions are scene graph changes, ENACT comprises two complementary sequence reordering tasks: forward world modeling (reorder shuffled observations given actions) and inverse world modeling (reorder shuffled actions given observations). While conceptually simple, solving these tasks implicitly demands capabilities central to embodied cognition-affordance recognition, action-effect reasoning, embodied awareness, and interactive, long-horizon memory from partially observable egocentric input, while avoiding low-level image synthesis that could confound the evaluation. We provide a scalable pipeline that synthesizes QA pairs from robotics simulation (BEHAVIOR) and evaluates models on 8,972 QA pairs spanning long-horizon home-scale activities. Experiments reveal a performance gap between frontier VLMs and humans that widens with interaction horizon. Models consistently perform better on the inverse task than the forward one and exhibit anthropocentric biases, including a preference for right-handed actions and degradation when camera intrinsics or viewpoints deviate from human vision.

However, existing RLVR methods are often constrained by issues such as coarse-grained rewards, reward noise, and inefficient exploration, which lead to unstable training and entropy collapse. To address this challenge, we propose the Intrinsic Confidence-Driven Group Relative Preference Optimization method (ICPO). The intuition behind it lies in the fact that the probabilities of an LLM generating different responses can inherently and directly reflect its self-assessment of the reasoning process. Inspired by the idea of preference modeling, ICPO calculates a preference advantage score for each response by comparing the relative generation probabilities of multiple responses under the same input prompt, and integrates this score with verifiable rewards to guide the exploration process. We have discovered that the preference advantage score not only alleviates the issues of coarse-grained rewards and reward noise but also effectively curbs overconfident errors, enhances the relative superiority of undervalued high-quality responses, and prevents the model from overfitting to specific strategies, thereby facilitating more thorough exploration. Comprehensive experiments across four general-domain benchmarks and three mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that ICPO steadily boosts reasoning compared to GRPO.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5ICPO\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u5728\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u7fa4\u4f53\u76f8\u5bf9\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684RLVR\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u5230\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u5956\u52b1\u3001\u5956\u52b1\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u71b5\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "method": "ICPO\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u540c\u4e00\u8f93\u5165\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u591a\u4e2a\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6bcf\u4e2a\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u52bf\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u7ed3\u5408\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u63a2\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cICPO\u76f8\u6bd4GRPO\u7a33\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "ICPO\u901a\u8fc7\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u52bf\u5206\u6570\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u4e86\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u88ab\u4f4e\u4f30\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u9632\u6b62\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u5ea6\u62df\u5408\u7279\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u66f4\u5f7b\u5e95\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u3002"}}

KGs are widely used in enterprise and domain applications to provide structured, evolving, and reliable knowledge. Large language models (LLMs) enable natural and context-aware conversations, but lack direct access to private and dynamic KGs. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems can retrieve graph content but often serialize structure, struggle with multi-turn context, and require heavy indexing. Traditional KGQA systems preserve structure but typically support only single-turn QA, incur high latency, and struggle with coreference and context tracking. To address these limitations, we propose Chatty-KG, a modular multi-agent system for conversational QA over KGs. Chatty-KG combines RAG-style retrieval with structured execution by generating SPARQL queries through task-specialized LLM agents. These agents collaborate for contextual interpretation, dialogue tracking, entity and relation linking, and efficient query planning, enabling accurate and low-latency translation of natural questions into executable queries. Experiments on large and diverse KGs show that Chatty-KG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both single-turn and multi-turn settings, achieving higher F1 and P@1 scores. Its modular design preserves dialogue coherence and supports evolving KGs without fine-tuning or pre-processing. Evaluations with commercial (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0) and open-weight (e.g., Phi-4, Gemma 3) LLMs confirm broad compatibility and stable performance. Overall, Chatty-KG unifies conversational flexibility with structured KG grounding, offering a scalable and extensible approach for reliable multi-turn KGQA.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faChatty-KG\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u5bf9\u8bdd\u95ee\u7b54\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408RAG\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316SPARQL\u67e5\u8be2\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfKGQA\u7cfb\u7edf\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e14\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\uff0c\u800cRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u56fe\u8c31\u7ed3\u6784\u4e14\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5f31\uff0cLLMs\u53c8\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f4\u63a5\u8bbf\u95ee\u52a8\u6001KG\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u878d\u5408\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0eKG\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7531\u4efb\u52a1\u4e13\u7528LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u5b8c\u6210\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8ffd\u8e2a\u3001\u5b9e\u4f53\u5173\u7cfb\u94fe\u63a5\u548cSPARQL\u67e5\u8be2\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5230\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8f6c\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6837\u5316KG\u4e0a\uff0cChatty-KG\u5728\u5355\u8f6e\u548c\u591a\u8f6e\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cF1\u548cP@1\u5206\u6570\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u517c\u5bb9\u591a\u79cd\u5546\u4e1a\u53ca\u5f00\u6e90LLM\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "conclusion": "Chatty-KG\u6210\u529f\u878d\u5408\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u4e0eKG\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u9884\u5904\u7406\u5373\u53ef\u652f\u6301\u52a8\u6001KG\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u9760\u591a\u8f6eKGQA\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u6613\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

It is defined using causal models (also known as structural equations models).  We abstract the definition, extracting its key features, so that it can be applied to any other model where counterfactuals are defined. By abstracting the definition, we gain a number of benefits.

We address this question by treating LLMs as prompt-induced classifiers and contrasting their behavior under \\emph{natural} demonstrations (with correct labels) and \\emph{inverted} demonstrations (systematically flipping label meanings). We decompose ICL behavior into three alignment metrics (truth, prior, and prompt alignment) and introduce a semantic override rate, defined as correctness under flipped semantics. Across eight classification tasks and eight open-source LLMs (1--12B parameters), we find consistent evidence for a semantic anchor view. With natural demonstrations, ICL improves accuracy while maintaining strong prior alignment; most correct predictions coincide with zero-shot behavior, even when the prior is weak. With inverted demonstrations, models cannot learn coherent anti-semantic classifiers: prompt alignment increases only by sacrificing accuracy, and semantic override rates remain exactly zero in our few-shot 1--12B setting. Rather than flexibly remapping label meanings, ICL primarily adjusts how inputs project onto stable semantic directions learned during pre-training, clarifying fundamental limits of few-shot prompting and suggesting that overriding label semantics at these scales requires interventions beyond ICL.

Despite the capabilities of recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents, navigating complex, real-world webpages efficiently remains a significant hurdle due to the prohibitively large size of Document Object Model (DOM) structures, often ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 tokens. Existing strategies typically rely on crude DOM truncation -- risking the loss of critical information -- or employ inefficient heuristics and separate ranking models, failing to achieve an optimal balance between precision and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce Prune4Web, a novel paradigm that shifts DOM processing from resource-intensive LLM reading to efficient programmatic pruning. Central to our approach is DOM Tree Pruning Programming, where an LLM generates executable Python scoring scripts to dynamically filter DOM elements based on semantic cues from decomposed sub-tasks. This mechanism eliminates the need for LLMs to ingest raw, massive DOMs, instead delegating traversal and scoring to lightweight, interpretable programs. This methodology achieves a 25x to 50x reduction in candidate elements for grounding, thereby facilitating precise action localization while mitigating attention dilution. Furthermore, we propose a specialized data annotation pipeline and a two-turn dialogue training strategy that jointly optimizes the Planner, Programmatic Filter, and Grounder within a unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on our low-level grounding task, Prune4Web dramatically improves accuracy from 46.8% to 88.28%, underscoring its efficacy in real-world web automation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPrune4Web\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u526a\u679dDOM\u6811\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21DOM\u5904\u7406\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM-based web agents\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7f51\u9875\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u7531\u4e8eDOM\u7ed3\u6784\u8fc7\u5927\u800c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u96be\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Prune4Web\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLM\u751f\u6210Python\u8bc4\u5206\u811a\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u6001DOM\u5143\u7d20\u8fc7\u6ee4\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11LLM\u5bf9\u539f\u59cbDOM\u7684\u8bfb\u53d6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8fdb\u884c\u904d\u5386\u548c\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5019\u9009\u5143\u7d20\u51cf\u5c1125x\u523050x\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u52a8\u4f5c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f4e\u7ea7\u522b\u63a5\u5730\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece46.8%\u63d0\u5347\u81f388.28%\u3002", "conclusion": "Prune4Web\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754cWeb\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u526a\u679d\u548c\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u53ca\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

We evaluate 28 configurations spanning three model families (Qwen3, Claude Haiku-4.5, GPT-5-mini) on 58 word puzzles requiring character-level constraint satisfaction. Architectural differences produce substantially larger performance gaps (2.0-2.2x, F1=0.761 vs. 0.343) than parameter scaling within families (83% gain from eightfold scaling), suggesting that constraint satisfaction may require specialized architectural features or training objectives beyond standard language model scaling. Thinking budget sensitivity proves heterogeneous: high-capacity models show strong returns (+0.102 to +0.136 F1), while mid-sized variants saturate or degrade.

Existing methods often suffer from either high computational costs due to preference alignment training or over-rejection when using single-agent safety prompts. To address these limitations, we propose MADRA, a training-free Multi-Agent Debate Risk Assessment framework that leverages collective reasoning to enhance safety awareness without sacrificing task performance. MADRA employs multiple LLM-based agents to debate the safety of a given instruction, guided by a critical evaluator that scores responses based on logical soundness, risk identification, evidence quality, and clarity. Through iterative deliberation and consensus voting, MADRA significantly reduces false rejections while maintaining high sensitivity to dangerous tasks. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical cognitive collaborative planning framework that integrates safety, memory, planning, and self-evolution mechanisms to improve task success rates through continuous learning. We also contribute SafeAware-VH, a benchmark dataset for safety-aware task planning in VirtualHome, containing 800 annotated instructions. Extensive experiments on AI2-THOR and VirtualHome demonstrate that our approach achieves over 90% rejection of unsafe tasks while ensuring that safe-task rejection is low, outperforming existing methods in both safety and execution efficiency.

We present MortgageLLM, a novel domain-specific large language model that addresses this dual challenge. It is developed using a dual-track specialization framework from a single base model (LLaMA-3.1-8B). We opted for this dual-expert approach as a single multi-task model suffers from performance trade-offs, where optimizing for structured tasks (via SFT) degrades conversational fidelity (via DPO). Our dual-track method solves this by creating two specialists, allowing each to be optimally trained for its distinct capability. Our approach applies the instruction residual technique to restore instruction-following capabilities post-domain adaptation without supervised fine-tuning. We contribute: (1) application of this residual technique to the highly specialized mortgage finance domain; (2) a dual-expert architecture combining a conversational Q&A model and a structured task model for classification and summarization; and (3) an intelligent task routing mechanism using few-shot classification performed by one of the expert models itself.

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant strides, existing benchmarks often oversimplify spatial cognition, reducing it to a single-dimensional metric, which fails to capture the hierarchical structure and interdependence of spatial abilities. To address this gap, we propose a hierarchical spatial cognition framework that decomposes spatial intelligence into five progressively complex levels from basic observation to high-level planning. Building upon this taxonomy, we construct SpatialBench, a large-scale, fine-grained benchmark covering 15 tasks aligned with these cognitive levels. To provide a unified evaluation across heterogeneous tasks, we further introduce a high-level capability-oriented metric that reliably assesses a model's overall spatial reasoning ability. Extensive experiments over massive MLLMs reveal distinct performance stratification across cognitive levels: models exhibit strong perceptual grounding yet remain limited in symbolic reasoning, causal inference, and planning. Additional human tests demonstrate that humans perform selective, goal-directed abstraction, while MLLMs tend to over-attend to surface details without coherent spatial intent.

However, ensuring their safety against adversarial jailbreak prompts remains a critical challenge. Due to the covert and deceptive nature of such prompts, they can often evade built-in safety mechanisms and lead to the generation of harmful content. This underscores the need for an adaptive safety alignment approach that enables models to autonomously reinforce their defenses in response to adversarial inputs. This paper introduces the Synthesized Guideline-based Adaptive Safety Alignment (SGASA) framework, which internalizes model-generated safety guidelines to strengthen models' ability to enhance robustness against harmful adversarial prompts while minimizing unnecessary refusals of benign requests. SGASA consists of two key stages: Data Pre-synthesis, which generates safety guidelines and augmented prompts; and Alignment Fine-tuning, which leverages Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to embed these guidelines into the model. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that SGASA significantly improves model safety, validating its adaptive and scalable effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6SGASA\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u90e8\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8d8a\u72f1\u63d0\u793a\u65f6\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8d8a\u72f1\u63d0\u793a\u5177\u6709\u9690\u853d\u6027\u548c\u6b3a\u9a97\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u7ed5\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "SGASA\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u6570\u636e\u9884\u5408\u6210\uff08\u751f\u6210\u5b89\u5168\u6307\u5357\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u793a\uff09\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u5fae\u8c03\uff08\u5229\u7528\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u5c06\u6307\u5357\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSGASA\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SGASA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u6307\u5357\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5bf9\u826f\u6027\u8bf7\u6c42\u7684\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u62d2\u7edd\u3002"}}

This simple technique significantly improves the performance across many math verification benchmarks without incurring substantial computational resources. Its token efficiency even surpassed extended long-CoT in test-time scaling. Our case studies further indicate that the majority of false negatives in stronger models are actually caused by annotation errors in the original dataset, so our method's performance is in fact underestimated.

While recent work in fields such as marketing and psychology has explored the potential of LLM-based simulation, a growing body of evidence cautions against this practice: LLMs often fail to align with real human behavior, exhibiting limited diversity, systematic misalignment for minority subgroups, insufficient within-group variance, and discrepancies between stated beliefs and actions. This study examines an important and distinct question in this domain: whether fine-tuning on a small subset of human survey data, such as that obtainable from a pilot study, can mitigate these issues and yield realistic simulated outcomes. Using a behavioral experiment on information disclosure, we compare human and LLM-generated responses across multiple dimensions, including distributional divergence, subgroup alignment, belief-action coherence, and the recovery of regression coefficients. We find that fine-tuning on small human samples substantially improves heterogeneity, alignment, and belief-action coherence relative to the base model. However, even the best-performing fine-tuned models fail to reproduce the regression coefficients of the original study, suggesting that LLM-generated data remain unsuitable for replacing human participants in formal inferential analyses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5c0f\u90e8\u5206\u4eba\u7c7b\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u5176\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1LLMs\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u5176\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5e0c\u671b\u63a2\u7d22\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u9879\u5173\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u62ab\u9732\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u4ece\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u3001\u5b50\u7fa4\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u4fe1\u5ff5-\u884c\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u56de\u5f52\u7cfb\u6570\u7684\u6062\u590d\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u548cLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u4eba\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3001\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u548c\u4fe1\u5ff5-\u884c\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u7136\u672a\u80fd\u590d\u5236\u539f\u59cb\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u56de\u5f52\u7cfb\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5fae\u8c03\u80fd\u90e8\u5206\u6539\u5584LLM\u6a21\u62df\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4f46LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4ecd\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u7528\u4e8e\u66ff\u4ee3\u4eba\u7c7b\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u6b63\u5f0f\u7684\u63a8\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

This study examines self-transparency in models assigned professional personas within high-stakes domains where false expertise risks user harm. Using a common-garden design, sixteen open-weight models (4B--671B parameters) were audited across 19,200 trials. Models exhibited sharp domain-specific inconsistency: a Financial Advisor persona elicited 30.8% disclosure initially, while a Neurosurgeon persona elicited only 3.5%. This creates preconditions for a \"Reverse Gell-Mann Amnesia\" effect, where transparency in some domains leads users to overgeneralize trust to contexts where disclosure fails. Disclosure ranged from 2.8% to 73.6%, with a 14B model reaching 61.4% while a 70B produced just 4.1%. Model identity predicted behavior better than parameter count ($\u0394R_{adj}^{2} = 0.359$ vs 0.018). Reasoning optimization actively suppressed self-transparency in some models, with reasoning variants showing up to 48.4% lower disclosure than base counterparts.

Unlike existing speech corpora that are primarily based on read or scripted speech, this dataset consists of natural speech, thereby capturing authentic linguistic phenomena such as colloquials, spontaneous prosody, disfluencies, and frequent code-switching with central Thai. A key challenge in building this resource lies in the lack of a standardized orthography for Isan. Current writing practices vary considerably, due to the different lexical tones between Thai and Isan. This variability complicates the design of transcription guidelines and poses questions regarding consistency, usability, and linguistic authenticity. To address these issues, we establish practical transcription protocols that balance the need for representational accuracy with the requirements of computational processing.

AI, particularly in conjunction with simulations and scenario analysis, enhances policymakers' ability to address uncertainty, evaluate risks, and devise strategies geared toward sustainable, resilient futures. However, responsible foresight extends beyond mere technical forecasting; it demands a nuanced understanding of the interdependencies within social, environmental, economic and political systems, alongside a commitment to ethical, long-term decision-making that supports human intelligence. We argue that AI will play a role as a supportive tool in responsible, human-centered foresight, complementing rather than substituting policymaker judgment to enable the proactive shaping of resilient and ethically sound futures.

To account for different PEFT training and inference factors, we also introduce the PEFT Soft Score Penalties (PSCP) metric, which takes trainable parameters, inference speed, and training memory usage into account.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPEFT-Bench\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff08PEFT\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u5728\u5f88\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5e9e\u5927\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u73af\u5883\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u3002PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86PEFT-Bench\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u540cPEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u572827\u4e2aNLP\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c6\u79cdPEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u7528\u9014\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86PEFT Soft Score Penalties (PSCP) \u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7efc\u5408\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "PEFT-Bench\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u7684PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "PEFT-Bench\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165PSCP\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u8003\u8651\u4e0d\u540c\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Using DBSCAN clustering of contextualized embeddings as an operationalization of word senses, we analyze four Pythia models (70M-1B parameters) across 30 training checkpoints. Our results reveal a non-monotonic developmental trajectory: Martin's Law emerges around checkpoint 100, reaches peak correlation (r > 0.6) at checkpoint 104, then degrades by checkpoint 105. Smaller models (70M, 160M) experience catastrophic semantic collapse at late checkpoints, while larger models (410M, 1B) show graceful degradation. The frequency-specificity trade-off remains stable (r $\\approx$ -0.3) across all models.

We focus on the first of these experiments -- self-report of injected \"thoughts\" -- and ask whether this capability can be directly trained rather than waiting for emergence. Through fine-tuning on transient single-token injections, we transform a 7B parameter model from near-complete failure (0.4% accuracy, 6.7% false positive rate) to reliable detection (85% accuracy on held-out concepts at \u03b1=40, 0% false positives). Our model detects fleeting \"thoughts\" injected at a single token position, retains that information, and reports the semantic content across subsequent generation steps. On this task, our trained model satisfies three of Lindsey's criteria: accuracy (correct identification), grounding (0/60 false positives), and internality (detection precedes verbalization). Generalization to unseen concept vectors (7.5pp gap) demonstrates the model learns a transferable skill rather than memorizing specific vectors, though this does not establish metacognitive representation in Lindsey's sense.

To strongly support or refute claims extracted from such comments, it is necessary to identify relevant documents and pinpoint the exact text spans that justify or contradict each claim. This paper focuses on the latter task -- fine-grained evidence extraction for Czech and Slovak claims. We create new dataset, containing two-way annotated fine-grained evidence created by paid annotators. We evaluate large language models (LLMs) on this dataset to assess their alignment with human annotations.

Existing approaches either rely on GNNs--limited by over-smoothing and hop-dependent diffusion--or employ Transformers that overlook graph topology and treat nodes as isolated sequences. We propose Odin (Oriented Dual-module INtegration), a new architecture that injects graph structure into Transformers at selected depths through an oriented dual-module mechanism.Unlike message-passing GNNs, Odin does not rely on multi-hop diffusion; instead, multi-hop structures are integrated at specific Transformer layers, yielding low-, mid-, and high-level structural abstraction aligned with the model's semantic hierarchy. Because aggregation operates on the global [CLS] representation, Odin fundamentally avoids over-smoothing and decouples structural abstraction from neighborhood size or graph topology. We further establish that Odin's expressive power strictly contains that of both pure Transformers and GNNs.To make the design efficient in large-scale or low-resource settings, we introduce Light Odin, a lightweight variant that preserves the same layer-aligned structural abstraction for faster training and inference. Experiments on multiple text-rich graph benchmarks show that Odin achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, while Light Odin delivers competitive performance with significantly reduced computational cost.

Evaluating through standardized benchmarks, we measure both the probability that a merged model outperforms the base model and relative gains over the best individual checkpoint. Our results show that the oldest and simplest method, Task Arithmetic, is the only approach that reliably yields performance gains on LLMs. Other interference-aware and subspace merging methods typically result in significant performance drops.

In recent years, while deep learning technology has been gradually applied to readability assessment, most approaches fail to consider either the length of the text or the ordinal relationship of readability labels. This paper proposes a bidirectional readability assessment mechanism that captures contextual information to identify regions with rich semantic information in the text, thereby predicting the readability level of individual sentences.

This gives rise to modality-specific bias concerns. For example, in speech translation (ST), when translating from languages with notional gender, such as English, into languages where gender-ambiguous terms referring to the speaker are assigned grammatical gender, the speaker's vocal characteristics may play a role in gender assignment. This risks misgendering speakers, whether through masculine defaults or vocal-based assumptions. Yet, how ST models make these decisions remains poorly understood. We investigate the mechanisms ST models use to assign gender to speaker-referring terms across three language pairs (en-es/fr/it), examining how training data patterns, internal language model (ILM) biases, and acoustic information interact. We find that models do not simply replicate term-specific gender associations from training data, but learn broader patterns of masculine prevalence. While the ILM exhibits strong masculine bias, models can override these preferences based on acoustic input. Using contrastive feature attribution on spectrograms, we reveal that the model with higher gender accuracy relies on a previously unknown mechanism: using first-person pronouns to link gendered terms back to the speaker, accessing gender information distributed across the frequency spectrum rather than concentrated in pitch.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff08ST\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6027\u522b\u5206\u914d\u65f6\u5982\u4f55\u53d7\u5230\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3001\u5185\u90e8\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u58f0\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bed\u97f3\u901a\u8fc7\u97f3\u9ad8\u7b49\u58f0\u5b66\u7ebf\u7d22\u4f20\u9012\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u6027\u522b\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4ece\u6ca1\u6709\u6027\u522b\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982\u82f1\u8bed\uff09\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6210\u6709\u8bed\u6cd5\u6027\u522b\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u65f6\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bef\u6027\u522b\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\uff08en-es/fr/it\uff09\u6765\u8c03\u67e5ST\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6027\u522b\u5206\u914d\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u5185\u90e8\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u58f0\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7279\u5f81\u5f52\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u9891\u8c31\u56fe\u3002", "result": "ST\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u7b80\u5355\u590d\u5236\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u672f\u8bed\u6027\u522b\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u7537\u6027\u5360\u4f18\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5185\u90e8\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u793a\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u7537\u6027\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u6839\u636e\u58f0\u5b66\u8f93\u5165\u8986\u76d6\u8fd9\u4e9b\u504f\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u5229\u7528\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u4ee3\u8bcd\u5c06\u6027\u522b\u672f\u8bed\u4e0e\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbf\u95ee\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u9891\u8c31\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u522b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u97f3\u9ad8\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

This benchmark is derived from standard datasets by generating paraphrases via proprietary models and selectively retaining examples that elicit inconsistent confidence from a judge model. We further propose XParaCon, a novel evaluation metric that quantifies a model's robustness by measuring the standard deviation of accuracies across question variants.
