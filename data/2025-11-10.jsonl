Reject-option\nprediction addresses this by allowing the model to abstain when prediction\nuncertainty is high. Traditional reject-option approaches focus solely on\naleatoric uncertainty, an assumption valid only when large training data makes\nthe epistemic uncertainty negligible. However, in many practical scenarios,\nlimited data makes this assumption unrealistic. This paper introduces the\nepistemic reject-option predictor, which abstains in regions of high epistemic\nuncertainty caused by insufficient data. Building on Bayesian learning, we\nredefine the optimal predictor as the one that minimizes expected regret -- the\nperformance gap between the learned model and the Bayes-optimal predictor with\nfull knowledge of the data distribution. The model abstains when the regret for\na given input exceeds a specified rejection cost.

This work introduces multiMentalRoBERTa, a fine-tuned\nRoBERTa model designed for multiclass classification of common mental health\nconditions, including stress, anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress\ndisorder (PTSD), suicidal ideation, and neutral discourse. Drawing on multiple\ncurated datasets, data exploration is conducted to analyze class overlaps,\nrevealing strong correlations between depression and suicidal ideation as well\nas anxiety and PTSD, while stress emerges as a broad, overlapping category.\nComparative experiments with traditional machine learning methods,\ndomain-specific transformers, and prompting-based large language models\ndemonstrate that multiMentalRoBERTa achieves superior performance, with macro\nF1-scores of 0.839 in the six-class setup and 0.870 in the five-class setup\n(excluding stress), outperforming both fine-tuned MentalBERT and baseline\nclassifiers. Beyond predictive accuracy, explainability methods, including\nLayer Integrated Gradients and KeyBERT, are applied to identify lexical cues\nthat drive classification, with a particular focus on distinguishing depression\nfrom suicidal ideation. The findings emphasize the effectiveness of fine-tuned\ntransformers for reliable and interpretable detection in sensitive contexts,\nwhile also underscoring the importance of fairness, bias mitigation, and\nhuman-in-the-loop safety protocols. Overall, multiMentalRoBERTa is presented as\na lightweight, robust, and deployable solution for enhancing support in mental\nhealth platforms."}

While base LLMs are known to exhibit next-token calibration, it\nremains unclear whether they can assess confidence in the actual meaning of\ntheir responses beyond the token level. We find that, when using a certain\nsampling-based notion of semantic calibration, base LLMs are remarkably\nwell-calibrated: they can meaningfully assess confidence in open-domain\nquestion-answering tasks, despite not being explicitly trained to do so. Our\nmain theoretical contribution establishes a mechanism for why semantic\ncalibration emerges as a byproduct of next-token prediction, leveraging a\nrecent connection between calibration and local loss optimality. The theory\nrelies on a general definition of \"B-calibration,\" which is a notion of\ncalibration parameterized by a choice of equivalence classes (semantic or\notherwise). This theoretical mechanism leads to a testable prediction: base\nLLMs will be semantically calibrated when they can easily predict their own\ndistribution over semantic answer classes before generating a response. We\nstate three implications of this prediction, which we validate through\nexperiments: (1) Base LLMs are semantically calibrated across\nquestion-answering tasks, (2) RL instruction-tuning systematically breaks this\ncalibration, and (3) chain-of-thought reasoning breaks calibration.

To investigate this, we introduce the Moral\nRolePlay benchmark, a new dataset featuring a four-level moral alignment scale\nand a balanced test set for rigorous evaluation.

This capability raises safety concerns as it may,\nfor example, allow models to better conceal their true abilities during\nevaluation. We attempt to characterize the minimal conditions under which such\nself-awareness emerges, and the mechanistic processes through which it\nmanifests. Through controlled finetuning experiments on instruction-tuned LLMs\nwith low-rank adapters (LoRA), we find: (1) that self-awareness can be reliably\ninduced using a single rank-1 LoRA adapter; (2) that the learned self-aware\nbehavior can be largely captured by a single steering vector in activation\nspace, recovering nearly all of the fine-tune's behavioral effect; and (3) that\nself-awareness is non-universal and domain-localized, with independent\nrepresentations across tasks. Together, these findings suggest that behavioral\nself-awareness emerges as a domain-specific, linear feature that can be easily\ninduced and modulated."}

Existing approaches predominantly rely on context\ninjection, where user history is embedded into the prompt to directly guide the\ngeneration process. However, this single-step paradigm imposes a dual burden on\nthe model: generating accurate content while simultaneously aligning with\nuser-specific styles. This often results in a trade-off that compromises output\nquality and limits precise control. To address this fundamental tension, we\npropose Reflective Personalization Optimization (RPO), a novel framework that\nredefines the personalization paradigm by decoupling content generation from\nalignment. RPO operates in two distinct stages: first, a base model generates a\nhigh-quality, generic response; then, an external reflection module explicitly\nrewrites this output to align with the user's preferences. This reflection\nmodule is trained using a two-stage process. Initially, supervised fine-tuning\nis employed on structured rewriting trajectories to establish a core\npersonalized reasoning policy that models the transformation from generic to\nuser-aligned responses. Subsequently, reinforcement learning is applied to\nfurther refine and enhance the quality of the personalized outputs.\nComprehensive experiments on the LaMP benchmark demonstrate that RPO, by\ndecoupling content generation from personalization, significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines. These findings underscore the superiority of\nexplicit response shaping over implicit context injection. Moreover, RPO\nintroduces an efficient, model-agnostic personalization layer that can be\nseamlessly integrated with any underlying base model, paving the way for a new\nand effective direction in user-centric generation scenarios."}
