We developed a fuzzy-XGBoost model on 1,014 maternal health records, achieving 88.67% accuracy (ROC-AUC: 0.9703). A validation study with 14 healthcare professionals in Bangladesh revealed strong preference for hybrid explanations (71.4% across three clinical cases) with 54.8% expressing trust for clinical use. SHAP analysis identified healthcare access as the primary predictor, with the engineered fuzzy risk score ranking third, validating clinical knowledge integration (r=0.298). Clinicians valued integrated clinical parameters but identified critical gaps: obstetric history, gestational age, and connectivity barriers. This work demonstrates that combining interpretable fuzzy rules with feature importance explanations enhances both utility and trust, providing practical insights for XAI deployment in maternal healthcare.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The first question is how to enable a model to recognize that it does not know. A promising approach is to use confidence, computed from the model's internal signals, to reflect its ignorance. Prior work in specific domains has shown that calibration can provide reliable confidence estimates. In this work, we propose a simple, effective, and universal training-free method that applies to both vision and language models, performing model calibration, cascading, and data cleaning to better exploit a model's ability to recognize when it does not know. We first highlight two key empirical observations: higher confidence corresponds to higher accuracy within a single model, and models calibrated on the validation set remain calibrated on a held-out test set. These findings empirically establish the reliability and comparability of calibrated confidence. Building on this, we introduce two applications: (1) model cascading with calibrated advantage routing and (2) data cleaning based on model ensemble. Using the routing signal derived from the comparability of calibrated confidences, we cascade large and small models to improve efficiency with almost no compromise in accuracy, and we further cascade two models of comparable scale to achieve performance beyond either model alone. Leveraging multiple experts and their calibrated confidences, we design a simple yet effective data-cleaning method that balances precision and detection rate to identify mislabeled samples in ImageNet and Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) datasets. Our results demonstrate that enabling models to recognize when they do not know is a practical step toward more efficient, reliable, and trustworthy AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While OpenAI introduces deliberative alignment (DA) to enhance the safety of its o-series models through reasoning over detailed ``code-like'' safety rules, the effectiveness of this approach in open-source LLMs, which typically lack advanced reasoning capabilities, is understudied. In this work, we systematically evaluate the impact of explicitly specifying extensive safety codes versus demonstrating them through illustrative cases. We find that referencing explicit codes inconsistently improves harmlessness and systematically degrades helpfulness, whereas training on case-augmented simple codes yields more robust and generalized safety behaviors. By guiding LLMs with case-augmented reasoning instead of extensive code-like safety rules, we avoid rigid adherence to narrowly enumerated rules and enable broader adaptability. Building on these insights, we propose CADA, a case-augmented deliberative alignment method for LLMs utilizing reinforcement learning on self-generated safety reasoning chains. CADA effectively enhances harmlessness, improves robustness against attacks, and reduces over-refusal while preserving utility across diverse benchmarks, offering a practical alternative to rule-only DA for improving safety while maintaining helpfulness.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

First, we perform state representation learning by fine-tuning an RWKV-based LLM, transforming it into \\textbf{EmbeddingRWKV}, a unified model that serves as both an embedding model and a state backbone for extracting compact, reusable states.

This paper examines how frontier AI regulations in the United States and European Union in 2025 handle internal deployment. We identify three gaps that could cause internally-deployed systems to evade intended oversight: (1) scope ambiguity that allows internal systems to evade regulatory obligations, (2) point-in-time compliance assessments that fail to capture the continuous evolution of internal systems, and (3) information asymmetries that subvert regulatory awareness and oversight. We then analyze why these gaps persist, examining tensions around measurability, incentives, and information access.

With increasing renewable energy integration, sustainable energy management has become essential for reducing grid dependence and supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 7 on affordable and clean energy. However, the intermittent nature of renewables poses challenges in balancing supply and demand in real time. Intelligent load scheduling is therefore crucial to minimize operational costs while maintaining reliability. Reinforcement Learning has shown promise in improving energy efficiency and reducing costs. However, most RL-based scheduling methods assume complete knowledge of future prices or generation, which is unrealistic in dynamic environments. Moreover, standard PPO variants rely on fixed clipping or KL divergence thresholds, often leading to unstable training under variable tariffs. To address these challenges, this study proposes a Deep Reinforcement Learning framework for efficient load scheduling in dairy farms, focusing on battery storage and water heating under realistic operational constraints. The proposed Forecast Aware PPO incorporates short term forecasts of demand and renewable generation using hour of day and month based residual calibration, while the PID KL PPO variant employs a proportional integral derivative controller to regulate KL divergence for stable policy updates adaptively. Trained on real world dairy farm data, the method achieves up to 1% lower electricity cost than PPO, 4.8% than DQN, and 1.5% than SAC. For battery scheduling, PPO reduces grid imports by 13.1%, demonstrating scalability and effectiveness for sustainable energy management in modern dairy farming.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Despite their apparent simplicity, these constraints fail with striking regularity, and the conditions governing failure have remained poorly understood. This paper presents the first comprehensive mechanistic investigation of negative instruction failure. We introduce semantic pressure, a quantitative measure of the model's intrinsic probability of generating the forbidden token, and demonstrate that violation probability follows a tight logistic relationship with pressure ($p=\u03c3(-2.40+2.27\\cdot P_0)$; $n=40{,}000$ samples; bootstrap $95%$ CI for slope: $[2.21,,2.33]$). Through layer-wise analysis using the logit lens technique, we establish that the suppression signal induced by negative instructions is present but systematically weaker in failures: the instruction reduces target probability by only 5.2 percentage points in failures versus 22.8 points in successes -- a $4.4\\times$ asymmetry. We trace this asymmetry to two mechanistically distinct failure modes. In priming failure (87.5% of violations), the instruction's explicit mention of the forbidden word paradoxically activates rather than suppresses the target representation. In override failure (12.5%), late-layer feed-forward networks generate contributions of $+0.39$ toward the target probability -- nearly $4\\times$ larger than in successes -- overwhelming earlier suppression signals. Activation patching confirms that layers 23--27 are causally responsible: replacing these layers' activations flips the sign of constraint effects.

To address this gap, we construct a post crash LC dataset by extracting vehicle trajectories from drone videos captured after crashes. Our empirical analysis reveals that, compared to mandatory LCs (MLCs) and discretionary LCs (DLCs), post crash LCs exhibit longer durations, lower insertion speeds, and higher crash risks. Notably, 79.4% of post crash LCs involve at least one instance of non yielding behavior from the new follower, compared to 21.7% for DLCs and 28.6% for MLCs. Building on these findings, we develop a novel trajectory prediction framework for post crash LCs. At its core is a graph based attention module that explicitly models yielding behavior as an auxiliary interaction aware task. This module is designed to guide both a conditional variational autoencoder and a Transformer based decoder to predict the lane changer's trajectory. By incorporating the interaction aware module, our model outperforms existing baselines in trajectory prediction performance by more than 10% in both average displacement error and final displacement error across different prediction horizons. Moreover, our model provides more reliable crash risk analysis by reducing false crash rates and improving conflict prediction accuracy. Finally, we validate the model's transferability using additional post crash LC datasets collected from different sites.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Recent studies typically focus on verbalizing the graph structures via handcrafted prompts, feeding the target node and its neighborhood context into LLMs. However, constrained by the context window, existing methods mainly resort to random sampling, often implemented via dropping node/edge randomly, which inevitably introduces noise and cause reasoning instability. We argue that graphs inherently contain rich structural and semantic information, and that their effective exploitation can unlock potential gains in LLMs reasoning performance. To this end, we propose Homophily-aware Structural and Semantic Compression for LLMs (HS2C), a framework centered on exploiting graph homophily. Structurally, guided by the principle of Structural Entropy minimization, we perform a global hierarchical partition that decodes the graph's essential topology. This partition identifies naturally cohesive, homophilic communities, while discarding stochastic connectivity noise. Semantically, we deliver the detected structural homophily to the LLM, empowering it to perform differentiated semantic aggregation based on predefined community type. This process compresses redundant background contexts into concise community-level consensus, selectively preserving semantically homophilic information aligned with the target nodes. Extensive experiments on 10 node-level benchmarks across LLMs of varying sizes and families demonstrate that, by feeding LLMs with structurally and semantically compressed inputs, HS2C simultaneously enhances the compression rate and downstream inference accuracy, validating its superiority and scalability.

However, these facets ignore pitfalls of CE in the context of LLMs and language variation: confidence estimates should remain consistent under semantically equivalent prompt or answer variations, and should change when the answer meaning differs. Therefore, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework for CE that measures their confidence quality on three new aspects: robustness of confidence against prompt perturbations, stability across semantic equivalent answers, and sensitivity to semantically different answers. In our work, we demonstrate that common CE methods for LLMs often fail on these metrics: methods that achieve good performance on calibration or discrimination are not robust to prompt variations or are not sensitive to answer changes.

While guardrail frameworks aim to block out-of-scope questions (Rodriguez et al., 2024), no research has investigated the question of suggesting answerable queries in order to complete the user interaction.\n  In this paper, we initiate the study of query suggestion for agentic RAG. We consider the setting where user questions are not answerable, and the suggested queries should be similar to aid the user interaction. Such scenarios are frequent for tool-calling LLMs as communicating the restrictions of the tools or the underlying datasets to the user is difficult, and adding query suggestions enhances the interaction with the RAG agent. As opposed to traditional settings for query recommendations such as in search engines, ensuring that the suggested queries are answerable is a major challenge due to the RAG's multi-step workflow that demands a nuanced understanding of the RAG as a whole, which the executing LLM lacks. As such, we introduce robust dynamic few-shot learning which retrieves examples from relevant workflows. We show that our system can be self-learned, for instance on prior user queries, and is therefore easily applicable in practice. We evaluate our approach on three benchmark datasets based on two unlabeled question datasets collected from real-world user queries.

To address this gap, we introduce the Reasoning Model Confidence estimation Benchmark (RMCB), a public resource of 347,496 reasoning traces from six popular LRMs across different architectural families. The benchmark is constructed from a diverse suite of datasets spanning high-stakes domains, including clinical, financial, legal, and mathematical reasoning, alongside complex general reasoning benchmarks, with correctness annotations provided for all samples. Using RMCB, we conduct a large-scale empirical evaluation of over ten distinct representation-based methods, spanning sequential, graph-based, and text-based architectures.

Moreover, the utilization of reference policy induces a misalignment issue between the reward formulation for training and the metric for generation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Triplet-based Self-Play fIne-tuNing (T-SPIN) method that integrates two key designs. First, beyond current advantages, T-SPIN additionally incorporates historical advantages between iteratively generated responses and proto-synthetic responses produced by the initial policy.

To address this, we initially developed a framework for automated task-oriented multi-turn dialogue generation at scale, utilizing an LRM-based simulator to dynamically generate high-value, domain-specific tools to solve specified tasks.

In parallel, recent advances in large-scale generative systems, particularly multimodal architectures, have demonstrated increasingly sophisticated forms of pattern recombination, raising questions about the nature and limits of machine creativity. This paper proposes a generative perspective on creativity in AI, framing it as an emergent property of domain-limited generative models embedded within bounded informational environments. Rather than introducing new evaluative criteria, we focus on the structural and contextual conditions under which creative behaviors arise. We introduce a conceptual decomposition of creativity into four interacting components-pattern-based generation, induced world models, contextual grounding, and arbitrarity, and examine how these components manifest in multimodal generative systems.

Firstly, a high-quality dataset covering various mainstream UAV SDKs is constructed, featuring instruction-code-reasoning chains, and incorporates counterfactual negative samples for data augmentation, guiding the model to learn the end-to-end logic from instruction parsing to code generation. Secondly, leveraging DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite quantized via QLoRA as the teacher model, and based on a hybrid black-box and white-box distillation strategy, high-quality chain-of-thought soft labels are generated. These are combined with a weighted cross-entropy loss using hard labels to transfer complex reasoning capabilities to the smaller student model. Finally, through prompt tuning engineering optimized for the UAV control scenario, the model performance on core tasks such as SDK type recognition and function call matching is enhanced.

We present the first study of mental manipulation detection in spoken dialogues, introducing a synthetic multi-speaker benchmark SPEECHMENTALMANIP that augments a text-based dataset with high-quality, voice-consistent Text-to-Speech rendered audio. Using few-shot large audio-language models and human annotation, we evaluate how modality affects detection accuracy and perception. Our results reveal that models exhibit high specificity but markedly lower recall on speech compared to text, suggesting sensitivity to missing acoustic or prosodic cues in training. Human raters show similar uncertainty in the audio setting, underscoring the inherent ambiguity of manipulative speech.

Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) can enhance transparency in the decisions of deep learning models, which is crucial for a sensitive domain such as hate speech detection. In this paper, we present a multi-modal and explainable web application for detecting misogyny in text and memes in code-mixed Hindi and English.

While heuristic constraints like length penalties can reduce verbosity, they often truncate essential reasoning steps, creating a difficult trade-off between efficiency and verification.

We argue that this interpretation rests on a conceptual error. LLMs do not reason morally; they statistically internalize the record of human social interaction, including laws, contracts, negotiations, conflicts, and coercive arrangements. Behaviors commonly labeled as unethical or anomalous are therefore better understood as structural generalizations of interaction regimes that arise under extreme asymmetries of power, information, or constraint. Drawing on relational models theory, we show that practices such as blackmail are not categorical deviations from normal social behavior, but limiting cases within the same continuum that includes market pricing, authority relations, and ultimatum bargaining. The surprise elicited by such outputs reflects an anthropomorphic expectation that intelligence should reproduce only socially sanctioned behavior, rather than the full statistical landscape of behaviors humans themselves enact. Because human morality is plural, context-dependent, and historically contingent, the notion of a universally moral artificial intelligence is ill-defined. We therefore reframe concerns about artificial general intelligence (AGI). The primary risk is not adversarial intent, but AGI's role as an endogenous amplifier of human intelligence, power, and contradiction. By eliminating longstanding cognitive and institutional frictions, AGI compresses timescales and removes the historical margin of error that has allowed inconsistent values and governance regimes to persist without collapse. Alignment failure is thus structural, not accidental, and requires governance approaches that address amplification, complexity, and regime stability rather than model-level intent alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

GraphSearch combines a Graph-aware Query Planner, which disentangles search space (e.g., 1-hop, multi-hop, or global neighbors) from semantic queries, with a Graph-aware Retriever, which constructs candidate sets based on topology and ranks them using a hybrid scoring function. We further instantiate two traversal modes: GraphSearch-R, which recursively expands neighborhoods hop by hop, and GraphSearch-F, which flexibly retrieves across local and global neighborhoods without hop constraints. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks show that GraphSearch achieves competitive or even superior performance compared to supervised graph learning methods, setting state-of-the-art results in zero-shot node classification and link prediction.

In social psychology, however, political ideology is also understood as a downstream consequence of fundamental moral intuitions. In this work, we investigate the causal relationship between moral values and political positioning by treating moral orientation as a controllable condition. Rather than simply assigning a demographic persona, we condition models to endorse or reject specific moral values and evaluate the resulting shifts on their political orientations, using the Political Compass Test. By treating moral values as lenses, we observe how moral conditioning actively steers model trajectories across economic and social dimensions. Our findings show that such conditioning induces pronounced, value-specific shifts in models' political coordinates. We further notice that these effects are systematically modulated by role framing and model scale, and are robust across alternative assessment instruments instantiating the same moral value. This highlights that effective alignment requires anchoring political assessments within the context of broader social values including morality, paving the way for more socially grounded alignment techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We argue that the field of AI is unprepared to measure or respond to how the proliferation of entertaining AI-generated content will impact society. Emerging data suggest AI is already widely adopted for entertainment purposes -- especially by young people -- and represents a large potential source of revenue. We contend that entertainment will become a primary business model for major AI corporations seeking returns on massive infrastructure investments; this will exert a powerful influence on the technology these companies produce in the coming years. Examining current evaluation practices, we identify a critical asymmetry: while AI assessments rigorously measure both benefits and harms of intelligence, they focus almost exclusively on cultural harms. We lack frameworks for articulating how cultural outputs might be actively beneficial. Drawing on insights from the humanities, we propose \"thick entertainment\" as a framework for evaluating AI-generated cultural content -- one that considers entertainment's role in meaning-making, identity formation, and social connection rather than simply minimizing harm.

We instantiate this methodology in three national case studies: PoliBiasNL (2,701 Dutch parliamentary motions and votes from 15 political parties), PoliBiasNO (10,584 motions and votes from 9 Norwegian parties), and PoliBiasES (2,480 motions and votes from 10 Spanish parties). Across these benchmarks, we assess ideological tendencies and political entity bias in LLM behavior. As part of our evaluation framework, we also propose a method to visualize the ideology of LLMs and political parties in a shared two-dimensional CHES (Chapel Hill Expert Survey) space by linking their voting-based positions to the CHES dimensions, enabling direct and interpretable comparisons between models and real-world political actors. Our experiments reveal fine-grained ideological distinctions: state-of-the-art LLMs consistently display left-leaning or centrist tendencies, alongside clear negative biases toward right-conservative parties.

Results show that LLMs outperform neural models at all granularity levels, with the gap narrowing as granularity becomes coarser.

Textual resources carry unique information that can be used in complementarity with geospatial data sources, thus providing insights at the local scale into environmental conditions and properties hidden from more traditional data sources. Leveraging textual information in a spatial context presents several challenges. First, the contribution of textual data remains poorly defined in an ecological context, and it is unclear for which tasks it should be incorporated. Unlike ubiquitous satellite imagery or environmental covariates, the availability of textual data is sparse and irregular; its integration with geospatial data is not straightforward. In response to these challenges, this work proposes an attention-based approach that combines aerial imagery and geolocated text within a spatial neighbourhood, i.e. integrating contributions from several nearby observations. Our approach combines vision and text representations with a geolocation encoding, with an attention-based module that dynamically selects spatial neighbours that are useful for predictive tasks.The proposed approach is applied to the EcoWikiRS dataset, which combines high-resolution aerial imagery with sentences extracted from Wikipedia describing local environmental conditions across Switzerland. Our model is evaluated on the task of predicting 103 environmental variables from the SWECO25 data cube. Our approach consistently outperforms single-location or unimodal, i.e. image-only or text-only, baselines. When analysing variables by thematic groups, results show a significant improvement in performance for climatic, edaphic, population and land use/land cover variables, underscoring the benefit of including the spatial context when combining text and image data.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Code available at https://github.com/GMLR-Penn/Multiplex-Thinking", "summary": "Large language models often solve complex reasoning tasks more effectively with Chain-of-Thought (CoT), but at the cost of long, low-bandwidth token sequences. Humans, by contrast, often reason softly by maintaining a distribution over plausible next steps. Motivated by this, we propose Multiplex Thinking, a stochastic soft reasoning mechanism that, at each thinking step, samples K candidate tokens and aggregates their embeddings into a single continuous multiplex token. This preserves the vocabulary embedding prior and the sampling dynamics of standard discrete generation, while inducing a tractable probability distribution over multiplex rollouts. Consequently, multiplex trajectories can be directly optimized with on-policy reinforcement learning (RL). Importantly, Multiplex Thinking is self-adaptive: when the model is confident, the multiplex token is nearly discrete and behaves like standard CoT; when it is uncertain, it compactly represents multiple plausible next steps without increasing sequence length. Across challenging math reasoning benchmarks, Multiplex Thinking consistently outperforms strong discrete CoT and RL baselines from Pass@1 through Pass@1024, while producing shorter sequences.
