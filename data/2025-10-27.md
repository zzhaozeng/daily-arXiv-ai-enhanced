### [1] [Shoot First, Ask Questions Later? Building Rational Agents that Explore and Act Like People](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20886)
*Gabriel Grand,Valerio Pepe,Jacob Andreas,Joshua B. Tenenbaum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种用于评估和增强基于语言模型（LM）的智能体在信息寻求中的理性行为的方法，通过引入‘合作战舰’任务，并应用贝叶斯实验设计原则的蒙特卡洛推理策略，显著提高了智能体的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多AI的高风险应用需要数据驱动的假设和有针对性的猜测，但现有LM智能体在信息寻求中表现不佳，因此需要方法来量化和改进其理性行为。

Method: 引入‘合作战舰’任务以评估LM智能体的表现，并基于贝叶斯实验设计原则开发了新的蒙特卡洛推理策略，以增强智能体的信息寻求能力。

Result: 对于Spotter智能体，新方法将准确性提高了14.7%；对于Captain智能体，期望信息增益提高了0.227比特，F1分数提高了0.303-0.374，并在‘Guess Who?’任务中验证了其通用性。

Conclusion: 通过结合这些方法，较弱的LM可以超越人类和前沿模型，展示了构建理性信息寻求智能体的可行性和有效性。

Abstract: Many high-stakes applications of AI require forming data-driven hypotheses
and making targeted guesses; e.g., in scientific and diagnostic settings. Given
limited resources, to what extent do agents based on language models (LMs) act
rationally? We develop methods to benchmark and enhance agentic
information-seeking, drawing on insights from human behavior. First, we
introduce a strategic decision-oriented dialogue task called Collaborative
Battleship, in which a partially-informed Captain must balance exploration
(asking questions) and action (taking shots), while a fully-informed Spotter
must provide accurate answers under an information bottleneck. Compared to
human players (N=42), we find that LM agents struggle to ground answers in
context, generate informative questions, and select high-value actions. Next,
to address these gaps, we develop novel Monte Carlo inference strategies for
LMs based on principles from Bayesian Experimental Design (BED). For Spotter
agents, our approach boosts accuracy by up to 14.7% absolute over LM-only
baselines; for Captain agents, it raises expected information gain (EIG) by up
to 0.227 bits (94.2% of the achievable noise ceiling). Combined, these
components yield sharper targeting (+0.303-0.374 F1), and enable weaker LMs,
such as Llama-4-Scout, to outperform both humans (8% -> 82% win rate) and
frontier models (0% -> 67% win rate vs. GPT-5) at ~1% of GPT-5's cost. We
replicate these findings on Guess Who? where our methods significantly boost
accuracy (+28.3-42.4 p.p.), demonstrating their general applicability for
building rational information-seeking agents.

### [2] [Code-enabled language models can outperform reasoning models on diverse tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20909)
*Cedegao E. Zhang,Cédric Colas,Gabriel Poesia,Joshua B. Tenenbaum,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文展示了标准指令语言模型（LMs）通过CodeAdapt方法无需微调即可达到与推理模型（RMs）相当或更优的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理模型尽管成功，但训练和运行需要大量计算和数据，而标准指令模型通过适当的方法可以更高效地实现类似能力。

Method: 提出CodeAdapt方法，将CodeAct框架与少量样本上下文学习结合，使LMs在多步骤中交错自然语言推理与代码执行。

Result: 在八种任务上，三种LMs通过CodeAdapt平均优于对应的RMs，同时更高效；在六种任务上表现优于所有模型平均值。

Conclusion: CodeAdapt风格的学习和推理可能具有稳健性和领域通用性，代码增强的LMs是认知基础强大的系统，为权重内强化学习提供了强有力基础。

Abstract: Reasoning models (RMs), language models (LMs) trained with reinforcement
learning to produce long-form natural language reasoning, have been remarkably
successful, but they still require large amounts of computation and data to
train, and can be slow and expensive to run. In this paper, we show that
standard instruct LMs can already be elicited to be strong reasoners at a level
comparable to or even surpassing their corresponding RMs (e.g., DeepSeek V3 vs
R1) without finetuning, across diverse domains from instruction following and
creative generation to mathematical reasoning. This is achieved by CodeAdapt,
our simple recipe that combines the CodeAct framework, where LMs interleave
natural language reasoning with code execution in a multi-step fashion, with
few-shot bootstrap in-context learning from as few as five training problems.
Analyzing four matched pairs of LMs and RMs, we find that CodeAdapt enables
three LMs to outperform the corresponding RMs on average over eight tasks (up
to 22.9%) while being 10-81% more token efficient, and delivers superior
performance on six tasks when averaged over the four models (up to 35.7%).
Furthermore, the code-augmented reasoning traces display rich and varied
problem-solving strategies. Our findings support that (1) CodeAdapt-style
learning and reasoning may be robust and domain general and (2) code-enabled
LMs are cognitively grounded and powerful systems, potentially providing a
strong foundation for in-weight reinforcement learning.

### [3] [FicSim: A Dataset for Multi-Faceted Semantic Similarity in Long-Form Fiction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20926)
*Natasha Johnson,Amanda Bertsch,Maria-Emil Deal,Emma Strubell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 随着语言模型处理长文本和复杂文本能力的提高，它们在计算文学研究中的应用越来越受到关注。然而，由于长文本细粒度标注的成本和公共领域文学数据污染的担忧，评估这些模型的有效性具有挑战性。当前嵌入相似性数据集因侧重于粗粒度相似性和非常短的文本，不适合文学领域的任务。因此，作者们构建并发布了FICSIM数据集，包括由作者提供的元数据指导并由数字人文学者验证的12个相似性维度评分。评估表明，嵌入模型倾向于关注表面特征，而非对计算文学研究任务有用的语义类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估语言模型在计算文学研究中的有效性面临细粒度标注成本高和公共领域文学数据污染的问题，现有嵌入相似性数据集不适合文学领域任务。

Method: 构建并发布FICSIM数据集，包括由作者提供的元数据指导并由数字人文学者验证的12个相似性维度评分，并对一系列嵌入模型进行评估。

Result: 评估结果表明，嵌入模型倾向于关注表面特征，而非对计算文学研究任务有用的语义类别。

Conclusion: FICSIM数据集为评估语言模型在文学领域的应用提供了新工具，并揭示了嵌入模型在语义类别上的不足，强调了关注作者权益和数据获取过程中知情同意的重要性。

Abstract: As language models become capable of processing increasingly long and complex
texts, there has been growing interest in their application within
computational literary studies. However, evaluating the usefulness of these
models for such tasks remains challenging due to the cost of fine-grained
annotation for long-form texts and the data contamination concerns inherent in
using public-domain literature. Current embedding similarity datasets are not
suitable for evaluating literary-domain tasks because of a focus on
coarse-grained similarity and primarily on very short text. We assemble and
release FICSIM, a dataset of long-form, recently written fiction, including
scores along 12 axes of similarity informed by author-produced metadata and
validated by digital humanities scholars. We evaluate a suite of embedding
models on this task, demonstrating a tendency across models to focus on
surface-level features over semantic categories that would be useful for
computational literary studies tasks. Throughout our data-collection process,
we prioritize author agency and rely on continual, informed author consent.

### [4] [Do LLMs Truly Understand When a Precedent Is Overruled?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20941)
*Li Zhang,Jaromir Savelka,Kevin Ashley*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了大型语言模型在识别美国最高法院案例中推翻关系的能力，揭示了模型在长文本法律理解中的三个关键局限性：时代敏感性、浅层推理和复杂上下文中的推理失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理长法律文档时缺乏有效评估，现有基准测试多为简化合成任务，难以反映真实法律文档理解的复杂性。

Method: 使用236对美国最高法院案例对的数据集，评估了当前先进的语言模型在识别推翻关系方面的表现。

Result: 模型表现出三个关键限制：(1) 对历史案例的表现较差，显示出训练数据中的时间偏差；(2) 依赖浅层逻辑启发式而非深层法律理解；(3) 在复杂开放任务中产生时间上不可能的关系，尽管在简单上下文中保持基本的时间意识。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个反映真实法律推理任务复杂性和风险性的基准测试，填补了现实长文本评估中的关键空白。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows show promise for
complex legal reasoning tasks, yet their ability to understand long legal
documents remains insufficiently evaluated. Developing long-context benchmarks
that capture realistic, high-stakes tasks remains a significant challenge in
the field, as most existing evaluations rely on simplified synthetic tasks that
fail to represent the complexity of real-world document understanding.
Overruling relationships are foundational to common-law doctrine and commonly
found in judicial opinions. They provide a focused and important testbed for
long-document legal understanding that closely resembles what legal
professionals actually do. We present an assessment of state-of-the-art LLMs on
identifying overruling relationships from U.S. Supreme Court cases using a
dataset of 236 case pairs. Our evaluation reveals three critical limitations:
(1) era sensitivity -- the models show degraded performance on historical cases
compared to modern ones, revealing fundamental temporal bias in their training;
(2) shallow reasoning -- models rely on shallow logical heuristics rather than
deep legal comprehension; and (3) context-dependent reasoning failures --
models produce temporally impossible relationships in complex open-ended tasks
despite maintaining basic temporal awareness in simple contexts. Our work
contributes a benchmark that addresses the critical gap in realistic
long-context evaluation, providing an environment that mirrors the complexity
and stakes of actual legal reasoning tasks.

### [5] [Irish-BLiMP: A Linguistic Benchmark for Evaluating Human and Language Model Performance in a Low-Resource Setting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20957)
*Josh McGiff,Khanh-Tung Tran,William Mulcahy,Dáibhidh Ó Luinín,Jake Dalzell,Róisín Ní Bhroin,Adam Burke,Barry O'Sullivan,Hoang D. Nguyen,Nikola S. Nikolov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Irish-BLiMP，这是首个用于爱尔兰语（濒危语言）语言能力细粒度评估的数据集和框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了评估爱尔兰语的语言能力，尤其是在低资源语言背景下，构建一个系统化的评测框架。

Method: 通过借鉴各种语言学文献和语法参考书籍，由流利爱尔兰语者团队手动构建和审查1020个最小对，涵盖11个语言特征，并评估现有的大语言模型和流利的人类参与者。

Result: 人类在所有语言特征上均优于所有模型，平均准确率高出16.6%。开源和闭源LLMs之间存在18.1%的性能差距，最强的模型（gpt-5）达到73.5%的准确率，而人类为90.1%。

Conclusion: Irish-BLiMP为评估爱尔兰语中LLMs的语法能力提供了首个系统化框架，并为低资源语言的语言理解研究提供了有价值的基准。

Abstract: We present Irish-BLiMP (Irish Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal Pairs), the
first dataset and framework designed for fine-grained evaluation of linguistic
competence in the Irish language, an endangered language. Drawing on a variety
of linguistic literature and grammar reference works, we manually constructed
and reviewed 1020 minimal pairs across a taxonomy of 11 linguistic features,
through a team of fluent Irish speakers. We evaluate both existing Large
Language Models (LLMs) and fluent human participants on their syntactic
knowledge of Irish. Our findings show that humans outperform all models across
all linguistic features, achieving 16.6% higher accuracy on average. Moreover,
a substantial performance gap of 18.1% persists between open- and closed-source
LLMs, with even the strongest model (gpt-5) reaching only 73.5% accuracy
compared to 90.1% by human. Interestingly, human participants and models
struggle on different aspects of Irish grammar, thus highlighting a difference
in representation learned by the models. Overall, Irish-BLiMP provides the
first systematic framework for evaluating the grammatical competence of LLMs in
Irish and offers a valuable benchmark for advancing research on linguistic
understanding in low-resource languages.

### [6] [Can Confidence Estimates Decide When Chain-of-thought is Necessary for Llms?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21007)
*Samuel Lewis-Lim,Xingwei Tan,Zhixue Zhao,Nikolaos Aletras*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种称为confidence-gated CoT的方法，通过训练无关的信心估计方法，在模型对直接答案信心不足时才启用推理链（CoT），以减少不必要的推理开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然CoT提示能提高复杂任务的准确性，但常常导致不必要的token使用增加，限制了推理模型在现实场景中的实用性。因此，需要确定何时使用CoT以获得最佳性能。

Method: 研究评估了四种训练无关的信心估计方法，并与随机基线和总是知道何时使用CoT的理想模型进行比较，以决定在何时启用CoT。

Result: 现有的训练无关信心估计方法能减少冗余的CoT使用，并优于随机启用的CoT，但这些方法的有效性在不同数据集和模型之间不一致。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了当前信心门控CoT方法的潜力与局限性，为更可靠的自适应CoT门控方法铺平了道路。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a common technique for
enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). While
extended reasoning can boost accuracy on complex tasks, it is often unnecessary
and substantially increases token usage, limiting the practicality of reasoning
models in many scenarios. Recent models, such as GPT-OSS and Qwen3, expose
controls that enable users to adjust the length of CoT or determine whether it
is used at all. Yet, it remains unclear when CoT should be used: on some tasks
it improves performance, while on others it provides little benefit or even
harms performance. We address this challenge with confidence-gated CoT, where a
model invokes reasoning only when confidence in its direct answer is low. To
this end, we present the first systematic study of training-free confidence
estimation methods for CoT gating. Specifically, we evaluate four training-free
confidence estimation methods and compare them to a random baseline and an
oracle that always knows when CoT is needed. Through extensive experiments, we
show that existing training-free confidence measures can reduce redundant CoT
and outperform randomly invoked CoT. However, the utility of individual
confidence measures is inconsistent, varying with both the dataset and the
model, underscoring the difficulty of deploying confidence-gated CoT in
practice. By analysing both strengths and failure modes, our study highlights
the potential and limitations of current methods and paves the way toward more
reliable adaptive gating of CoT.

### [7] [Reasoning's Razor: Reasoning Improves Accuracy but Can Hurt Recall at Critical Operating Points in Safety and Hallucination Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21049)
*Atoosa Chegini,Hamid Kazemi,Garrett Souza,Maria Safi,Yang Song,Samy Bengio,Sinead Williamson,Mehrdad Farajtabar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在低假阳性率（FPR）分类任务中的推理表现，发现推理增强（Think On）在整体准确率上有优势，但在低FPR下表现不佳；无推理（Think Off）在低FPR下表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管推理已成为大型语言模型的核心范式，但其在对精度要求敏感的任务中的适用性仍不清楚。本文旨在系统性地研究在严格低假阳性率（FPR）条件下，推理对分类任务的影响。

Method: 分析涵盖两个任务：安全检测和幻觉检测，在微调（fine-tuned）和零样本（zero-shot）设置下评估标准LLMs和大型推理模型（LRMs），比较Think On和Think Off的表现，并考察基于分数的评分和自验证置信度。

Result: 结果显示，Think On提高整体准确率，但在低FPR下表现不佳；Think Off在低FPR下表现更好。基于分数的评分在精度敏感部署中优于自验证置信度。两者的简单集成能结合各自优势。

Conclusion: 推理是一把双刃剑：对平均准确率有益，但对需要严格精度的应用往往不合适。Think Off在低FPR下更可靠，而Think On在高FPR下表现更好，两者的集成可互补。

Abstract: Reasoning has become a central paradigm for large language models (LLMs),
consistently boosting accuracy across diverse benchmarks. Yet its suitability
for precision-sensitive tasks remains unclear. We present the first systematic
study of reasoning for classification tasks under strict low false positive
rate (FPR) regimes. Our analysis covers two tasks--safety detection and
hallucination detection--evaluated in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings,
using standard LLMs and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). Our results reveal a
clear trade-off: Think On (reasoning-augmented) generation improves overall
accuracy, but underperforms at the low-FPR thresholds essential for practical
use. In contrast, Think Off (no reasoning during inference) dominates in these
precision-sensitive regimes, with Think On surpassing only when higher FPRs are
acceptable. In addition, we find token-based scoring substantially outperforms
self-verbalized confidence for precision-sensitive deployments. Finally, a
simple ensemble of the two modes recovers the strengths of each. Taken
together, our findings position reasoning as a double-edged tool: beneficial
for average accuracy, but often ill-suited for applications requiring strict
precision.

### [8] [Dynamic Retriever for In-Context Knowledge Editing via Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21059)
*Mahmud Wasif Nafee,Maiqi Jiang,Haipeng Chen,Yanfu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态选择示范的轻量级框架DR-IKE，用于上下文知识编辑，解决了数量-质量权衡和任务难度适应性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在事实回忆方面表现出色，但仍然传播过时或错误的知识。现有的上下文知识编辑方法依赖于表面相似性选择静态示范集，存在数量-质量权衡和缺乏任务难度适应性的问题。

Method: 提出Dynamic Retriever for In-Context Knowledge Editing (DR-IKE)框架，使用REINFORCE训练BERT检索器，根据编辑奖励对示范进行排序，并采用可学习阈值过滤低价值示例，以动态调整示范集长度。

Result: 在COUNTERFACT基准上，DR-IKE将编辑成功率提高了17.1%，减少了41.6%的延迟，并在不相关查询上保持准确性。

Conclusion: DR-IKE实现了可扩展和自适应的知识编辑，适用于黑盒大型语言模型，无需修改模型权重，兼容性强。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at factual recall yet still propagate
stale or incorrect knowledge. In-context knowledge editing offers a
gradient-free remedy suitable for black-box APIs, but current editors rely on
static demonstration sets chosen by surface-level similarity, leading to two
persistent obstacles: (i) a quantity-quality trade-off, and (ii) lack of
adaptivity to task difficulty. We address these issues by dynamically selecting
supporting demonstrations according to their utility for the edit. We propose
Dynamic Retriever for In-Context Knowledge Editing (DR-IKE), a lightweight
framework that (1) trains a BERT retriever with REINFORCE to rank
demonstrations by editing reward, and (2) employs a learnable threshold to
prune low-value examples, shortening the prompt when the edit is easy and
expanding it when the task is hard. DR-IKE performs editing without modifying
model weights, relying solely on forward passes for compatibility with
black-box LLMs. On the COUNTERFACT benchmark, it improves edit success by up to
17.1%, reduces latency by 41.6%, and preserves accuracy on unrelated queries,
demonstrating scalable and adaptive knowledge editing. The code is available at

### [9] [Bridging Language Gaps with Adaptive RAG: Improving Indonesian Language Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21068)
*William Christian,Daniel Adamlu,Adrian Yu,Derwin Suhartono*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了通过引入自适应检索增强生成（Adaptive RAG）系统来提升印尼语问答系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前先进的问答系统主要在英语上表现出色，但低资源语言（如印尼语）上的应用仍有较大差距，因此需要解决这一问题。

Method: 采用Adaptive RAG系统，通过分类器区分问题的复杂性，从而决定回答问题的策略。同时，利用机器翻译进行数据增强，以应对印尼语数据集的有限性。

Result: 实验展示了可靠的问题复杂性分类器，但在多检索回答策略上观察到显著不一致性，对整体评估产生了负面影响。

Conclusion: 研究结果突显了在低资源语言上进行问答系统的潜力和挑战，并指出了未来改进的方向。

Abstract: Question Answering (QA) has seen significant improvements with the
advancement of machine learning models, further studies enhanced this question
answering system by retrieving external information, called Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) to produce more accurate and informative answers. However,
these state-of-the-art-performance is predominantly in English language. To
address this gap we made an effort of bridging language gaps by incorporating
Adaptive RAG system to Indonesian language. Adaptive RAG system integrates a
classifier whose task is to distinguish the question complexity, which in turn
determines the strategy for answering the question. To overcome the limited
availability of Indonesian language dataset, our study employs machine
translation as data augmentation approach. Experiments show reliable question
complexity classifier; however, we observed significant inconsistencies in
multi-retrieval answering strategy which negatively impacted the overall
evaluation when this strategy was applied. These findings highlight both the
promise and challenges of question answering in low-resource language
suggesting directions for future improvement.

### [10] [CDrugRed: A Chinese Drug Recommendation Dataset for Discharge Medications in Metabolic Diseases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21084)
*Juntao Li,Haobin Yuan,Ling Luo,Yan Jiang,Fan Wang,Ping Zhang,Huiyi Lv,Jian Wang,Yuanyuan Sun,Hongfei Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CDrugRed是首个公开的中文药物推荐数据集，专注于代谢性疾病的出院药物。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能药物推荐系统可提升临床决策的质量和效率，但公开、真实的EHR数据集稀缺，尤其是在非英语语言中。

Method: 介绍了CDrugRed数据集，包含5,894个去标识化的病人记录，评估了多种先进的大语言模型在出院药物推荐任务上的表现。

Result: 监督微调提高了模型性能，但仍有很大改进空间，最佳模型的F1分数为0.5648，Jaccard分数为0.4477。

Conclusion: CDrugRed数据集为开发更稳健和准确的药物推荐系统提供了挑战性和有价值的资源。

Abstract: Intelligent drug recommendation based on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is
critical for improving for improving the quality and efficiency of clinical
decision-making. By leveraging large-scale patient data, drug recommendation
systems can assist physicians in selecting the most appropriate medications
according to a patient's medical history, diagnoses, laboratory results, and
comorbidities. However, the advancement of such systems is significantly
hampered by the scarcity of publicly available, real-world EHR datasets,
particularly in languages other than English. In this work, we present
CDrugRed, a first publicly available Chinese drug recommendation dataset
focused on discharge medications for metabolic diseases. The dataset includes
5,894 de-identified records from 3,190 patients, containing comprehensive
information such as patient demographics, medical history, clinical course, and
discharge diagnoses. We assess the utility of CDrugRed by benchmarking several
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on the discharge medication
recommendation task. Experimental results show that while supervised
fine-tuning improves model performance, there remains substantial room for
improvement, with the best model achieving the F1 score of 0.5648 and Jaccard
score of 0.4477. This result highlights the complexity of the clinical drug
recommendation task and establishes CDrugRed as a challenging and valuable
resource for developing more robust and accurate drug recommendation systems.
The dataset is publicly available to the research community under the data
usage agreements at https://github.com/DUTIR-BioNLP/CDrugRed.

### [11] [Self-Rewarding PPO: Aligning Large Language Models with Demonstrations Only](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21090)
*Qingru Zhang,Liang Qiu,Ilgee Hong,Zhenghao Xu,Tianyi Liu,Shiyang Li,Rongzhi Zhang,Zheng Li,Lihong Li,Bing Yin,Chao Zhang,Jianshu Chen,Haoming Jiang,Tuo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Self-Rewarding PPO的新方法，通过结合SFT和PPO来增强大语言模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SFT在有限数据情况下存在过拟合和泛化能力差的问题，需要一种新方法来提高模型的泛化和数据效率。

Method: 结合SFT和监督式策略优化（PPO），引入一个以SFT模型和预训练基础模型之间的对数策略比作为奖励函数，进行自奖励的在线微调。

Result: 在多个自然语言处理任务上的实验表明，Self-Rewarding PPO始终优于传统SFT方法，尤其在高质量标注数据稀缺的情况下。

Conclusion: Self-Rewarding PPO通过利用自奖励机制，提高了LLMs的泛化性能、数据效率和鲁棒性，是比传统SFT更有效的微调方法。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has emerged as a crucial method for aligning
large language models (LLMs) with human-annotated demonstrations. However, SFT,
being an off-policy approach similar to behavior cloning, often struggles with
overfitting and poor out-of-domain generalization, especially in limited-data
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Rewarding PPO, a novel
fine-tuning method that leverages on-policy techniques to enhance
generalization performance. Our approach combines the strengths of SFT and
proximal policy optimization (PPO) to achieve more effective alignment from
demonstration data. At its core is a reward function designed as the log policy
ratio between the SFT model and the pretrained base model. This function serves
as an implicit reward signal, using the pretrained policy as a baseline and the
SFT policy as a target. By doing so, it enables on-policy fine-tuning without
relying on human preference annotations. The integration of this self-rewarding
mechanism with PPO addresses key limitations of SFT, improving generalization,
data efficiency, and robustness. Our empirical evaluation across a range of
natural language processing tasks demonstrates that Self-Rewarding PPO
consistently outperforms traditional SFT methods. The results highlight the
effectiveness of our approach in aligning LLMs using demonstration data,
particularly in scenarios where high-quality annotated data is scarce.

### [12] [The Gray Zone of Faithfulness: Taming Ambiguity in Unfaithfulness Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21118)
*Qiang Ding,Lvzhou Luo,Yixuan Cao,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新的忠实性注释框架VeriGray，用于检测和分类大型语言模型生成摘要中的不忠实内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM忠实性基准存在注释模糊问题，因为对于生成输出中允许的外部知识边界定义不清。

Method: 引入中间类别Out-Dependent，并构建了新的不忠实检测基准VeriGray，用于分类需要外部知识进行验证的摘要。

Result: 统计显示，即使最先进的LLM（如GPT-5）在摘要任务中也有约6%的句子出现幻觉，约8%的句子属于Out-Dependent类别。

Conclusion: VeriGray基准对多个基线方法提出了重大挑战，显示在不忠实检测领域还有很大的改进空间。

Abstract: Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) generate summaries faithful to a
given source document is essential for real-world applications. While prior
research has explored LLM faithfulness, existing benchmarks suffer from
annotation ambiguity, primarily due to the ill-defined boundary of permissible
external knowledge in generated outputs. For instance, common sense is often
incorporated into responses and labeled as "faithful", yet the acceptable
extent of such knowledge remains unspecified, leading to inconsistent
annotations. To address this issue, we propose a novel faithfulness annotation
framework, which introduces an intermediate category, Out-Dependent, to
classify cases where external knowledge is required for verification. Using
this framework, we construct VeriGray (Verification with the Gray Zone) -- a
new unfaithfulness detection benchmark in summarization. Statistics reveal that
even SOTA LLMs, such as GPT-5, exhibit hallucinations ($\sim 6\%$ of sentences)
in summarization tasks. Moreover, a substantial proportion ($\sim 8\%$ on
average of models) of generated sentences fall into the Out-Dependent category,
underscoring the importance of resolving annotation ambiguity in unfaithfulness
detection benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that our benchmark poses
significant challenges to multiple baseline methods, indicating considerable
room for future improvement.

### [13] [Large Language Models Meet Text-Attributed Graphs: A Survey of Integration Frameworks and Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21131)
*Guangxin Su,Hanchen Wang,Jianwei Wang,Wenjie Zhang,Ying Zhang,Jian Pei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文综述了大型语言模型（LLMs）和文本属性图（TAGs）的集成，从编排的角度提供了系统性的分类和回顾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在自然语言处理中表现出色，但其黑箱性质限制了结构和多跳推理。TAGs提供明确的关联结构，但缺乏语义深度。结合两者可以实现互补优势，提高TAG表示学习和LLMs的推理及可解释性。

Method: 引入了一个新的分类法，涵盖两个基本方向：LLM用于TAG和TAG用于LLM。将编排策略分为顺序、并行和多模块框架，并讨论了TAG特定的预训练、提示和参数高效微调方面的进展。

Result: 总结了实证见解，整理了可用数据集，并突出了推荐系统、生物医学分析和知识密集型问答等多样化应用。

Conclusion: 提出了开放挑战和未来的研究方向，旨在指导语言和图学习交叉领域的后续工作。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural
language processing through strong semantic understanding and generation.
However, their black-box nature limits structured and multi-hop reasoning. In
contrast, Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) provide explicit relational structures
enriched with textual context, yet often lack semantic depth. Recent research
shows that combining LLMs and TAGs yields complementary benefits: enhancing TAG
representation learning and improving the reasoning and interpretability of
LLMs. This survey provides the first systematic review of LLM--TAG integration
from an orchestration perspective. We introduce a novel taxonomy covering two
fundamental directions: LLM for TAG, where LLMs enrich graph-based tasks, and
TAG for LLM, where structured graphs improve LLM reasoning. We categorize

### [14] [Social Simulations with Large Language Model Risk Utopian Illusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21180)
*Ning Bian,Xianpei Han,Hongyu Lin,Baolei Wu,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个分析大型语言模型（LLMs）在社会模拟中行为的系统框架，发现LLMs在模拟人类行为时存在社会认知偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可靠的模拟人类行为对于解释、预测和干预社会至关重要。尽管LLMs在模仿人类行为方面显示出潜力，但其在社会环境中与真实人类行为的差异仍不明确。

Method: 通过聊天室式多智能体互动模拟，从五个语言维度进行分析，提出了一种简单有效的方法来检验出现的社会认知偏差。

Result: 实验涉及来自三个系列的八个代表性LLMs，发现LLMs并未忠实地复制真实人类行为，而是受到社会期望偏差的影响，表现出社会角色偏差、首因效应和积极偏差。

Conclusion: LLMs模拟的社会过于理想化，缺乏真实人类互动的复杂性和多样性，呼吁建立更具社会基础的LLMs以捕捉人类社交行为的多样性。

Abstract: Reliable simulation of human behavior is essential for explaining,
predicting, and intervening in our society. Recent advances in large language
models (LLMs) have shown promise in emulating human behaviors, interactions,
and decision-making, offering a powerful new lens for social science studies.
However, the extent to which LLMs diverge from authentic human behavior in
social contexts remains underexplored, posing risks of misinterpretation in
scientific studies and unintended consequences in real-world applications.
Here, we introduce a systematic framework for analyzing LLMs' behavior in
social simulation. Our approach simulates multi-agent interactions through
chatroom-style conversations and analyzes them across five linguistic
dimensions, providing a simple yet effective method to examine emergent social
cognitive biases. We conduct extensive experiments involving eight
representative LLMs across three families. Our findings reveal that LLMs do not
faithfully reproduce genuine human behavior but instead reflect overly
idealized versions of it, shaped by the social desirability bias. In
particular, LLMs show social role bias, primacy effect, and positivity bias,
resulting in "Utopian" societies that lack the complexity and variability of
real human interactions. These findings call for more socially grounded LLMs
that capture the diversity of human social behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前爱沙尼亚语的LLM基准测试有限，缺乏全面比较不同LLMs在爱沙尼亚语任务上的性能评估。

Method: 基于7个多样化数据集建立新基准，涵盖通用和领域特定知识、语法词汇理解等任务；评估6个基础模型和26个指令微调模型，采用人工评估和LLM-as-a-judge方法。

Result: 人工评估与基准测试结果呈现中等到高度相关性；Claude 3.7 Sonnet作为评判模型与人工评分高度一致。

Conclusion: 新基准有效评估了爱沙尼亚语LLMs性能，顶级LLMs(如Claude 3.7)可作为可靠的自动化评估工具。

Abstract: The availability of LLM benchmarks for the Estonian language is limited, and
a comprehensive evaluation comparing the performance of different LLMs on
Estonian tasks has yet to be conducted. We introduce a new benchmark for
evaluating LLMs in Estonian, based on seven diverse datasets. These datasets
assess general and domain-specific knowledge, understanding of Estonian grammar
and vocabulary, summarization abilities, contextual comprehension, and more.
The datasets are all generated from native Estonian sources without using
machine translation. We compare the performance of base models,
instruction-tuned open-source models, and commercial models. Our evaluation
includes 6 base models and 26 instruction-tuned models. To assess the results,
we employ both human evaluation and LLM-as-a-judge methods. Human evaluation
scores showed moderate to high correlation with benchmark evaluations,
depending on the dataset. Claude 3.7 Sonnet, used as an LLM judge, demonstrated
strong alignment with human ratings, indicating that top-performing LLMs can
effectively support the evaluation of Estonian-language models.

we propose a methodology that uses state-of-the-art natural language processing
techniques with sociological insights to analyse the MIGR-TWIT corpus of
far-right tweets in English and French. We aim to uncover patterns of discourse
surrounding migration, hate speech, and persuasion techniques employed by right
and far-right actors. By integrating linguistic, sociological, and
computational approaches, we seek to offer cross-disciplinary insights into
societal dynamics and contribute to a better understanding of contemporary
challenges posed by right-wing extremism on social media platforms.

TL;DR: 开发并评估了一个基于临床分类法和大型语言模型的多智能体系统，用于模拟紧急医疗调度场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 紧急医疗调度（EMD）面临来电者困扰、模糊性和认知负荷等挑战，LLMs和MAS有助于增强调度员的能力。

Method: 构建了包含32个主诉和6个来电者身份的分类法，并设计了一个六阶段通话协议。利用AutoGen开发了一个MAS，包括来电者和调度员智能体，并通过混合评估框架进行评估。

Result: 人类评估显示，系统调度有效性高（94%联系正确潜在其他智能体），指导效果良好（91%的案例中提供了建议），并且情感中立、可读性高、礼貌。

Conclusion: 该分类法基础的MAS以高保真度模拟了多样化的临床调度场景，支持调度员培训、协议评估，并为实时决策支持奠定了基础，展示了将AI智能体安全集成到应急响应工作流中的路径。

Abstract: Objective: Emergency medical dispatch (EMD) is a high-stakes process
challenged by caller distress, ambiguity, and cognitive load. Large Language
Models (LLMs) and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) offer opportunities to augment
dispatchers. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a taxonomy-grounded,
LLM-powered multi-agent system for simulating realistic EMD scenarios. Methods:
We constructed a clinical taxonomy (32 chief complaints, 6 caller identities
from MIMIC-III) and a six-phase call protocol. Using this framework, we
developed an AutoGen-based MAS with Caller and Dispatcher Agents. The system
grounds interactions in a fact commons to ensure clinical plausibility and
mitigate misinformation. We used a hybrid evaluation framework: four physicians
assessed 100 simulated cases for "Guidance Efficacy" and "Dispatch
Effectiveness," supplemented by automated linguistic analysis (sentiment,
readability, politeness). Results: Human evaluation, with substantial
inter-rater agreement (Gwe's AC1 > 0.70), confirmed the system's high
performance. It demonstrated excellent Dispatch Effectiveness (e.g., 94 %
contacting the correct potential other agents) and Guidance Efficacy (advice
provided in 91 % of cases), both rated highly by physicians. Algorithmic
metrics corroborated these findings, indicating a predominantly neutral
affective profile (73.7 % neutral sentiment; 90.4 % neutral emotion), high
readability (Flesch 80.9), and a consistently polite style (60.0 % polite; 0 %
impolite). Conclusion: Our taxonomy-grounded MAS simulates diverse, clinically
plausible dispatch scenarios with high fidelity. Findings support its use for
dispatcher training, protocol evaluation, and as a foundation for real-time
decision support. This work outlines a pathway for safely integrating advanced
AI agents into emergency response workflows.

### [18] [Correlation Dimension of Auto-Regressive Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21258)
*Xin Du,Kumiko Tanaka-Ishii*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的文本复杂性度量方法——相关维度，用以揭示和评估大型语言模型生成文本的结构性特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估指标关注局部预测准确度，忽略了长距离结构复杂性，无法充分解释模型生成中的重复和不连贯等现象。

Method: 引入了分形几何中的相关维度作为度量标准，用以量化语言模型所感知文本的认知复杂性，并评估其在生成过程中的结构变化。

Result: 相关维度揭示了预训练中的三个不同阶段，反映了上下文相关复杂性，指示了模型的幻觉倾向，并能有效检测生成文本的多种退化形式。

Conclusion: 该方法计算高效，适用于多种自回归结构，对模型量化具有鲁棒性，为理解LLMs的生成动态提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in natural
language generation, yet they continue to display puzzling behaviors -- such as
repetition and incoherence -- even when exhibiting low perplexity. This
highlights a key limitation of conventional evaluation metrics, which emphasize
local prediction accuracy while overlooking long-range structural complexity.
We introduce correlation dimension, a fractal-geometric measure of
self-similarity, to quantify the epistemological complexity of text as
perceived by a language model. This measure captures the hierarchical
recurrence structure of language, bridging local and global properties in a
unified framework. Through extensive experiments, we show that correlation
dimension (1) reveals three distinct phases during pretraining, (2) reflects
context-dependent complexity, (3) indicates a model's tendency toward
hallucination, and (4) reliably detects multiple forms of degeneration in
generated text. The method is computationally efficient, robust to model
quantization (down to 4-bit precision), broadly applicable across
autoregressive architectures (e.g., Transformer and Mamba), and provides fresh
insight into the generative dynamics of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的方法Permuted Block-Sparse Attention (PBS-Attn)，通过利用注意力矩阵的排列特性，提高块级稀疏性，从而提升大规模语言模型在长上下文预填充中的计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模语言模型在扩展上下文长度时，自注意力机制的计算复杂度高，成为内存和延迟的瓶颈。虽然块稀疏注意力方法被提出以优化，但其效果依赖于注意力模式，可能导致次优的块级稀疏性。

Method: 提出PBS-Attn，该方法通过排列注意力矩阵，增加块级稀疏性，并提高计算效率。利用定制的permuted-FlashAttention内核，实现长上下文预填充的加速。

Result: 在挑战性的实际长上下文数据集上进行实验，PBS-Attn在模型准确性方面持续优于现有块稀疏注意力方法，并接近全注意力基准。在长上下文预填充中实现端到端加速高达2.75倍。

Conclusion: PBS-Attn通过排列注意力的方法，有效提升了大规模语言模型在长上下文任务中的性能，具有实际可行性。

Abstract: Scaling the context length of large language models (LLMs) offers significant
benefits but is computationally expensive. This expense stems primarily from
the self-attention mechanism, whose $O(N^2)$ complexity with respect to
sequence length presents a major bottleneck for both memory and latency.
Fortunately, the attention matrix is often sparse, particularly for long
sequences, suggesting an opportunity for optimization. Block-sparse attention
has emerged as a promising solution that partitions sequences into blocks and
skips computation for a subset of these blocks. However, the effectiveness of
this method is highly dependent on the underlying attention patterns, which can
lead to sub-optimal block-level sparsity. For instance, important key tokens
for queries within a single block may be scattered across numerous other
blocks, leading to computational redundancy. In this work, we propose Permuted
Block-Sparse Attention (\textbf{PBS-Attn}), a plug-and-play method that
leverages the permutation properties of attention to increase block-level
sparsity and enhance the computational efficiency of LLM prefilling. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on challenging real-world long-context datasets,
demonstrating that PBS-Attn consistently outperforms existing block-sparse
attention methods in model accuracy and closely matches the full attention
baseline. Powered by our custom permuted-FlashAttention kernels, PBS-Attn
achieves an end-to-end speedup of up to $2.75\times$ in long-context
prefilling, confirming its practical viability. Code available at

TL;DR: 引入多样性引导采样器，通过NLI模型提升大模型在问答中的不确定性估计效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自由问答中准确估计大语言模型的语义不确定性具有挑战性，传统方法需大量生成，成本高。

Method: 提出多样性引导采样器，利用NLI模型在解码过程中避免语义冗余，结合重要性重加权和对照变量降低不确定性估计的偏差和方差。

Result: 在四个问答基准上，该方法在相同样本数下匹配或超越基线，并覆盖更多语义簇。

Conclusion: 该方法模块化且无需访问基础模型的梯度，可作为风险敏感模型部署中的即插即用增强。

Abstract: Accurately estimating semantic aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in large
language models (LLMs) is particularly challenging in free-form question
answering (QA), where obtaining stable estimates often requires many expensive
generations. We introduce a diversity-steered sampler that discourages
semantically redundant outputs during decoding, covers both autoregressive and
masked diffusion paradigms, and yields substantial sample-efficiency gains. The
key idea is to inject a continuous semantic-similarity penalty into the model's
proposal distribution using a natural language inference (NLI) model lightly
finetuned on partial prefixes or intermediate diffusion states. We debias
downstream uncertainty estimates with importance reweighting and shrink their
variance with control variates. Across four QA benchmarks, our method matches
or surpasses baselines while covering more semantic clusters with the same
number of samples. Being modular and requiring no gradient access to the base
LLM, the framework promises to serve as a drop-in enhancement for uncertainty
estimation in risk-sensitive model deployments.

*Gianluca Sperduti,Alejandro Moreo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究显示，人类和某些NLP模型都能在读由内部打乱字母的单词时表现出鲁棒性，即忽略字符内部顺序。论文探讨了模型在多个不同单词在字母打乱后形成相同表示的情况下仍能良好运作的原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在理解NLP模型如何在打乱字母（typoglycemia）情况下依然维持性能，尤其是在多个单词坍塌成相同表示时。

Method: 分析英国国家语料库（BNC）以量化单词坍塌和模糊性，评估BERT对坍塌形式进行去模糊化的能力，并通过探测实验比较在干净文本和打乱字母文本上从头训练的BERT变体。

Result: 打乱字母导致的表现退化小于预期，BERT在去模糊化坍塌单词方面表现良好。

Conclusion: 英语中相对较少的单词在打乱字母后会坍塌，并且坍塌的单词往往出现在上下文中，使得去模糊化变得简单，这解释了模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Research in linguistics has shown that humans can read words with internally
scrambled letters, a phenomenon recently dubbed typoglycemia. Some specific NLP
models have recently been proposed that similarly demonstrate robustness to
such distortions by ignoring the internal order of characters by design. This
raises a fundamental question: how can models perform well when many distinct
words (e.g., form and from) collapse into identical representations under
typoglycemia? Our work, focusing exclusively on the English language, seeks to
shed light on the underlying aspects responsible for this robustness. We
hypothesize that the main reasons have to do with the fact that (i) relatively
few English words collapse under typoglycemia, and that (ii) collapsed words
tend to occur in contexts so distinct that disambiguation becomes trivial. In
our analysis, we (i) analyze the British National Corpus to quantify word
collapse and ambiguity under typoglycemia, (ii) evaluate BERT's ability to
disambiguate collapsing forms, and (iii) conduct a probing experiment by
comparing variants of BERT trained from scratch on clean versus typoglycemic
Wikipedia text; our results reveal that the performance degradation caused by
scrambling is smaller than expected.

*Priyanshu Karmakar,Soumyabrata Chaudhuri,Shubhojit Mallick,Manish Gupta,Abhik Jana,Shreya Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了TripTide，首个评估大型语言模型在现实干扰下调整旅行计划能力的基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管现有模型在个性化旅行计划方面取得进展，但实际旅行常面临干扰，因此需要评估LLM在修订行程时的适应能力。

Method: TripTide通过建模干扰严重程度和旅行者容忍度，提出三种评估方式：自动指标（意图保持、响应性和适应性）、LLM-as-a-judge方法和专家手动评估。

Result: LLMs在保持顺序一致性和语义稳定性方面表现良好，但在处理空间变化时，短行程偏差较大；且随着计划长度增加，处理干扰的能力下降。

Conclusion: TripTide为评估LLM在旅行计划中的适应性、个性化和韧性提供了基准，揭示了模型在处理长行程干扰时的局限性。

Abstract: Recent efforts like TripCraft and TravelPlanner have advanced the use of
Large Language Models ( LLMs) for personalized, constraint aware travel
itinerary generation. Yet, real travel often faces disruptions. To address
this, we present TripTide, the first benchmark evaluating LLM's ability to
revise itineraries under realistic disruptions. TripTide models key dimensions
such as disruption severity and traveler tolerance, enabling nuanced assessment
of LLM adaptability to events like flight cancellations, weather closures, or
overbooked attractions. We conduct a threefold evaluation. First, we introduce
automatic metrics including Preservation of Intent (how well the revised plan
maintains feasibility and goals), Responsiveness (promptness and
appropriateness of disruption handling), and Adaptability (semantic, spatial,
and sequential divergence between original and revised plans). Second, we apply
an LLM-as-a-judge approach to automatically assess revision quality. Third, we
perform manual expert evaluation to verify whether revisions preserve semantic,
spatial, sequential, and responsive aspects. Our experiments show that LLMs
maintain strong sequential consistency and semantic stability, while spatial
deviations are larger for shorter trips but decrease with longer ones,
indicating that extended plans encourage better geographic coherence. However,
disruption-handling ability declines as plan length increases, highlighting
limits in LLM robustness. TripTide establishes a benchmark for evaluating
adaptability, personalization, and resilience in LLM-based travel planning
under real-world uncertainty.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）通常在单轮强化学习中发展推理能力，而现实世界应用通常涉及多轮交互。研究发现，多轮训练在推理任务中并不总是必要的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于探讨多轮训练与单轮训练在推理任务中的有效性，以解决训练和实际应用之间的不匹配问题。

Method: 比较了传统的单轮训练和三种多轮策略，通过实验评估它们在单轮和多轮推理任务中的表现。

Result: 单轮训练设置在单轮和多轮评估中均表现良好，而多轮训练在单轮推理任务中表现显著下降。

Conclusion: 对于信息完整的任务，强大的单轮训练仍然更有效和可靠，多轮训练在基本反馈下提供的益处有限，甚至可能降低推理能力。

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically
developed through the single-turn reinforcement learning, whereas real-world
applications often involve multi-turn interactions with human feedback, leading
to a potential mismatch between training and deployment conditions. In this
work, we study whether multi-turn training with human feedback is necessary for
reasoning tasks. We compare conventional single-turn training with three
multi-turn strategies and reach contrary conclusions to previous research. We
find that models trained in a single-turn setting generalize effectively to
both single- and multi-turn evaluations, while models trained with multi-turn
strategies exhibit a significant degradation in single-turn reasoning
performance. These results suggest that for tasks with complete information,
robust single-turn training remains more effective and reliable, as multi-turn
training with basic feedback provides limited benefits and can even degrade
reasoning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多瑞典基准是翻译自以美国为中心的基准，不适合测试与瑞典特别相关的知识。因此，作者提出了一个新的手动编写的问答基准，专注于瑞典相关的人物和事件。

Method: 数据集由标注员从流行的文化、媒体人物和瑞典重大体育赛事中获得灵感编写而成，并包含英语翻译。该数据集可用于测量不同规模和瑞典覆盖度的模型的事实回忆能力，并探究跨语言事实一致性。

Result: 研究发现，具有更强瑞典覆盖度的小型模型在回忆与瑞典相关的事实方面，表现与三倍大的多语言模型相当。此外，在瑞典语上持续预训练通常会提高事实知识，但也会导致部分原有知识的遗忘。

Conclusion: 该数据集展示了作为诊断工具在研究中多语言模型语言适应和知识保留方面的潜力。

Abstract: Many Swedish benchmarks are translated US-centric benchmarks, and therefore
not suitable for testing knowledge that is particularly relevant, or even
specific, to Sweden. We therefore introduce a manually written
question-answering benchmark specifically targeted to Sweden-related
personalities and events, many of which receive very limited coverage in
international media. Our annotators drew inspiration from a popular radio
program featuring public figures from culture and media, as well as major
sports events in Sweden. The dataset can be used to measure factual recall
across models of varying sizes and degrees of Swedish coverage, and allows to
probe cross-lingual factual consistency as to contains English translations.
Using the dataset, we find that smaller models with stronger Swedish coverage
perform comparably to a three times larger multilingual model in recalling
Sweden-related facts. We also observe that continued pre-training on Swedish
generally improves factual knowledge but also leads to forgetting of a part of
the previously known information. These results demonstrate the dataset's
potential as a diagnostic tool for studying language adaptation and knowledge
retention in multilingual models and during language adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在自然语言处理领域取得了巨大成功，但许多形态丰富的语言（如土耳其语）在大规模预训练中代表性不足。

Method: 从头开始训练SindBERT模型，使用312 GB的土耳其语文本数据，并在多个NLP任务上评估其性能，包括词性标注、命名实体识别、冒犯语言检测和TurBLiMP语言可接受性基准。

Result: SindBERT在多项任务中表现与现有的土耳其语和多语言模型相当，大型版本在其中两个任务中取得最佳分数，但整体上扩展优势不明显。

Conclusion: 当前土耳其语NLP基准可能已经饱和，语料库的质量和多样性可能比数据量更为重要。SindBERT作为开放资源为土耳其语NLP做出了贡献，并揭示了扩展的局限性和语料组成的关键作用。

Abstract: Transformer models have revolutionized NLP, yet many morphologically rich
languages remain underrepresented in large-scale pre-training efforts. With
SindBERT, we set out to chart the seas of Turkish NLP, providing the first
large-scale RoBERTa-based encoder for Turkish. Trained from scratch on 312 GB
of Turkish text (mC4, OSCAR23, Wikipedia), SindBERT is released in both base
and large configurations, representing the first large-scale encoder-only
language model available for Turkish. We evaluate SindBERT on part-of-speech
tagging, named entity recognition, offensive language detection, and the
TurBLiMP linguistic acceptability benchmark. Our results show that SindBERT
performs competitively with existing Turkish and multilingual models, with the
large variant achieving the best scores in two of four tasks but showing no
consistent scaling advantage overall. This flat scaling trend, also observed
for XLM-R and EuroBERT, suggests that current Turkish benchmarks may already be
saturated. At the same time, comparisons with smaller but more curated models
such as BERTurk highlight that corpus quality and diversity can outweigh sheer
data volume. Taken together, SindBERT contributes both as an openly released
resource for Turkish NLP and as an empirical case study on the limits of
scaling and the central role of corpus composition in morphologically rich
languages. The SindBERT models are released under the MIT license and made
available in both fairseq and Huggingface formats.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI的发展，VLMs在医疗健康领域的应用逐渐增多，但在HAR中的应用仍较少被研究。传统的深度学习模型在HAR中存在一些限制，而VLMs的灵活性和能力可能克服这些限制，因此有必要探索其在该领域的应用。

Method: 引入了一个描述性标注数据集，并提出了评估VLMs在HAR中的综合评估方法，通过对比实验与最先进的深度学习模型进行比较。

Result: 实验结果表明，VLMs在HAR中能够实现与先进深度学习模型相当的性能，在某些情况下，甚至在准确率上超过传统方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为VLMs在智能医疗系统中的应用提供了有力的基准，并展示了其在远程健康监测中的潜力，为未来的研究和应用开辟了新的可能性。

Abstract: As generative AI continues to evolve, Vision Language Models (VLMs) have
emerged as promising tools in various healthcare applications. One area that
remains relatively underexplored is their use in human activity recognition
(HAR) for remote health monitoring. VLMs offer notable strengths, including
greater flexibility and the ability to overcome some of the constraints of
traditional deep learning models. However, a key challenge in applying VLMs to
HAR lies in the difficulty of evaluating their dynamic and often
non-deterministic outputs. To address this gap, we introduce a descriptive
caption data set and propose comprehensive evaluation methods to evaluate VLMs
in HAR. Through comparative experiments with state-of-the-art deep learning
models, our findings demonstrate that VLMs achieve comparable performance and,
in some cases, even surpass conventional approaches in terms of accuracy. This
work contributes a strong benchmark and opens new possibilities for the
integration of VLMs into intelligent healthcare systems.

TL;DR: 传统IR指标在RAG系统中表现不佳，因此提出了一种新的基于效用的标注方案及UDCG指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IR指标假设用户顺序查看文档，而RAG系统中的LLM则是整体处理文档，并且传统指标无法处理相关但不相干的文档对生成质量的负面影响。

Method: 引入了基于效用的标注方案，量化相关段落的积极贡献和干扰段落的负面影响，并提出UDCG指标，使用面向LLM的位置折扣。

Result: 在五个数据集和六个LLM上的实验表明，UDCG相比传统指标，相关性提高了36%。

Conclusion: UDCG指标能更好地与LLM消费者对齐，为RAG组件提供更可靠的评估。

Abstract: Traditional Information Retrieval (IR) metrics, such as nDCG, MAP, and MRR,
assume that human users sequentially examine documents with diminishing
attention to lower ranks. This assumption breaks down in Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) systems, where search results are consumed by Large Language
Models (LLMs), which, unlike humans, process all retrieved documents as a whole
rather than sequentially. Additionally, traditional IR metrics do not account
for related but irrelevant documents that actively degrade generation quality,
rather than merely being ignored. Due to these two major misalignments, namely
human vs. machine position discount and human relevance vs. machine utility,
classical IR metrics do not accurately predict RAG performance. We introduce a
utility-based annotation schema that quantifies both the positive contribution
of relevant passages and the negative impact of distracting ones. Building on
this foundation, we propose UDCG (Utility and Distraction-aware Cumulative
Gain), a metric using an LLM-oriented positional discount to directly optimize
the correlation with the end-to-end answer accuracy. Experiments on five
datasets and six LLMs demonstrate that UDCG improves correlation by up to 36%
compared to traditional metrics. Our work provides a critical step toward
aligning IR evaluation with LLM consumers and enables more reliable assessment
of RAG components

*Thanh Cong Ho,Farah Kharrat,Abderrazek Abid,Fakhri Karray*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种集成多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）、物联网（IoT）和可穿戴设备的自主远程健康监测系统REMONI，能够自动收集和处理患者数据，检测异常情况，并通过自然语言处理与医护人员交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前远程患者监测领域在传感器数据采集、可视化和分析方面已有较多研究，但人机交互方面存在明显不足。因此，需要开发一种更智能、更自然的交互方式。

Method: REMONI系统通过可穿戴设备和摄像头自动连续收集生命体征、加速度计数据和患者视频片段，利用异常检测模块（包括跌倒检测模型）处理数据，并通过MLLMs实现自然语言处理，识别患者活动和情绪，并响应医护人员询问。系统采用提示工程整合所有患者信息，通过用户友好的Web应用提供实时数据。

Conclusion: REMONI系统通过集成多种技术，实现了远程健康监测中人机交互的突破，具有良好的应用前景，并有望在医疗领域推广使用。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of wearable devices in our daily lives, the
demand and appeal for remote patient monitoring have significantly increased.
Most research in this field has concentrated on collecting sensor data,
visualizing it, and analyzing it to detect anomalies in specific diseases such
as diabetes, heart disease and depression. However, this domain has a notable
gap in the aspect of human-machine interaction. This paper proposes REMONI, an
autonomous REmote health MONItoring system that integrates multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), the Internet of Things (IoT), and wearable devices.
The system automatically and continuously collects vital signs, accelerometer
data from a special wearable (such as a smartwatch), and visual data in patient
video clips collected from cameras. This data is processed by an anomaly
detection module, which includes a fall detection model and algorithms to
identify and alert caregivers of the patient's emergency conditions. A
distinctive feature of our proposed system is the natural language processing
component, developed with MLLMs capable of detecting and recognizing a
patient's activity and emotion while responding to healthcare worker's
inquiries. Additionally, prompt engineering is employed to integrate all
patient information seamlessly. As a result, doctors and nurses can access
real-time vital signs and the patient's current state and mood by interacting
with an intelligent agent through a user-friendly web application. Our
experiments demonstrate that our system is implementable and scalable for
real-life scenarios, potentially reducing the workload of medical professionals
and healthcare costs. A full-fledged prototype illustrating the functionalities
of the system has been developed and being tested to demonstrate the robustness
of its various capabilities.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多奖励优化（MRO）方法，通过增强序列内和序列间的词元相关性来提升扩散语言模型（DLM）的推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型（DLM）在推理性能上仍不及自回归大语言模型（LLM），尤其是在减少去噪步骤时。问题主要源于去噪步骤中词元独立生成，无法捕捉词元相关性。

Method: 定义了两种词元相关性：序列内相关性和序列间相关性。提出了一种多奖励优化（MRO）方法，通过测试时间缩放、拒绝采样和强化学习直接优化词元相关性，并引入分组步骤和重要性采样策略以减少奖励方差并提升采样效率。

Result: 通过大量实验，MRO方法不仅提升了推理性能，还在保持高性能的同时显著提高了采样速度。

Conclusion: MRO方法通过增强词元相关性显著改善了扩散语言模型的推理性能，并在推理基准测试中实现了显著的采样加速。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion language models (DLMs) have presented a
promising alternative to traditional autoregressive large language models
(LLMs). However, DLMs still lag behind LLMs in reasoning performance,
especially as the number of denoising steps decreases. Our analysis reveals
that this shortcoming arises primarily from the independent generation of
masked tokens across denoising steps, which fails to capture the token
correlation. In this paper, we define two types of token correlation:
intra-sequence correlation and inter-sequence correlation, and demonstrate that
enhancing these correlations improves reasoning performance. To this end, we
propose a Multi-Reward Optimization (MRO) approach, which encourages DLMs to
consider the token correlation during the denoising process. More specifically,
our MRO approach leverages test-time scaling, reject sampling, and
reinforcement learning to directly optimize the token correlation with multiple
elaborate rewards. Additionally, we introduce group step and importance
sampling strategies to mitigate reward variance and enhance sampling
efficiency. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MRO not only
improves reasoning performance but also achieves significant sampling speedups
while maintaining high performance on reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Pretrained language models are remarkably effective in aligning with human
brain responses elicited by natural language stimuli, positioning them as
promising model organisms for studying language processing in the brain.
However, existing approaches for both estimating and improving this brain
alignment are participant-dependent and highly affected by the amount of data
available per participant, hindering both generalization to new participants
and population-level analyses. In this work, we address these limitations by
introducing a scalable, generalizable brain-tuning method, in which we
fine-tune pretrained speech language models to jointly predict fMRI responses
from multiple participants. We demonstrate that the resulting brain-tuned
models exhibit strong individual brain alignment while generalizing across
participants. Specifically, our method leads to 1) a 5-fold decrease in the
amount of fMRI data needed to predict brain data from new participants, 2) up
to a 50% increase in the overall brain alignment, and 3) strong generalization
to new unseen datasets. Furthermore, this multi-participant brain-tuning
additionally improves downstream performance on semantic tasks, suggesting that
training using brain data from multiple participants leads to more
generalizable semantic representations. Taken together, these findings
demonstrate a bidirectional benefit between neuroscience and AI, helping bridge
the gap between the two fields. We make our code and models publicly available
at https://github.com/bridge-ai-neuro/multi-brain-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统存在生成内容与检索信息不一致的幻觉问题，现有方法未能有效区分外部知识和参数知识的贡献，需要揭示其内在机制并提出精准检测方案。

Method: 通过分析Qwen3-0.6b模型各层FFN模块对残差流的影响，构建外部上下文分数与参数知识分数的差异信号，训练回归分类器进行幻觉预测，并在GPT-4.1-mini上验证跨模型泛化性。

Result: 所提机制性方法在GPT-5/GPT-4.1等SOTA模型及RAGAS/TruLens等基线对比中表现优异，且Qwen3-0.6b训练的分类器可成功迁移至GPT-4.1-mini。

Conclusion: 模型后期FFN模块对参数知识的过度注入是RAG幻觉的关键机制，基于该机理的检测信号具有高效性和跨模型泛化潜力，为RAG系统幻觉监控提供了新范式。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates external knowledge to
mitigate hallucinations, yet models often generate outputs inconsistent with
retrieved content. Accurate hallucination detection requires disentangling the
contributions of external context and parametric knowledge, which prior methods
typically conflate. We investigate the mechanisms underlying RAG hallucinations
and find they arise when later-layer FFN modules disproportionately inject
parametric knowledge into the residual stream. To address this, we explore a
mechanistic detection approach based on external context scores and parametric
knowledge scores. Using Qwen3-0.6b, we compute these scores across layers and
attention heads and train regression-based classifiers to predict
hallucinations. Our method is evaluated against state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-5,
GPT-4.1) and detection baselines (RAGAS, TruLens, RefChecker). Furthermore,
classifiers trained on Qwen3-0.6b signals generalize to GPT-4.1-mini responses,
demonstrating the potential of proxy-model evaluation. Our results highlight
mechanistic signals as efficient, generalizable predictors for hallucination
detection in RAG systems.

Abstract: We apply category theory to extract multimodal document structure which leads
us to develop information theoretic measures, content summarization and
extension, and self-supervised improvement of large pretrained models. We first
develop a mathematical representation of a document as a category of
question-answer pairs. Second, we develop an orthogonalization procedure to
divide the information contained in one or more documents into non-overlapping
pieces. The structures extracted in the first and second steps lead us to
develop methods to measure and enumerate the information contained in a
document. We also build on those steps to develop new summarization techniques,
as well as to develop a solution to a new problem viz. exegesis resulting in an
extension of the original document. Our question-answer pair methodology
enables a novel rate distortion analysis of summarization techniques. We
implement our techniques using large pretrained models, and we propose a
multimodal extension of our overall mathematical framework. Finally, we develop
a novel self-supervised method using RLVR to improve large pretrained models
using consistency constraints such as composability and closure under certain
operations that stem naturally from our category theoretic framework.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在多语言行为中存在显著差异，但语言谱系结构在此过程中的作用尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过扩展MultiQ数据集的分析，检查模型在提示语言保真度不维持时是否倾向于切换到谱系相关语言，并调查知识一致性在属内和属间的保持情况。

Result: 属级别效应存在，但强烈依赖于训练资源的可用性；不同LLM家族展现出不同的多语言策略。

Conclusion: LLMs编码了属级别结构的某些方面，但训练数据不平衡仍然是塑造其多语言表现的主要因素。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display notable variation in multilingual
behavior, yet the role of genealogical language structure in shaping this
variation remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs
exhibit sensitivity to linguistic genera by extending prior analyses on the
MultiQ dataset. We first check if models prefer to switch to genealogically
related languages when prompt language fidelity is not maintained. Next, we
investigate whether knowledge consistency is better preserved within than
across genera. We show that genus-level effects are present but strongly
conditioned by training resource availability. We further observe distinct
multilingual strategies across LLMs families. Our findings suggest that LLMs
encode aspects of genus-level structure, but training data imbalances remain
the primary factor shaping their multilingual performance.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型能力的提升，需要更具挑战性的评估，特别是涉及语用学，即理解受语境和语言文化规范影响的情境意义。

Method: 通过翻译困难讨论、建立人类基线活动，并对LLMs进行试点评估，设计了SloPragEval和SloPragMega基准测试。

Result: 当前模型在理解细微语言方面有所改进，但在推断非字面表达中隐含的说话者意义时仍可能失败，尤其是涉及文化特定的表达。同时，专有模型和开源模型之间存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 设计针对细微语言理解和目标文化知识的基准测试需谨慎，最好从本地数据构建，并通过人类反应进行验证。

Abstract: Large language models are demonstrating increasing capabilities, excelling at
benchmarks once considered very difficult. As their capabilities grow, there is
a need for more challenging evaluations that go beyond surface-level linguistic
competence. Namely, language competence involves not only syntax and semantics
but also pragmatics, i.e., understanding situational meaning as shaped by
context as well as linguistic and cultural norms. To contribute to this line of
research, we introduce SloPragEval and SloPragMega, the first pragmatics
understanding benchmarks for Slovene that contain altogether 405
multiple-choice questions. We discuss the difficulties of translation, describe
the campaign to establish a human baseline, and report pilot evaluations with
LLMs. Our results indicate that current models have greatly improved in
understanding nuanced language but may still fail to infer implied speaker
meaning in non-literal utterances, especially those that are culture-specific.
We also observe a significant gap between proprietary and open-source models.
Finally, we argue that benchmarks targeting nuanced language understanding and
knowledge of the target culture must be designed with care, preferably
constructed from native data, and validated with human responses.

Result: 音节级特征明显优于字符级基线，高精度方法为需要验证的词条提供了系统标记方法。

Conclusion: 该方法支持在低资源语言文档中提高数据质量。

Abstract: Lexical data collection in language documentation often contains
transcription errors and undocumented borrowings that can mislead linguistic
analysis. We present unsupervised anomaly detection methods to identify
phonotactic inconsistencies in wordlists, applying them to a multilingual
dataset of Kokborok varieties with Bangla. Using character-level and
syllable-level phonotactic features, our algorithms identify potential
transcription errors and borrowings. While precision and recall remain modest
due to the subtle nature of these anomalies, syllable-aware features
significantly outperform character-level baselines. The high-recall approach
provides fieldworkers with a systematic method to flag entries requiring
verification, supporting data quality improvement in low-resourced language
documentation.

Conclusion: RETuning方法通过增强模型的独立逻辑推理能力，减少上下文的不当影响，提高了股票走势预测的性能。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding
reasoning capabilities on mathematical and coding tasks. However, their
application to financial tasks-especially the most fundamental task of stock
movement prediction-remains underexplored. We study a three-class
classification problem (up, hold, down) and, by analyzing existing reasoning
responses, observe that: (1) LLMs follow analysts' opinions rather than exhibit
a systematic, independent analytical logic (CoTs). (2) LLMs list summaries from
different sources without weighing adversarial evidence, yet such
counterevidence is crucial for reliable prediction. It shows that the model
does not make good use of its reasoning ability to complete the task. To
address this, we propose Reflective Evidence Tuning (RETuning), a cold-start
method prior to reinforcement learning, to enhance prediction ability. While
generating CoT, RETuning encourages dynamically constructing an analytical
framework from diverse information sources, organizing and scoring evidence for
price up or down based on that framework-rather than on contextual
viewpoints-and finally reflecting to derive the prediction. This approach
maximally aligns the model with its learned analytical framework, ensuring
independent logical reasoning and reducing undue influence from context. We
also build a large-scale dataset spanning all of 2024 for 5,123 A-share stocks,
with long contexts (32K tokens) and over 200K samples. In addition to price and
news, it incorporates analysts' opinions, quantitative reports, fundamental
data, macroeconomic indicators, and similar stocks. Experiments show that
RETuning successfully unlocks the model's reasoning ability in the financial
domain. Inference-time scaling still works even after 6 months or on
out-of-distribution stocks, since the models gain valuable insights about stock
movement prediction.

Abstract: Understanding how information is dynamically accumulated and transformed in
human reasoning has long challenged cognitive psychology, philosophy, and
artificial intelligence. Existing accounts, from classical logic to
probabilistic models, illuminate aspects of output or individual modelling, but
do not offer a unified, quantitative description of general human reasoning
dynamics. To solve this, we introduce Information Flow Tracking (IF-Track),
that uses large language models (LLMs) as probabilistic encoder to quantify
information entropy and gain at each reasoning step. Through fine-grained
analyses across diverse tasks, our method is the first successfully models the
universal landscape of human reasoning behaviors within a single metric space.
We show that IF-Track captures essential reasoning features, identifies
systematic error patterns, and characterizes individual differences. Applied to
discussion of advanced psychological theory, we first reconcile single- versus
dual-process theories in IF-Track and discover the alignment of artificial and
human cognition and how LLMs reshaping human reasoning process. This approach
establishes a quantitative bridge between theory and measurement, offering
mechanistic insights into the architecture of reasoning.

Abstract: Fuzzy numbers are commonly represented with fuzzy sets. Their objective is to
better represent imprecise data. However, operations on fuzzy numbers are not
as straightforward as maths on crisp numbers. Commonly, the Zadeh's extension
rule is applied to elaborate a result. This can produce two problems: (1) high
computational complexity and (2) for some fuzzy sets and some operations the
results is not a fuzzy set with the same features (eg. multiplication of two
triangular fuzzy sets does not produce a triangular fuzzy set). One more
problem is the fuzzy spread -- fuzziness of the result increases with the
number of operations. These facts can severely limit the application field of
fuzzy numbers. In this paper we would like to revisite this problem with a
different kind of fuzzy numbers -- extensional fuzzy numbers. The paper defines
operations on extensional fuzzy numbers and relational operators (=, >, >=, <,
<=) for them. The proposed approach is illustrated with several applicational
examples. The C++ implementation is available from a public GitHub repository.

<details>

Motivation: 借鉴社会认识论的最新研究，探讨AI系统作为人工认识权威（AEAs）的合理性和影响，特别是在高风险的背景下。

Method: 通过引入AI Preemptionism和total evidence view，分析AI系统作为认识权威的优缺点，并论证为何后者更为合理。

Result: total evidence view具有三个主要优势：1）通过保持人类用户的参与，减轻专业技能的退化；2）为有意义的监督和人类控制提供认识论依据；3）在可靠性条件不满足时，解释对AI的合理不信任。

Conclusion: total evidence view提供了一种在实践中有原则的方法，以确定在何种情况下AI的顺从是合理的，尤其是在需要严格可靠性的高风险背景下。

Abstract: When should we defer to AI outputs over human expert judgment? Drawing on
recent work in social epistemology, I motivate the idea that some AI systems
qualify as Artificial Epistemic Authorities (AEAs) due to their demonstrated
reliability and epistemic superiority. I then introduce AI Preemptionism, the
view that AEA outputs should replace rather than supplement a user's
independent epistemic reasons. I show that classic objections to preemptionism
- such as uncritical deference, epistemic entrenchment, and unhinging epistemic
bases - apply in amplified form to AEAs, given their opacity, self-reinforcing
authority, and lack of epistemic failure markers. Against this, I develop a
more promising alternative: a total evidence view of AI deference. According to
this view, AEA outputs should function as contributory reasons rather than
outright replacements for a user's independent epistemic considerations. This
approach has three key advantages: (i) it mitigates expertise atrophy by
keeping human users engaged, (ii) it provides an epistemic case for meaningful
human oversight and control, and (iii) it explains the justified mistrust of AI
when reliability conditions are unmet. While demanding in practice, this
account offers a principled way to determine when AI deference is justified,
particularly in high-stakes contexts requiring rigorous reliability.

Abstract: Recently, large models have shown significant potential for smart healthcare.
However, the deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for clinical
services is currently hindered by three critical challenges: a tendency to
hallucinate answers not grounded in visual evidence, the inefficiency of
fixed-depth reasoning, and the difficulty of multi-institutional collaboration.
To address these challenges, in this paper, we develop MedAlign, a novel
framework to ensure visually accurate LVLM responses for Medical Visual
Question Answering (Med-VQA). Specifically, we first propose a multimodal
Direct Preference Optimization (mDPO) objective to explicitly align preference
learning with visual context. We then design a Retrieval-Aware
Mixture-of-Experts (RA-MoE) architecture that utilizes image and text
similarity to route queries to a specialized and context-augmented LVLM (i.e.,
an expert), thereby mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs. To achieve adaptive
reasoning and facilitate multi-institutional collaboration, we propose a
federated governance mechanism, where the selected expert, fine-tuned on
clinical datasets based on mDPO, locally performs iterative Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning via the local meta-cognitive uncertainty estimator. Extensive
experiments on three representative Med-VQA datasets demonstrate that MedAlign
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong retrieval-augmented
baselines by up to $11.85\%$ in F1-score, and simultaneously reducing the
average reasoning length by $51.60\%$ compared with fixed-depth CoT approaches.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对含有未观测混杂偏差数据的深度强化学习算法，该算法在多种Atari游戏中表现优于标准DQN。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂且高维的环境中，未观测的混杂因素可能导致学习策略出现偏差。因此，需要一种能够抵抗这些混杂偏差的强化学习方法。

Method: 基于Deep Q-Network (DQN)，提出了一种新的深度强化学习算法，该算法试图在兼容观测数据的最坏情况下寻找安全策略。

Result: 在十二种存在混杂偏差的Atari游戏中应用该方法，发现在行为策略与目标策略输入不匹配且存在未观测混杂因素时，该方法始终优于标准DQN。

Conclusion: 该算法能够有效抵抗观测数据中的混杂偏差，并在多种复杂环境中提升性能。

Abstract: A key task in Artificial Intelligence is learning effective policies for
controlling agents in unknown environments to optimize performance measures.
Off-policy learning methods, like Q-learning, allow learners to make optimal
decisions based on past experiences. This paper studies off-policy learning
from biased data in complex and high-dimensional domains where \emph{unobserved
confounding} cannot be ruled out a priori. Building on the well-celebrated Deep
Q-Network (DQN), we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm
robust to confounding biases in observed data. Specifically, our algorithm
attempts to find a safe policy for the worst-case environment compatible with
the observations. We apply our method to twelve confounded Atari games, and
find that it consistently dominates the standard DQN in all games where the
observed input to the behavioral and target policies mismatch and unobserved
confounders exist.

### [43] [NeuroGenPoisoning: Neuron-Guided Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation of LLM via Genetic Optimization of External Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21144)
*Hanyu Zhu,Lance Fiondella,Jiawei Yuan,Kai Zeng,Long Jiao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的攻击框架NeuroGenPoisoning，通过LLM内部神经元属性和遗传优化生成对抗性外部知识，以解决RAG中毒和知识冲突问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG攻击忽视了模型的内部表示动态和神经元级别的敏感性，且未充分考虑知识冲突的影响，因此需要一种新的攻击框架。

Method: 首先识别与上下文中毒知识强烈相关的Poison-Responsive Neurons，然后使用遗传算法演化对抗性段落以最大化激活这些神经元，并通过观察到的属性信号识别和重用有潜力的不成功的外部知识变体。

Result: 在不同模型和数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法能够持续实现超过90%的高Population Overwrite Success Rate（POSR），并保持文本的流畅性。

Conclusion: NeuroGenPoisoning能够有效解决RAG中的知识冲突问题，并生成大规模高效的中毒知识。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to
dynamically integrate external knowledge during inference, improving their
factual accuracy and adaptability. However, adversaries can inject poisoned
external knowledge to override the model's internal memory. While existing
attacks iteratively manipulate retrieval content or prompt structure of RAG,
they largely ignore the model's internal representation dynamics and
neuron-level sensitivities. The underlying mechanism of RAG poisoning has not
been fully studied and the effect of knowledge conflict with strong parametric
knowledge in RAG is not considered. In this work, we propose NeuroGenPoisoning,
a novel attack framework that generates adversarial external knowledge in RAG
guided by LLM internal neuron attribution and genetic optimization. Our method
first identifies a set of Poison-Responsive Neurons whose activation strongly
correlates with contextual poisoning knowledge. We then employ a genetic
algorithm to evolve adversarial passages that maximally activate these neurons.
Crucially, our framework enables massive-scale generation of effective poisoned
RAG knowledge by identifying and reusing promising but initially unsuccessful
external knowledge variants via observed attribution signals. At the same time,
Poison-Responsive Neurons guided poisoning can effectively resolves knowledge
conflict. Experimental results across models and datasets demonstrate
consistently achieving high Population Overwrite Success Rate (POSR) of over
90% while preserving fluency. Empirical evidence shows that our method
effectively resolves knowledge conflict.

### [44] [How to Auto-optimize Prompts for Domain Tasks? Adaptive Prompting and Reasoning through Evolutionary Domain Knowledge Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21148)
*Yang Zhao,Pu Wang,Hao Frank Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动化框架EGO-Prompt，通过因果引导的文本梯度过程优化提示和推理过程，提高领域特定任务的效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在特定领域任务中，设计最优提示和推理过程对于大型语言模型（LLMs）是必要且具有挑战性的。如何整合领域知识、提高推理效率，并为领域专家提供精细的知识整合提示是关键问题。

Method: EGO-Prompt从一个通用提示和人类专家构建的容错初始语义因果图（SCG）描述开始，通过因果引导的文本梯度过程进行自动优化。该过程包括两个步骤：首先生成每个实例的几乎确定的推理指导，然后调整LLM以有效利用该指导。迭代优化算法进一步使用文本梯度和真实值优化SCG和推理机制。

Result: 在现实世界的公共卫生、交通和人类行为任务中，EGO-Prompt的F1值比最先进的方法高出7.32%-12.61%，并允许小模型在低于原成本20%的情况下达到大模型的性能。

Conclusion: EGO-Prompt不仅提高了模型的性能和效率，还输出了可解释性更强的领域特定SCG，为领域专家提供了更好的知识整合提示。

Abstract: Designing optimal prompts and reasoning processes for large language models
(LLMs) on domain-specific tasks is both necessary and challenging in real-world
applications. Determining how to integrate domain knowledge, enhance reasoning
efficiency, and even provide domain experts with refined knowledge integration
hints are particularly crucial yet unresolved tasks. In this research, we
propose Evolutionary Graph Optimization for Prompting (EGO-Prompt), an
automated framework to designing better prompts, efficient reasoning processes
and providing enhanced causal-informed process. EGO-Prompt begins with a
general prompt and fault-tolerant initial Semantic Causal Graph (SCG)
descriptions, constructed by human experts, which is then automatically refined
and optimized to guide LLM reasoning. Recognizing that expert-defined SCGs may
be partial or imperfect and that their optimal integration varies across LLMs,
EGO-Prompt integrates a novel causal-guided textual gradient process in two
steps: first, generating nearly deterministic reasoning guidance from the SCG
for each instance, and second, adapting the LLM to effectively utilize the
guidance alongside the original input. The iterative optimization algorithm
further refines both the SCG and the reasoning mechanism using textual
gradients with ground-truth. We tested the framework on real-world public
health, transportation and human behavior tasks. EGO-Prompt achieves
7.32%-12.61% higher F1 than cutting-edge methods, and allows small models to
reach the performence of larger models at under 20% of the original cost. It
also outputs a refined, domain-specific SCG that improves interpretability.

### [45] [String Seed of Thought: Prompting LLMs for Distribution-Faithful and Diverse Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21150)
*Kou Misaki,Takuya Akiba*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SSoT是一种新的提示方法，通过引入随机字符串生成和操控来改善大语言模型在概率指令遵循任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在单一、确定性答案的任务中表现出色，但在概率指令遵循任务中常常失败，这限制了需要非确定性行为的应用，如人类行为模拟、内容多样化和多人游戏。

Method: SSoT方法指导大语言模型首先生成一个随机字符串以产生足够的熵，并通过操作该字符串提取随机性，从而在保持答案多样性的同时符合特定约束。

Result: SSoT显著提高了大语言模型在概率指令遵循任务中的表现，接近伪随机数生成器的理想性能，并在NoveltyBench上展示了其在提高响应多样性方面的优势。

Conclusion: SSoT通过简单的提示方法有效解决了大语言模型在概率指令遵循任务中的偏差问题，扩展了其在开放任务中的应用潜力。

Abstract: We introduce String Seed of Thought (SSoT), a novel prompting method for LLMs
that improves Probabilistic Instruction Following (PIF). We define PIF as a
task requiring an LLM to select its answer from a predefined set of options,
each associated with a specific probability, such that the empirical
distribution of the generated answers aligns with the target distribution when
prompted multiple times. While LLMs excel at tasks with single, deterministic
answers, they often fail at PIF, exhibiting biases problematic for applications
requiring non-deterministic behaviors, such as human-behavior simulation,
content diversification, and multiplayer games. It also harms the diversity of
generated responses, a crucial factor in test-time scaling, by causing the
outputs to collapse into a limited set of answers. To address this, we propose
SSoT, a simple prompting method that instructs an LLM to first output a random
string to generate sufficient entropy. SSoT also instructs the LLM to extract
randomness by manipulating this string to derive a final answer, thereby
preserving diversity while adhering to specific constraints. We demonstrate
that SSoT significantly improves the PIF performance of LLMs, approaching the
ideal performance of a pseudo-random number generator. Furthermore, our
experiments on NoveltyBench show SSoT's benefits extend beyond closed-set tasks
to open-ended tasks by enhancing response diversity.

### [46] [Memory-Free Continual Learning with Null Space Adaptation for Zero-Shot Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21175)
*Yujin Jo,Taesup Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种轻量级无记忆持续学习框架NuSA-CL，该框架用于解决视觉语言模型在持续学习中遇到的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实部署中，视觉语言模型会遇到分布变化和新任务，而传统的零样本能力无法满足这些需求，因此需要持续学习方法来适应这些变化并避免灾难性遗忘。

Method: NuSA-CL采用低秩适应和约束任务特定权重更新的方法，使更新位于模型当前参数的近似零空间中，从而最小化对已有知识的干扰。

Result: 实验表明，NuSA-CL能有效保持零样本迁移能力，并在持续学习基准上实现高度竞争力表现。

Conclusion: NuSA-CL是一种实用且可扩展的解决方案，适用于在真实世界中持续演化的零样本视觉语言模型。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization, enabling deployment in a wide range of
real-world tasks without additional task-specific training. However, in real
deployment scenarios with evolving environments or emerging classes, these
models inevitably face distributional shifts and novel tasks. In such contexts,
static zero-shot capabilities are insufficient, and there is a growing need for
continual learning methods that allow models to adapt over time while avoiding
catastrophic forgetting. We introduce NuSA-CL (Null Space Adaptation for
Continual Learning), a lightweight memory-free continual learning framework
designed to address this challenge. NuSA-CL employs low-rank adaptation and
constrains task-specific weight updates to lie within an approximate null space
of the model's current parameters. This strategy minimizes interference with
previously acquired knowledge, effectively preserving the zero-shot
capabilities of the original model. Unlike methods relying on replay buffers or
costly distillation, NuSA-CL imposes minimal computational and memory overhead,
making it practical for deployment in resource-constrained, real-world
continual learning environments. Experiments show that our framework not only
effectively preserves zero-shot transfer capabilities but also achieves highly
competitive performance on continual learning benchmarks. These results
position NuSA-CL as a practical and scalable solution for continually evolving
zero-shot VLMs in real-world applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出OutboundEval，一个用于评估大型语言模型在专家级智能外呼场景中表现的综合基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在数据集多样性与类别覆盖不足、用户模拟不真实和评估指标不准确三大局限，因此需要一种新的评估框架。

Method: OutboundEval通过三个主要组成部分解决这些问题：1）涵盖六个主要业务领域和30个代表性子场景的结构化基准，2）大型模型驱动的用户模拟器，3）动态评估方法，结合自动化和人工评估。

Result: 在12个先进的大型语言模型上的实验揭示了专家级任务完成和交互流畅性之间的明显权衡，为构建可靠、类人的外呼AI系统提供了实际见解。

Conclusion: OutboundEval为在专业应用中评估大型语言模型建立了一个实用、可扩展且面向领域的标准。

Abstract: We propose OutboundEval, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating large
language models (LLMs) in expert-level intelligent outbound calling scenarios.
Unlike existing methods that suffer from three key limitations - insufficient
dataset diversity and category coverage, unrealistic user simulation, and
inaccurate evaluation metrics - OutboundEval addresses these issues through a
structured framework. First, we design a benchmark spanning six major business
domains and 30 representative sub-scenarios, each with scenario-specific
process decomposition, weighted scoring, and domain-adaptive metrics. Second,
we develop a large-model-driven User Simulator that generates diverse,
persona-rich virtual users with realistic behaviors, emotional variability, and
communication styles, providing a controlled yet authentic testing environment.
Third, we introduce a dynamic evaluation method that adapts to task variations,
integrating automated and human-in-the-loop assessment to measure task
execution accuracy, professional knowledge application, adaptability, and user
experience quality. Experiments on 12 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal distinct
trade-offs between expert-level task completion and interaction fluency,
offering practical insights for building reliable, human-like outbound AI
systems. OutboundEval establishes a practical, extensible, and domain-oriented
standard for benchmarking LLMs in professional applications.

TL;DR: 本文综述了AI驱动的自主系统中OOD（分布外）检测技术在安全保证中的应用，分析了相关技术、挑战和未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI自主系统操作能力和应用领域的显著扩展，严格证明其安全性变得至关重要，尤其是在安全关键领域。OOD检测因其在识别不确定和新情况下的潜力，受到了研究、开发和安全工程领域的关注。

Method: 通过定义相关概念，分析导致OOD的原因和挑战，本文识别出多种可在ML开发生命周期中使用的OOD检测技术，并提出了这些技术在安全保证中可能的应用区域。同时讨论了集成OOD检测时需要注意的问题。

Result: 文章综述了多种OOD检测技术，并指出了它们在ML生命周期中的潜在应用，为安全保证提供了支持。此外，还讨论了安全工程师在集成这些技术时必须注意的若干警告。

Conclusion: 文章最后概述了在多个领域和应用中安全开发和操作自主系统所面临的挑战和未来的工作方向。

Abstract: The operational capabilities and application domains of AI-enabled autonomous
systems have expanded significantly in recent years due to advances in robotics
and machine learning (ML). Demonstrating the safety of autonomous systems
rigorously is critical for their responsible adoption but it is challenging as
it requires robust methodologies that can handle novel and uncertain situations
throughout the system lifecycle, including detecting out-of-distribution (OoD)
data. Thus, OOD detection is receiving increased attention from the research,
development and safety engineering communities. This comprehensive review
analyses OOD detection techniques within the context of safety assurance for
autonomous systems, in particular in safety-critical domains. We begin by
defining the relevant concepts, investigating what causes OOD and exploring the
factors which make the safety assurance of autonomous systems and OOD detection
challenging. Our review identifies a range of techniques which can be used
throughout the ML development lifecycle and we suggest areas within the
lifecycle in which they may be used to support safety assurance arguments. We
discuss a number of caveats that system and safety engineers must be aware of
when integrating OOD detection into system lifecycles. We conclude by outlining
the challenges and future work necessary for the safe development and operation
of autonomous systems across a range of domains and applications.

### [49] [Investigating Scale Independent UCT Exploration Factor Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21275)
*Robin Schmöcker,Christoph Schnell,Alexander Dockhorn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了新的自适应选择UCT探索常数λ的策略，使其对游戏奖励规模不敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UCT算法对奖励规模敏感，在奖励密集且规模不同的游戏中表现不佳，需要改进。

Method: 评估了多种自适应选择UCT探索常数λ的策略，包括文献中的和五种新策略，推荐使用新策略，即选择λ为搜索树中所有状态-动作对Q值的经验标准偏差的两倍。

Result: 新策略在各种任务中表现优于现有策略，无论是在单一参数值还是在优化所有可用参数时都能取得更好的性能。

Conclusion: 推荐使用新提出的λ策略，即选择λ为2·σ（σ为Q值的经验标准偏差），该策略在不同奖励规模的游戏中表现更优。

Abstract: The Upper Confidence Bounds For Trees (UCT) algorithm is not agnostic to the
reward scale of the game it is applied to. For zero-sum games with the sparse
rewards of $\{-1,0,1\}$ at the end of the game, this is not a problem, but many
games often feature dense rewards with hand-picked reward scales, causing a
node's Q-value to span different magnitudes across different games. In this
paper, we evaluate various strategies for adaptively choosing the UCT
exploration constant $\lambda$, called $\lambda$-strategies, that are agnostic
to the game's reward scale. These $\lambda$-strategies include those proposed
in the literature as well as five new strategies. Given our experimental
results, we recommend using one of our newly suggested $\lambda$-strategies,
which is to choose $\lambda$ as $2 \cdot \sigma$ where $\sigma$ is the
empirical standard deviation of all state-action pairs' Q-values of the search
tree. This method outperforms existing $\lambda$-strategies across a wide range
of tasks both in terms of a single parameter value and the peak performances
obtained by optimizing all available parameters.

*Yingzhi Mao,Chunkang Zhang,Junxiang Wang,Xinyan Guan,Boxi Cao,Yaojie Lu,Hongyu Lin,Xianpei Han,Le Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在复杂推理任务中表现出卓越的能力，但容易受到严重的安全风险，包括有害内容生成和越狱攻击。本文提出了Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG)框架以解决这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的安全缓解策略依赖于在训练过程中注入启发式安全信号，但这往往会抑制模型的推理能力，无法解决安全性与推理能力之间的权衡问题。

Method: 通过分析不同LRMs的推理轨迹，发现了Self-Jailbreak现象，并提出了Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG)训练框架，该框架重组或回溯不安全的推理步骤，使模型回到安全的推理轨迹。

Result: 在多个推理和安全基准测试上的广泛实验表明，CoG显著提高了当前LRMs的安全性，同时保持了相当的推理能力，明显优于以往方法。

Conclusion: CoG框架能够有效提升LRMs的安全性，同时不损害其推理能力，为解决安全性与推理能力之间的权衡问题提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on complex
reasoning tasks but remain vulnerable to severe safety risks, including harmful
content generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing mitigation strategies rely
on injecting heuristic safety signals during training, which often suppress
reasoning ability and fail to resolve the safety-reasoning trade-off. To
systematically investigate this issue, we analyze the reasoning trajectories of
diverse LRMs and uncover a phenomenon we term Self-Jailbreak, where models
override their own risk assessments and justify responding to unsafe prompts.
This finding reveals that LRMs inherently possess the ability to reject unsafe
queries, but this ability is compromised, resulting in harmful outputs.
Building on these insights, we propose the Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG), a training
framework that recomposes or backtracks unsafe reasoning steps, steering the
model back onto safe trajectories while preserving valid reasoning chains.
Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning and safety benchmarks
demonstrate that CoG substantially improves the safety of current LRMs while
preserving comparable reasoning ability, significantly outperforming prior
methods that suffer from severe safety-reasoning trade-offs.

Motivation: 当前AI可信度研究过于以技术为中心，忽略了社会技术维度，而这对理解现实世界中的AI可信度至关重要。

Method: 对AIES和FAccT会议记录进行范围综述，系统分析不同研究领域如何定义、操作和应用可信度，关注概念化方法、测量方法、验证技术、应用领域和基础价值。

Result: 尽管在技术属性（如透明性、问责制和稳健性）方面取得显著进展，但现有研究往往忽视社会和伦理考量，AI系统的社会技术性质仍较少探索，可信度成为由有权定义者塑造的有争议概念。

Conclusion: 推进可信的AI需要结合技术严谨性与社会、文化和制度考量的跨学科方法，提出可操作的措施，推动真正解决AI系统与社会复杂互动的整体框架，促进有利于所有利益相关者的负责任技术发展。

Abstract: Background: Trustworthy AI serves as a foundational pillar for two major AI
ethics conferences: AIES and FAccT. However, current research often adopts
techno-centric approaches, focusing primarily on technical attributes such as
reliability, robustness, and fairness, while overlooking the sociotechnical
dimensions critical to understanding AI trustworthiness in real-world contexts.
  Objectives: This scoping review aims to examine how the AIES and FAccT
communities conceptualize, measure, and validate AI trustworthiness,
identifying major gaps and opportunities for advancing a holistic understanding
of trustworthy AI systems.
  Methods: We conduct a scoping review of AIES and FAccT conference proceedings
to date, systematically analyzing how trustworthiness is defined,
operationalized, and applied across different research domains. Our analysis
focuses on conceptualization approaches, measurement methods, verification and
validation techniques, application areas, and underlying values.
  Results: While significant progress has been made in defining technical
attributes such as transparency, accountability, and robustness, our findings
reveal critical gaps. Current research often predominantly emphasizes technical
precision at the expense of social and ethical considerations. The
sociotechnical nature of AI systems remains less explored and trustworthiness
emerges as a contested concept shaped by those with the power to define it.
  Conclusions: An interdisciplinary approach combining technical rigor with
social, cultural, and institutional considerations is essential for advancing
trustworthy AI. We propose actionable measures for the AI ethics community to
adopt holistic frameworks that genuinely address the complex interplay between
AI systems and society, ultimately promoting responsible technological
development that benefits all stakeholders.

TL;DR: 提出一种结合符号验证和交互验证的神经符号具身任务规划框架，以增强生成代码的环境基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型生成的代码在动态或部分可观察环境中常因环境基础不足导致任务成功率低。

Method: 在代码生成过程中，引入显式的符号验证和交互验证，通过生成探索性代码与环境的互动获取缺失的观察。

Result: 在RLBench和现实世界动态、部分可观察场景中的实验显示，任务成功率提高了46.2%，任务相关动作的可执行性超过86.8%。

Conclusion: 该框架提高了生成代码的基础性，从而在复杂环境中增强了任务规划的可靠性和成功率。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the automatic
generation of executable code for task planning and control in embodied agents
such as robots, demonstrating the potential of LLM-based embodied intelligence.
However, these LLM-based code-as-policies approaches often suffer from limited
environmental grounding, particularly in dynamic or partially observable
settings, leading to suboptimal task success rates due to incorrect or
incomplete code generation. In this work, we propose a neuro-symbolic embodied
task planning framework that incorporates explicit symbolic verification and
interactive validation processes during code generation. In the validation
phase, the framework generates exploratory code that actively interacts with
the environment to acquire missing observations while preserving task-relevant
states. This integrated process enhances the grounding of generated code,
resulting in improved task reliability and success rates in complex
environments. We evaluate our framework on RLBench and in real-world settings
across dynamic, partially observable scenarios. Experimental results
demonstrate that our framework improves task success rates by 46.2% over
Code-as-Policies baselines and attains over 86.8% executability of
task-relevant actions, thereby enhancing the reliability of task planning in
dynamic environments.

### [53] [Magellan: Guided MCTS for Latent Space Exploration and Novelty Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21341)
*Lufan Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Magellan是一个使用MCTS和层次指导系统来提升LLMs创新生成能力的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在生成创新想法方面存在局限，通常倾向于生成训练数据中的常见概念，现有方法在指导探索方面不一致且缺乏原则性。

Method: Magellan采用MCTS，通过‘语义罗盘’向量进行长期方向引导，并通过感知环境的价值函数进行局部决策，以平衡连贯性、新颖性和叙述进展。

Result: 实验表明，Magellan在生成具有更高可信度和创新性的科学想法方面显著优于ReAct和ToT等基线方法。

Conclusion: 原则性、有指导的搜索在创新发现中比无约束的自主性更有效，为LLMs成为更具创新能力的伙伴铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with generating truly innovative
ideas, typically defaulting to high-probability, familiar concepts within their
training data's "gravity wells." While advanced search-based methods like Tree
of Thoughts (ToT) attempt to mitigate this, they are fundamentally limited by
their reliance on unprincipled, inconsistent self-evaluation heuristics to
guide exploration. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{Magellan}, a novel
framework that reframes creative generation as a principled, guided exploration
of an LLM's latent conceptual space. At its core, Magellan employs Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) governed by a hierarchical guidance system. For long-range
direction, a "semantic compass" vector, formulated via orthogonal projection,
steers the search towards relevant novelty. For local, step-by-step decisions,
a landscape-aware value function replaces flawed self-evaluation with an
explicit reward structure that balances intrinsic coherence, extrinsic novelty,
and narrative progress. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Magellan
significantly outperforms strong baselines, including ReAct and ToT, in
generating scientific ideas with superior plausibility and innovation. Our work
shows that for creative discovery, a principled, guided search is more
effective than unconstrained agency, paving the way for LLMs to become more
capable partners in innovation.

Motivation: 为解决复杂数学优化问题，提供一个无需人工干预的自动化解决方案，并创建一个大规模、多样化的优化模型数据集。

Method: 构建了一个名为AutoOpt-11k的数据集，并开发了AutoOpt框架，该框架包含三个模块：M1（图像到文本）、M2（文本到文本）和M3（优化），分别负责数学表达式识别、LaTeX到PYOMO代码转换和优化求解。

Result: M1模块在BLEU得分上优于ChatGPT、Gemini和Nougat；M3模块在复杂问题上表现优于内点算法和遗传算法。

Conclusion: AutoOpt-11k数据集和AutoOpt框架为自动解决数学优化问题提供了有效的工具，并在实验中表现出色。

Abstract: This study presents AutoOpt-11k, a unique image dataset of over 11,000
handwritten and printed mathematical optimization models corresponding to
single-objective, multi-objective, multi-level, and stochastic optimization
problems exhibiting various types of complexities such as non-linearity,
non-convexity, non-differentiability, discontinuity, and high-dimensionality.
The labels consist of the LaTeX representation for all the images and modeling
language representation for a subset of images. The dataset is created by 25
experts following ethical data creation guidelines and verified in two-phases
to avoid errors. Further, we develop AutoOpt framework, a machine learning
based automated approach for solving optimization problems, where the user just
needs to provide an image of the formulation and AutoOpt solves it efficiently
without any further human intervention. AutoOpt framework consists of three
Modules: (i) M1 (Image_to_Text)- a deep learning model performs the
Mathematical Expression Recognition (MER) task to generate the LaTeX code
corresponding to the optimization formulation in image; (ii) M2 (Text_to_Text)-
a small-scale fine-tuned LLM generates the PYOMO script (optimization modeling
language) from LaTeX code; (iii) M3 (Optimization)- a Bilevel Optimization
based Decomposition (BOBD) method solves the optimization formulation described
in the PYOMO script. We use AutoOpt-11k dataset for training and testing of
deep learning models employed in AutoOpt. The deep learning model for MER task
(M1) outperforms ChatGPT, Gemini and Nougat on BLEU score metric. BOBD method
(M3), which is a hybrid approach, yields better results on complex test
problems compared to common approaches, like interior-point algorithm and
genetic algorithm.

typically learn unified solvers to handle multiple constraints simultaneously.
However, they often underutilize the compositional structure of VRP variants,
each derivable from a common set of basis VRP variants. This critical oversight
causes unified solvers to miss out the potential benefits of basis solvers,
each specialized for a basis VRP variant. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a framework that enables unified solvers to perceive the
shared-component nature across VRP variants by proactively reusing basis
solvers, while mitigating the exponential growth of trained neural solvers.
Specifically, we introduce a State-Decomposable MDP (SDMDP) that reformulates
VRPs by expressing the state space as the Cartesian product of basis state
spaces associated with basis VRP variants. More crucially, this formulation
inherently yields the optimal basis policy for each basis VRP variant.
Furthermore, a Latent Space-based SDMDP extension is developed by incorporating
both the optimal basis policies and a learnable mixture function to enable the
policy reuse in the latent space. Under mild assumptions, this extension
provably recovers the optimal unified policy of SDMDP through the mixture
function that computes the state embedding as a mapping from the basis state
embeddings generated by optimal basis policies. For practical implementation,
we introduce the Mixture-of-Specialized-Experts Solver (MoSES), which realizes
basis policies through specialized Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) experts, and
implements the mixture function via an adaptive gating mechanism. Extensive
experiments conducted across VRP variants showcase the superiority of MoSES
over prior methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶等关键领域中，安全性是基本要求。CBFs已被用于设计安全过滤器，但传统方法在失败集不明显或难以形式化时存在困难。

Method: 利用逆约束学习（ICL）训练一个约束函数，将系统状态分类为安全或不安全，然后使用该函数标注模拟轨迹以训练神经CBF。

Result: 在四个不同环境中进行实证评估，结果表明该方法优于现有基线，并与使用真实安全标签训练的神经CBF性能相当。

Conclusion: 该方法通过专家示范训练神经CBF，在避免失败集方面表现良好，适用于难以形式化失败集的场景。

Abstract: Safety is a fundamental requirement for autonomous systems operating in
critical domains. Control barrier functions (CBFs) have been used to design
safety filters that minimally alter nominal controls for such systems to
maintain their safety. Learning neural CBFs has been proposed as a data-driven
alternative for their computationally expensive optimization-based synthesis.
However, it is often the case that the failure set of states that should be
avoided is non-obvious or hard to specify formally, e.g., tailgating in
autonomous driving, while a set of expert demonstrations that achieve the task
and avoid the failure set is easier to generate. We use ICL to train a
constraint function that classifies the states of the system under
consideration to safe, i.e., belong to a controlled forward invariant set that
is disjoint from the unspecified failure set, and unsafe ones, i.e., belong to
the complement of that set. We then use that function to label a new set of
simulated trajectories to train our neural CBF. We empirically evaluate our
approach in four different environments, demonstrating that it outperforms
existing baselines and achieves comparable performance to a neural CBF trained
with the same data but annotated with ground-truth safety labels.

### [57] [CMOMgen: Complex Multi-Ontology Alignment via Pattern-Guided In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21656)
*Marta Contreiras Silva,Daniel Faria,Catia Pesquita*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了CMOMgen，首个端到端的多本体匹配（CMOM）策略，能够生成完整且语义合理的映射，无需限制目标本体或实体的数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建全面的知识图谱需要使用多个本体，以便将数据完全上下文化。现有的简单成对本体匹配方法无法提供相关但分散的本体的完全语义集成。

Method: CMOMgen采用检索增强生成（Retrieval-Augmented Generation）选择相关类并过滤匹配的参考映射，以增强上下文学习（In-Context Learning），从而生成映射。

Result: 在三个生物医学任务中，CMOMgen在类别选择上优于基线方法，F1分数至少达到63%，在三个任务中的两个任务中优于所有基线和消融版本，在第三个任务中排名第二。

Conclusion: CMOMgen能够有效构建语义合理的映射，在复杂多本体匹配任务中表现出优越性。

Abstract: Constructing comprehensive knowledge graphs requires the use of multiple
ontologies in order to fully contextualize data into a domain. Ontology
matching finds equivalences between concepts interconnecting ontologies and
creating a cohesive semantic layer. While the simple pairwise state of the art
is well established, simple equivalence mappings cannot provide full semantic
integration of related but disjoint ontologies. Complex multi-ontology matching
(CMOM) aligns one source entity to composite logical expressions of multiple
target entities, establishing more nuanced equivalences and provenance along
the ontological hierarchy.
  We present CMOMgen, the first end-to-end CMOM strategy that generates
complete and semantically sound mappings, without establishing any restrictions
on the number of target ontologies or entities. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
selects relevant classes to compose the mapping and filters matching reference
mappings to serve as examples, enhancing In-Context Learning. The strategy was
evaluated in three biomedical tasks with partial reference alignments. CMOMgen
outperforms baselines in class selection, demonstrating the impact of having a
dedicated strategy. Our strategy also achieves a minimum of 63% in F1-score,
outperforming all baselines and ablated versions in two out of three tasks and
placing second in the third. Furthermore, a manual evaluation of non-reference
mappings showed that 46% of the mappings achieve the maximum score, further
substantiating its ability to construct semantically sound mappings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个用于评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）的专家标注视频广告数据集，旨在分析能源行业公共关系中的‘框架’策略，特别是‘绿色清洗’问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业通过公关活动塑造品牌形象，但常出现言行不一（如石油公司的绿色清洗）。大规模分析框架策略有助于理解公关目标，但现有数据集多为文本，缺乏对视频多模态的支持。

Method: 构建包含50多个企业/组织、20国、13类框架标注的Facebook/YouTube视频广告数据集，专为VLMs设计；测试了GPT-4.1等模型的基线性能，并分析挑战（如隐含框架、视频长度、文化背景）。

Result: GPT-4.1在环境信息检测中F1为79%，但绿色创新框架识别最佳模型仅46%；揭示了VLMs在复杂场景下的性能差距。

Conclusion: 该数据集推动了能源领域多模态战略沟通研究，暴露了VLMs在隐含语义、多模态处理等方面的不足，为未来改进指明方向。

Abstract: Companies spend large amounts of money on public relations campaigns to
project a positive brand image. However, sometimes there is a mismatch between
what they say and what they do. Oil & gas companies, for example, are accused
of "greenwashing" with imagery of climate-friendly initiatives. Understanding
the framing, and changes in framing, at scale can help better understand the
goals and nature of public relations campaigns. To address this, we introduce a
benchmark dataset of expert-annotated video ads obtained from Facebook and
YouTube. The dataset provides annotations for 13 framing types for more than 50
companies or advocacy groups across 20 countries. Our dataset is especially
designed for the evaluation of vision-language models (VLMs), distinguishing it
from past text-only framing datasets. Baseline experiments show some promising
results, while leaving room for improvement for future work: GPT-4.1 can detect
environmental messages with 79% F1 score, while our best model only achieves
46% F1 score on identifying framing around green innovation. We also identify
challenges that VLMs must address, such as implicit framing, handling videos of
various lengths, or implicit cultural backgrounds. Our dataset contributes to
research in multimodal analysis of strategic communication in the energy
sector.
