We propose a two-stage\nalignment strategy that bridges the domain gap between sparse VR sketch\nembeddings and rich CLIP embeddings, facilitating both VR sketch-based\nretrieval and generation tasks. 2) Fine-Grained multi-modal conditioning. We\ndisentangle the 3D generation process by using explicit VR sketches for\ngeometric conditioning and text descriptions for appearance control. To\nfacilitate this, we propose a generalizable VR sketch encoder that effectively\naligns different modalities. 3) Efficient and high-fidelity 3D native\ngeneration. Our method leverages a 3D-native generation approach that enables\nfast and texture-rich 3D object synthesis. Experiments conducted on our VRSS\ndataset demonstrate that our method achieves high-quality, multi-modal VR\nsketch-based 3D generation. We believe our VRSS dataset and VRsketch2Gaussian\nmethod will be beneficial for the 3D generation community."}

An AV perception module is responsible for capturing\nand interpreting the surrounding environment to facilitate safe navigation.\nThis module enables AVs to recognize traffic signs, traffic lights, and various\nroad users. However, the perception module is vulnerable to adversarial\nattacks, which can compromise their accuracy and reliability. One such attack\nis the adversarial patch attack (APA), a physical attack in which an adversary\nstrategically places a specially crafted sticker on an object to deceive object\nclassifiers. In APA, an adversarial patch is positioned on a target object,\nleading the classifier to misidentify it. Such an APA can cause AVs to\nmisclassify traffic signs, leading to catastrophic incidents. To enhance the\nsecurity of an AV perception system against APAs, this study develops a\nGenerative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based single-stage defense strategy for\ntraffic sign classification. This approach is tailored to defend against APAs\non different classes of traffic signs without prior knowledge of a patch's\ndesign. This study found this approach to be effective against patches of\nvarying sizes. Our experimental analysis demonstrates that the defense strategy\npresented in this paper improves the classifier's accuracy under APA conditions\nby up to 80.8% and enhances overall classification accuracy for all the traffic\nsigns considered in this study by 58%, compared to a classifier without any\ndefense mechanism. Our defense strategy is model-agnostic, making it applicable\nto any traffic sign classifier, regardless of the underlying classification\nmodel."}

Besides, due to the\nconsiderable number of 3D voxels and quadratic complexity of Transformers,\nmultiple sequences are grouped before feeding to Transformers, leading to a\nlimited receptive field. Inspired by the impressive performance of State Space\nModels (SSM) achieved in the field of 2D vision tasks, in this paper, we\npropose a novel Unified Mamba (UniMamba), which seamlessly integrates the\nmerits of 3D convolution and SSM in a concise multi-head manner, aiming to\nperform \"local and global\" spatial context aggregation efficiently and\nsimultaneously. Specifically, a UniMamba block is designed which mainly\nconsists of spatial locality modeling, complementary Z-order serialization and\nlocal-global sequential aggregator. The spatial locality modeling module\nintegrates 3D submanifold convolution to capture the dynamic spatial position\nembedding before serialization. Then the efficient Z-order curve is adopted for\nserialization both horizontally and vertically. Furthermore, the local-global\nsequential aggregator adopts the channel grouping strategy to efficiently\nencode both \"local and global\" spatial inter-dependencies using multi-head SSM.\nAdditionally, an encoder-decoder architecture with stacked UniMamba blocks is\nformed to facilitate multi-scale spatial learning hierarchically.

To overcome these challenges, we propose\nProbDiffFlow, a training-free framework that estimates optical flow\ndistributions from a single image. Instead of directly predicting motion,\nProbDiffFlow follows an estimation-by-synthesis paradigm: it first generates\ndiverse plausible future frames using a diffusion-based model, then estimates\nmotion from these synthesized samples using a pre-trained optical flow model,\nand finally aggregates the results into a probabilistic flow distribution. This\ndesign eliminates the need for task-specific training while capturing multiple\nplausible motions. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets\ndemonstrate that ProbDiffFlow achieves superior accuracy, diversity, and\nefficiency, outperforming existing single-image and two-frame baselines."}

Without bells and whistles, achieving 80.8 HOTA on\n  SportsMOT", "summary": "The aim of multiple object tracking (MOT) is to detect all objects in a video\nand bind them into multiple trajectories. Generally, this process is carried\nout in two steps: detecting objects and associating them across frames based on\nvarious cues and metrics. Many studies and applications adopt object\nappearance, also known as re-identification (ReID) features, for target\nmatching through straightforward similarity calculation. However, we argue that\nthis practice is overly naive and thus overlooks the unique characteristics of\nMOT tasks. Unlike regular re-identification tasks that strive to distinguish\nall potential targets in a general representation, multi-object tracking\ntypically immerses itself in differentiating similar targets within the same\nvideo sequence. Therefore, we believe that seeking a more suitable feature\nrepresentation space based on the different sample distributions of each\nsequence will enhance tracking performance. In this paper, we propose using\nhistory-aware transformations on ReID features to achieve more discriminative\nappearance representations. Specifically, we treat historical trajectory\nfeatures as conditions and employ a tailored Fisher Linear Discriminant (FLD)\nto find a spatial projection matrix that maximizes the differentiation between\ndifferent trajectories. Our extensive experiments reveal that this\ntraining-free projection can significantly boost feature-only trackers to\nachieve competitive, even superior tracking performance compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods while also demonstrating impressive zero-shot transfer\ncapabilities.

An\nablation study showed that even without logical inference, the fact-based\ncontext constructed by Logic-RAG alone improved accuracy by 15%. Logic-RAG is\nextensible: it allows seamless replacement of individual components with\nimproved versions and enables domain experts to compose new knowledge in both\nFOL and natural language.

While recent ViT-based TTA methods\nhave introduced batch-level adaptation, they remain suboptimal for VLMs due to\ninadequate integration of the text modality. To address these limitations, we\npropose a novel transductive TTA framework, Supportive Clique-based Attribute\nPrompting (SCAP), which effectively combines visual and textual information to\nenhance adaptation by generating fine-grained attribute prompts across test\nbatches. SCAP first forms supportive cliques of test samples in an unsupervised\nmanner based on visual similarity and learns an attribute prompt for each\nclique, capturing shared attributes critical for adaptation. For each test\nsample, SCAP aggregates attribute prompts from its associated cliques,\nproviding enriched contextual information. To ensure adaptability over time, we\nincorporate a retention module that dynamically updates attribute prompts and\ntheir associated attributes as new data arrives. Comprehensive experiments\nacross multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SCAP outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art methods, significantly advancing VLM generalization under\ndomain shifts.

We evaluate our approach on two common benchmark datasets for scene\nsynthesis, RealEstate10K and ScanNet+, and find that our proposed GGS model\nsignificantly improves both the 3D consistency of the generated multi-view\nimages, and the quality of the generated 3D scenes over all relevant baselines.\nCompared to a similar model without 3D representation, GGS improves FID on the\ngenerated 3D scenes by ~20% on both RealEstate10K and ScanNet+.

To achieve more controllable generation,\nan intuitive way is to allow the user to input a few motion frames describing\nprecise desired postures. Thus, we explore a new Text-Frame-to-Motion (TF2M)\ngeneration task that aims to generate motions from text and very few given\nframes. Intuitively, the closer a frame is to a given frame, the lower the\nuncertainty of this frame is when conditioned on this given frame. Hence, we\npropose a novel Progressive Motion Generation (PMG) method to progressively\ngenerate a motion from the frames with low uncertainty to those with high\nuncertainty in multiple stages. During each stage, new frames are generated by\na Text-Frame Guided Generator conditioned on frame-aware semantics of the text,\ngiven frames, and frames generated in previous stages.

Our key\ncontributions include: 1) a dual-branch diffusion architecture with\nhierarchical feature fusion for seamless foreground-background integration; 2)\na self-supervised training paradigm with tailored data augmentation and score\nfunctions; and 3) controllable dropout strategies to balance fidelity and\ndiversity. To support further research, we introduce BlobData for large-scale\ntraining and BlobBench for systematic evaluation. Experiments show that\nBlobCtrl excels in various element-level manipulation tasks while maintaining\ncomputational efficiency, offering a practical solution for precise and\nflexible visual content creation.

Approach. Our simulation\nalgorithm integrates a grayscale filter, spatial resolution filter, and\ncontrast filter. This accounts for the limited sampling density of the retinal\nimplant, as well as the reduced contrast sensitivity of prosthetic vision.\nPatterns of Landolt C and faces created using this simulation algorithm are\ncompared to reports from actual PRIMA users.

Watermarks are typically expected to preserve the integrity of the\ntarget image, withstand removal attempts, and prevent unauthorized replication\nonto unrelated images. To address this need, recent methods embed persistent\nwatermarks into images produced by diffusion models using the initial noise.\nYet, to do so, they either distort the distribution of generated images or rely\non searching through a long dictionary of used keys for detection.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel watermarking method that embeds semantic\ninformation about the generated image directly into the watermark, enabling a\ndistortion-free watermark that can be verified without requiring a database of\nkey patterns. Instead, the key pattern can be inferred from the semantic\nembedding of the image using locality-sensitive hashing. Furthermore,\nconditioning the watermark detection on the original image content improves\nrobustness against forgery attacks. To demonstrate that, we consider two\nlargely overlooked attack strategies: (i) an attacker extracting the initial\nnoise and generating a novel image with the same pattern; (ii) an attacker\ninserting an unrelated (potentially harmful) object into a watermarked image,\npossibly while preserving the watermark. We empirically validate our method's\nincreased robustness to these attacks.

To address these challenges, we propose Dynamic\nDerivation and Elimination (DDESeg): a novel audio-visual segmentation\nframework. Specifically, to mitigate feature confusion, DDESeg reconstructs the\nsemantic content of the mixed audio signal by enriching the distinct semantic\ninformation of each individual source, deriving representations that preserve\nthe unique characteristics of each sound. To reduce the matching difficulty, we\nintroduce a discriminative feature learning module, which enhances the semantic\ndistinctiveness of generated audio representations. Considering that not all\nderived audio representations directly correspond to visual features (e.g.,\noff-screen sounds), we propose a dynamic elimination module to filter out\nnon-matching elements.

To address this challenge, we propose a task-oriented feature\ncompression (TOFC) method for multimodal understanding in a device-edge\nco-inference framework, where visual features are merged by clustering and\nencoded by a learnable and selective entropy model before feature projection.\nSpecifically, we employ density peaks clustering based on K nearest neighbors\nto reduce the number of visual features, thereby minimizing both data\ntransmission and computational complexity.

To enhance compression efficiency, multiple\nentropy models are adaptively selected based on the characteristics of the\nvisual features, enabling a more accurate estimation of the probability\ndistribution.

Recent breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have shown\nsignificant promise in development of advanced Deep Learning (DL) architectures\nfor breast cancer diagnosis through mammography. In this context, the paper\nfocuses on the integration of AI within a Human-Centric workflow to enhance\nbreast cancer diagnostics. Key challenges are, however, largely overlooked such\nas reliance on detailed tumor annotations and susceptibility to missing views,\nparticularly during test time. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid,\nmulti-scale and multi-view Swin Transformer-based framework (MSMV-Swin) that\nenhances diagnostic robustness and accuracy. The proposed MSMV-Swin framework\nis designed to work as a decision-support tool, helping radiologists analyze\nmulti-view mammograms more effectively. More specifically, the MSMV-Swin\nframework leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to isolate the breast\nlobe, reducing background noise and enabling comprehensive feature extraction.\nThe multi-scale nature of the proposed MSMV-Swin framework accounts for\ntumor-specific regions as well as the spatial characteristics of tissues\nsurrounding the tumor, capturing both localized and contextual information. The\nintegration of contextual and localized data ensures that MSMV-Swin's outputs\nalign with the way radiologists interpret mammograms, fostering better human-AI\ninteraction and trust. A hybrid fusion structure is then designed to ensure\nrobustness against missing views, a common occurrence in clinical practice when\nonly a single mammogram view is available."}

Few works have been\ninvestigated on abdominal radiology reports due to more complex anatomy and a\nwider range of pathologies in the abdomen. We propose LEAVS (Large language\nmodel Extractor for Abdominal Vision Supervision). This labeler can annotate\nthe certainty of presence and the urgency of seven types of abnormalities for\nnine abdominal organs on CT radiology reports. To ensure broad coverage, we\nchose abnormalities that encompass most of the finding types from CT reports.\nOur approach employs a specialized chain-of-thought prompting strategy for a\nlocally-run LLM using sentence extraction and multiple-choice questions in a\ntree-based decision system. We demonstrate that the LLM can extract several\nabnormality types across abdominal organs with an average F1 score of 0.89,\nsignificantly outperforming competing labelers and humans. Additionally, we\nshow that extraction of urgency labels achieved performance comparable to human\nannotations.

However, current clinical\ndiagnoses primarily rely on manual evaluation. Deep learning methods have shown\npromise in lesion detection, but most supervised approaches are heavily\ndependent on large, annotated datasets. Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD)\noffers a compelling alternative by eliminating the need for abnormal data\nannotations. However, existing UAD methods rely on curated normal datasets and\ntheir performance frequently deteriorates when applied to clinical datasets due\nto domain shifts. We propose an Uncertainty-based Unsupervised Anomaly\nDetection framework, termed U2AD, to address these limitations. Unlike\ntraditional methods, U2AD is designed to be trained and tested within the same\nclinical dataset, following a \"mask-and-reconstruction\" paradigm built on a\nVision Transformer-based architecture. We introduce an uncertainty-guided\nmasking strategy to resolve task conflicts between normal reconstruction and\nanomaly detection to achieve an optimal balance. Specifically, we employ a\nMonte-Carlo sampling technique to estimate reconstruction uncertainty mappings\nduring training. By iteratively optimizing reconstruction training under the\nguidance of both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, U2AD reduces overall\nreconstruction variance while emphasizing regions. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that U2AD outperforms existing supervised and unsupervised methods\nin patient-level identification and segment-level localization tasks. This\nframework establishes a new benchmark for incorporating uncertainty guidance\ninto UAD, highlighting its clinical utility in addressing domain shifts and\ntask conflicts in medical image anomaly detection.

Project Page:\n  https://gary3410.github.io/momanipVLA/", "summary": "Mobile manipulation is the fundamental challenge for robotics to assist\nhumans with diverse tasks and environments in everyday life. However,\nconventional mobile manipulation approaches often struggle to generalize across\ndifferent tasks and environments because of the lack of large-scale training.\nIn contrast, recent advances in vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown\nimpressive generalization capabilities, but these foundation models are\ndeveloped for fixed-base manipulation tasks. Therefore, we propose an efficient\npolicy adaptation framework named MoManipVLA to transfer pre-trained VLA models\nof fix-base manipulation to mobile manipulation, so that high generalization\nability across tasks and environments can be achieved in mobile manipulation\npolicy. Specifically, we utilize pre-trained VLA models to generate waypoints\nof the end-effector with high generalization ability. We design motion planning\nobjectives for the mobile base and the robot arm, which aim at maximizing the\nphysical feasibility of the trajectory. Finally, we present an efficient\nbi-level objective optimization framework for trajectory generation, where the\nupper-level optimization predicts waypoints for base movement to enhance the\nmanipulator policy space, and the lower-level optimization selects the optimal\nend-effector trajectory to complete the manipulation task. In this way,\nMoManipVLA can adjust the position of the robot base in a zero-shot manner,\nthus making the waypoints predicted from the fixed-base VLA models feasible.\nExtensive experimental results on OVMM and the real world demonstrate that\nMoManipVLA achieves a 4.2% higher success rate than the state-of-the-art mobile\nmanipulation, and only requires 50 training cost for real world deployment due\nto the strong generalization ability in the pre-trained VLA models."}
