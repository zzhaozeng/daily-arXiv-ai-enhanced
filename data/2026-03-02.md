Abstract: Long-document topic segmentation plays an important role in information retrieval and document understanding, yet existing methods still show clear shortcomings in ultra-long text settings. Traditional discriminative models are constrained by fixed windows and cannot model document-level semantics; generative large language models can output paragraph boundaries, but inference is expensive and long inputs are difficult to support. To address these issues, we propose a discriminative segmentation model based on Qwen3-0.6B. On top of the backbone network, we add a cross-window context fusion layer and a boundary classification head, and combine them with an overlapping sliding-window strategy. Our model supports single-pass inputs of up to 13k tokens and can be extended to ultra-long documents for paragraph boundary detection. To further enhance downstream retrieval efficiency, we derive a vector fusion method with scalar correction, which compresses the representation of ultra-long segments into a single vector without semantic loss. Experiments on the Wikipedia long-document topic segmentation dataset WIKI-727K show that, compared with three generative models based on Qwen2-0.5B released by Jina, our method achieves a better macro-averaged F1 and delivers two orders of magnitude faster inference, substantially improving the practicality and scalability of long-document processing.

Abstract: The rising demand for inclusive speech technologies amplifies the need for multilingual datasets for Natural Language Processing (NLP) research. However, limited awareness of existing task-specific resources in low-resource languages hinders research. This challenge is especially acute in linguistically diverse countries, such as India. Cross-task profiling of existing Indian speech datasets can alleviate the data scarcity challenge. This involves investigating the utility of datasets across multiple downstream tasks rather than focusing on a single task. Prior surveys typically catalogue datasets for a single task, leaving comprehensive cross-task profiling as an open opportunity. Therefore, we propose Task-Lens, a cross-task survey that assesses the readiness of 50 Indian speech datasets spanning 26 languages for nine downstream speech tasks. First, we analyze which datasets contain metadata and properties suitable for specific tasks. Next, we propose task-aligned enhancements to unlock datasets to their full downstream potential. Finally, we identify tasks and Indian languages that are critically underserved by current resources. Our findings reveal that many Indian speech datasets contain untapped metadata that can support multiple downstream tasks. By uncovering cross-task linkages and gaps, Task-Lens enables researchers to explore the broader applicability of existing datasets and to prioritize dataset creation for underserved tasks and languages.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Training large language models to reason with search engines via reinforcement learning is hindered by a fundamental credit assignment problem: existing methods such as Search-R1 provide only a sparse outcome reward after an entire multi-step trajectory, making it infeasible to attribute success or failure to individual reasoning and retrieval decisions. Process-reward methods like StepSearch alleviate this by introducing step-level supervision, but rely on heuristic rewards such as TF-IDF overlap with gold documents, and still sample k complete trajectories per example, retaining high gradient variance. We propose SLATE, a framework built on two complementary ideas: (1) truncated step-level sampling, which generates k trajectories that share a common prefix and differ only at the next step, and (2) dense LLM-as-judge rewards, which replace heuristic scoring with a capable LLM evaluator that assesses the quality of each reasoning step, search query, and answer, providing richer and more reliable supervision. We theoretically prove that under the same dense reward structure, truncated sampling reduces the variance of advantage estimates by up to a factor of T compared to full-trajectory sampling for T-step trajectories, yielding lower-variance, better-targeted policy gradients. Experiments on seven QA benchmarks confirm that SLATE consistently outperforms both sparse-reward and process-reward baselines, with the largest gains on harder multi-hop tasks and smaller models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Scientific research relies on accurate citation for attribution and integrity, yet large language models (LLMs) introduce a new risk: fabricated references that appear plausible but correspond to no real publications. Such hallucinated citations have already been observed in submissions and accepted papers at major machine learning venues, exposing vulnerabilities in peer review. Meanwhile, rapidly growing reference lists make manual verification impractical, and existing automated tools remain fragile to noisy and heterogeneous citation formats and lack standardized evaluation. We present the first comprehensive benchmark and detection framework for hallucinated citations in scientific writing. Our multi-agent verification pipeline decomposes citation checking into claim extraction, evidence retrieval, passage matching, reasoning, and calibrated judgment to assess whether a cited source truly supports its claim. We construct a large-scale human-validated dataset across domains and define unified metrics for citation faithfulness and evidence alignment. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs reveal substantial citation errors and show that our framework significantly outperforms prior methods in both accuracy and interpretability. This work provides the first scalable infrastructure for auditing citations in the LLM era and practical tools to improve the trustworthiness of scientific references.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Though patients are increasingly granted digital access to their electronic health records (EHRs), existing interfaces may not support precise, trustworthy answers to patient-specific questions. Large language models (LLM) show promise in clinical question answering (QA), but retrieval-based approaches are computationally inefficient, prone to hallucination, and difficult to deploy over real-life EHRs. In this work, we introduce FHIRPath-QA, the first open dataset and benchmark for patient-specific QA that includes open-standard FHIRPath queries over real-world clinical data. We propose a text-to-FHIRPath QA paradigm that shifts reasoning from free-text generation to FHIRPath query synthesis, significantly reducing LLM usage. Built on MIMIC-IV on FHIR Demo, the dataset pairs over 14k natural language questions in patient and clinician phrasing with validated FHIRPath queries and answers. Further, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to deal with ambiguity in patient language and perform poorly in FHIRPath query synthesis. However, they benefit strongly from supervised fine-tuning. Our results highlight that text-to-FHIRPath synthesis has the potential to serve as a practical foundation for safe, efficient, and interoperable consumer health applications, and our dataset and benchmark serve as a starting point for future research on the topic. The full dataset and generation code is available at: https://github.com/mooshifrew/fhirpath-qa.

Abstract: Understanding and extracting structured insights from unstructured documents remains a foundational challenge in industrial NLP. While Large Language Models (LLMs) enable zero-shot extraction, traditional pipelines often fail to handle multi-document packets, complex reasoning, and strict compliance requirements. We present IDP (Intelligent Document Processing) Accelerator, a framework enabling agentic AI for end-to-end document intelligence with four key components: (1) DocSplit, a novel benchmark dataset and multimodal classifier using BIO tagging to segment complex document packets; (2) configurable Extraction Module leveraging multimodal LLMs to transform unstructured content into structured data; (3) Agentic Analytics Module, compliant with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) providing data access through secure, sandboxed code execution; and (4) Rule Validation Module replacing deterministic engines with LLM-driven logic for complex compliance checks. The interactive demonstration enables users to upload document packets, visualize classification results, and explore extracted data through an intuitive web interface. We demonstrate effectiveness across industries, highlighting a production deployment at a leading healthcare provider achieving 98% classification accuracy, 80% reduced processing latency, and 77% lower operational costs over legacy baselines. IDP Accelerator is open-sourced with a live demonstration available to the community.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Human reasoning often involves working over limited information to arrive at probabilistic conclusions. In its simplest form, this involves making an inference that is not strictly entailed by a premise, but rather only likely given the premise. While reasoning LLMs have demonstrated strong performance on logical and mathematical tasks, their behavior on such open-ended, non-deterministic inferences remains largely unexplored. We introduce ProbCOPA, a dataset of 210 handcrafted probabilistic inferences in English, each annotated for inference likelihood by 25--30 human participants. We find that human responses are graded and varied, revealing probabilistic judgments of the inferences in our dataset. Comparing these judgments with responses from eight state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, we show that models consistently fail to produce human-like distributions. Finally, analyzing LLM reasoning chains, we find evidence of a common reasoning pattern used to evaluate such inferences. Our findings reveal persistent differences between humans and LLMs, and underscore the need to evaluate reasoning beyond deterministic settings.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Sentences like "She will go to France or Spain, or perhaps to Germany or France." appear formally redundant, yet become acceptable in contexts such as "Mary will go to a philosophy program in France or Spain, or a mathematics program in Germany or France." While this phenomenon has typically been analyzed using symbolic formal representations, we aim to provide a complementary account grounded in artificial neural mechanisms. We first present new behavioral evidence from humans and large language models demonstrating the robustness of this apparent non-redundancy across contexts. We then show that, in language models, redundancy avoidance arises from two interacting mechanisms: models learn to bind contextually relevant information to repeated lexical items, and Transformer induction heads selectively attend to these context-licensed representations. We argue that this neural explanation sheds light on the mechanisms underlying context-sensitive semantic interpretation, and that it complements existing symbolic analyses.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Suicide remains a pressing global public health concern. While social media platforms offer opportunities for early risk detection through online conversation trees, existing approaches face two major limitations: (1) They rely on predefined rules (e.g., quotes or relies) to log conversations that capture only a narrow spectrum of user interactions, and (2) They overlook hidden influences such as user conformity and suicide copycat behavior, which can significantly affect suicidal expression and propagation in online communities. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Agent Causal Reasoning (MACR) framework that collaboratively employs a Reasoning Agent to scale user interactions and a Bias-aware Decision-Making Agent to mitigate harmful biases arising from hidden influences. The Reasoning Agent integrates cognitive appraisal theory to generate counterfactual user reactions to posts, thereby scaling user interactions. It analyses these reactions through structured dimensions, i.e., cognitive, emotional, and behavioral patterns, with a dedicated sub-agent responsible for each dimension. The Bias-aware Decision-Making Agent mitigates hidden biases through a front-door adjustment strategy, leveraging the counterfactual user reactions produced by the Reasoning Agent. Through the collaboration of reasoning and bias-aware decision making, the proposed MACR framework not only alleviates hidden biases, but also enriches contextual information of user interactions with counterfactual knowledge. Extensive experiments on real-world conversational datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of MACR in identifying suicide risk.

Abstract: In the field of educational assessment, automated scoring systems increasingly rely on deep learning and large language models (LLMs). However, these systems face significant risks of bias amplification, where model prediction gaps between student groups become larger than those observed in training data. This issue is especially severe for underrepresented groups such as English Language Learners (ELLs), as models may inherit and further magnify existing disparities in the data. We identify that this issue is closely tied to representation bias: the scarcity of minority (high-scoring ELL) samples makes models trained with empirical risk minimization favor majority (non-ELL) linguistic patterns. Consequently, models tend to under-predict ELL students who even demonstrate comparable domain knowledge but use different linguistic patterns, thereby undermining the fairness of automated scoring outcomes. To mitigate this, we propose BRIDGE, a Bias-Reducing Inter-group Data GEneration framework designed for low-resource assessment settings. Instead of relying on the limited minority samples, BRIDGE synthesizes high-scoring ELL samples by "pasting" construct-relevant (i.e., rubric-aligned knowledge and evidence) content from abundant high-scoring non-ELL samples into authentic ELL linguistic patterns. We further introduce a discriminator model to ensure the quality of synthetic samples. Experiments on California Science Test (CAST) datasets demonstrate that BRIDGE effectively reduces prediction bias for high-scoring ELL students while maintaining overall scoring performance. Notably, our method achieves fairness gains comparable to using additional real human data, offering a cost-effective solution for ensuring equitable scoring in large-scale assessments.

Abstract: Long-form question answering (LFQA) demands nuanced evaluation of multi-sentence explanatory responses, yet existing metrics often fail to reflect human judgment. We present LFQA-HP-1M, a large-scale dataset comprising 1.3M human pairwise preference annotations for LFQA. We propose nine rubrics for answer quality evaluation, and show that simple linear models based on these features perform comparably to state-of-the-art LLM evaluators. We further examine transitivity consistency, positional bias, and verbosity biases in LLM evaluators and demonstrate their vulnerability to adversarial perturbations. Overall, this work provides one of the largest public LFQA preference datasets and a rubric-driven framework for transparent and reliable evaluation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs), defined as their ability to analyze, infer, and make decisions based on input information, is essential for building intelligent task-oriented dialogue systems. However, existing benchmarks do not sufficiently reflect the complexity of real-world scenarios, which limits their effectiveness in evaluating and enhancing LLM reasoning in practical contexts. Many current reasoning datasets are overly simplistic and abstract, often disconnected from realistic task flows, domain constraints, and operational rules, making it difficult to effectively evaluate LLMs' logical reasoning ability. In addition, data contamination from pretraining corpora undermines the reliability of evaluation results, and traditional crowdsourcing methods for dataset construction are labor-intensive and difficult to scale. To address these challenges, we propose a LLM-driven framework for synthesizing multi-turn, task-oriented dialogues grounded in realistic reasoning scenarios, leveraging trilevel optimization to enhance dialogue quality. Our method generates dialogues grounded in authentic task scenarios, enriched with real-world information, and exhibiting strong contextual coherence. Corresponding reasoning tasks are carefully designed around these dialogues and iteratively refined to continuously improve the tasks' quality and challenge. The resulting dataset serves as a valuable benchmark for assessing and advancing the realistic logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Experimental results show that our synthetic data-based reasoning tasks introduce non-trivial reasoning challenges and provide meaningful support for improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: TRIZ-based contradiction mining is a fundamental task in patent analysis and systematic innovation, as it enables the identification of improving and worsening technical parameters that drive inventive problem solving. However, existing approaches largely rely on rule-based systems or traditional machine learning models, which struggle with semantic ambiguity, domain dependency, and limited generalization when processing complex patent language. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown strong semantic understanding capabilities, yet their direct application to TRIZ parameter extraction remains challenging due to hallucination and insufficient grounding in structured TRIZ knowledge. To address these limitations, this paper proposes TRIZ-RAGNER, a retrieval-augmented large language model framework for TRIZ-aware named entity recognition in patent-based contradiction mining. TRIZ-RAGNER reformulates contradiction mining as a semantic-level NER task and integrates dense retrieval over a TRIZ knowledge base, cross-encoder reranking for context refinement, and structured LLM prompting to extract improving and worsening parameters from patent sentences. By injecting domain-specific TRIZ knowledge into the LLM reasoning process, the proposed framework effectively reduces semantic noise and improves extraction consistency. Experiments on the PaTRIZ dataset demonstrate that TRIZ-RAGNER consistently outperforms traditional sequence labeling models and LLM-based baselines. The proposed framework achieves a precision of 85.6%, a recall of 82.9%, and an F1-score of 84.2% in TRIZ contradiction pair identification. Compared with the strongest baseline using prompt-enhanced GPT, TRIZ-RAGNER yields an absolute F1-score improvement of 7.3 percentage points, confirming the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented TRIZ knowledge grounding for robust and accurate patent-based contradiction mining.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The evaluation of large language models (LLMs) has predominantly relied on static datasets, which offer limited scalability and fail to capture the evolving reasoning capabilities of recent models. To overcome these limitations, we propose an agent-centric benchmarking paradigm that moves beyond static datasets by introducing a dynamic protocol in which autonomous agents iteratively generate, validate, and solve problems. Within this protocol, a teacher agent generates candidate problems, an orchestrator agent rigorously verifies their validity and guards against adversarial attacks, and a student agent attempts to solve the validated problems. An invalid problem is revised by the teacher agent until it passes validation. If the student correctly solves the problem, the orchestrator prompts the teacher to generate more challenging variants. Consequently, the benchmark scales in difficulty automatically as more capable agents are substituted into any role, enabling progressive evaluation of large language models without manually curated datasets. Adopting text anomaly detection as our primary evaluation format, which demands cross-sentence logical inference and resists pattern-matching shortcuts, we demonstrate that this protocol systematically exposes corner-case reasoning errors that conventional benchmarks fail to reveal. We further advocate evaluating systems along several complementary axes including cross-model pairwise performance and progress between the initial and orchestrator-finalized problems. By shifting the focus from fixed datasets to dynamic protocols, our approach offers a sustainable direction for evaluating ever-evolving language models and introduces a research agenda centered on the co-evolution of agent-centric benchmarks.

Abstract: This study addresses the issues of semantic entanglement, unclear label structure, and insufficient feature representation in few-shot text classification, and proposes an optimization framework based on structured prompts to enhance semantic understanding and task adaptation under low-resource conditions. The framework first uses a pretrained language model to encode the input text and obtain basic semantic representations. It then introduces structured prompts composed of multi-dimensional semantic factors and integrates them with text features through a learnable combination mechanism, which forms task-related representations with clear boundaries in the latent space. To further strengthen the consistency between text representations and label semantics, the method constructs a structured label embedding matrix and employs a cross-space alignment mechanism to ensure stable matching between textual features and label attributes. In addition, the model applies prompt orthogonality constraints and a joint optimization objective to maintain independence across different semantic factors in the prompts, allowing the structured prompts to provide transparent and controllable guidance for classification decisions. Three types of sensitivity experiments, including learning rate sensitivity, prompt length sensitivity, and data scale sensitivity, are designed to evaluate the stability and robustness of the framework under different conditions. Experimental results show that the proposed structured prompt optimization framework effectively alleviates semantic conflicts and label ambiguity in few-shot text classification. It significantly improves performance on accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC, and demonstrates strong cross-task applicability.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have shown promising performance across various reasoning tasks, establishing themselves as an alternative to autoregressive large language models (LLMs). Unlike autoregressive LLMs that generate one token per step based on all previous tokens, dLLMs theoretically enable parallel generation of multiple tokens at each decoding step. However, recent dLLMs still favor one-token-per-step generation in practice, as directly decoding multiple masked tokens often leads to degraded generation quality and stability. This reveals a substantial gap between the theoretical parallelism and practical performance of dLLMs. To bridge this gap, we introduce an adaptive parallel decoding approach, namely DiCo, which features a three-phase divide-and-conquer paradigm to unleash the inherent parallelism of dLLMs. During the Divide phase, DiCo first explores the input masked sequence and identifies masked tokens as seed tokens, which are then expanded to construct a set of local clusters. During the Conquer phase, DiCo performs parallel decoding across different local clusters constructed in the Divide phase. The divide-and-conquer process repeatedly alternates between the Divide and Conquer phases until convergence. During the Finalize phase, DiCo decodes the remaining few masked tokens using an effective fine-grained compound decoding scheme to finalize the generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiCo can achieve significant inference speedups while maintaining competitive generation quality.

Abstract: We present GLUScope, an open-source tool for analyzing neurons in Transformer-based language models, intended for interpretability researchers. We focus on more recent models than previous tools do; specifically we consider gated activation functions such as SwiGLU. This introduces a new challenge: understanding positive activations is not enough. Instead, both the gate and the in activation of a neuron can be positive or negative, leading to four different possible sign combinations that in some cases have quite different functionalities. Accordingly, for any neuron, our tool shows text examples for each of the four sign combinations, and indicates how often each combination occurs. We describe examples of how our tool can lead to novel insights. A demo is available at https: //sjgerstner.github.io/gluscope.

Abstract: Chinese text correction has traditionally focused on spelling and grammar, while factual error correction is usually treated separately. However, in paragraph-level Chinese professional writing, linguistic (word/grammar/punctuation) and factual errors frequently co-occur and interact, making unified correction both necessary and challenging. This paper introduces CLFEC (Chinese Linguistic & Factual Error Correction), a new task for joint linguistic and factual correction. We construct a mixed, multi-domain Chinese professional writing dataset spanning current affairs, finance, law, and medicine. We then conduct a systematic study of LLM-based correction paradigms, from prompting to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agentic workflows. The analysis reveals practical challenges, including limited generalization of specialized correction models, the need for evidence grounding for factual repair, the difficulty of mixed-error paragraphs, and over-correction on clean inputs. Results further show that handling linguistic and factual Error within the same context outperform decoupled processes, and that agentic workflows can be effective with suitable backbone models. Overall, our dataset and empirical findings provide guidance for building reliable, fully automatic proofreading systems in industrial settings.

Abstract: We show that large language models (LLMs) have an astonishing ability to recover meaning from severely degraded English texts. Texts in which content words have been randomly substituted by nonsense strings, e.g., "At the ghybe of the swuint, we are haiveed to Wourge Phrear-gwurr, who sproles into an ghitch flount with his crurp", can be translated to conventional English that is, in many cases, close to the original text, e.g., "At the start of the story, we meet a man, Chow, who moves into an apartment building with his wife." These results show that structural cues (e.g., morphosyntax, closed-class words) constrain lexical meaning to a much larger degree than imagined. Although the abilities of LLMs to make sense of "Jabberwockified" English are clearly superhuman, they are highly relevant to understanding linguistic structure and suggest that efficient language processing either in biological or artificial systems likely benefits from very tight integration between syntax, lexical semantics, and general world knowledge.

Abstract: Transformer-based models such as BERT have significantly advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) across many languages. However, Nepali, a low-resource language written in Devanagari script, remains relatively underexplored. This study benchmarks multilingual, Indic, Hindi, and Nepali BERT variants to evaluate their effectiveness in Nepali topic classification. Ten pre-trained models, including mBERT, XLM-R, MuRIL, DevBERT, HindiBERT, IndicBERT, and NepBERTa, were fine-tuned and tested on the balanced Nepali dataset containing 25,006 sentences across five conceptual domains and the performance was evaluated using accuracy, weighted precision, recall, F1-score, and AUROC metrics. The results reveal that Indic models, particularly MuRIL-large, achieved the highest F1-score of 90.60%, outperforming multilingual and monolingual models. NepBERTa also performed competitively with an F1-score of 88.26%. Overall, these findings establish a robust baseline for future document-level classification and broader Nepali NLP applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces a dataset of enriched geographic coordinates retrieved from Diderot and d'Alembert's eighteenth-century Encyclopedie. Automatically recovering geographic coordinates from historical texts is a complex task, as they are expressed in a variety of ways and with varying levels of precision. To improve retrieval of coordinates from similar digitized early modern texts, we have created a gold standard dataset, trained models, published the resulting inferred and normalized coordinate data, and experimented applying these models to new texts. From 74,000 total articles in each of the digitized versions of the Encyclopedie from ARTFL and ENCCRE, we examined 15,278 geographical entries, manually identifying 4,798 containing coordinates, and 10,480 with descriptive but non-numerical references. Leveraging our gold standard annotations, we trained transformer-based models to retrieve and normalize coordinates. The pipeline presented here combines a classifier to identify coordinate-bearing entries and a second model for retrieval, tested across encoder-decoder and decoder architectures. Cross-validation yielded an 86% EM score. On an out-of-domain eighteenth-century Trevoux dictionary (also in French), our fine-tuned model had a 61% EM score, while for the nineteenth-century, 7th edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica in English, the EM was 77%. These findings highlight the gold standard dataset's usefulness as training data, and our two-step method's cross-lingual, cross-domain generalizability.

Abstract: Memory systems address the challenge of context loss in Large Language Model during prolonged interactions. However, compared to human cognition, the efficacy of these systems in processing emotion-related information remains inconclusive. To address this gap, we propose an emotion-enhanced memory evaluation benchmark to assess the performance of mainstream and state-of-the-art memory systems in handling affective information. We developed the \textbf{H}uman-\textbf{L}ike \textbf{M}emory \textbf{E}motion (\textbf{HLME}) dataset, which evaluates memory systems across three dimensions: emotional information extraction, emotional memory updating, and emotional memory question answering. Experimental results indicate that none of the evaluated systems achieve robust performance across all three tasks. Our findings provide an objective perspective on the current deficiencies of memory systems in processing emotional memories and suggest a new trajectory for future research and system optimization.

Abstract: Spanish is the official language of twenty-one countries and is spoken by over 441 million people. Naturally, there are many variations in how Spanish is spoken across these countries. Media platforms such as YouTube rely on automatic speech recognition systems to make their content accessible to different groups of users. However, YouTube offers only one option for automatically generating captions in Spanish. This raises the question: could this captioning system be biased against certain Spanish dialects? This study examines the potential biases in YouTube's automatic captioning system by analyzing its performance across various Spanish dialects. By comparing the quality of captions for female and male speakers from different regions, we identify systematic disparities which can be attributed to specific dialects. Our study provides further evidence that algorithmic technologies deployed on digital platforms need to be calibrated to the diverse needs and experiences of their user populations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities have fueled a compelling narrative that reasoning universally improves performance across language tasks. We test this claim through a comprehensive evaluation of 504 configurations across seven model families--including adaptive, conditional, and reinforcement learning-based reasoning architectures--on sentiment analysis datasets of varying granularity (binary, five-class, and 27-class emotion). Our findings reveal that reasoning effectiveness is strongly task-dependent, challenging prevailing assumptions: (1) Reasoning shows task-complexity dependence--binary classification degrades up to -19.9 F1 percentage points (pp), while 27-class emotion recognition gains up to +16.0pp; (2) Distilled reasoning variants underperform base models by 3-18 pp on simpler tasks, though few-shot prompting enables partial recovery; (3) Few-shot learning improves over zero-shot in most cases regardless of model type, with gains varying by architecture and task complexity; (4) Pareto frontier analysis shows base models dominate efficiency-performance trade-offs, with reasoning justified only for complex emotion recognition despite 2.1x-54x computational overhead. We complement these quantitative findings with qualitative error analysis revealing that reasoning degrades simpler tasks through systematic over-deliberation, offering mechanistic insight beyond the high-level overthinking hypothesis.

Abstract: Resource-efficient training optimization techniques are becoming increasingly important as the size of large language models (LLMs) continues to grow. In particular, batch packing is commonly used in pre-training and supervised fine-tuning to achieve resource-efficient training. We propose preference packing, a method to enhance resource efficiency in training techniques that use data with different responses for the same input prompt, such as reward models or Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Preference packing improves resource efficiency by reducing the attention operations for duplicate input prompts and decreasing KV cache memory usage. We conducted experiments on text-only datasets and image-included datasets and achieved at least 37% reduction in training time. Notably, this method can be applied alongside existing optimization techniques such as batch sorting, resulting in a 3.22x speedup.

Abstract: Can narratives make arguments more persuasive? And to this end, which narrative features matter most? Although stories are often seen as powerful tools for persuasion, their specific role in online, unstructured argumentation remains underexplored. To address this gap, we present ARGUS, a framework for studying the impact of narration on persuasion in argumentative discourse. ARGUS introduces a new ChangeMyView corpus annotated for story presence and six key narrative features, integrating insights from two established theoretical frameworks that capture both textual narrative features and their effects on recipients. Leveraging both encoder-based classifiers and zero-shot large language models (LLMs), ARGUS identifies stories and narrative features and applies them at scale to examine how different narrative dimensions influence persuasion success in online argumentation.

Abstract: This study presents the first systematic, reference-free human evaluation of large language model (LLM) machine translation (MT) for Ancient Greek (AG) technical prose. We evaluate translations by three commercial LLMs (Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT) of twenty paragraph-length passages from two works by the Greek physician Galen of Pergamum (ca. 129-216 CE): On Mixtures, which has two published English translations, and On the Composition of Drugs according to Kinds, which has never been fully translated into English. We assess translation quality using both standard automated evaluation metrics (BLEU, chrF++, METEOR, ROUGE-L, BERTScore, COMET, BLEURT) and expert human evaluation via a modified Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) framework applied to all 60 translations by a team of domain specialists. On the previously translated expository text, LLMs achieved high translation quality (mean MQM score 95.2/100), with performance approaching expert level. On the untranslated pharmacological text, aggregate quality was lower (79.9/100) but with high variance driven by two passages presenting extreme terminological density; excluding these, scores converged to within 4 points of the translated text. Terminology rarity, operationalized via corpus frequency in the literary Diorisis Ancient Greek Corpus, emerged as a strong predictor of translation failure (r = -.97 for passage-level quality on the untranslated text). Automated metrics showed moderate correlation with human judgment overall on the text with a wide quality spread (Composition), but no metric discriminated among high-quality translations. We discuss implications for the use of LLMs in Classical scholarship and for the design of automated evaluation pipelines for low-resource ancient languages.

Abstract: Mobile Agents can autonomously execute user instructions, which requires hybrid-capabilities reasoning, including screen summary, subtask planning, action decision and action function. However, existing agents struggle to achieve both decoupled enhancement and balanced integration of these capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose Channel-of-Mobile-Experts (CoME), a novel agent architecture consisting of four distinct experts, each aligned with a specific reasoning stage, CoME activates the corresponding expert to generate output tokens in each reasoning stage via output-oriented activation. To empower CoME with hybrid-capabilities reasoning, we introduce a progressive training strategy: Expert-FT enables decoupling and enhancement of different experts' capability; Router-FT aligns expert activation with the different reasoning stage; CoT-FT facilitates seamless collaboration and balanced optimization across multiple capabilities. To mitigate error propagation in hybrid-capabilities reasoning, we propose InfoGain-Driven DPO (Info-DPO), which uses information gain to evaluate the contribution of each intermediate step, thereby guiding CoME toward more informative reasoning. Comprehensive experiments show that CoME outperforms dense mobile agents and MoE methods on both AITZ and AMEX datasets.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to large language models for task-specific applications. However, they are often employed in high-volume, low-latency settings, where efficiency is crucial. We propose TASC, Task-Adaptive Sequence Compression, a framework for SLM acceleration comprising two use-cases: When performing SLM fine-tuning, we propose TASC-ft, which iteratively enriches the tokenizer vocabulary with high-frequency output n-grams and then fine-tunes the model to utilize the expanded vocabulary. Next, we propose an inference-time method, termed TASC-spec. TASC-spec is a lightweight, training-free speculative decoding method that constructs an n-gram draft model from the task's output corpus, mixing task and context n-gram information.TASC-spec avoids any additional training, while bypassing draft-target vocabulary alignment constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of both methods across multiple low output-variability generation tasks. Our methods show consistent improvements in inference efficiency while maintaining task performance.

Abstract: We present a scalable methodology for evaluating language models in multi-turn interactions, using a suite of collaborative games that require effective communication about private information. This enables an interactive scaling analysis, in which a fixed token budget is divided over a variable number of turns. We find that in many cases, language models are unable to use interactive collaboration to improve over the non-interactive baseline scenario in which one agent attempts to summarize its information and the other agent immediately acts -- despite substantial headroom. This suggests that state-of-the-art models still suffer from significant weaknesses in planning and executing multi-turn collaborative conversations. We analyze the linguistic features of these dialogues, assessing the roles of sycophancy, information density, and discourse coherence. While there is no single linguistic explanation for the collaborative weaknesses of contemporary language models, we note that humans achieve comparable task success at superior token efficiency by producing dialogues that are more coherent than those produced by most language models. The proactive management of private information is a defining feature of real-world communication, and we hope that MT-PingEval will drive further work towards improving this capability.

Abstract: AI agents powered by reasoning models require access to sensitive user data. However, their reasoning traces are difficult to control, which can result in the unintended leakage of private information to external parties. We propose training models to follow instructions not only in the final answer, but also in reasoning traces, potentially under different constraints. We hypothesize that improving their instruction following abilities in the reasoning traces can improve their privacy-preservation skills. To demonstrate this, we fine-tune models on a new instruction-following dataset with explicit restrictions on reasoning traces. We further introduce a generation strategy that decouples reasoning and answer generation using separate LoRA adapters. We evaluate our approach on six models from two model families, ranging from 1.7B to 14B parameters, across two instruction-following benchmarks and two privacy benchmarks. Our method yields substantial improvements, achieving gains of up to 20.9 points in instruction-following performance and up to 51.9 percentage points on privacy benchmarks. These improvements, however, can come at the cost of task utility, due to the trade-off between reasoning performance and instruction-following abilities. Overall, our results show that improving instruction-following behavior in reasoning models can significantly enhance privacy, suggesting a promising direction for the development of future privacy-aware agents.

Abstract: Multi-turn interactions with large language models typically retain the assistant's own past responses in the conversation history. In this work, we revisit this design choice by asking whether large language models benefit from conditioning on their own prior responses. Using in-the-wild, multi-turn conversations, we compare standard (full-context) prompting with a user-turn-only prompting approach that omits all previous assistant responses, across three open reasoning models and one state-of-the-art model. To our surprise, we find that removing prior assistant responses does not affect response quality on a large fraction of turns. Omitting assistant-side history can reduce cumulative context lengths by up to 10x. To explain this result, we find that multi-turn conversations consist of a substantial proportion (36.4%) of self-contained prompts, and that many follow-up prompts provide sufficient instruction to be answered using only the current user turn and prior user turns. When analyzing cases where user-turn-only prompting substantially outperforms full context, we identify instances of context pollution, in which models over-condition on their previous responses, introducing errors, hallucinations, or stylistic artifacts that propagate across turns. Motivated by these findings, we design a context-filtering approach that selectively omits assistant-side context. Our findings suggest that selectively omitting assistant history can improve response quality while reducing memory consumption.

Abstract: Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers contain a collection of thousands of open-source standardized tools, linking LLMs to external systems; however, existing datasets and benchmarks lack realistic, human-like user queries, remaining a critical gap in evaluating the tool usage and ecosystems of MCP servers. Existing datasets often do contain tool descriptions but fail to represent how different users portray their requests, leading to poor generalization and inflated reliability of certain benchmarks. This paper introduces the first large-scale MCP dataset featuring diverse, high-quality diverse user queries generated specifically to match 2800 tools across 308 MCP servers, developing on the MCP Zero dataset. Each tool is paired with multiple unique user personas that we have generated, to capture varying levels of user intent ranging from precise task requests, and ambiguous, exploratory commands, reflecting the complexity of real-world interaction patterns.

Abstract: Adverse media screening is a critical component of anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) compliance processes in financial institutions. Traditional approaches rely on keyword-based searches that generate high false-positive rates or require extensive manual review. We present an agentic system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to automate adverse media screening. Our system implements a multi-step approach where an LLM agent searches the web, retrieves and processes relevant documents, and computes an Adverse Media Index (AMI) score for each subject. We evaluate our approach using multiple LLM backends on a dataset comprising Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs), persons from regulatory watchlists, and sanctioned persons from OpenSanctions and clean names from academic sources, demonstrating the system's ability to distinguish between high-risk and low-risk individuals.

Abstract: Previous work establishing completeness results for $\textit{counterfactual identification}$ has been circumscribed to the setting where the input data belongs to observational or interventional distributions (Layers 1 and 2 of Pearl's Causal Hierarchy), since it was generally presumed impossible to obtain data from counterfactual distributions, which belong to Layer 3. However, recent work (Raghavan & Bareinboim, 2025) has formally characterized a family of counterfactual distributions which can be directly estimated via experimental methods - a notion they call $\textit{counterfactual realizabilty}$. This leaves open the question of what $\textit{additional}$ counterfactual quantities now become identifiable, given this new access to (some) Layer 3 data. To answer this question, we develop the CTFIDU+ algorithm for identifying counterfactual queries from an arbitrary set of Layer 3 distributions, and prove that it is complete for this task. Building on this, we establish the theoretical limit of which counterfactuals can be identified from physically realizable distributions, thus implying the $\textit{fundamental limit to exact causal inference in the non-parametric setting}$. Finally, given the impossibility of identifying certain critical types of counterfactuals, we derive novel analytic bounds for such quantities using realizable counterfactual data, and corroborate using simulations that counterfactual data helps tighten the bounds for non-identifiable quantities in practice.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In the real world, planning is often challenged by distribution shifts. As such, a model of the environment obtained under one set of conditions may no longer remain valid as the distribution of states or the environment dynamics change, which in turn causes previously learned strategies to fail. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework for planning under partial observability using Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) formulated using causal knowledge. By representing shifts in the environment as interventions on this causal POMDP, the framework enables evaluating plans under hypothesized changes and actively identifying which components of the environment have been altered. We show how to maintain and update a belief over both the latent state and the underlying domain, and we prove that the value function remains piecewise linear and convex (PWLC) in this augmented belief space. Preservation of PWLC under distribution shifts has the advantage of maintaining the tractability of planning via $α$-vector-based POMDP methods.

Abstract: The Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (mTSP) extends the Traveling Salesman Problem to m tours that start and end at a common depot and jointly visit all customers exactly once. In the min-max variant, the objective is to minimize the longest tour, reflecting workload balance. We propose a hybrid approach, Construct, Merge, Solve & Adapt with Reinforcement Learning (RL-CMSA), for the symmetric single-depot min-max mTSP. The method iteratively constructs diverse solutions using probabilistic clustering guided by learned pairwise q-values, merges routes into a compact pool, solves a restricted set-covering MILP, and refines solutions via inter-route remove, shift, and swap moves. The q-values are updated by reinforcing city-pair co-occurrences in high-quality solutions, while the pool is adapted through ageing and pruning. This combination of exact optimization and reinforcement-guided construction balances exploration and exploitation. Computational results on random and TSPLIB instances show that RL-CMSA consistently finds (near-)best solutions and outperforms a state-of-the-art hybrid genetic algorithm under comparable time limits, especially as instance size and the number of salesmen increase.

Abstract: We present SleepLM, a family of sleep-language foundation models that enable human sleep alignment, interpretation, and interaction with natural language. Despite the critical role of sleep, learning-based sleep analysis systems operate in closed label spaces (e.g., predefined stages or events) and fail to describe, query, or generalize to novel sleep phenomena. SleepLM bridges natural language and multimodal polysomnography, enabling language-grounded representations of sleep physiology. To support this alignment, we introduce a multilevel sleep caption generation pipeline that enables the curation of the first large-scale sleep-text dataset, comprising over 100K hours of data from more than 10,000 individuals. Furthermore, we present a unified pretraining objective that combines contrastive alignment, caption generation, and signal reconstruction to better capture physiological fidelity and cross-modal interactions. Extensive experiments on real-world sleep understanding tasks verify that SleepLM outperforms state-of-the-art in zero-shot and few-shot learning, cross-modal retrieval, and sleep captioning. Importantly, SleepLM also exhibits intriguing capabilities including language-guided event localization, targeted insight generation, and zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks. All code and data will be open-sourced.

Abstract: Synthesizing high-quality training data is crucial for enhancing domain models' reasoning abilities. Existing methods face limitations in long-tail knowledge coverage, effectiveness verification, and interpretability. Knowledge-graph-based approaches still fall short in functionality, granularity, customizability, and evaluation. To address these issues, we propose MMKG-RDS, a flexible framework for reasoning data synthesis that leverages multimodal knowledge graphs. It supports fine-grained knowledge extraction, customizable path sampling, and multidimensional data quality scoring. We validate MMKG-RDS with the MMKG-RDS-Bench dataset, covering five domains, 17 task types, and 14,950 samples. Experimental results show fine-tuning Qwen3 models (0.6B/8B/32B) on a small number of synthesized samples improves reasoning accuracy by 9.2%. The framework also generates distinct data, challenging existing models on tasks involving tables and formulas, useful for complex benchmark construction.

Abstract: Everyone from AI executives and researchers to doomsayers, politicians, and activists is talking about Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Yet, they often don't seem to agree on its exact definition. One common definition of AGI is an AI that can do everything a human can do, but are humans truly general? In this paper, we address what's wrong with our conception of AGI, and why, even in its most coherent formulation, it is a flawed concept to describe the future of AI. We explore whether the most widely accepted definitions are plausible, useful, and truly general. We argue that AI must embrace specialization, rather than strive for generality, and in its specialization strive for superhuman performance, and introduce Superhuman Adaptable Intelligence (SAI). SAI is defined as intelligence that can learn to exceed humans at anything important that we can do, and that can fill in the skill gaps where humans are incapable. We then lay out how SAI can help hone a discussion around AI that was blurred by an overloaded definition of AGI, and extrapolate the implications of using it as a guide for the future.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents typically rely on reactive decision-making paradigms such as ReAct, selecting actions conditioned on growing execution histories. While effective for short tasks, these approaches often lead to redundant tool usage, unstable reasoning, and high token consumption in complex long-horizon tasks involving branching, iteration, or multi-tool coordination. To address these limitations, this paper introduces PseudoAct, a novel framework for flexible planning and action control in LLM agents through pseudocode synthesis. Leveraging the ability of LLMs to express task-solving strategies as code, PseudoAct synthesizes a structured pseudocode plan that decomposes a task into subtasks and explicitly encodes control flow, including sequencing, conditionals, loops, parallel composition, and combinations of these logic primitives. Actions are then executed by following this global plan, making the decision logic explicit and temporally coherent. This design reduces redundant actions, prevents infinite loops, and avoids uninformative alternative exploration, enabling consistent and efficient long-horizon decision-making. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method significantly outperforms existing reactive agent approaches, achieving a 20.93% absolute gain in success rate on FEVER and setting a new state-of-the-art on HotpotQA.

Abstract: The paradigm of large language model (LLM) reasoning is shifting from parameter scaling to test-time compute scaling, yet many existing approaches still rely on uniform brute-force sampling (for example, fixed best-of-N or self-consistency) that is costly, hard to attribute, and can trigger overthinking with diminishing returns. We propose ODAR-Expert, an adaptive routing framework that optimizes the accuracy-efficiency trade-off via principled resource allocation. ODAR uses a difficulty estimator grounded in amortized active inference to dynamically route queries between a heuristic Fast Agent and a deliberative Slow Agent. We further introduce a free-energy-principled, risk-sensitive fusion mechanism that selects answers by minimizing a variational free energy objective, balancing log-likelihood with epistemic uncertainty (varentropy) as a principled alternative to ad hoc voting over heterogeneous candidates. Extensive evaluation across 23 benchmarks shows strong and consistent gains, including 98.2% accuracy on MATH and 54.8% on Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), while improving the compute-accuracy frontier under compute-matched settings. We also validate reproducibility on a fully open-source stack (Llama 4 + DeepSeek), where ODAR surpasses homogeneous sampling strategies while reducing computational costs by 82%. Overall, our results suggest that thinking-optimal scaling requires adaptive resource allocation with free-energy-based decision-making rather than simply increasing test-time compute.

Abstract: LLM-powered Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex domains but suffer from inherent fragility and opaque failure mechanisms. Existing failure attribution methods, whether relying on direct prompting, costly replays, or supervised fine-tuning, typically treat execution logs as flat sequences. This linear perspective fails to disentangle the intricate causal links inherent to MAS, leading to weak observability and ambiguous responsibility boundaries. To address these challenges, we propose CHIEF, a novel framework that transforms chaotic trajectories into a structured hierarchical causal graph. It then employs hierarchical oracle-guided backtracking to efficiently prune the search space via sybthesized virtual oracles. Finally, it implements counterfactual attribution via a progressive causal screening strategy to rigorously distinguish true root causes from propagated symptoms. Experiments on Who&When benchmark show that CHIEF outperforms eight strong and state-of-the-art baselines on both agent- and step-level accuracy. Ablation studies further confirm the critical role of each proposed module.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents show promise for e-commerce conversational shopping, yet existing implementations lack the interaction depth and contextual breadth required for complex product research. Meanwhile, the Deep Research paradigm, despite advancing information synthesis in web search, suffers from domain gaps when transferred to e-commerce. We propose ProductResearch, a multi-agent framework that synthesizes high-fidelity, long-horizon tool-use trajectories for training robust e-commerce shopping agents. The framework employs a User Agent to infer nuanced shopping intents from behavioral histories, and a Supervisor Agent that orchestrates iterative collaboration with a Research Agent to generate synthetic trajectories culminating in comprehensive, insightful product research reports. These trajectories are rigorously filtered and distilled through a reflective internalization process that consolidates multi-agent supervisory interactions into coherent single-role training examples, enabling effective fine-tuning of LLM agents for complex shopping inquiries. Extensive experiments show that a compact MoE model fine-tuned on our synthetic data achieves substantial improvements over its base model in response comprehensiveness, research depth, and user-perceived utility, approaching the performance of frontier proprietary deep research systems and establishing multi-agent synthetic trajectory training as an effective and scalable paradigm for enhancing LLM-based shopping assistance.

Abstract: The field of Artificial Intelligence is undergoing a transition from Generative AI -- probabilistic generation of text and images -- to Agentic AI, in which autonomous systems execute actions within external environments on behalf of users. This transition exposes a fundamental architectural mismatch: Large Language Models (LLMs) produce stochastic, unstructured outputs, whereas the backend infrastructure they must control -- databases, APIs, cloud services -- requires deterministic, schema-conformant inputs. The present paper describes the Auton Agentic AI Framework, a principled architecture for standardizing the creation, execution, and governance of autonomous agent systems. The framework is organized around a strict separation between the Cognitive Blueprint, a declarative, language-agnostic specification of agent identity and capabilities, and the Runtime Engine, the platform-specific execution substrate that instantiates and runs the agent. This separation enables cross-language portability, formal auditability, and modular tool integration via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The paper formalizes the agent execution model as an augmented Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) with a latent reasoning space, introduces a hierarchical memory consolidation architecture inspired by biological episodic memory systems, defines a constraint manifold formalism for safety enforcement via policy projection rather than post-hoc filtering, presents a three-level self-evolution framework spanning in-context adaptation through reinforcement learning, and describes runtime optimizations -- including parallel graph execution, speculative inference, and dynamic context pruning -- that reduce end-to-end latency for multi-step agent workflows.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) pursue omni-perception capabilities, yet integrating robust sensory grounding with complex reasoning remains a challenge, particularly for underrepresented regions. In this report, we introduce the research preview of MERaLiON2-Omni (Alpha), a 10B-parameter multilingual omni-perception tailored for Southeast Asia (SEA). We present a progressive training pipeline that explicitly decouples and then integrates "System 1" (Perception) and "System 2" (Reasoning) capabilities. First, we establish a robust Perception Backbone by aligning region-specific audio-visual cues (e.g., Singlish code-switching, local cultural landmarks) with a multilingual LLM through orthogonal modality adaptation. Second, to inject cognitive capabilities without large-scale supervision, we propose a cost-effective Generate-Judge-Refine pipeline. By utilizing a Super-LLM to filter hallucinations and resolve conflicts via a consensus mechanism, we synthesize high-quality silver data that transfers textual Chain-of-Thought reasoning to multimodal scenarios.
  Comprehensive evaluation on our newly introduced SEA-Omni Benchmark Suite reveals an Efficiency-Stability Paradox: while reasoning acts as a non-linear amplifier for abstract tasks (boosting mathematical and instruction-following performance significantly), it introduces instability in low-level sensory processing. Specifically, we identify Temporal Drift in long-context audio, where extended reasoning desynchronizes the model from acoustic timestamps, and Visual Over-interpretation, where logic overrides pixel-level reality. This report details the architecture, the data-efficient training recipe, and a diagnostic analysis of the trade-offs between robust perception and structured reasoning.

Abstract: This paper addresses the domain generalization (DG) problem in deep learning. While most DG methods focus on enforcing visual feature invariance, we leverage the reasoning capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and explore the potential of constructing reasoning chains that derives image categories to achieve more robust predictions under domain shift. To this end, we systematically study the role of reasoning in DG using DomainBed-Reasoning, a newly constructed extension of DomainBed dataset, in which each sample is paired with class-relevant reasoning chains. Our analysis reveals two key challenges: (i) fine-tuning MLLMs with reasoning chains for classification is more challenging than direct label supervision, since the model must optimize complex reasoning sequences before label prediction; and (ii) mismatches in reasoning patterns between supervision signals and fine-tuned MLLMs lead to a trade-off between semantic richness (informative but harder to optimize) and optimization efficiency (easier to optimize but less informative). To address these issues, we propose RD-MLDG (Reasoning-Driven Multimodal LLM for Domain Generalization), a framework with two components: (i) MTCT (Multi-Task Cross-Training), which introduces an additional direct classification pathway to guide reasoning supervision; and (ii) SARR (Self-Aligned Reasoning Regularization), which preserves the semantic richness of reasoning chains while mitigating reasoning-pattern mismatches via iterative self-labeling. Experiments on standard DomainBed datasets (PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, TerraInc) demonstrate that RD-MLDG achieves state-of-the-art performances, highlighting reasoning as a promising complementary signal for robust out-of-domain generalization.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable progress in visual reasoning and understanding tasks but still struggle to capture the complexity and subjectivity of human emotions. Existing approaches based on supervised fine-tuning often suffer from limited generalization and poor interpretability, while reinforcement learning methods such as Group Relative Policy Optimization fail to align with the intrinsic characteristics of emotional cognition. To address these challenges, we propose Reflective Reinforcement Learning for Emotional Reasoning (EMO-R3), a framework designed to enhance the emotional reasoning ability of MLLMs. Specifically, we introduce Structured Emotional Thinking to guide the model to perform step-by-step emotional reasoning in a structured and interpretable manner, and design a Reflective Emotional Reward that enables the model to re-evaluate its reasoning based on visual-text consistency and emotional coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EMO-R3 significantly improves both the interpretability and emotional intelligence of MLLMs, achieving superior performance across multiple visual emotional understanding benchmarks.

Abstract: Designing efficient reward functions for low-level control tasks is a challenging problem. Recent research aims to reduce reliance on expert experience by using Large Language Models (LLMs) with task information to generate dense reward functions. These methods typically rely on training results as feedback, iteratively generating new reward functions with greedy or evolutionary algorithms. However, they suffer from poor utilization of historical feedback and inefficient search, resulting in limited improvements in complex control tasks. To address this challenge, we propose RF-Agent, a framework that treats LLMs as language agents and frames reward function design as a sequential decision-making process, enhancing optimization through better contextual reasoning. RF-Agent integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to manage the reward design and optimization process, leveraging the multi-stage contextual reasoning ability of LLMs. This approach better utilizes historical information and improves search efficiency to identify promising reward functions. Outstanding experimental results in 17 diverse low-level control tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The source code is available at https://github.com/deng-ai-lab/RF-Agent.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning aims to learn an agent from pre-collected datasets, avoiding unsafe and inefficient real-time interaction. However, inevitable access to out-ofdistribution actions during the learning process introduces approximation errors, causing the error accumulation and considerable overestimation. In this paper, we construct a new pessimistic auxiliary policy for sampling reliable actions. Specifically, we develop a pessimistic auxiliary strategy by maximizing the lower confidence bound of the Q-function. The pessimistic auxiliary strategy exhibits a relatively high value and low uncertainty in the vicinity of the learned policy, avoiding the learned policy sampling high-value actions with potentially high errors during the learning process. Less approximation error introduced by sampled action from pessimistic auxiliary strategy leads to the alleviation of error accumulation. Extensive experiments on offline reinforcement learning benchmarks reveal that utilizing the pessimistic auxiliary strategy can effectively improve the efficacy of other offline RL approaches.

Abstract: Market regime shifts induce distribution shifts that can degrade the performance of portfolio rebalancing policies. We propose macro-conditioned scenario-context rollout (SCR) that generates plausible next-day multivariate return scenarios under stress events. However, doing so faces new challenges, as history will never tell what would have happened differently. As a result, incorporating scenario-based rewards from rollouts introduces a reward--transition mismatch in temporal-difference learning, destabilizing RL critic training.
  We analyze this inconsistency and show it leads to a mixed evaluation target. Guided by this analysis, we construct a counterfactual next state using the rollout-implied continuations and augment the critic agent's bootstrap target. Doing so stabilizes the learning and provides a viable bias-variance tradeoff.
  In out-of-sample evaluations across 31 distinct universes of U.S. equity and ETF portfolios, our method improves Sharpe ratio by up to 76% and reduces maximum drawdown by up to 53% compared with classic and RL-based portfolio rebalancing baselines.

Abstract: This paper proposes CIRCLE, a six-stage, lifecycle-based framework to bridge the reality gap between model-centric performance metrics and AI's materialized outcomes in deployment. While existing frameworks like MLOps focus on system stability and benchmarks measure abstract capabilities, decision-makers outside the AI stack lack systematic evidence about the behavior of AI technologies under real-world user variability and constraints. CIRCLE operationalizes the Validation phase of TEVV (Test, Evaluation, Verification, and Validation) by formalizing the translation of stakeholder concerns outside the stack into measurable signals. Unlike participatory design, which often remains localized, or algorithmic audits, which are often retrospective, CIRCLE provides a structured, prospective protocol for linking context-sensitive qualitative insights to scalable quantitative metrics. By integrating methods such as field testing, red teaming, and longitudinal studies into a coordinated pipeline, CIRCLE produces systematic knowledge: evidence that is comparable across sites yet sensitive to local context. This can enable governance based on materialized downstream effects rather than theoretical capabilities.

Abstract: The pursuit of human-like conversational agents has long been guided by the Turing test. For modern speech-to-speech (S2S) systems, a critical yet unanswered question is whether they can converse like humans. To tackle this, we conduct the first Turing test for S2S systems, collecting 2,968 human judgments on dialogues between 9 state-of-the-art S2S systems and 28 human participants. Our results deliver a clear finding: no existing evaluated S2S system passes the test, revealing a significant gap in human-likeness. To diagnose this failure, we develop a fine-grained taxonomy of 18 human-likeness dimensions and crowd-annotate our collected dialogues accordingly. Our analysis shows that the bottleneck is not semantic understanding but stems from paralinguistic features, emotional expressivity, and conversational persona. Furthermore, we find that off-the-shelf AI models perform unreliably as Turing test judges. In response, we propose an interpretable model that leverages the fine-grained human-likeness ratings and delivers accurate and transparent human-vs-machine discrimination, offering a powerful tool for automatic human-likeness evaluation. Our work establishes the first human-likeness evaluation for S2S systems and moves beyond binary outcomes to enable detailed diagnostic insights, paving the way for human-like improvements in conversational AI systems.

Abstract: Winter road maintenance is critical for ensuring public safety and reducing environmental impacts, yet existing methods struggle to manage large-scale routing problems effectively and mostly reply on human decision. This study presents a novel, scalable bi-level optimization framework, validated on real operational data on UK strategic road networks (M25, M6, A1), including interconnected local road networks in surrounding areas for vehicle traversing, as part of the highway operator's efforts to solve existing planning challenges. At the upper level, a reinforcement learning (RL) agent strategically partitions the road network into manageable clusters and optimally allocates resources from multiple depots. At the lower level, a multi-objective vehicle routing problem (VRP) is solved within each cluster, minimizing the maximum vehicle travel time and total carbon emissions. Unlike existing approaches, our method handles large-scale, real-world networks efficiently, explicitly incorporating vehicle-specific constraints, depot capacities, and road segment requirements. Results demonstrate significant improvements, including balanced workloads, reduced maximum travel times below the targeted two-hour threshold, lower emissions, and substantial cost savings. This study illustrates how advanced AI-driven bi-level optimization can directly enhance operational decision-making in real-world transportation and logistics.

Abstract: This paper presents the Artificial Agency Program (AAP), a position and research agenda for building AI systems as reality embedded, resource-bounded agents whose development is driven by curiosity-as-learning-progress under physical and computational constraints. The central thesis is that AI is most useful when treated as part of an extended human--tool system that increases sensing, understanding, and actuation capability while reducing friction at the interface between people, tools, and environments. The agenda unifies predictive compression, intrinsic motivation, empowerment and control, interface quality (unification), and language/self-communication as selective information bottlenecks. We formulate these ideas as a falsifiable program with explicit costs, staged experiments, and a concrete multimodal tokenized testbed in which an agent allocates limited budget among observation, action, and deliberation. The aim is to provide a conceptual and experimental framework that connects intrinsic motivation, information theory, thermodynamics, bounded rationality, and modern reasoning systems

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the complex reasoning capabilities of Large Reasoning Models. However, standard outcome-based supervision suffers from a critical limitation that penalizes trajectories that are largely correct but fail due to several missteps as heavily as completely erroneous ones. This coarse feedback signal causes the model to discard valuable largely correct rollouts, leading to a degradation in rollout diversity that prematurely narrows the exploration space. Process Reward Models have demonstrated efficacy in providing reliable step-wise verification for test-time scaling, naively integrating these signals into RLVR as dense rewards proves ineffective.Prior methods attempt to introduce off-policy guided whole-trajectory replacement that often outside the policy model's distribution, but still fail to utilize the largely correct rollouts generated by the model itself and thus do not effectively mitigate the narrowing of the exploration space. To address these issues, we propose SCOPE (Step-wise Correction for On-Policy Exploration), a novel framework that utilizes Process Reward Models to pinpoint the first erroneous step in suboptimal rollouts and applies fine-grained, step-wise off-policy rectification. By applying precise refinement on partially correct rollout, our method effectively salvages partially correct trajectories and increases diversity score by 13.5%, thereby sustaining a broad exploration space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach establishes new state-of-the-art results, achieving an average accuracy of 46.6% on math reasoning and exhibiting robust generalization with 53.4% accuracy on out-of-distribution reasoning tasks.

Abstract: We present a new approach for benchmarking Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities on research-level mathematics. Existing benchmarks largely rely on static, hand-curated sets of contest or textbook-style problems as proxies for mathematical research. Instead, we establish an updatable benchmark evaluating models directly on the latest research results in mathematics. This consists of an automatic pipeline that extracts lemmas from arXiv and rewrites them into self-contained statements by making all assumptions and required definitions explicit. It results in a benchmark that can be updated regularly with new problems taken directly from human mathematical research, while previous instances can be used for training without compromising future evaluations. We benchmark current state-of-the-art LLMs, which obtain around 10-15$\%$ accuracy in theorem proving (pass@1) depending on the model, showing that there is currently a large margin of progression for LLMs to reach human-level proving capabilities in a research context.

Abstract: Despite their capabilities, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) may produce plausible but erroneous outputs, hindering reliable deployment. Accurate uncertainty metrics could enable escalation of unreliable queries to human experts or larger models for improved performance. However, existing uncertainty metrics have practical constraints, such as being designed only for specific modalities, reliant on external tools, or computationally expensive. We introduce UMPIRE, a training-free uncertainty quantification framework for MLLMs that works efficiently across various input and output modalities without external tools, relying only on the models' own internal modality features. UMPIRE computes the incoherence-adjusted semantic volume of sampled MLLM responses for a given task instance, effectively capturing both the global semantic diversity of samples and the local incoherence of responses based on internal model confidence. We propose uncertainty desiderata for MLLMs and provide theoretical analysis motivating UMPIRE's design. Extensive experiments show that UMPIRE consistently outperforms baseline metrics in error detection and uncertainty calibration across image, audio, and video-text benchmarks, including adversarial and out-of-distribution settings. We also demonstrate UMPIRE's generalization to non-text output tasks, including image and audio generation.

Abstract: The fast-growing demands in using Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle complex multi-step data science tasks create an emergent need for accurate benchmarking. There are two major gaps in existing benchmarks: (i) the lack of standardized, process-aware evaluation that captures instruction adherence and process fidelity, and (ii) the scarcity of accurately labeled training data. To bridge these gaps, we introduce DARE-bench, a benchmark designed for machine learning modeling and data science instruction following. Unlike many existing benchmarks that rely on human- or model-based judges, all tasks in DARE-bench have verifiable ground truth, ensuring objective and reproducible evaluation. To cover a broad range of tasks and support agentic tools, DARE-bench consists of 6,300 Kaggle-derived tasks and provides both large-scale training data and evaluation sets. Extensive evaluations show that even highly capable models such as gpt-o4-mini struggle to achieve good performance, especially in machine learning modeling tasks. Using DARE-bench training tasks for fine-tuning can substantially improve model performance. For example, supervised fine-tuning boosts Qwen3-32B's accuracy by 1.83x and reinforcement learning boosts Qwen3-4B's accuracy by more than 8x. These significant improvements verify the importance of DARE-bench both as an accurate evaluation benchmark and critical training data.
