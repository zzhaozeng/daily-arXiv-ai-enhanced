We present a secure, modular framework for automated structured feature extraction from clinical notes leveraging locally deployed large language models (LLMs) on institutionally approved, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA)-compliant compute infrastructure. This system integrates retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and structured response methods of LLMs into a widely deployable and scalable container to provide feature extraction for diverse clinical domains. In evaluation, the framework achieved high accuracy across multiple medical characteristics present in large bodies of patient notes when compared against an expert-annotated dataset and identified several annotation errors missed in manual review.

However, conventional construction methods demand extensive location-labeled data, which are costly and impractical in many real-world scenarios. This paper presents a blind radio map construction framework that infers user trajectories from indoor multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) channel measurements without relying on location labels. It first proves that channel state information (CSI) under non-line-of-sight (NLOS) exhibits spatial continuity under a quasi-specular environmental model, allowing the derivation of a CSI-distance metric that is proportional to the corresponding physical distance. For rectilinear trajectories in Poisson-distributed access point (AP) deployments, it is shown that the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) of localization error vanishes asymptotically, even under poor angular resolution. Building on these theoretical results, a spatially regularized Bayesian inference framework is developed that jointly estimates channel features, distinguishes line-of-sight (LOS)/NLOS conditions and recovers user trajectories. Experiments on a ray-tracing dataset demonstrate an average localization error of 0.68 m and a beam map reconstruction error of 3.3%, validating the effectiveness of the proposed blind mapping method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u76f2\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u5730\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7MIMO-OFDMA\u4fe1\u9053\u6d4b\u91cf\u63a8\u65ad\u7528\u6237\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u5730\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u4e14\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u975e\u89c6\u8ddd\uff08NLOS\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff08CSI\uff09\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u8ddd\u79bb\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684CSI\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\uff1b\u5728\u6cca\u677e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u63a5\u5165\u70b9\uff08AP\uff09\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a7a\u95f4\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f30\u8ba1\u4fe1\u9053\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u533a\u5206LOS/NLOS\u6761\u4ef6\u5e76\u6062\u590d\u7528\u6237\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5c04\u7ebf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a0.68\u7c73\uff0c\u6ce2\u675f\u5730\u56fe\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a3.3%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u76f2\u6620\u5c04\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u6ce2\u675f\u5730\u56fe\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This paper presents Adjudicator, a system that addresses the critical data mining challenge of automatically identifying and correcting label noise and has been validated for production deployment. Adjudicator models this as a neuro-symbolic task, first constructing a dynamic Knowledge Graph (KG) to unify item context. This KG then informs a \"Council of Agents,\" a novel multi-agent Large Language Model architecture where specialized agents debate and vote on a label's validity. We validate our system on a 1,000-item balanced subset of the AlleNoise benchmark. Our KG-informed model achieves a 0.99 F1-score, significantly outperforming a single-LLM baseline (0.48 F1) and a non-KG council (0.59 F1). Our analysis reveals this is due to a Precision, achieved by a novel override logic that uses the KG to perfectly identify complex, structural errors (complete Recall) -- a class of errors that baselines fail to find.

This paper presents an AI-based annotation pipeline that systematically identifies, labels, and fixes for instability patterns on LLM output. Our human-AI synergy method combines the models of automated weak supervision and confidence-based annotation with the target human validation to guarantee the reliability and moral uprightness of feedback information (Cabitza et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023). The semantic consistency, factual correctness, and logical coherence categories of stability-specific annotation are introduced into our framework, allowing the continuous calibration of models and the enhancement of their robustness based on the feedback loops (Honovich et al., 2021; Nan et al., 2021).", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The method introduces a candidate span generation mechanism and structured attention modeling to achieve unified modeling of entity boundaries, hierarchical relationships, and cross-dependencies. The model first uses a pretrained language model to obtain context-aware semantic representations, then captures multi-granular entity span features through candidate representation combinations, and introduces hierarchical structural constraints during decoding to ensure consistency between semantics and structure. To enhance stability in complex scenarios, the model jointly optimizes classification loss and structural consistency loss, maintaining high recognition accuracy under multi-entity co-occurrence and long-sentence dependency conditions. Experiments conducted on the ACE 2005 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, particularly in nested and overlapping entity recognition, where the model shows stronger boundary localization and structural modeling capability.

As AI systems expand into real-world applications, adapting to personalized values beyond task completion or collective alignment has become a critical challenge. We address this by proposing a value-driven approach to personalized decision-making. Human values serve as stable, transferable signals that support consistent and generalizable behavior across contexts. Compared to task-oriented paradigms driven by external rewards and incentives, value-driven decision-making enhances interpretability and enables agents to act appropriately even in novel scenarios. We introduce ValuePilot, a two-phase framework consisting of a dataset generation toolkit (DGT) and a decision-making module (DMM). DGT constructs diverse, value-annotated scenarios from a human-LLM collaborative pipeline. DMM learns to evaluate actions based on personal value preferences, enabling context-sensitive, individualized decisions. When evaluated on previously unseen scenarios, DMM outperforms strong LLM baselines, including GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, Gemini-2-flash, and Llama-3.1-70b, in aligning with human action choices.

Prior work introduces the concept of \"effective depth\", arguing that deeper models fail to fully utilize their layers for meaningful computation. Building on this, we systematically study how effective depth varies with model scale, training type, and task difficulty. First, we analyze the model behavior of Qwen-2.5 family (1.5B-32B) and find that while the number of effective layers grows with model size, the effective depth ratio remains stable. Besides, comparisons between base and corresponding long-CoT models show no increase in effective depth, suggesting that improved reasoning stems from longer context rather than deeper per-token computation. Furthermore, evaluations across tasks of varying difficulty indicate that models do not dynamically use more layers for harder problems. Our results suggest that current LLMs underuse available depth across scales, training paradigms and tasks of varying difficulties, pointing out research opportunities on increasing the layer utilization rate of LLMs, model pruning, and early exiting.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically evaluate quantization effects across all three levels of Pearls Causal Ladder. Using a 3000 sample stratified CLadder benchmark, we find that rung level accuracy in Llama 3 8B remains broadly stable under quantization, with NF4 showing less than one percent overall degradation. Interventional queries at rung 2 are the most sensitive to precision loss, whereas counterfactual reasoning at rung 3 is comparatively stable but exhibits heterogeneous weaknesses across query types such as collider bias and backdoor adjustment. Experiments on the CRASS benchmark show near identical performance across precisions, indicating that existing commonsense counterfactual datasets lack the structural sensitivity needed to reveal quantization induced reasoning drift. We further evaluate Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation using ground truth causal graphs and observe a consistent improvement in NF4 interventional accuracy of plus 1.7 percent, partially offsetting compression related degradation. These results suggest that causal reasoning is unexpectedly robust to four bit quantization, graph structured augmentation can selectively reinforce interventional reasoning, and current counterfactual benchmarks fail to capture deeper causal brittleness.

To this end, we study AR-to-dLM conversion to transform pretrained AR models into efficient dLMs that excel in speed while preserving AR models' task accuracy. We achieve this by identifying limitations in the attention patterns and objectives of existing AR-to-dLM methods and then proposing principles and methodologies for more effective AR-to-dLM conversion. Specifically, we first systematically compare different attention patterns and find that maintaining pretrained AR weight distributions is critical for effective AR-to-dLM conversion. As such, we introduce a continuous pretraining scheme with a block-wise attention pattern, which remains causal across blocks while enabling bidirectional modeling within each block. We find that this approach can better preserve pretrained AR models' weight distributions than fully bidirectional modeling, in addition to its known benefit of enabling KV caching, and leads to a win-win in accuracy and efficiency. Second, to mitigate the training-test gap in mask token distributions (uniform vs. highly left-to-right), we propose a position-dependent token masking strategy that assigns higher masking probabilities to later tokens during training to better mimic test-time behavior. Leveraging this framework, we conduct extensive studies of dLMs' attention patterns, training dynamics, and other design choices, providing actionable insights into scalable AR-to-dLM conversion. These studies lead to the Efficient-DLM family, which outperforms state-of-the-art AR models and dLMs, e.g., our Efficient-DLM 8B achieves +5.4%/+2.7% higher accuracy with 4.5x/2.7x higher throughput compared to Dream 7B and Qwen3 4B, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86AR-to-dLM\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u4ee5\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684AR\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548dLM\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u901f\u5ea6\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08dLMs\uff09\u867d\u7136\u652f\u6301\u5e76\u884c\u3001\u975e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e8e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\uff08AR\uff09\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7AR-to-dLM\u8f6c\u6362\u6765\u63d0\u5347dLMs\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51fa\u8fde\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\u4e0e\u5757\u7ea7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3AR\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u5e03\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51fa\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684token masking\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7f29\u5c0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "result": "Efficient-DLM\u5bb6\u65cf\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709AR\u6a21\u578b\u548cdLMs\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982Efficient-DLM 8B\u5728Dream 7B\u548cQwen3 4B\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0+5.4%/+2.7%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u548c4.5x/2.7x\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548AR-to-dLM\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Zero-shot transfer with two-language training remains limited, underscoring substantive cross-lingual differences.

We introduce the Semantic Grounding Index (SGI), defined as the ratio of angular distances from the response to the question versus the context on the unit hypersphere $\\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$.Our central finding is \\emph{semantic laziness}: hallucinated responses remain angularly proximate to questions rather than departing toward retrieved contexts. On HaluEval ($n$=5,000), we observe large effect sizes (Cohen's $d$ ranging from 0.92 to 1.28) across five embedding models with mean cross-model correlation $r$=0.85. Crucially, we derive from the spherical triangle inequality that SGI's discriminative power should increase with question-context angular separation $\u03b8(q,c)$-a theoretical prediction confirmed empirically: effect size rises monotonically from $d$=0.61 -low $\u03b8(q,c)$, to $d$=1.27 -high $\u03b8(q,c)$, with AUC improving from 0.72 to 0.83. Subgroup analysis reveals that SGI excels on long responses ($d$=2.05) and short questions ($d$=1.22), while remaining robust across context lengths.

Such methods discard useful variants, suffer from destructive edits, and explore a brittle search space prone to structural failure. We introduce EvoLattice, a framework that represents an entire population of candidate programs or agent behaviors within a single directed acyclic graph. Each node stores multiple persistent alternatives, and every valid path through the graph defines a distinct executable candidate, yielding a large combinatorial search space without duplicating structure. EvoLattice enables fine-grained alternative-level evaluation by scoring each alternative across all paths in which it appears, producing statistics that reveal how local design choices affect global performance. These statistics provide a dense, data-driven feedback signal for LLM-guided mutation, recombination, and pruning, while preserving successful components. Structural correctness is guaranteed by a deterministic self-repair mechanism that enforces acyclicity and dependency consistency independently of the LLM. EvoLattice naturally extends to agent evolution by interpreting alternatives as prompt fragments or sub-agent behaviors. Across program synthesis (proxy and optimizer meta-learning), EvoLattice yields more stable evolution, greater expressivity, and stronger improvement trajectories than prior LLM-guided methods. The resulting dynamics resemble quality-diversity optimization, emerging implicitly from EvoLattice's internal multi-alternative representation rather than an explicit external archive.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To this end, we propose MURIM, a MUlti-dimensional Reputation-based Incentive Mechanism that jointly considers client reliability, privacy, resource capacity, and fairness while preventing malicious or unreliable clients from earning undeserved rewards. MURIM allocates incentives based on client contribution, latency, and reputation, supported by a reliability verification module. Extensive experiments on MNIST, FMNIST, and ADULT Income datasets demonstrate that MURIM achieves up to 18% improvement in fairness metrics, reduces privacy attack success rates by 5-9%, and improves robustness against poisoning and noisy-gradient attacks by up to 85% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Georgiev, G${\u00f3}$mez-Serrano, Tao, and Wagner [GGSTW+25] demonstrate that AI systems can explore new constructions and improve existing bounds, illustrating the growing potential of LLMs to accelerate mathematical discovery. Similarly, Bubeck et al. [BCE+25] show that GPT-5 can meaningfully contribute to scientific workflows, from proposing hypotheses to generating proofs and analyses. Despite these advances, a rigorous evaluation of these models on canonical, graduate-level mathematical theory remains necessary to understand their baseline reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we present a comprehensive benchmark of four frontier models: GPT-5-Thinking, Gemini-3-Pro, Claude-Sonnet-4.5-Thinking, and Grok-4 against the classic curriculum of Randomized Algorithms by Motwani and Raghavan [MR95].\n  We tasked each model with generating formal LaTeX proofs for a series of lemmas and exercises spanning the textbook. We find that while the top-tier models (Gemini, and Claude) achieve a high accuracy rate (approx. 66%), demonstrating a robust grasp of probabilistic method and formal logic, other models lag significantly in consistency (approx. 40%). We provide a qualitative analysis of the generated proofs, highlighting differences in conciseness, hallucination rates, and logical structure.

We segment the model's reasoning into steps, identify the steps corresponding to reflection, and extract a reflection direction in the latent space that governs this behavior. Using this direction, we propose a stepwise steering method that can control reflection frequency. We call our framework ReflCtrl. Our experiments show that (1) in many cases reflections are redundant, especially in stronger models (in our experiments, we can save up to 33.6 percent of reasoning tokens while preserving performance), and (2) the model's reflection behavior is highly correlated with an internal uncertainty signal, implying self-reflection may be controlled by the model's uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8868\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a7\u5236\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u53cd\u601d\u9891\u7387\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u53cd\u601d\u884c\u4e3a\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u6b65\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u53cd\u601d\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u62bd\u53d6\u53cd\u5c04\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9010\u6b65\u63a7\u5236\u53cd\u601d\u9891\u7387\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5ReflCtrl\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u53cd\u601d\u5728\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u662f\u5197\u4f59\u7684\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8282\u7701\u9ad8\u8fbe33.6%\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6807\u8bb0\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53cd\u601d\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u5185\u90e8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u6697\u793a\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u53ef\u80fd\u7531\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u3002"}}

For this reason the corpora available for the learning of Large Language Models (LLMs) are virtually non-existent, posing a significant challenge. The goal is to produce a substantial number of syntactically valid artificial Nawatl sentences and thereby to expand the corpora for the purpose of learning non contextual embeddings. For this objective, we introduce two new Nawatl CFGs and use them in generative mode. Using these grammars, it is possible to expand Nawatl corpus significantly and subsequently to use it to learn embeddings and to evaluate their relevance in a sentences semantic similarity task.

However, the standard Top-k routing strategy imposes a uniform sparsity pattern that ignores the varying difficulty of tokens. While Top-p routing offers a flexible alternative, existing implementations typically rely on a fixed global probability threshold, which results in uncontrolled computational costs and sensitivity to hyperparameter selection. In this paper, we propose DTop-p MoE, a sparsity-controllable dynamic Top-p routing mechanism. To resolve the challenge of optimizing a non-differentiable threshold, we utilize a Proportional-Integral (PI) Controller that dynamically adjusts the probability threshold to align the running activated-expert sparsity with a specified target. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic routing normalization mechanism that adapts layer-wise routing logits, allowing different layers to learn distinct expert-selection patterns while utilizing a global probability threshold. Extensive experiments on Large Language Models and Diffusion Transformers demonstrate that DTop-p consistently outperforms both Top-k and fixed-threshold Top-p baselines. Our analysis confirms that DTop-p maintains precise control over the number of activated experts while adaptively allocating resources across different tokens and layers. Furthermore, DTop-p exhibits strong scaling properties with respect to expert granularity, expert capacity, model size, and dataset size, offering a robust framework for large-scale MoE pre-training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDTop-p MoE\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u63a7\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u7684\u52a8\u6001Top-p\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7PI\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u4e13\u5bb6\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6Top-k\u8def\u7531\u7b56\u7565\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4e0d\u540ctoken\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\u800c\u73b0\u6709Top-p\u8def\u7531\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6982\u7387\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0d\u53ef\u63a7\u4e14\u5bf9\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u654f\u611f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDTop-p MoE\uff0c\u5229\u7528PI\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6982\u7387\u9608\u503c\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u76ee\u6807\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u5404\u5c42\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDTop-p\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8eTop-k\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u9608\u503cTop-p\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e13\u5bb6\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "DTop-p\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4e13\u5bb6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u4e13\u5bb6\u5bb9\u91cf\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MoE\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

To address these limitations, we introduce the EDU-based Context Compressor, a novel explicit compression framework designed to preserve both global structure and fine-grained details. Our approach reformulates context compression as a structure-then-select process. First, our LingoEDU transforms linear text into a structural relation tree of Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs) which are anchored strictly to source indices to eliminate hallucination. Second, a lightweight ranking module selects query-relevant sub-trees for linearization. To rigorously evaluate structural understanding, we release StructBench, a manually annotated dataset of 248 diverse documents.

Existing chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting methods enhance model reasoning by eliciting intermediate steps, but suffer from two major limitations: First, their uniform application tends to induce overthinking on simple tasks. Second, they lack intention abstraction in code generation, such as explicitly modeling core algorithmic design and efficiency, leading models to focus on surface-level structures while neglecting the global problem objective. Inspired by the cognitive economy principle of engaging structured reasoning only when necessary to conserve cognitive resources, we propose RoutingGen, a novel difficulty-aware routing framework that dynamically adapts prompting strategies for code generation.

However, a critical dichotomy persists: while models are rigorously benchmarked, the data fueling them remains a black box--characterized by opaque composition, uncertain provenance, and a lack of systematic evaluation. This opacity hinders reproducibility and obscures the causal link between data characteristics and model behaviors. To bridge this gap, we introduce OpenDataArena (ODA), a holistic and open platform designed to benchmark the intrinsic value of post-training data. ODA establishes a comprehensive ecosystem comprising four key pillars: (i) a unified training-evaluation pipeline that ensures fair, open comparisons across diverse models (e.g., Llama, Qwen) and domains; (ii) a multi-dimensional scoring framework that profiles data quality along tens of distinct axes; (iii) an interactive data lineage explorer to visualize dataset genealogy and dissect component sources; and (iv) a fully open-source toolkit for training, evaluation, and scoring to foster data research. Extensive experiments on ODA--covering over 120 training datasets across multiple domains on 22 benchmarks, validated by more than 600 training runs and 40 million processed data points--reveal non-trivial insights. Our analysis uncovers the inherent trade-offs between data complexity and task performance, identifies redundancy in popular benchmarks through lineage tracing, and maps the genealogical relationships across datasets. We release all results, tools, and configurations to democratize access to high-quality data evaluation. Rather than merely expanding a leaderboard, ODA envisions a shift from trial-and-error data curation to a principled science of Data-Centric AI, paving the way for rigorous studies on data mixing laws and the strategic composition of foundation models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86OpenDataArena\uff08ODA\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5185\u5728\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u7ec4\u6210\u548c\u6765\u6e90\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u59a8\u788d\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u4e4b\u95f4\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "ODA\u5e73\u53f0\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u90e8\u5206\uff1a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3-\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u7a0b\u3001\u591a\u7ef4\u8bc4\u5206\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u8840\u7edf\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u548c\u5f00\u6e90\u5de5\u5177\u5305\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728ODA\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8840\u7edf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u5e38\u89c1\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed8\u5236\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8c31\u7cfb\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "ODA\u65e8\u5728\u63a8\u52a8\u4ece\u8bd5\u9519\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u6574\u7406\u5411\u4ee5\u6570\u636e\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684AI\u539f\u5219\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\u6cd5\u5219\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6218\u7565\u7ec4\u6210\u7814\u7a76\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

A hybrid TCN-Transformer architecture (14.2M parameters) captures local temporal patterns and long-range dependencies, while hierarchical normalization handles six orders of magnitude in discharge. On held-out synthetic tests comprising 799 stations with 18 expert-validated anomaly types, HydroGEM achieves F1 = 0.792 for detection and 68.7% reconstruction-error reduction, a 36.3% improvement over existing methods. Zero-shot transfer to 100 Environment and Climate Change Canada stations yields F1 = 0.586, exceeding all baselines and demonstrating cross-national generalization. The model maintains consistent detection across correction magnitudes and aligns with operational seasonal patterns.

Autoregressive modeling has been a popular approach, partly because of its training efficiency; however, that comes at the cost of sensitivity to overfitting. On the other hand, masked-diffusion models are less efficient to train while being more resilient to overfitting. In this work, we demonstrate that dual-objective training achieves the best of both worlds.

However, they still struggle with complex tasks that necessitate dynamic and iterative focusing on fine-grained visual regions to achieve precise grounding and diagnosis.

In contrast to prior approaches limited by the performance ceiling of specialized tools, Ophiuchus integrates the model's inherent grounding and perception capabilities with external tools, thereby fostering higher-level reasoning. The core of our method is a three-stage training strategy: cold-start training with tool-integrated reasoning data to achieve basic tool selection and adaptation for inspecting key regions; self-reflection fine-tuning to strengthen reflective reasoning and encourage revisiting tool outputs; and Agentic Tool Reinforcement Learning to directly optimize task-specific rewards and emulate expert-like diagnostic behavior. Extensive experiments show that Ophiuchus consistently outperforms both closed-source and open-source SOTA methods across diverse medical benchmarks, including VQA, detection, and reasoning-based segmentation.

This issue frequently arises in biological specimen collection records, where locations are often described through narratives rather than coordinates if they pre-date GPS.

The primary objective is to determine whether LLMs alone can create comprehensive ontologies and, if not, whether human-LLM collaboration can achieve this goal. Consequently, the paper assesses the effectiveness of LLMs in automated ontology development and the enhancement achieved through human-LLM collaboration.\n  Initial ontology generation was performed using One Shot (OS) and Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts, demonstrating the capability of LLMs to autonomously construct ontologies for PD monitoring and alerting. However, these outputs were not comprehensive and required substantial human refinement to enhance their completeness and accuracy.\n  X-HCOME, a hybrid ontology engineering approach that combines human expertise with LLM capabilities, showed significant improvements in ontology comprehensiveness.

This paper proposes a Massive editing approach for LLMs based on dynamic weight Generation (MeG). Our MeG involves attaching a dynamic weight neuron to specific layers of the LLMs and using a diffusion model to conditionally generate the weights of this neuron based on the input query required for the knowledge. This allows the use of adding a single dynamic weight neuron to achieve the goal of large-scale knowledge editing.

To build JMMMU-Pro, we propose Vibe Benchmark Construction, a methodology in which an image generative model (e.g., Nano Banana Pro) produces candidate visual questions, and humans verify the outputs and, when necessary, regenerate with adjusted prompts to ensure quality. By leveraging Nano Banana Pro's highly realistic image generation capabilities and its ability to embed clean Japanese text, we construct a high-quality benchmark at low cost, covering a wide range of background and layout designs. Experimental results show that all open-source LMMs struggle substantially with JMMMU-Pro, underscoring JMMMU-Pro as an important benchmark for guiding future efforts in the open-source community.

Furthermore, they often use unnecessarily large amounts of energy, leading to sustainability concerns and problems when deploying them on battery-powered devices.

Code available at https://github.com/RenYukun1563/specfem-mcp", "summary": "To address the steep learning curve and reliance on complex manual file editing and command-line operations in the traditional workflow of the mainstream open-source seismic wave simulation software SPECFEM, this paper proposes an intelligent, interactive workflow powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). We introduce the first Model Context Protocol (MCP) server suite for SPECFEM (supporting 2D, 3D Cartesian, and 3D Globe versions), which decomposes the entire simulation process into discrete, agent-executable tools spanning from parameter generation and mesh partitioning to solver execution and visualization. This approach enables a paradigm shift from file-driven to intent-driven conversational interactions. The framework supports both fully automated execution and human-in-the-loop collaboration, allowing researchers to guide simulation strategies in real time and retain scientific decision-making authority while significantly reducing tedious low-level operations.

Recent efforts primarily explore diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) for parallel decoding to reduce inference latency. To achieve AR-level generation quality, many techniques adapt AR models into dLLMs to enable parallel decoding. However, they suffer from limited speedup compared to AR models due to a pretrain-to-posttrain mismatch. Specifically, the masked data distribution in post-training deviates significantly from the real-world data distribution seen during pretraining, and dLLMs rely on bidirectional attention, which conflicts with the causal prior learned during pretraining and hinders the integration of exact KV cache reuse. To address this, we introduce Jacobi Forcing, a progressive distillation paradigm where models are trained on their own generated parallel decoding trajectories, smoothly shifting AR models into efficient parallel decoders while preserving their pretrained causal inference property. The models trained under this paradigm, Jacobi Forcing Model, achieves 3.8x wall-clock speedup on coding and math benchmarks with minimal loss in performance. Based on Jacobi Forcing Models' trajectory characteristics, we introduce multi-block decoding with rejection recycling, which enables up to 4.5x higher token acceptance count per iteration and nearly 4.0x wall-clock speedup, effectively trading additional compute for lower inference latency.

Including too few passages may omit critical information, while including too many can introduce noise and reduce the quality of the answer. Traditional approaches, such as fixed Top-$K$ retrieval and single-stage reranking, face the dilemma of selecting the right number of passages. This problem is particularly pronounced for factoid questions, which often require only a few specific pieces of evidence. To address this issue, we introduce \\emph{Context-Picker}, a reasoning-aware framework that shifts the paradigm from similarity-based ranking to minimal sufficient subset selection. Context-Picker treats context selection as a decision-making process optimized via a human-inspired, two-stage reinforcement learning schedule: a \\emph{recall-oriented} stage that prioritizes the coverage of reasoning chains, followed by a \\emph{precision-oriented} stage that aggressively prunes redundancy to distill a compact evidence set. To resolve reward sparsity, we propose an offline evidence distillation pipeline that mines \"minimal sufficient sets\" via a Leave-One-Out (LOO) procedure, providing dense, task-aligned supervision. Experiments on five long-context and multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that Context-Picker significantly outperforms strong RAG baselines, achieving superior answer accuracy with comparable or reduced context lengths. Ablation studies indicate that the coarse-to-fine optimization schedule, the redundancy-aware reward shaping, and the rationale-guided format all contribute substantially to these gains.", "AI": {"tldr": "Context-Picker \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u95ee\u7b54\uff08LCQA\uff09\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5c0f\u5145\u5206\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u3002\u8fc7\u5c11\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u53ef\u80fd\u9057\u6f0f\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u800c\u8fc7\u591a\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u566a\u97f3\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u7b54\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9009\u62e9\u6b63\u786e\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u5c11\u91cf\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86 Context-Picker \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9009\u62e9\u89c6\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u662f\u4ee5\u53ec\u56de\u4e3a\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u8986\u76d6\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\uff1b\u5176\u6b21\u662f\u4ee5\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e3a\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u526a\u679d\u5197\u4f59\u4ee5\u63d0\u70bc\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bc1\u636e\u84b8\u998f\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7 Leave-One-Out (LOO) \u7a0b\u5e8f\u6316\u6398\u201c\u6700\u5c0f\u5145\u5206\u96c6\u201d\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u9f50\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cContext-Picker \u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5927\u7684 RAG \u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4ee5\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u77ed\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Context-Picker \u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7684\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u4f18\u5316\u8c03\u5ea6\u3001\u5197\u4f59\u611f\u77e5\u5956\u52b1\u5851\u9020\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7406\u7531\u7684\u683c\u5f0f\u5747\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u663e\u8457\u8d21\u732e\u3002"}}

We benchmark leading video models (Veo-3, Sora-2, Wan-2.2) and image models (Nano-banana, Nano-banana Pro, GPT-4o-image, Qwen-image), revealing strong performance gaps across domains. Models show moderate success on Physical Commonsense tasks but perform poorly on Abstract Reasoning (below 10 percent accuracy on ARC-AGI) and struggle with long-horizon spatial planning in embodied settings.

Our scheduler is easy to implement, computationally efficient, and could be considered a good default scheduler for training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668GreedyLR\uff0c\u8be5\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u6839\u636e\u5f53\u524d\u635f\u5931\u8c03\u6574\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u591a\u6570\u7814\u7a76\u4ecd\u4f7f\u7528\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff0c\u5982\u4f59\u5f26\u6216\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86GreedyLR\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u5f53\u524d\u635f\u5931\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728NLP\u3001CV\u548cLLM\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6536\u655b\u6027\u65b9\u9762\uff0cGreedyLR\u4f18\u4e8e\u51e0\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "GreedyLR\u6613\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u826f\u597d\u9ed8\u8ba4\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u3002"}}

In this work, we systematically analyze UTs variants and show that improvements on ARC-AGI primarily arise from the recurrent inductive bias and strong nonlinear components of Transformer, rather than from elaborate architectural designs. Motivated by this finding, we propose the Universal Reasoning Model (URM), which enhances the UT with short convolution and truncated backpropagation. Our approach substantially improves reasoning performance, achieving state-of-the-art 53.8% pass@1 on ARC-AGI 1 and 16.0% pass@1 on ARC-AGI 2.

Most existing studies in this field have concentrated on news articles, where journalists usually follow a fixed writing style. While such approaches are effective in limited contexts, they often fail to adapt to the varied nature of real-world Bangla texts. In today's digital era, a massive amount of Bangla content is continuously produced across blogs, newspapers, and social media. This creates a pressing need for summarization systems that can reduce information overload and help readers understand content more quickly. To address this challenge, we developed a dataset of over 54,000 Bangla articles and summaries collected from multiple sources, including blogs such as Cinegolpo and newspapers such as Samakal and The Business Standard. Unlike single-domain resources, our dataset spans multiple domains and writing styles. It offers greater adaptability and practical relevance. To establish strong baselines, we trained and evaluated this dataset using several deep learning and transfer learning models, including LSTM, BanglaT5-small, and MTS-small. The results highlight its potential as a benchmark for future research in Bangla natural language processing. This dataset provides a solid foundation for building robust summarization systems and helps expand NLP resources for low-resource languages.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b54,000\u7bc7\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed\u6587\u7ae0\u548c\u6458\u8981\u7684\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u62bd\u8c61\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u591a\u79cd\u6765\u6e90\u548c\u9886\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u65b0\u95fb\u6587\u7ae0\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6587\u672c\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002\u968f\u7740\u6570\u5b57\u65f6\u4ee3\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u7206\u70b8\u6027\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u6025\u9700\u80fd\u591f\u51cf\u8f7b\u4fe1\u606f\u8fc7\u8f7d\u7684\u6458\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u4eceCinegolpo\u7b49\u535a\u5ba2\u548cSamakal\u7b49\u62a5\u7eb8\u6536\u96c6\u768454,000\u7bc7\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed\u6587\u7ae0\u548c\u6458\u8981\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528LSTM\u3001BanglaT5-small\u548cMTS-small\u7b49\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u53ca\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6458\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6269\u5c55\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684NLP\u8d44\u6e90\u3002"}}
