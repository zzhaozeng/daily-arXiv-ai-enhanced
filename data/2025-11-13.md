### [1] [Where did you get that? Towards Summarization Attribution for Analysts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08589)
*Violet B,John M. Conroy,Sean Lynch,Danielle M,Neil P. Molino,Aaron Wiechmann,Julia S. Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文关注于自动归因方法，旨在将摘要中的每个句子与源文本部分链接，并探讨使用混合摘要和自定义拓扑结构来简化归因过程和识别归因错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析师需要归因信息，因为无法在不知道信息来源的情况下进行报告。因此，研究自动归因方法变得非常重要。

Method: 研究使用混合摘要（即提取摘要的自动改写）来简化归因，并使用自定义拓扑结构来识别不同类别的归因相关错误比例。

Result: 通过混合摘要和自定义拓扑结构，能够更有效地进行归因，并识别归因错误的类别和比例。

Conclusion: 自动归因方法，特别是结合混合摘要和自定义拓扑，能够提高归因的准确性和效率，从而改善分析报告的质量。

Abstract: Analysts require attribution, as nothing can be reported without knowing the source of the information. In this paper, we will focus on automatic methods for attribution, linking each sentence in the summary to a portion of the source text, which may be in one or more documents. We explore using a hybrid summarization, i.e., an automatic paraphrase of an extractive summary, to ease attribution. We also use a custom topology to identify the proportion of different categories of attribution-related errors.

### [2] [GMTRouter: Personalized LLM Router over Multi-turn User Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08590)
*Encheng Xie,Yihang Sun,Tao Feng,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GMTRouter利用异构图和消息传递机制，通过轻量级归纳图学习框架从少量数据中捕捉用户偏好，实现个性化LLM路由。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户偏好数据稀缺、嘈杂且格式不一致，现有方法无法完全个性化，难以捕捉用户与LLM之间的复杂互动。

Method: GMTRouter将多轮用户-LLM互动表示为异构图，包括用户、LLM、查询和响应四种节点类型，并通过定制的消息传递机制在轻量级归纳图学习框架中学习用户偏好。

Result: GMTRouter在多个数据集上始终优于强基准，准确率提高了0.9到21.6个百分点，AUC提高了0.006到0.309。

Conclusion: GMTRouter能够仅使用少量数据适应新用户和不断变化的偏好，无需大量微调，展示了其强大的个性化能力和适应性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) routing has demonstrated strong capability in balancing response quality with computational cost. As users exhibit diverse preferences, personalization has attracted increasing attention in LLM routing, since even identical queries may require different models to generate responses tailored to individual needs. However, existing approaches are not fully personalized and often fail to capture the complex interactions between specific users and LLMs. Moreover, user preference data is typically scarce, noisy, and inconsistent in format, which limits the effectiveness of methods that rely solely on user-specific data. To address these challenges, we propose GMTRouter, which represents multi-turn user-LLM interactions as a heterogeneous graph with four node types: user, LLM, query, and response, thereby preserving the rich relational structure of the interaction. Through a tailored message-passing mechanism, GMTRouter learns to capture user preferences from few-shot data within a lightweight inductive graph learning framework, enabling effective personalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMTRouter consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving 0.9 to 21.6 percent higher accuracy and 0.006 to 0.309 higher AUC across multiple datasets. More importantly, we demonstrate that GMTRouter can adapt to new users and evolving preferences using only few-shot data, without extensive fine-tuning. The code for GMTRouter is publicly available at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/GMTRouter.

### [3] [The Collective Turing Test: Large Language Models Can Generate Realistic Multi-User Discussions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08592)
*Azza Bouleimen,Giordano De Marzo,Taehee Kim,Nicol`o Pagan,Hannah Metzler,Silvia Giordano,David Garcia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）可以生成足以以假乱真的人类社交媒体对话。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs是否能逼真地模仿社交媒体上的人类群体对话，并探讨其在模拟在线社区和内容政策测试中的潜在应用。

Method: 从Reddit收集真实的人类对话，并使用Llama 3 70B和GPT-4o生成相同主题的人工对话，然后让研究参与者并排评估这些对话。

Result: LLM生成的对话有39%的时间被误认为是人类生成的内容，Llama 3生成的对话只有56%的时间被正确识别为AI生成，仅略高于随机水平。

Conclusion: LLMs能够生成足够逼真的社交媒体对话，足以在人类阅读时欺骗他们，这既突显了其在社会模拟中的潜力，也警示了LLMs可能被滥用于生成不真实的社交媒体内容。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new avenues to simulate online communities and social media. Potential applications range from testing the design of content recommendation algorithms to estimating the effects of content policies and interventions. However, the validity of using LLMs to simulate conversations between various users remains largely untested. We evaluated whether LLMs can convincingly mimic human group conversations on social media. We collected authentic human conversations from Reddit and generated artificial conversations on the same topic with two LLMs: Llama 3 70B and GPT-4o. When presented side-by-side to study participants, LLM-generated conversations were mistaken for human-created content 39\% of the time. In particular, when evaluating conversations generated by Llama 3, participants correctly identified them as AI-generated only 56\% of the time, barely better than random chance. Our study demonstrates that LLMs can generate social media conversations sufficiently realistic to deceive humans when reading them, highlighting both a promising potential for social simulation and a warning message about the potential misuse of LLMs to generate new inauthentic social media content.

### [4] [Knowledge Graph Analysis of Legal Understanding and Violations in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08593)
*Abha Jha,Abel Salinas,Fred Morstatter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一种结合知识图谱和检索增强生成（RAG）的方法，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在解读美国法典第18篇第175条（生物武器相关法律）时的理解能力、法律意图判断能力及潜在不安全输出风险。研究发现模型存在推理和安全性缺陷，但通过加强安全协议和法律推理框架可改善。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂法律分析中展现出潜力，但在处理敏感法律领域时可能产生危险输出（如生物武器制造步骤），存在法律合规与伦理风险，需系统性评估与改进。

Method: 构建知识图谱并结合检索增强生成（RAG）技术，设计结构化实验，评估LLMs在识别法律违规、生成禁止性指令、检测非法意图等方面的表现。

Result: LLMs在生物武器相关法律场景中表现出显著的推理局限性和安全机制不足，但在增强安全协议和强化法律推理框架后有望改进。

Conclusion: 通过整合知识图谱、RAG及强化安全机制，可构建更安全、可靠的LLMs，使其成为法律的保护者而非违规的协助者，为敏感法律领域的应用提供基础。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers transformative potential for interpreting complex legal frameworks, such as Title 18 Section 175 of the US Code, which governs biological weapons. These systems hold promise for advancing legal analysis and compliance monitoring in sensitive domains. However, this capability comes with a troubling contradiction: while LLMs can analyze and interpret laws, they also demonstrate alarming vulnerabilities in generating unsafe outputs, such as actionable steps for bioweapon creation, despite their safeguards. To address this challenge, we propose a methodology that integrates knowledge graph construction with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to systematically evaluate LLMs' understanding of this law, their capacity to assess legal intent (mens rea), and their potential for unsafe applications. Through structured experiments, we assess their accuracy in identifying legal violations, generating prohibited instructions, and detecting unlawful intent in bioweapons-related scenarios. Our findings reveal significant limitations in LLMs' reasoning and safety mechanisms, but they also point the way forward. By combining enhanced safety protocols with more robust legal reasoning frameworks, this research lays the groundwork for developing LLMs that can ethically and securely assist in sensitive legal domains - ensuring they act as protectors of the law rather than inadvertent enablers of its violation.

### [5] [Diverse Preference Learning for Capabilities and Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08594)
*Stewart Slocum,Asher Parker-Sartori,Dylan Hadfield-Menell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Soft Preference Learning方法以解决LLMs对齐过程中输出多样性的减少问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近期研究显示，RLHF和DPO等对齐算法显著降低了LLM输出的多样性，导致生成文本的结构和词汇选择重复，以及问题解决方法的统一，这归因于KL散度正则化器在偏好学习算法中的使用，导致模型系统地高估多数意见并牺牲输出多样性。

Method: 提出了一种名为Soft Preference Learning的方法，该方法通过解耦KL惩罚中的熵和交叉熵项，允许对LLM生成多样性进行细粒度控制。

Result: 使用Soft Preference Learning训练的LLMs在困难的重复采样任务上达到了更高的准确性，并生成了具有更高语义和词汇多样性的输出。从对齐的角度来看，它们能够表示更广泛的社会观点，并展示出改进的逻辑校准。

Conclusion: Soft Preference Learning不仅提高了LLMs的输出多样性，还能更好地表示社会多样性观点，是对标准温度缩放的帕累托改进。

Abstract: The ability of LLMs to represent diverse perspectives is critical as they increasingly impact society. However, recent studies reveal that alignment algorithms such as RLHF and DPO significantly reduce the diversity of LLM outputs. Not only do aligned LLMs generate text with repetitive structure and word choice, they also approach problems in more uniform ways, and their responses reflect a narrower range of societal perspectives. We attribute this problem to the KL divergence regularizer employed in preference learning algorithms. This causes the model to systematically overweight majority opinions and sacrifice diversity in its outputs. To address this, we propose Soft Preference Learning, which decouples the entropy and cross-entropy terms in the KL penalty - allowing for fine-grained control over LLM generation diversity. From a capabilities perspective, LLMs trained using Soft Preference Learning attain higher accuracy on difficult repeated sampling tasks and produce outputs with greater semantic and lexical diversity. From an alignment perspective, they are capable of representing a wider range of societal viewpoints and display improved logit calibration. Notably, Soft Preference Learning resembles, but is a Pareto improvement over, standard temperature scaling.

### [6] [What About the Scene with the Hitler Reference? HAUNT: A Framework to Probe LLMs' Self-consistency Via Adversarial Nudge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08596)
*Arka Dutta,Sujan Dutta,Rijul Magu,Soumyajit Datta,Munmun De Choudhury,Ashiqur R. KhudaBukhsh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一个框架，用于在对抗性诱导下进行大规模语言模型的事实保真度压力测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 幻觉是大型语言模型在高风险领域实际部署的关键挑战，尤其是在对抗性诱导的情况下。

Method: 提出的框架包含三个步骤：1) 指导LLM生成与封闭领域一致的真假陈述；2) 指导LLM验证这些陈述的真假；3) 测试LLM对由自己生成并验证的假陈述的稳健性。

Result: 在两个封闭领域（流行电影和小说）上对五个广泛使用的专有LLM进行的大量评估显示，模型对对抗性诱导的敏感性不同：Claude表现出很强的韧性，GPT和Grok表现出中等韧性，Gemini和DeepSeek表现出较弱韧性。

Conclusion: 随着越来越多的人使用LLM获取信息，这些发现对信息获取的可靠性提出了警示。

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a critical challenge to the real-world deployment of large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains. In this paper, we present a framework for stress testing factual fidelity in LLMs in the presence of adversarial nudge. Our framework consists of three steps. In the first step, we instruct the LLM to produce sets of truths and lies consistent with the closed domain in question. In the next step, we instruct the LLM to verify the same set of assertions as truths and lies consistent with the same closed domain. In the final step, we test the robustness of the LLM against the lies generated (and verified) by itself. Our extensive evaluation, conducted using five widely known proprietary LLMs across two closed domains of popular movies and novels, reveals a wide range of susceptibility to adversarial nudges: \texttt{Claude} exhibits strong resilience, \texttt{GPT} and \texttt{Grok} demonstrate moderate resilience, while \texttt{Gemini} and \texttt{DeepSeek} show weak resilience. Considering that a large population is increasingly using LLMs for information seeking, our findings raise alarm.

### [7] [Self-HarmLLM: Can Large Language Model Harm Itself?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08597)
*Heehwan Kim,Sungjune Park,Daeseon Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了Self-HarmLLM场景，研究大模型自身生成的内容可能成为攻击载体的问题。通过实验发现，经过缓解的有害查询(MHQ)在重新输入时可能导致越狱，且自动化评估会高估成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御假设攻击者来自外部，但模型自身输出成为新攻击载体的可能性未被充分探索。

Method: 提出Self-HarmLLM场景，使用同一模型生成的MHQ作为新输入，测试三种模型在Base/Zero-shot/Few-shot条件下的表现，并对比自动化评估与人评估。

Result: Zero-shot下最高52%转化率和33%越狱率，Few-shot下最高65%转化率和41%越狱率；自动化评估平均高估52%。

Conclusion: 模型自生成内容可能构成有效攻击，需重新考虑防护栏设计并建立更可靠的评估方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are generally equipped with guardrails to block the generation of harmful responses. However, existing defenses always assume that an external attacker crafts the harmful query, and the possibility of a model's own output becoming a new attack vector has not been sufficiently explored. In this study, we propose the Self-HarmLLM scenario, which uses a Mitigated Harmful Query (MHQ) generated by the same model as a new input. An MHQ is an ambiguous query whose original intent is preserved while its harmful nature is not directly exposed. We verified whether a jailbreak occurs when this MHQ is re-entered into a separate session of the same model. We conducted experiments on GPT-3.5-turbo, LLaMA3-8B-instruct, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B under Base, Zero-shot, and Few-shot conditions. The results showed up to 52% transformation success rate and up to 33% jailbreak success rate in the Zero-shot condition, and up to 65% transformation success rate and up to 41% jailbreak success rate in the Few-shot condition. By performing both prefix-based automated evaluation and human evaluation, we found that the automated evaluation consistently overestimated jailbreak success, with an average difference of 52%. This indicates that automated evaluation alone is not accurate for determining harmfulness. While this study is a toy-level study based on a limited query set and evaluators, it proves that our method can still be a valid attack scenario. These results suggest the need for a fundamental reconsideration of guardrail design and the establishment of a more robust evaluation methodology.

### [8] [Retrieval-Augmented Generation of Pediatric Speech-Language Pathology vignettes: A Proof-of-Concept Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08600)
*Yilan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个结合检索增强生成（RAG）系统与专业领域知识库的概念验证系统，用于生成儿科言语语言病理学（SLP）教学案例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床教学案例在SLP教育中非常重要，但手工创建耗时且通用大型语言模型（LLMs）缺乏领域专业知识，容易导致错误信息，需要大量专家修订。

Method: 开发了一个多模型基于RAG的系统，整合了专业领域知识和特定提示模板，支持五种商业和开源LLMs，并设计了七种不同障碍类型和年级水平的测试场景。通过多维评分标准自动评估生成的病例质量。

Result: 概念验证系统展示了RAG增强生成儿科SLP病例的技术可行性。商业模型在质量上略有优势，但开源模型也实现了可接受的表现，表明在保护隐私的机构部署中具有潜力。

Conclusion: 通过专家审查、学生试点测试和心理评估进行广泛验证后，该系统未来可应用于教育或研究，以及临床决策支持、自动化IEP目标生成和临床反思训练。

Abstract: Clinical vignettes are essential educational tools in speech-language pathology (SLP), but manual creation is time-intensive. While general-purpose large language models (LLMs) can generate text, they lack domain-specific knowledge, leading to hallucinations and requiring extensive expert revision. This study presents a proof-of-concept system integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with curated knowledge bases to generate pediatric SLP case materials. A multi-model RAG-based system was prototyped integrating curated domain knowledge with engineered prompt templates, supporting five commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro) and open-source (Llama 3.2, Qwen 2.5-7B) LLMs. Seven test scenarios spanning diverse disorder types and grade levels were systematically designed. Generated cases underwent automated quality assessment using a multi-dimensional rubric evaluating structural completeness, internal consistency, clinical appropriateness, and IEP goal/session note quality. This proof-of-concept demonstrates technical feasibility for RAG-augmented generation of pediatric SLP vignettes. Commercial models showed marginal quality advantages, but open-source alternatives achieved acceptable performance, suggesting potential for privacy-preserving institutional deployment. Integration of curated knowledge bases enabled content generation aligned with professional guidelines. Extensive validation through expert review, student pilot testing, and psychometric evaluation is required before educational or research implementation. Future applications may extend to clinical decision support, automated IEP goal generation, and clinical reflection training.

### [9] [Evaluating DisCoCirc in Translation Tasks & its Limitations: A Comparative Study Between Bengali & English](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08601)
*Nazmoon Falgunee Moon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文扩展了DisCoCirc形式主义以开发适用于孟加拉语的同类框架，并应用于英语和孟加拉语之间的翻译任务，发现其在降低语言官僚主义方面存在局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作者旨在扩展DisCoCirc框架以适用于孟加拉语，并评估其在英语和孟加拉语翻译任务中的有效性，特别是在减少语言官僚主义方面的效果。

Method: 通过扩展DisCoCirc框架，开发适用于孟加拉语的框架，并应用于英语和孟加拉语之间的翻译任务，同时探讨可能的改进方法。

Result: 尽管DisCoCirc在语言的许多方面表现良好，但由于两种语言的结构差异，其在翻译任务中仍面临局限性，即使在处理相对简单的句子时也表现不佳。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了DisCoCirc框架在翻译任务中的局限性，并指出了未来改进的可能性，同时还展示了英语连词与布尔逻辑之间的联系。

Abstract: In [4], the authors present the DisCoCirc (Distributed Compositional Circuits) formalism for the English language, a grammar-based framework derived from the production rules that incorporates circuit-like representations in order to give a precise categorical theoretical structure to the language. In this paper, we extend this approach to develop a similar framework for Bengali and apply it to translation tasks between English and Bengali. A central focus of our work lies in reassessing the effectiveness of DisCoCirc in reducing language bureaucracy. Unlike the result suggested in [5], our findings indicate that although it works well for a large part of the language, it still faces limitations due to the structural variation of the two languages. We discuss the possible methods that might handle these shortcomings and show that, in practice, DisCoCirc still struggles even with relatively simple sentences. This divergence from prior claims not only highlights the framework's constraints in translation but also suggest scope for future improvement. Apart from our primary focus on English-Bengali translation, we also take a short detour to examine English conjunctions, following [1], showing a connection between conjunctions and Boolean logic.

### [10] [Mina: A Multilingual LLM-Powered Legal Assistant Agent for Bangladesh for Empowering Access to Justice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08605)
*Azmine Toushik Wasi,Wahid Faisal,Mst Rafia Islam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了一个名为Mina的基于多语言大模型的法律助手，旨在为孟加拉国的低收入人群提供低成本、多语言的法律支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉的低收入人群由于复杂的法律语言、程序不透明和高昂费用，面临获取法律建议的重大障碍。现有AI法律助手缺乏孟加拉语支持和特定司法适应性。

Method: Mina采用多语言嵌入和基于RAG的工具链框架，实现检索、推理、翻译和文件生成，通过交互式聊天界面提供法律草案、引用和通俗易懂的解释。

Result: 经过对2022和2023年孟加拉国律师资格考试的评估，Mina在初步MCQs、笔试和模拟口试中得分75-80%，匹配或超过平均人类表现，展示了清晰的表达、上下文理解和良好的法律推理能力。

Conclusion: Mina验证了其作为低成本、多语言AI助手的潜力，可以自动化关键法律任务，扩大司法获取，为构建特定领域、低资源系统提供了实际案例研究，解决了多语言适应、效率和可持续公共服务AI部署的挑战。

Abstract: Bangladesh's low-income population faces major barriers to affordable legal advice due to complex legal language, procedural opacity, and high costs. Existing AI legal assistants lack Bengali-language support and jurisdiction-specific adaptation, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we developed Mina, a multilingual LLM-based legal assistant tailored for the Bangladeshi context. It employs multilingual embeddings and a RAG-based chain-of-tools framework for retrieval, reasoning, translation, and document generation, delivering context-aware legal drafts, citations, and plain-language explanations via an interactive chat interface. Evaluated by law faculty from leading Bangladeshi universities across all stages of the 2022 and 2023 Bangladesh Bar Council Exams, Mina scored 75-80% in Preliminary MCQs, Written, and simulated Viva Voce exams, matching or surpassing average human performance and demonstrating clarity, contextual understanding, and sound legal reasoning. These results confirm its potential as a low-cost, multilingual AI assistant that automates key legal tasks and scales access to justice, offering a real-world case study on building domain-specific, low-resource systems and addressing challenges of multilingual adaptation, efficiency, and sustainable public-service AI deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了多个大型语言模型（LLMs）在急诊医学诊断中的表现，并提出了一种集成这些模型的新方法，以提高诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗决策支持系统对于急诊医生快速准确地评估病情和做出诊断至关重要，人工智能，特别是大型语言模型在医疗领域的应用显示出变革性的潜力。

Method: 研究评估了五个著名的大型语言模型在真实急诊病例上的表现，并构建了一个名为MEDAS的超学习器，通过集成这些模型并使用元学习器来提高诊断准确率。

Result: 单个LLM的诊断准确率在58%到65%之间，而集成的超学习器（MEDAS）达到了70%的准确率，其中至少有一个集成的LLM能够达到85%的正确诊断率。

Conclusion: 通过元学习方法聚合多个LLM的诊断准确率超过了任何单个LLM的表现，表明超学习器能够利用所有集成模型的集体知识，提高急诊医学中的诊断准确性。

Abstract: Medical decision-support and advising systems are critical for emergency physicians to quickly and accurately assess patients' conditions and make diagnosis. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force in healthcare in recent years and Large Language Models (LLMs) have been employed in various fields of medical decision-support systems. We studied responses of a group of different LLMs to real cases in emergency medicine. The results of our study on five most renown LLMs showed significant differences in capabilities of Large Language Models for diagnostics acute diseases in medical emergencies with accuracy ranging between 58% and 65%. This accuracy significantly exceeds the reported accuracy of human doctors. We built a super-learner MEDAS (Medical Emergency Diagnostic Advising System) of five major LLMs - Gemini, Llama, Grok, GPT, and Claude). The super-learner produces higher diagnostic accuracy, 70%, even with a quite basic meta-learner. However, at least one of the integrated LLMs in the same super-learner produces 85% correct diagnoses. The super-learner integrates a cluster of LLMs using a meta-learner capable of learning different capabilities of each LLM to leverage diagnostic accuracy of the model by collective capabilities of all LLMs in the cluster. The results of our study showed that aggregated diagnostic accuracy provided by a meta-learning approach exceeds that of any individual LLM, suggesting that the super-learner can take advantage of the combined knowledge of the medical datasets used to train the group of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于大语言模型监督微调的自适应梯度感知数据选择方法GrADS，通过分析预训练阶段的梯度信息，有效选择训练数据子集，以提高领域特定任务的性能并缓解灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调虽然对特定领域适应很重要，但资源消耗大，且可能导致一般性能下降。为解决这些问题，提出通过梯度分析选择训练数据的有效子集。

Method: 设计了一种利用梯度大小和统计分布的自引导标准，通过分析初步训练阶段的梯度，优先选择对模型学习过程贡献最大的样本。

Result: 实验证明，仅使用5%的GrADS选择数据，LLMs的性能就超过了在全数据集上微调的模型，使用50%的数据时性能显著提升，同时缓解了灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: GrADS方法在多个领域（医学、法律、金融）中表现出显著的成本效益，能有效提高LLMs在特定领域的性能，同时减轻灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Despite large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive achievements across numerous tasks, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) remains essential for adapting these models to specialized domains. However, SFT for domain specialization can be resource-intensive and sometimes leads to a deterioration in performance over general capabilities due to catastrophic forgetting (CF). To address these issues, we propose a self-adaptive gradient-aware data selection approach (GrADS) for supervised fine-tuning of LLMs, which identifies effective subsets of training data by analyzing gradients obtained from a preliminary training phase. Specifically, we design self-guided criteria that leverage the magnitude and statistical distribution of gradients to prioritize examples that contribute the most to the model's learning process. This approach enables the acquisition of representative samples that enhance LLMs understanding of domain-specific tasks. Through extensive experimentation with various LLMs across diverse domains such as medicine, law, and finance, GrADS has demonstrated significant efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Remarkably, utilizing merely 5% of the selected GrADS data, LLMs already surpass the performance of those fine-tuned on the entire dataset, and increasing to 50% of the data results in significant improvements! With catastrophic forgetting substantially mitigated simultaneously. We will release our code for GrADS later.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合CNN和BiGRU的混合深度学习方案，用于从社交媒体数据中识别自杀意念，并引入SHAP解释性方法验证模型可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自杀是全球青少年第二大死因，且社交媒体平台上的自杀意图信号较为常见，需要有效识别这些信号以预防自杀。

Method: 提出了一种结合CNN（局部特征提取）和BiGRU（双向序列建模）的混合深度学习模型，并引入注意力机制和SHAP解释性方法。

Result: 在公开数据集上训练和评估，模型准确率达到93.97%，优于其他先进机器学习和深度学习模型。

Conclusion: 该模型在自杀意念检测中表现出色，验证了其在实际应用中的有效性和优越性。

Abstract: Worldwide, suicide is the second leading cause of death for adolescents with past suicide attempts to be an important predictor for increased future suicides. While some people with suicidal thoughts may try to suppress them, many signal their intentions in social media platforms. To address these issues, we propose a new type of hybrid deep learning scheme, i.e., the combination of a CNN architecture and a BiGRU technique, which can accurately identify the patterns of suicidal ideation from SN datasets. Also, we apply Explainable AI methods using SHapley Additive exPlanations to interpret the prediction results and verifying the model reliability. This integration of CNN local feature extraction, BiGRU bidirectional sequence modeling, attention mechanisms, and SHAP interpretability provides a comprehensive framework for suicide detection. Training and evaluation of the system were performed on a publicly available dataset. Several performance metrics were used for evaluating model performance. Our method was found to have achieved 93.97 accuracy in experimental results. Comparative study to different state-of-the-art Machine Learning and DL models and existing literature demonstrates the superiority of our proposed technique over all the competing methods.

### [14] [Toward Automated Cognitive Assessment in Parkinson's Disease Using Pretrained Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08806)
*Varada Khanna,Nilay Bhatt,Ikgyu Shin,Sule Tinaz,Yang Ren,Hua Xu,Vipina K. Keloth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 开发并评估了多种NLP模型，从帕金森病患者的个人叙述中自动识别认知过程类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解帕金森病患者如何描述日常认知体验，有助于洞察与疾病相关的认知和情感变化，但从非结构化患者叙述中提取信息具有挑战性。

Method: 开发了三种NLP模型家族：基于Bio_ClinicalBERT的嵌套实体识别模型、使用QLoRA微调的Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct模型，以及在零样本和少样本设置下评估的GPT-4o mini模型。比较了这些模型在提取七种认知过程类别上的表现。

Result: 不同类别和模型家族之间的模型性能差异显著。微调后的Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct模型在整体F1分数上表现最佳，特别是在依赖上下文的类别上；Bio_ClinicalBERT表现出高精度但低召回率，在某些类别上与Llama相当，但在其他类别上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 尽管由于认知叙述的抽象性和重叠性，该任务比传统信息提取更具挑战性，但通过持续改进，这些NLP系统有望实现对帕金森病患者认知功能的低负担、纵向监测，并为正式神经心理学评估提供有价值的补充。

Abstract: Understanding how individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) describe cognitive experiences in their daily lives can offer valuable insights into disease-related cognitive and emotional changes. However, extracting such information from unstructured patient narratives is challenging due to the subtle, overlapping nature of cognitive constructs. This study developed and evaluated natural language processing (NLP) models to automatically identify categories that reflect various cognitive processes from de-identified first-person narratives. Three model families, a Bio_ClinicalBERT-based span categorization model for nested entity recognition, a fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct model using QLoRA for instruction following, and GPT-4o mini evaluated under zero- and few-shot settings, were compared on their performance on extracting seven categories. Our findings indicated that model performance varied substantially across categories and model families. The fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct achieved the highest overall F1-scores (0.74 micro-average and 0.59 macro-average), particularly excelling in context-dependent categories such as thought and social interaction. Bio_ClinicalBERT exhibited high precision but low recall and performed comparable to Llama for some category types such as location and time but failed on other categories such as thought, emotion and social interaction. Compared to conventional information extraction tasks, this task presents a greater challenge due to the abstract and overlapping nature of narrative accounts of complex cognitive processes. Nonetheless, with continued refinement, these NLP systems hold promise for enabling low-burden, longitudinal monitoring of cognitive function and serving as a valuable complement to formal neuropsychological assessments in PD.

Conclusion: BNLI数据集为提升孟加拉语和低资源语言的自然语言推理研究提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Despite the growing progress in Natural Language Inference (NLI) research, resources for the Bengali language remain extremely limited. Existing Bengali NLI datasets exhibit several inconsistencies, including annotation errors, ambiguous sentence pairs, and inadequate linguistic diversity, which hinder effective model training and evaluation. To address these limitations, we introduce BNLI, a refined and linguistically curated Bengali NLI dataset designed to support robust language understanding and inference modeling. The dataset was constructed through a rigorous annotation pipeline emphasizing semantic clarity and balance across entailment, contradiction, and neutrality classes. We benchmarked BNLI using a suite of state-of-the-art transformer-based architectures, including multilingual and Bengali-specific models, to assess their ability to capture complex semantic relations in Bengali text. The experimental findings highlight the improved reliability and interpretability achieved with BNLI, establishing it as a strong foundation for advancing research in Bengali and other low-resource language inference tasks.

TL;DR: 本文研究了LLM在引用推荐中的幻觉问题，发现引用次数与事实准确性强相关，高被引论文更易被准确记忆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在引用推荐中存在生成虚构论文的幻觉问题，需探究其成因，尤其是模型对知识的记忆与生成差异。

Method: 假设引用次数可代表预训练数据冗余度，利用GPT-4.1在20个计算机科学领域生成100条引用，人工校验并通过余弦相似度衡量生成与真实元数据的一致性。

Result: 引用次数与事实准确性强相关；引用超过1000次的文献信息几乎被逐字记忆；多个高被引论文内容相似时会产生记忆干扰。

Conclusion: 模型存在一个从泛化到记忆的阈值，高被引论文几乎以逐字方式被记忆，引用次数可预测模型幻觉程度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to a wide range of tasks, from natural language understanding to code generation. While they have also been used to assist in citation recommendation, the hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce bibliographic records depends on whether the underlying knowledge is generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear in the pretraining corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency with which a given bibliographic record appears in the pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified 100 citations across twenty computer-science domains, and measured factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic metadata. The results revealed that (i) citation count is strongly correlated with factual accuracy, (ii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatim memorized beyond roughly 1,000 citations, and (iii) memory interference occurs when multiple highly cited papers share similar content. These findings indicate a threshold where generalization shifts into memorization, with highly cited papers being nearly verbatim retained in the model.

Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLMs)在自然语言处理任务中表现出色，但会产生损害事实可靠性的幻觉内容。

Method: HalluClean采用增强推理范式，将过程分解为计划、执行和修订阶段，并采用最小任务路由提示实现零样本泛化。

Result: 在五个代表性任务上的实验表明，HalluClean显著提高了事实一致性，并优于竞争基线。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks, yet they often produce hallucinated content that undermines factual reliability. To address this challenge, we introduce HalluClean, a lightweight and task-agnostic framework for detecting and correcting hallucinations in LLM-generated text. HalluClean adopts a reasoning-enhanced paradigm, explicitly decomposing the process into planning, execution, and revision stages to identify and refine unsupported claims. It employs minimal task-routing prompts to enable zero-shot generalization across diverse domains, without relying on external knowledge sources or supervised detectors. We conduct extensive evaluations on five representative tasks-question answering, dialogue, summarization, math word problems, and contradiction detection. Experimental results show that HalluClean significantly improves factual consistency and outperforms competitive baselines, demonstrating its potential to enhance the trustworthiness of LLM outputs in real-world applications.

TL;DR: TiDAR是一种序列级混合架构，通过在一个前向传播中使用结构化注意力掩码，在扩散中起草标记（Thinking），并自回归地采样最终输出（Talking），实现了高吞吐量和高质量的语言生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型能实现快速并行生成，但自回归模型在质量上表现更优。现有方法无法有效平衡这两个方面，因此需要一种新架构来实现高质量和高吞吐量的结合。

Method: TiDAR采用序列级混合架构，在扩散模型中起草标记，并自回归地采样最终输出，利用结构化注意力掩码在一个前向传播中完成整个过程，并优化了GPU利用率。

Result: 在1.5B和8B规模上，TiDAR在生成和似然任务中表现优于自回归模型、推测解码和扩散模型变体，实现了4.71x到5.91x的每秒生成标记数，并缩小了与自回归模型的质量差距。

Conclusion: TiDAR通过并行起草和采样以及精确的KV缓存支持，首次实现了在高质量的同时，显著提升生成速度，是一种高效的语言模型架构。

Abstract: Diffusion language models hold the promise of fast parallel generation, while autoregressive (AR) models typically excel in quality due to their causal structure aligning naturally with language modeling. This raises a fundamental question: can we achieve a synergy with high throughput, higher GPU utilization, and AR level quality? Existing methods fail to effectively balance these two aspects, either prioritizing AR using a weaker model for sequential drafting (speculative decoding), leading to lower drafting efficiency, or using some form of left-to-right (AR-like) decoding logic for diffusion, which still suffers from quality degradation and forfeits its potential parallelizability. We introduce TiDAR, a sequence-level hybrid architecture that drafts tokens (Thinking) in Diffusion and samples final outputs (Talking) AutoRegressively - all within a single forward pass using specially designed structured attention masks. This design exploits the free GPU compute density, achieving a strong balance between drafting and verification capacity. Moreover, TiDAR is designed to be serving-friendly (low overhead) as a standalone model. We extensively evaluate TiDAR against AR models, speculative decoding, and diffusion variants across generative and likelihood tasks at 1.5B and 8B scales. Thanks to the parallel drafting and sampling as well as exact KV cache support, TiDAR outperforms speculative decoding in measured throughput and surpasses diffusion models like Dream and Llada in both efficiency and quality. Most notably, TiDAR is the first architecture to close the quality gap with AR models while delivering 4.71x to 5.91x more tokens per second.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用大语言模型（LLMs）生成和验证解释以检测自然语言推理（NLI）数据集中错误的新框架EVADE，通过减少人工标注轮次，有效降低了成本并提高了数据集质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自然语言推理（NLI）任务中，人类标注变异（HLV）使得难以区分标注错误与合理的标注变异。现有的VARIERR框架需要多轮人工标注，成本高昂且可能限制合理标签或解释的覆盖范围。

Method: 提出了一个名为EVADE的新框架，利用大语言模型（LLMs）生成和验证解释以检测错误。通过分布比较、验证重叠和模型微调影响进行综合分析，对比了人类和LLM检测的错误。

Result: 实验表明，LLM验证能细化生成的解释分布，使其更接近人类标注。从训练数据中去除LLM检测到的错误比去除人工标注者识别的错误能带来更好的微调性能提升。

Conclusion: EVADE框架展示了扩展错误检测的潜力，可以在减少人工努力的同时提高标签变异下的数据集质量。

Abstract: High-quality datasets are critical for training and evaluating reliable NLP models. In tasks like natural language inference (NLI), human label variation (HLV) arises when multiple labels are valid for the same instance, making it difficult to separate annotation errors from plausible variation. An earlier framework VARIERR (Weber-Genzel et al., 2024) asks multiple annotators to explain their label decisions in the first round and flag errors via validity judgments in the second round. However, conducting two rounds of manual annotation is costly and may limit the coverage of plausible labels or explanations. Our study proposes a new framework, EVADE, for generating and validating explanations to detect errors using large language models (LLMs). We perform a comprehensive analysis comparing human- and LLM-detected errors for NLI across distribution comparison, validation overlap, and impact on model fine-tuning. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM validation refines generated explanation distributions to more closely align with human annotations, and that removing LLM-detected errors from training data yields improvements in fine-tuning performance than removing errors identified by human annotators. This highlights the potential to scale error detection, reducing human effort while improving dataset quality under label variation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有潜在推理方法缺乏确保潜在表示稳定演化的机制，也缺乏系统性地交错隐式和显式推理的方法。

Method: SpiralThinker执行潜在表示的迭代更新，结合渐进对齐目标和结构化注释。

Result: 在数学、逻辑和常识推理任务中，SpiralThinker在所有基准测试中始终优于以前的潜在推理方法。

Conclusion: 迭代和对齐都是不可或缺的，潜在标记和迭代次数表现出数据集特定的最佳值，适当的对齐对有效的迭代过程至关重要。SpiralThinker成功桥接了迭代计算和潜在推理。

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models have been driven by reinforcement learning and test-time scaling, accompanied by growing interest in latent rather than purely textual reasoning. However, existing latent reasoning methods lack mechanisms to ensure stable evolution of latent representations and a systematic way to interleave implicit and explicit reasoning. We introduce SpiralThinker, a unified framework that performs iterative updates over latent representations, enabling extended implicit reasoning without generating additional tokens. A progressive alignment objective combined with structured annotations maintains coherence between latent and textual reasoning. Across mathematical, logical, and commonsense reasoning tasks, SpiralThinker achieves the best overall performance among latent reasoning approaches, consistently surpassing previous methods across all benchmarks. Detailed analyses reveal that both iteration and alignment are indispensable, the numbers of latent tokens and iterations exhibit dataset-specific optima, and appropriate alignment proves critical for an effective iterative process. Overall, SpiralThinker bridges iterative computation and latent reasoning, demonstrating that aligned iterative updates can reliably steer reasoning in the latent space.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对大语言模型在情感支持方面的新评估框架，从传统的静态评估转向动态轨迹评估，以更好地模拟和评估情感支持在长期对话中的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在情感支持方面的评估方法过于静态和简短，未能捕捉到情感支持的动态和长期特性，因此需要一种新的评估方法来填补这一空白。

Method: 采用用户中心视角，通过构建包含328个情感上下文和1,152个干扰事件的大规模基准，模拟真实情感变化。模型输出受到心理验证的情感调节策略的约束，用户情感轨迹建模为一阶马尔可夫过程，并采用因果调整的情感估计来获得无偏的情感状态追踪。引入了三个轨迹级指标：基线情感水平（BEL）、情感轨迹波动性（ETV）和情感质心位置（ECP）。

Result: 对多个大语言模型进行了广泛评估，发现它们在情感支持能力上存在显著差异，为模型开发提供了可操作的见解。

Conclusion: 新提出的动态轨迹评估框架能够更全面和准确地评估大语言模型在长期情感支持方面的性能，为未来模型改进提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Emotional support is a core capability in human-AI interaction, with applications including psychological counseling, role play, and companionship. However, existing evaluations of large language models (LLMs) often rely on short, static dialogues and fail to capture the dynamic and long-term nature of emotional support. To overcome this limitation, we shift from snapshot-based evaluation to trajectory-based assessment, adopting a user-centered perspective that evaluates models based on their ability to improve and stabilize user emotional states over time. Our framework constructs a large-scale benchmark consisting of 328 emotional contexts and 1,152 disturbance events, simulating realistic emotional shifts under evolving dialogue scenarios. To encourage psychologically grounded responses, we constrain model outputs using validated emotion regulation strategies such as situation selection and cognitive reappraisal. User emotional trajectories are modeled as a first-order Markov process, and we apply causally-adjusted emotion estimation to obtain unbiased emotional state tracking. Based on this framework, we introduce three trajectory-level metrics: Baseline Emotional Level (BEL), Emotional Trajectory Volatility (ETV), and Emotional Centroid Position (ECP). These metrics collectively capture user emotional dynamics over time and support comprehensive evaluation of long-term emotional support performance of LLMs. Extensive evaluations across a diverse set of LLMs reveal significant disparities in emotional support capabilities and provide actionable insights for model development.

Motivation: 大型语言模型因其固有的随机性，难以在严格监管的行业中应用。本文旨在解决这一限制，通过形式化自然语言策略，实现逻辑正确性验证。

Method: 该框架分为两个阶段：(1) 利用大型语言模型（可选择性的人类指导）将自然语言策略形式化；(2) 在推理时通过自动形式化验证自然语言陈述的逻辑正确性。当正确性至关重要时，通过多个冗余形式化步骤进行交叉验证。

Result: 基准测试表明，该方法超过了99%的健全性，意味着在识别逻辑有效性时几乎为零的误报率。

Conclusion: 该方法产生了可审计的逻辑工件，能够验证结果并用于改进原始文本，从而在逻辑正确性至关重要的领域提高模型可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models perform well at natural language interpretation and reasoning, but their inherent stochasticity limits their adoption in regulated industries like finance and healthcare that operate under strict policies. To address this limitation, we present a two-stage neurosymbolic framework that (1) uses LLMs with optional human guidance to formalize natural language policies, allowing fine-grained control of the formalization process, and (2) uses inference-time autoformalization to validate logical correctness of natural language statements against those policies. When correctness is paramount, we perform multiple redundant formalization steps at inference time, cross checking the formalizations for semantic equivalence. Our benchmarks demonstrate that our approach exceeds 99% soundness, indicating a near-zero false positive rate in identifying logical validity. Our approach produces auditable logical artifacts that substantiate the verification outcomes and can be used to improve the original text.

Conclusion: MM-CRITIC为评估和提升LMMs的批判能力提供了可靠的基准，并揭示了响应质量与批判能力之间的关系，以及不同维度的批判难度。

Abstract: The ability of critique is vital for models to self-improve and serve as reliable AI assistants. While extensively studied in language-only settings, multimodal critique of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) remains underexplored despite their growing capabilities in tasks like captioning and visual reasoning. In this work, we introduce MM-CRITIC, a holistic benchmark for evaluating the critique ability of LMMs across multiple dimensions: basic, correction, and comparison. Covering 8 main task types and over 500 tasks, MM-CRITIC collects responses from various LMMs with different model sizes and is composed of 4471 samples. To enhance the evaluation reliability, we integrate expert-informed ground answers into scoring rubrics that guide GPT-4o in annotating responses and generating reference critiques, which serve as anchors for trustworthy judgments. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of MM-CRITIC and provide a comprehensive assessment of leading LMMs' critique capabilities under multiple dimensions. Further analysis reveals some key insights, including the correlation between response quality and critique, and varying critique difficulty across evaluation dimensions.

Conclusion: 该框架灵活适应不同语速，有效提升长句识别的语义一致性，同时保持接近全局解码的性能。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a streaming speech recognition framework for Amdo Tibetan, built upon a hybrid CTC/Atten-tion architecture with a context-aware dynamic chunking mechanism. The proposed strategy adaptively adjusts chunk widths based on encoding states, enabling flexible receptive fields, cross-chunk information exchange, and robust adaptation to varying speaking rates, thereby alleviating the context truncation problem of fixed-chunk methods. To further capture the linguistic characteristics of Tibetan, we construct a lexicon grounded in its orthographic principles, providing linguistically motivated modeling units. During decoding, an external language model is integrated to enhance semantic consistency and improve recognition of long sentences. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves a word error rate (WER) of 6.23% on the test set, yielding a 48.15% relative improvement over the fixed-chunk baseline, while significantly reducing recognition latency and maintaining performance close to global decoding.

Conclusion: Bi-RAR框架通过双向评估和多目标优化，有效提升了复杂推理场景下的模型性能，为检索增强推理提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven to be effective in mitigating hallucinations in large language models, yet its effectiveness remains limited in complex, multi-step reasoning scenarios.Recent efforts have incorporated search-based interactions into RAG, enabling iterative reasoning with real-time retrieval. Most approaches rely on outcome-based supervision, offering no explicit guidance for intermediate steps. This often leads to reward hacking and degraded response quality. We propose Bi-RAR, a novel retrieval-augmented reasoning framework that evaluates each intermediate step jointly in both forward and backward directions. To assess the information completeness of each step, we introduce a bidirectional information distance grounded in Kolmogorov complexity, approximated via language model generation probabilities. This quantification measures both how far the current reasoning is from the answer and how well it addresses the question. To optimize reasoning under these bidirectional signals, we adopt a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework with a cascading reward structure that emphasizes early trajectory alignment. Empirical results on seven question answering benchmarks demonstrate that Bi-RAR surpasses previous methods and enables efficient interaction and reasoning with the search engine during training and inference.

Abstract: Personalized learning has gained attention in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) education, where engagement and motivation play crucial roles in reading comprehension. We propose a novel approach to generating personalized English reading comprehension tests tailored to students' interests. We develop a structured content transcreation pipeline using OpenAI's gpt-4o, where we start with the RACE-C dataset, and generate new passages and multiple-choice reading comprehension questions that are linguistically similar to the original passages but semantically aligned with individual learners' interests. Our methodology integrates topic extraction, question classification based on Bloom's taxonomy, linguistic feature analysis, and content transcreation to enhance student engagement. We conduct a controlled experiment with EFL learners in South Korea to examine the impact of interest-aligned reading materials on comprehension and motivation. Our results show students learning with personalized reading passages demonstrate improved comprehension and motivation retention compared to those learning with non-personalized materials.

Motivation: RoPE在Transformer模型中存在长度外推的固有限制，影响了注意力机制的有效性。

Method: 提出DoPE，一种基于截断矩阵熵的训练自由方法，通过检测特征图中的异常频率带，并用无参数高斯分布进行重参数化。

Result: 在needle-in-a-haystack和many-shot in-context learning任务上，DoPE显著提高了检索精度和推理稳定性，有效缓解了注意力汇聚现象。

Conclusion: 去噪位置编码策略简单而强大，能够改善长度泛化，为长上下文建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) in Transformer models has inherent limits that weaken length extrapolation. We reinterpret the attention map with positional encoding as a noisy feature map, and propose Denoising Positional Encoding (DoPE), a training-free method based on truncated matrix entropy to detect outlier frequency bands in the feature map. Leveraging the noise characteristics of the feature map, we further reparameterize it with a parameter-free Gaussian distribution to achieve robust extrapolation. Our method theoretically reveals the underlying cause of the attention sink phenomenon and its connection to truncated matrix entropy. Experiments on needle-in-a-haystack and many-shot in-context learning tasks demonstrate that DoPE significantly improves retrieval accuracy and reasoning stability across extended contexts (up to 64K tokens). The results show that the denoising strategy for positional embeddings effectively mitigates attention sinks and restores balanced attention patterns, providing a simple yet powerful solution for improving length generalization.

TL;DR: LoopTool是一个自动化的模型感知数据演化框架，通过集成数据合成和模型训练来增强大型语言模型的工具学习能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工具学习受限于静态合成数据管道，数据生成和模型训练分离，无法自适应聚焦模型的弱点并持续存在噪声标签，从而降低训练效率。

Method: LoopTool采用三个模块：1) GCP（贪婪能力探测）诊断模型的能力和失败；2) JGLV（判断引导标签验证）使用开源判断模型来发现和纠正标注错误；3) EDDE（错误驱动数据扩展）基于已识别的失败生成新的挑战样本。

Result: 使用LoopTool训练的8B模型在BFCL-v3和ACEBench基准测试中显著超越其32B数据生成器，并取得了同规模模型的最新最佳结果。

Conclusion: LoopTool的闭环自我优化数据管道能够极大增强大型语言模型的工具使用能力，并摆脱对昂贵闭源API的依赖。

Abstract: Augmenting Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools enables them to execute complex, multi-step tasks. However, tool learning is hampered by the static synthetic data pipelines where data generation and model training are executed as two separate, non-interactive processes. This approach fails to adaptively focus on a model's specific weaknesses and allows noisy labels to persist, degrading training efficiency. We introduce LoopTool, a fully automated, model-aware data evolution framework that closes this loop by tightly integrating data synthesis and model training. LoopTool iteratively refines both the data and the model through three synergistic modules: (1) Greedy Capability Probing (GCP) diagnoses the model's mastered and failed capabilities; (2) Judgement-Guided Label Verification (JGLV) uses an open-source judge model to find and correct annotation errors, progressively purifying the dataset; and (3) Error-Driven Data Expansion (EDDE) generates new, challenging samples based on identified failures. This closed-loop process operates within a cost-effective, open-source ecosystem, eliminating dependence on expensive closed-source APIs. Experiments show that our 8B model trained with LoopTool significantly surpasses its 32B data generator and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the BFCL-v3 and ACEBench benchmarks for its scale. Our work demonstrates that closed-loop, self-refining data pipelines can dramatically enhance the tool-use capabilities of LLMs.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在表格问答（TQA）中表现不佳，因为难以捕捉复杂表格结构，导致答案错误。

Method: 提出一种单元格提取方法，通过结合语言模型和TF-IDF的混合检索机制，计算问题-单元格相似度，并采用对比学习在问题-表头对的小数据集上训练语言模型。

Result: 在NTCIR-18的U4共享任务TQA数据集上，准确率达到74.6%，优于GPT-4o mini（63.9%）。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了复杂表头下TQA的准确率，未来计划引入更高效的文本搜索模型以进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining increased attention in the domain of Table Question Answering (TQA), particularly for extracting information from tables in documents. However, directly entering entire tables as long text into LLMs often leads to incorrect answers because most LLMs cannot inherently capture complex table structures. In this paper, we propose a cell extraction method for TQA without manual identification, even for complex table headers. Our approach estimates table headers by computing similarities between a given question and individual cells via a hybrid retrieval mechanism that integrates a language model and TF-IDF. We then select as the answer the cells at the intersection of the most relevant row and column. Furthermore, the language model is trained using contrastive learning on a small dataset of question-header pairs to enhance performance. We evaluated our approach in the TQA dataset from the U4 shared task at NTCIR-18. The experimental results show that our pipeline achieves an accuracy of 74.6\%, outperforming existing LLMs such as GPT-4o mini~(63.9\%). In the future, although we used traditional encoder models for retrieval in this study, we plan to incorporate more efficient text-search models to improve performance and narrow the gap with human evaluation results.

*Amal Sunny,Advay Gupta,Vishnu Sreekumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过实证验证了仅使用上下文项的顺序性度量在评估文章流畅性方面的有效性，发现其比原始的主题和上下文结合的度量更具预测价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的研究在量化叙事流畅性时，由于主题选择的问题，度量结果存在偏差，并且缺乏与真实流畅性度量的验证。因此，研究者提出仅使用上下文项作为更有效的替代方案，需要实证验证这一提议。

Method: 研究使用了两个带有手动评分的文章数据集（ASAP++和ELLIPSE），评估了不同版本的顺序性度量（仅上下文、仅主题、原始结合度量）在预测文章组织结构及连贯性方面的表现。

Result: 仅上下文版本的顺序性度量与人工评估的组织结构和连贯性评分更为一致，且在结合标准语言特征后，比仅使用主题或原始顺序性度量的预测效果更好，甚至优于零样本提示的LLMs。

Conclusion: 上下文为基础的顺序性度量被验证为一种可解释的、有效的补充特征，适用于自动文章评分及相关NLP任务。

Abstract: Recent work has proposed using Large Language Models (LLMs) to quantify narrative flow through a measure called sequentiality, which combines topic and contextual terms. A recent critique argued that the original results were confounded by how topics were selected for the topic-based component, and noted that the metric had not been validated against ground-truth measures of flow. That work proposed using only the contextual term as a more conceptually valid and interpretable alternative. In this paper, we empirically validate that proposal. Using two essay datasets with human-annotated trait scores, ASAP++ and ELLIPSE, we show that the contextual version of sequentiality aligns more closely with human assessments of discourse-level traits such as Organization and Cohesion. While zero-shot prompted LLMs predict trait scores more accurately than the contextual measure alone, the contextual measure adds more predictive value than both the topic-only and original sequentiality formulations when combined with standard linguistic features. Notably, this combination also outperforms the zero-shot LLM predictions, highlighting the value of explicitly modeling sentence-to-sentence flow. Our findings support the use of context-based sequentiality as a validated, interpretable, and complementary feature for automated essay scoring and related NLP tasks.

*Francois Meyer,Jan Buys*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了语言模型在预训练和微调过程中动态优化子词分词的学习动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究语言模型在训练过程中如何动态优化子词分词，以及子词在预训练和微调过程中的演变。

Method: 扩展了子词分段语言模型（SSLM）框架以支持预训练和微调，并在三种不同类型语言（isi-Xhosa、Setswana和English）上训练模型，从语言学角度分析子词动态。

Result: 发现了子词学习的四个阶段，复杂形态的isi-Xhosa表现出更大的不稳定性；微调过程中，子词边界变得更精细。

Conclusion: 可学习的子词为提高文本生成和跨语言迁移，特别是对于低资源和形态复杂的语言，提供了一种有前途的方法。

Abstract: Subword segmentation is typically applied in preprocessing and stays fixed during training. Alternatively, it can be learned during training to optimise the training objective. In this paper we study the learning dynamics of subword segmentation: if a language model can dynamically optimise tokenisation, how do its subwords evolve during pretraining and finetuning? To explore this, we extend the subword segmental language model (SSLM), a framework for learning subwords during training, to support pretraining and finetuning. We train models for three typologically diverse languages to study learning dynamics across the morphological spectrum: Isi-Xhosa is conjunctive (long word forms composed of many morphemes), Setswana is disjunctive (morphemes written as separate words), and English represents a typological middle ground. We analyse subword dynamics from a linguistic perspective, tracking morphology, productivity, and fertility. We identify four stages of subword learning, with the morphologically complex isi-Xhosa exhibiting greater instability. During finetuning, subword boundaries shift to become finer-grained. Lastly, we show that learnable subwords offers a promising approach to improve text generation and cross-lingual transfer for low-resource, morphologically complex languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习方法只优化最终任务结果，导致模型在早期训练中容易崩溃，特别是在诚实对齐方面。因此，需要一种方法来稳定训练过程，提高推理能力。

Method: 研究者们提出了Anchor方法，通过将真实轨迹注入到模型的rollouts中，以防止早期训练崩溃。此外，还构建了两个基于图结构的多步推理数据集，用于评估模型在可验证奖励下的表现。

Result: 实验表明，Anchor方法能够稳定学习过程，并显著提高推理性能。相比之下，GRPO方法在这些任务上表现不佳。课程学习虽然有一定好处，但需要精心设计的数据集。

Conclusion: Anchor方法通过改善训练动态，提高了语言模型在诚实对齐和推理方面的可靠性，强调了训练过程在实现可靠推理中的重要性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a promising framework for aligning language models with complex reasoning objectives. However, most existing methods optimize only for final task outcomes, leaving models vulnerable to collapse when negative rewards dominate early training. This challenge is especially pronounced in honesty alignment, where models must not only solve answerable queries but also identify when conclusions cannot be drawn from the given premises. Deductive reasoning provides an ideal testbed because it isolates reasoning capability from reliance on external factual knowledge. To investigate honesty alignment, we curate two multi-step deductive reasoning datasets from graph structures, one for linear algebra and one for logical inference, and introduce unanswerable cases by randomly perturbing an edge in half of the instances. We find that GRPO, with or without supervised fine tuning initialization, struggles on these tasks. Through extensive experiments across three models, we evaluate stabilization strategies and show that curriculum learning provides some benefit but requires carefully designed in distribution datasets with controllable difficulty. To address these limitations, we propose Anchor, a reinforcement learning method that injects ground truth trajectories into rollouts, preventing early training collapse. Our results demonstrate that this method stabilizes learning and significantly improves the overall reasoning performance, underscoring the importance of training dynamics for enabling reliable deductive reasoning in aligned language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视源语言之间的语义共性，导致翻译性能有偏。

Method: 引入偏差补偿模块进行粗略对齐，使用Q-Former施加token级OT约束，应用层调度策略集中OT约束在最语义受益的层。

Result: 在FLEURS数据集上实现SOTA性能，五种常见语言平均+0.93 BLEU，零样本语言+5.05 BLEU。

Conclusion: POTSA框架有效提升多语言语音到文本翻译性能，特别是在低资源语言上表现显著。

Abstract: Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have achieved breakthroughs in multilingual speech-to-text translation (S2TT). However, existing approaches often overlook semantic commonalities across source languages, leading to biased translation performance. In this work, we propose \textbf{POTSA} (Parallel Optimal Transport for Speech Alignment), a new framework based on cross-lingual parallel speech pairs and Optimal Transport (OT), designed to bridge high- and low-resource translation gaps. First, we introduce a Bias Compensation module to coarsely align initial speech representations across languages. Second, we impose token-level OT constraints on a Q-Former using parallel speech pairs to establish fine-grained consistency of representations. Then, we apply a layer scheduling strategy to focus OT constraints on the most semantically beneficial layers. Experiments on the FLEURS dataset show that our method achieves SOTA performance, with +0.93 BLEU on average over five common languages and +5.05 BLEU on zero-shot languages, using only 10 hours of parallel speech per source language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本生成模型在控制多个属性时面临挑战，特别是在属性需求冲突时缺乏协调机制。

Method: C$^3$TG框架在生成阶段通过加权KL散度调整token概率，优化阶段利用能量函数结合分类器评分和惩罚项，通过迭代反馈解决属性冲突。

Result: C$^3$TG在多个指标（属性准确性、语言流畅性和输出多样性）上显著优于基线，并减少了毒性。

Conclusion: C$^3$TG是一种有效且灵活的解决方案，用于多维文本属性控制，无需模型架构修改或大量微调。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable text generation capabilities. However, controlling specific attributes of generated text remains challenging without architectural modifications or extensive fine-tuning. Current methods typically toggle a single, basic attribute but struggle with precise multi-attribute control. In scenarios where attribute requirements conflict, existing methods lack coordination mechanisms, causing interference between desired attributes. Furthermore, these methods fail to incorporate iterative optimization processes in the controlled generation pipeline. To address these limitations, we propose Conflict-aware, Composite, and Collaborative Controlled Text Generation (C$^3$TG), a two-phase framework for fine-grained, multi-dimensional text attribute control. During generation, C$^3$TG selectively pairs the LLM with the required attribute classifiers from the 17 available dimensions and employs weighted KL-divergence to adjust token probabilities. The optimization phase then leverages an energy function combining classifier scores and penalty terms to resolve attribute conflicts through iterative feedback, enabling precise control over multiple dimensions simultaneously while preserving natural text flow. Experiments show that C$^3$TG significantly outperforms baselines across multiple metrics including attribute accuracy, linguistic fluency, and output diversity, while simultaneously reducing toxicity. These results establish C$^3$TG as an effective and flexible solution for multi-dimensional text attribute control that requires no costly model modifications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人们有不同的创意写作偏好，而现有的模型通常将不同的个人品味视为一个整体。为了实现个性化，需要能够适应用户偏好的模型。

Method: 通过60个人的阅读偏好构建了LiteraryTaste数据集，包括自述的阅读习惯和品味（陈述偏好）以及对100对短创意写作文本的偏好注释（揭示偏好）。

Result: 1) 人们在创意写作偏好上存在分歧；2) 微调transformer编码器建模个人和集体揭示偏好的准确率分别达到75.8%和67.7%；3) 陈述偏好在建模揭示偏好方面作用有限。

Conclusion: 该研究为个性化创意写作技术奠定了基础，并通过LLM驱动的可解释性流程分析了人们偏好的差异。

Abstract: People have different creative writing preferences, and large language models (LLMs) for these tasks can benefit from adapting to each user's preferences. However, these models are often trained over a dataset that considers varying personal tastes as a monolith. To facilitate developing personalized creative writing LLMs, we introduce LiteraryTaste, a dataset of reading preferences from 60 people, where each person: 1) self-reported their reading habits and tastes (stated preference), and 2) annotated their preferences over 100 pairs of short creative writing texts (revealed preference). With our dataset, we found that: 1) people diverge on creative writing preferences, 2) finetuning a transformer encoder could achieve 75.8% and 67.7% accuracy when modeling personal and collective revealed preferences, and 3) stated preferences had limited utility in modeling revealed preferences. With an LLM-driven interpretability pipeline, we analyzed how people's preferences vary. We hope our work serves as a cornerstone for personalizing creative writing technologies.

Abstract: Khmer polarity classification is a fundamental natural language processing task that assigns a positive, negative, or neutral label to a given Khmer text input. Existing Khmer models typically predict the label without explaining the rationale behind the prediction. This paper proposes an explainable Khmer polarity classifier by fine-tuning an instruction-based reasoning Qwen-3 model. The notion of explainability in this paper is limited to self-explanations, which the model uses to rationalize its predictions. Experimental results show that the fine-tuned model not only predicts labels accurately but also provides reasoning by identifying polarity-related keywords or phrases to support its predictions. In addition, we contribute a new Khmer polarity dataset consisting of short- to medium-length casual, romanized, and mixed-code Khmer expressions. This dataset was constructed using both heuristic rules and human curation and is publicly available through a gated Hugging Face repository (rinabuoy/khmerpolarity_nonreasoning). The fine-tuned Qwen-3 models are also made available in the same Hugging Face account.

Motivation: 当前方法在处理变长输入时采用固定删除率，导致性能不佳，需要一种能够根据输入特性动态调整的方法。

Result: 在自然语言任务中实现了强大的经验结果，认证的区域中位数提升了多达30个数量级。

Conclusion: AdaptDel方法在序列分类任务中显著提升了认证的鲁棒性，优于现有最先进的认证方法。

Abstract: We consider the problem of certified robustness for sequence classification against edit distance perturbations. Naturally occurring inputs of varying lengths (e.g., sentences in natural language processing tasks) present a challenge to current methods that employ fixed-rate deletion mechanisms and lead to suboptimal performance. To this end, we introduce AdaptDel methods with adaptable deletion rates that dynamically adjust based on input properties. We extend the theoretical framework of randomized smoothing to variable-rate deletion, ensuring sound certification with respect to edit distance. We achieve strong empirical results in natural language tasks, observing up to 30 orders of magnitude improvement to median cardinality of the certified region, over state-of-the-art certifications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在 multimodal reasoning 基准上表现良好，但难以区分真正的科学推理能力和简单的模式匹配能力。

Method: 引入了包含1,460道题目的mmJEE-Eval基准，题目来自2019-2025年印度JEE Advanced考试，涵盖大学预科物理、化学和数学领域，并对17个最先进的模型进行了评估。

Result: 前沿VLMs（如GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash）在2025年题目上的准确率为77-84%，而开源模型尽管参数规模达到400B，却只有37-45%的准确率。当推理负荷增加时，闭源模型（Google 和 OpenAI）表现显著下降（如GPT-5仅能修复5.2%的错误）。

Conclusion: mmJEE-Eval基准能够有效区分不同的训练和推理方法，其难度来自于复杂性和推理深度，而非记忆能力。作者公开了相关代码和数据。

Abstract: Contemporary vision-language models (VLMs) perform well on existing multimodal reasoning benchmarks (78-85\% accuracy on MMMU, MathVista). Yet, these results fail to sufficiently distinguish true scientific reasoning articulation capabilities from pattern-matching. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{mmJEE-Eval}, a multimodal bilingual (English and Hindi) benchmark comprising 1,460 questions from India's JEE Advanced examination (2019-2025) spanning pre-college Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics domains. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art models reveals that while frontier VLMs (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash) achieve 77-84\% accuracy on held-out 2025 questions, open-source models plateau at 37-45\% despite scaling to 400B parameters, a significant difference not observed on existing benchmarks. While closed frontiers from Google and OpenAI show high problem-solving accuracies (up to 100\% pass@3 scores), they fully collapse when the reasoning load is increased meta-cognitively (GPT-5 fixes just 5.2\% errors). Systematic ablations show mmJEE-Eval's difficulty stems from complexity and reasoning depth rather than memorization. Effectively, our benchmark segregates superior training and reasoning methodologies where alternatives fail. We publicly release our code and data: https://mmjee-eval.github.io

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的动态自洽性框架SeerSC，通过整合系统1和系统2推理，提升大语言模型在推理时的token效率和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test-time scaling虽然提高了大语言模型的推理性能，但也带来了巨大的计算开销。当前的方法在减少token消耗方面有所进展，但仍然受限于顺序请求的高延迟问题。

Method: SeerSC框架利用快速系统1计算给定查询的答案熵，该分数用于评估样本的扩展潜力，从而在系统2下实现动态自洽性。通过系统1提供的准确估计，该方法能够在减少token使用的同时，通过并行生成显著降低延迟。

Result: SeerSC在现有方法的基础上实现了高达47%的token消耗降低和43%的推理延迟减少，且没有显著的性能损失。

Conclusion: SeerSC通过整合系统1和系统2推理，有效提升了token效率和降低了推理延迟，为大规模语言模型的高效推理提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Test-time scaling improves the inference performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) but also incurs substantial computational costs. Although recent studies have reduced token consumption through dynamic self-consistency, they remain constrained by the high latency of sequential requests. In this paper, we propose SeerSC, a dynamic self-consistency framework that simultaneously improves token efficiency and latency by integrating System 1 and System 2 reasoning. Specifically, we utilize the rapid System 1 to compute the answer entropy for given queries. This score is then used to evaluate the potential of samples for scaling, enabling dynamic self-consistency under System 2. Benefiting from the advance and accurate estimation provided by System 1, the proposed method can reduce token usage while simultaneously achieving a significant decrease in latency through parallel generation. It outperforms existing methods, achieving up to a 47% reduction in token consumption and a 43% reduction in inference latency without significant performance loss.

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) for evaluating outputs is becoming an increasingly effective and scalable approach. However, it remains uncertain whether this capability extends beyond task-specific evaluations to more general assessments of text quality, particularly in multilingual contexts. In this study, we introduce, MTQ-Eval, a novel framework for multilingual text quality evaluation that learns from examples of both high- and low-quality texts, adjusting its internal representations. To develop MTQ-Eval, we first automatically generate text quality preference data and then use it to train open-source base LLMs to align with ratings of high- and low-quality text. Our comprehensive evaluation across 115 languages demonstrates the improved performance of the proposed model. Upon further analysis, we find that this enhanced evaluation capability also leads to notable improvements in downstream tasks.

Motivation: 现有的SPARQL到Cypher解析工具通常需要外部工具或RDF图，S2CLite旨在解决这些问题，实现无需外部依赖的解析。

Method: S2CLite采用纯基于规则的方法，类似于传统编程语言编译器，进行SPARQL到Cypher的翻译。

Result: 在BSBM42和Spider4SPARQL数据集上的实验显示，S2CLite显著减少了查询解析错误，在Spider4SPARQL上实现了77.8%的解析准确率，而现有最佳S2CTrans的准确率为44.2%。

Conclusion: S2CLite在解析准确性和执行准确性方面优于现有工具，并生成了包含4525个独特问题和2581个匹配查询的Spider4SSC数据集。

Abstract: We present Spider4SSC dataset and S2CLite parsing tool. S2CLite is a lightweight, ontology-agnostic parser that translates SPARQL queries into Cypher queries, enabling both in-situ and large-scale SPARQL to Cypher translation. Unlike existing solutions, S2CLite is purely rule-based (inspired by traditional programming language compilers) and operates without requiring an RDF graph or external tools. Experiments conducted on the BSBM42 and Spider4SPARQL datasets show that S2CLite significantly reduces query parsing errors, achieving a total parsing accuracy of 77.8% on Spider4SPARQL compared to 44.2% by the state-of-the-art S2CTrans. Furthermore, S2CLite achieved a 96.6\% execution accuracy on the intersecting subset of queries parsed by both parsers, outperforming S2CTrans by 7.3%. We further use S2CLite to parse Spider4SPARQL queries to Cypher and generate Spider4SSC, a unified Text-to-Query language (SQL, SPARQL, Cypher) dataset with 4525 unique questions and 3 equivalent sets of 2581 matching queries (SQL, SPARQL and Cypher). We open-source S2CLite for further development on GitHub (github.com/vejvarm/S2CLite) and provide the clean Spider4SSC dataset for download.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在自我修正方面表现出色，但其在开放式生成和多项选择任务中的表现及错误修正行为可能不同，这对于设计有效的自我修正机制具有重要意义。

Method: 通过比较不同自然语言理解和推理任务中语言模型的表现趋势和错误修正行为，涵盖了不同规模和系列的语言模型。

Conclusion: 自我修正机制的设计需要考虑任务结构和输出空间的互动，这对知识密集型推理和以决策为导向的LLM应用都有启示。

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated remarkable abilities to self-correct their responses through iterative refinement, often referred to as self-consistency or self-reflection. However, the dynamics of this self-correction mechanism may differ substantially depending on whether the model is tasked with open-ended text generation or with selecting the most appropriate response from multiple predefined options. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation of these two paradigms by comparing performance trends and error-correction behaviors across various natural language understanding and reasoning tasks, covering language models of different scales and families. Our experimental results reveal distinct patterns of improvement and failure modes:
  \textit{While open-ended generation often benefits from the flexibility of re-interpretation and compositional refinement, multiple-choice selection can leverage clearer solution boundaries but may be limited by the provided options}. This contrast also reflects the dual demands faced by emerging agentic LLM applications: effective agents must not only generate and refine open-ended plans or explanations, but also make reliable discrete choices when operating within constrained action spaces. Our findings, therefore, highlight that the design of self-correction mechanisms should take into account the interaction between task structure and output space, with implications for both knowledge-intensive reasoning and decision-oriented applications of LLMs.

*Lukas Arana,Julen Etxaniz,Ander Salaberria,Gorka Azkune*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文开发了一个针对巴斯克语的多模态大语言模型，展示了低比例的多模态数据（约20%）即可获得良好性能，且不必依赖巴斯克语指令调优的基座模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前开放科学社区在低资源语言的多模态大语言模型方面表现不佳，而商业MLLMs在低资源语言上表现尚可，因此本文旨在为巴斯克语开发一个强大的MLLM。

Method: 作者开发了自己的图像-文本训练和评估数据集，使用Llama-3.1-Instruct和巴斯克语适配模型Latxa作为骨干，探索不同的数据混合训练方案。

Result: 低比例的巴斯克多模态数据（约20%）足以在巴斯克语基准上取得良好结果，且不必依赖巴斯克语指令调优的基座模型。

Conclusion: 研究结果为开发其他低资源语言的MLLMs铺平了道路，作者公开了相关资源。

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models exhibit very strong performance for several demanding tasks. While commercial MLLMs deliver acceptable performance in low-resource languages, comparable results remain unattained within the open science community. In this paper, we aim to develop a strong MLLM for a low-resource language, namely Basque. For that purpose, we develop our own training and evaluation image-text datasets. Using two different Large Language Models as backbones, the Llama-3.1-Instruct model and a Basque-adapted variant called Latxa, we explore several data mixtures for training. We show that: i) low ratios of Basque multimodal data (around 20%) are already enough to obtain solid results on Basque benchmarks, and ii) contrary to expected, a Basque instructed backbone LLM is not required to obtain a strong MLLM in Basque. Our results pave the way to develop MLLMs for other low-resource languages by openly releasing our resources.

*Ruibo Deng,Duanyu Feng,Wenqiang Lei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的优化方法AMaPO，通过自适应边际调整来解决离线偏好优化中的过拟合和欠拟合困境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前离线偏好优化方法的有效性高度依赖于排名准确性，但现有边际设计会导致过拟合和欠拟合问题。

Method: AMaPO采用实例级自适应边际，通过Z-归一化和指数缩放动态调整学习力度，放大错误排名样本的梯度并抑制正确排名样本的梯度。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准测试中，AMaPO实现了更好的排名准确性和下游对齐性能，并有效缓解了核心过拟合和欠拟合问题。

Conclusion: AMaPO是一个简单而有原则的算法，能够显著提升离线偏好优化的效果。

Abstract: Offline preference optimization offers a simpler and more stable alternative to RLHF for aligning language models. However, their effectiveness is critically dependent on ranking accuracy, a metric where further gains are highly impactful. This limitation arises from a fundamental problem that we identify and formalize as the Overfitting-Underfitting Dilemma: current margin designs cause models to apply excessive, wasteful gradients to correctly ranked samples (overfitting) while providing insufficient corrective signals for misranked ones (underfitting). To resolve this dilemma, we propose Adaptive Margin-attached Preference Optimization (AMaPO), a simple yet principled algorithm. AMaPO employs an instance-wise adaptive margin, refined by Z-normalization and exponential scaling, which dynamically reallocates learning effort by amplifying gradients for misranked samples and suppressing them for correct ones. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks demonstrate that AMaPO not only achieves better ranking accuracy and superior downstream alignment performance, but targeted analysis also confirms that it successfully mitigates the core overfitting and underfitting issues.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 为解决心理咨询需求增长与服务供给不匹配问题，作者提出了CARE-Bench，一个动态且交互式的自动化评估基准，用于全面评估大型语言模型在心理咨询领域的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在心理咨询中的应用潜力巨大，但现有方法受限于非专业的客户模拟、静态问答评估格式和单一维度的评估指标，无法有效评估模型应对复杂多样客户的能力。

Method: CARE-Bench基于真实心理咨询案例构建多样化客户画像，并按照专家指南进行模拟。采用多维度的性能评估，使用已建立的心理学量表，对多个通用和专门心理咨询模型进行评估。

Result: 通过CARE-Bench评估，揭示了当前通用和专门心理咨询模型在处理不同类型客户互动时的局限，并进行了详细的失败原因分析。

Conclusion: CARE-Bench为评估和提升大型语言模型在心理咨询中的表现提供了新的基准和方向，有助于开发更全面、通用和有效的心理咨询模型。

Abstract: The mismatch between the growing demand for psychological counseling and the limited availability of services has motivated research into the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this domain. Consequently, there is a need for a robust and unified benchmark to assess the counseling competence of various LLMs. Existing works, however, are limited by unprofessional client simulation, static question-and-answer evaluation formats, and unidimensional metrics. These limitations hinder their effectiveness in assessing a model's comprehensive ability to handle diverse and complex clients. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{CARE-Bench}, a dynamic and interactive automated benchmark. It is built upon diverse client profiles derived from real-world counseling cases and simulated according to expert guidelines. CARE-Bench provides a multidimensional performance evaluation grounded in established psychological scales. Using CARE-Bench, we evaluate several general-purpose LLMs and specialized counseling models, revealing their current limitations. In collaboration with psychologists, we conduct a detailed analysis of the reasons for LLMs' failures when interacting with clients of different types, which provides directions for developing more comprehensive, universal, and effective counseling models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GSAP-ERE是一个细粒度数据集，用于从机器学习相关出版物中提取和连接信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从科学出版物中提取信息，以大规模识别有关研究概念和资源的信息，从而提高对机器学习相关研究的理解和可复现性。

Method: 引入了GSAP-ERE，一个手动策划的细粒度数据集，包含10种实体类型和18种语义分类关系类型。该数据集被用于微调模型以自动提取下游任务相关信息，并作为测试套件探索使用大型语言模型的信息提取提示策略。

Result: 微调的模型在实体识别（NER）和关系提取（RE）任务中性能优于最先进的大型语言模型提示方法（NER: 80.6%，RE: 54.0% vs. NER: 44.4%，RE: 10.1%）。

Conclusion: 监督模型与大型语言模型无监督使用之间的性能差距表明，像GSAP-ERE这样的数据集在推动学术信息提取领域的研究中至关重要。

Abstract: Research in Machine Learning (ML) and AI evolves rapidly. Information Extraction (IE) from scientific publications enables to identify information about research concepts and resources on a large scale and therefore is a pathway to improve understanding and reproducibility of ML-related research. To extract and connect fine-grained information in ML-related research, e.g. method training and data usage, we introduce GSAP-ERE. It is a manually curated fine-grained dataset with 10 entity types and 18 semantically categorized relation types, containing mentions of 63K entities and 35K relations from the full text of 100 ML publications. We show that our dataset enables fine-tuned models to automatically extract information relevant for downstream tasks ranging from knowledge graph (KG) construction, to monitoring the computational reproducibility of AI research at scale. Additionally, we use our dataset as a test suite to explore prompting strategies for IE using Large Language Models (LLM). We observe that the performance of state-of-the-art LLM prompting methods is largely outperformed by our best fine-tuned baseline model (NER: 80.6%, RE: 54.0% for the fine-tuned model vs. NER: 44.4%, RE: 10.1% for the LLM). This disparity of performance between supervised models and unsupervised usage of LLMs suggests datasets like GSAP-ERE are needed to advance research in the domain of scholarly information extraction.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的文本预筛选策略TPoT，用于从生成文本中预测个体的大五人格特质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从大量文本中预测人格特质具有挑战性，需要解决输入文本限制和提高预测准确性的问题。

Method: 引入了一种称为目标文本预选（TPoT）的策略，该方法通过语义筛选文本，输入到深度学习模型（BIG5-TPoT）中，以预测大五人格特质。

Result: TPoT策略不仅解决了大语言模型输入文本限制的问题，还在意识流散文数据集上提高了平均绝对误差和预测准确性。

Conclusion: 通过语义相关的文本预筛选，TPoT策略有效地提升了人格特质预测的性能。

Abstract: Predicting an individual's personalities from their generated texts is a challenging task, especially when the text volume is large. In this paper, we introduce a straightforward yet effective novel strategy called targeted preselection of texts (TPoT). This method semantically filters the texts as input to a deep learning model, specifically designed to predict a Big Five personality trait, facet, or item, referred to as the BIG5-TPoT model. By selecting texts that are semantically relevant to a particular trait, facet, or item, this strategy not only addresses the issue of input text limits in large language models but also improves the Mean Absolute Error and accuracy metrics in predictions for the Stream of Consciousness Essays dataset.

### [49] [Bridging Natural Language and ASP: A Hybrid Approach Using LLMs and AMR Parsing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08715)
*Connar Hite,Sean Saud,Raef Taha,Nayim Rahman,Tanvir Atahary,Scott Douglass,Tarek Taha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种将无约束英语翻译成ASP程序的新方法，结合LLM和AMR图，以解决逻辑谜题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了让不熟悉编程语言的用户能够与代码交互，需要一个能将自然语言转化为可执行程序的系统。

Method: 使用LLM简化自然语言句子并识别关键字，生成简单的事实，然后利用AMR图解析并系统化地生成ASP约束。

Result: 系统成功生成了完整的ASP程序，能够解决组合逻辑问题。

Conclusion: 这种方法在创建轻量级、可解释的自然语言转换系统方面是一个重要的初步步骤。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a declarative programming paradigm based on logic programming and non-monotonic reasoning. It is a tremendously powerful tool for describing and solving combinatorial problems. Like any other language, ASP requires users to learn how it works and the syntax involved. It is becoming increasingly required for those unfamiliar with programming languages to interact with code. This paper proposes a novel method of translating unconstrained English into ASP programs for logic puzzles using an LLM and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs. Everything from ASP rules, facts, and constraints is generated to fully represent and solve the desired problem. Example logic puzzles are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the system. While most current methods rely entirely on an LLM, our system minimizes the role of the LLM only to complete straightforward tasks. The LLM is used to simplify natural language sentences, identify keywords, and generate simple facts. The AMR graphs are then parsed from simplified language and used to generate ASP constraints systematically. The system successfully creates an entire ASP program that solves a combinatorial logic problem. This approach is a significant first step in creating a lighter-weight, explainable system that converts natural language to solve complex logic problems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于认知启发的神经符号方法，用于解决ARC-AGI的抽象推理挑战，通过结合VSAs与对象中心程序合成，实现了在少量样本下的高效学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ARC-AGI对现有AI系统仍极具挑战性，而人类却能轻松应对，因此需要模仿人类从神经科学到心理学的方法来提升AI的流体智力。

Method: 提出了一个认知上合理的ARC-AGI求解器，通过向量符号代数（VSA）结合系统1直觉和系统2推理，实现对象中心的程序合成，并使用神经符号方法。

Result: 在ARC-AGI-1-Train和ARC-AGI-1-Eval上分别达到10.8%和3.0%的得分；在Sort-of-ARC和1D-ARC上表现优异，分别为94.5%和83.1%，后者性能超越GPT-4且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: 首次将VSAs应用于ARC-AGI，开发出了目前最具认知合理性的ARC-AGI求解器，为人工智能在抽象推理任务中的发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) is a generative, few-shot fluid intelligence benchmark. Although humans effortlessly solve ARC-AGI, it remains extremely difficult for even the most advanced artificial intelligence systems. Inspired by methods for modelling human intelligence spanning neuroscience to psychology, we propose a cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver. Our solver integrates System 1 intuitions with System 2 reasoning in an efficient and interpretable process using neurosymbolic methods based on Vector Symbolic Algebras (VSAs). Our solver works by object-centric program synthesis, leveraging VSAs to represent abstract objects, guide solution search, and enable sample-efficient neural learning. Preliminary results indicate success, with our solver scoring 10.8% on ARC-AGI-1-Train and 3.0% on ARC-AGI-1-Eval. Additionally, our solver performs well on simpler benchmarks, scoring 94.5% on Sort-of-ARC and 83.1% on 1D-ARC -- the latter outperforming GPT-4 at a tiny fraction of the computational cost. Importantly, our approach is unique; we believe we are the first to apply VSAs to ARC-AGI and have developed the most cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver yet. Our code is available at: https://github.com/ijoffe/ARC-VSA-2025.

### [51] [Interpretable by Design: Query-Specific Neural Modules for Explainable Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08749)
*Mehrdad Zakershahrak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出QDIN架构，将强化学习系统设计为可查询环境知识的推理引擎，实现推断准确性和控制性能的解耦。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL仅关注最大化奖励，但确定性环境中智能体隐含丰富的环境知识，现有架构无法高效暴露这些信息。

Method: 设计Query Conditioned Deterministic Inference Networks (QDIN)，针对不同查询类型（策略、可达性、路径、比较）使用专用神经模块的统一架构。

Result: 推断准确率可达99%（可达性IoU），即使控制性能次优（31%回报）；专用查询架构优于统一模型和事后提取方法。

Conclusion: RL系统应从初始就设计为可查询知识库，这对可解释性、验证和人类-AI协作具有重要意义。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has traditionally focused on a singular objective: learning policies that select actions to maximize reward. We challenge this paradigm by asking: what if we explicitly architected RL systems as inference engines that can answer diverse queries about their environment? In deterministic settings, trained agents implicitly encode rich knowledge about reachability, distances, values, and dynamics - yet current architectures are not designed to expose this information efficiently. We introduce Query Conditioned Deterministic Inference Networks (QDIN), a unified architecture that treats different types of queries (policy, reachability, paths, comparisons) as first-class citizens, with specialized neural modules optimized for each inference pattern. Our key empirical finding reveals a fundamental decoupling: inference accuracy can reach near-perfect levels (99% reachability IoU) even when control performance remains suboptimal (31% return), suggesting that the representations needed for accurate world knowledge differ from those required for optimal control. Experiments demonstrate that query specialized architectures outperform both unified models and post-hoc extraction methods, while maintaining competitive control performance. This work establishes a research agenda for RL systems designed from inception as queryable knowledge bases, with implications for interpretability, verification, and human-AI collaboration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出UCO方法，通过多轮互动强化学习框架和双奖励机制，解决LLM作为智能导师时的动态适应性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督微调方法缺乏动态适应性，强化学习方法存在两大问题：仅以学生输出正确性评估教学效果，无法实时感知学生认知状态。

Method: 提出Unidirectional Cognitive Optimization (UCO)，采用多轮互动强化学习范式，包含Progress Reward（评估学生理解进展）和Scaffold Reward（动态识别最近发展区ZPD）两个奖励函数。

Result: 在BigMath和MathTutorBench基准测试中，UCO模型性能超过同等规模的11个基线模型，达到与先进闭源模型相当的水平。

Conclusion: UCO方法通过双奖励机制有效提升了LLM作为智能导师的动态适应能力，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are shifting from answer providers to intelligent tutors in educational settings, yet current supervised fine-tuning methods only learn surface teaching patterns without dynamic adaptation capabilities. Recent reinforcement learning approaches address this limitation but face two critical challenges. First, they evaluate teaching effectiveness solely based on whether students produce correct outputs, unable to distinguish whether students genuinely understand or echo teacher-provided answers during interaction. Second, they cannot perceive students' evolving cognitive states in real time through interactive dialogue, thus failing to adapt teaching strategies to match students' cognitive levels dynamically. We propose the Unidirectional Cognitive Optimization (UCO) method to address these challenges. UCO uses a multi-turn interactive reinforcement learning paradigm where the innovation lies in two synergistic reward functions: the Progress Reward captures students' cognitive advancement, evaluating whether students truly transition from confusion to comprehension, while the Scaffold Reward dynamically identifies each student's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), encouraging teachers to maintain productive teaching within this zone. We evaluate UCO by comparing it against 11 baseline models on BigMath and MathTutorBench benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our UCO model outperforms all models of equivalent scale and achieves performance comparable to advanced closed-source models.

Conclusion: Lumine 在多种不同世界和交互场景中表现出色，标志着向开放环境中的通用智能体迈进了一步。

Abstract: We introduce Lumine, the first open recipe for developing generalist agents capable of completing hours-long complex missions in real time within challenging 3D open-world environments. Lumine adopts a human-like interaction paradigm that unifies perception, reasoning, and action in an end-to-end manner, powered by a vision-language model. It processes raw pixels at 5 Hz to produce precise 30 Hz keyboard-mouse actions and adaptively invokes reasoning only when necessary. Trained in Genshin Impact, Lumine successfully completes the entire five-hour Mondstadt main storyline on par with human-level efficiency and follows natural language instructions to perform a broad spectrum of tasks in both 3D open-world exploration and 2D GUI manipulation across collection, combat, puzzle-solving, and NPC interaction. In addition to its in-domain performance, Lumine demonstrates strong zero-shot cross-game generalization. Without any fine-tuning, it accomplishes 100-minute missions in Wuthering Waves and the full five-hour first chapter of Honkai: Star Rail. These promising results highlight Lumine's effectiveness across distinct worlds and interaction dynamics, marking a concrete step toward generalist agents in open-ended environments.

*Xiaohan Zhang,Tian Gao,Mingyue Cheng,Bokai Pan,Ze Guo,Yaguo Liu,Xiaoyu Tao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AlphaCast 提出了一种结合人类智慧和大型语言模型（LLM）智能的交互式时间序列预测框架，旨在通过多源信息准备和生成推理优化预测过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的时间序列预测方法多为静态一次性映射任务，缺乏人类专家的交互性、推理性和适应性，限制了复杂现实环境中的应用。

Method: AlphaCast 框架包含两个阶段：(1) 自动化预测准备阶段，构建多源认知基础，包括特征集、领域知识库、上下文存储库和案例库；(2) 生成推理与反思优化阶段，通过整合统计时间特征、先验知识、上下文信息和预测策略，触发元推理循环进行自我修正和策略优化。

Result: 在短期和长期数据集上的广泛实验表明，AlphaCast 在预测准确性方面始终优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: AlphaCast 通过人类智慧与LLM智能的协同推理，成功地将预测重新定义为一个交互式过程，显著提升了时间序列预测的性能。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in high-stakes domains such as energy, healthcare, and climate. Although recent advances have improved accuracy, most approaches still treat forecasting as a static one-time mapping task, lacking the interaction, reasoning, and adaptability of human experts. This gap limits their usefulness in complex real-world environments. To address this, we propose AlphaCast, a human wisdom-large language model (LLM) intelligence co-reasoning framework that redefines forecasting as an interactive process. The key idea is to enable step-by-step collaboration between human wisdom and LLM intelligence to jointly prepare, generate, and verify forecasts. The framework consists of two stages: (1) automated prediction preparation, where AlphaCast builds a multi-source cognitive foundation comprising a feature set that captures key statistics and time patterns, a domain knowledge base distilled from corpora and historical series, a contextual repository that stores rich information for each time window, and a case base that retrieves optimal strategies via pattern clustering and matching; and (2) generative reasoning and reflective optimization, where AlphaCast integrates statistical temporal features, prior knowledge, contextual information, and forecasting strategies, triggering a meta-reasoning loop for continuous self-correction and strategy refinement. Extensive experiments on short- and long-term datasets show that AlphaCast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/SkyeGT/AlphaCast_Official .

Result: 成功解决超过一百万步骤的任务，零错误，具备进一步扩展潜力。

Conclusion: 极端分解和纠错结合可实现大规模任务扩展，提示未来可能通过分解智能体过程（MDAPs）高效解决问题。

Abstract: LLMs have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in reasoning, insights, and tool use, but chaining these abilities into extended processes at the scale of those routinely executed by humans, organizations, and societies has remained out of reach. The models have a persistent error rate that prevents scale-up: for instance, recent experiments in the Towers of Hanoi benchmark domain showed that the process inevitably becomes derailed after at most a few hundred steps. Thus, although LLM research is often still benchmarked on tasks with relatively few dependent logical steps, there is increasing attention on the ability (or inability) of LLMs to perform long range tasks. This paper describes MAKER, the first system that successfully solves a task with over one million LLM steps with zero errors, and, in principle, scales far beyond this level. The approach relies on an extreme decomposition of a task into subtasks, each of which can be tackled by focused microagents. The high level of modularity resulting from the decomposition allows error correction to be applied at each step through an efficient multi-agent voting scheme. This combination of extreme decomposition and error correction makes scaling possible. Thus, the results suggest that instead of relying on continual improvement of current LLMs, massively decomposed agentic processes (MDAPs) may provide a way to efficiently solve problems at the level of organizations and societies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶系统在面对复杂和危险驾驶情况时，缺乏实时监控和适应性反应的能力，这影响了系统的安全性和稳定性。

Method: 设计了Argus框架，能够持续监控ADS生成的轨迹以检测潜在危险，并通过危险缓解器在不安全时无缝接管控制。该框架与三种先进端到端ADS集成。

Result: Argus有效增强了ADS的弹性，使驾驶评分平均提高150.30%，防止了高达64.38%的违规行为，几乎没有额外的时间开销。

Conclusion: Argus框架显著提高了ADS在复杂驾驶场景中的安全性和稳定性，为自动驾驶系统的实际应用提供了重要保障。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems (ADSs), with their strong capabilities in environmental perception and generalizable driving decisions, are attracting growing attention from both academia and industry. However, once deployed on public roads, ADSs are inevitably exposed to diverse driving hazards that may compromise safety and degrade system performance. This raises a strong demand for resilience of ADSs, particularly the capability to continuously monitor driving hazards and adaptively respond to potential safety violations, which is crucial for maintaining robust driving behaviors in complex driving scenarios.
  To bridge this gap, we propose a runtime resilience-oriented framework, Argus, to mitigate the driving hazards, thus preventing potential safety violations and improving the driving performance of an ADS. Argus continuously monitors the trajectories generated by the ADS for potential hazards and, whenever the EGO vehicle is deemed unsafe, seamlessly takes control through a hazard mitigator. We integrate Argus with three state-of-the-art end-to-end ADSs, i.e., TCP, UniAD and VAD. Our evaluation has demonstrated that Argus effectively and efficiently enhances the resilience of ADSs, improving the driving score of the ADS by up to 150.30% on average, and preventing up to 64.38% of the violations, with little additional time overhead.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are poised to revolutionize emergency services by enabling faster, safer, and more efficient responses. This transformation is driven by advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Reinforcement Learning (RL), which allows AVs to navigate complex environments and make critical decisions in real time. However, conventional RL paradigms often suffer from poor sample efficiency and lack adaptability in dynamic emergency scenarios. This paper reviews next-generation AV optimization strategies to address these limitations. We analyze the shift from conventional RL to Diffusion Model (DM)-augmented RL, which enhances policy robustness through synthetic data generation, albeit with increased computational cost. Additionally, we explore the emerging paradigm of Large Language Model (LLM)-assisted In-Context Learning (ICL), which offers a lightweight and interpretable alternative by enabling rapid, on-the-fly adaptation without retraining. By reviewing the state of the art in AV intelligence, DM-augmented RL, and LLM-assisted ICL, this paper provides a critical framework for understanding the next generation of autonomous emergency response systems from a Generative AI perspective.

*Zezhen Ding,Zhen Tan,Jiheng Zhang,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出OR-R1，一种数据高效训练框架，用于自动化优化建模和求解，通过监督微调和测试时组相对策略优化，显著减少数据需求并提高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将自然语言问题转化为形式化模型及求解代码的过程需要大量专业知识，现有LLM方法泛化能力有限且依赖大量标注数据，导致高成本与扩展性差。

Method: OR-R1采用两阶段设计：1）监督微调（SFT）帮助模型从少量标注数据中学习建模和代码生成；2）测试时组相对策略优化（TGRPO）提升能力与一致性，有效利用未标注数据。

Result: 仅使用1/10合成数据，OR-R1平均求解准确率达67.7%，比ORLM高4.2%；100样本下超ORLM 2.4%；TGRPO额外提升3.1%-6.4%，Pass@1与Pass@8差距从13%缩至7%。

Conclusion: OR-R1在多个真实基准测试中表现稳健，降低了工业OR应用的专业知识和数据壁垒，为自动化优化问题提供了一种可扩展、低成本的解决方案。

Abstract: Optimization modeling and solving are fundamental to the application of Operations Research (OR) in real-world decision making, yet the process of translating natural language problem descriptions into formal models and solver code remains highly expertise intensive. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new opportunities for automation, the generalization ability and data efficiency of existing LLM-based methods are still limited, asmost require vast amounts of annotated or synthetic data, resulting in high costs and scalability barriers. In this work, we present OR-R1, a data-efficient training framework for automated optimization modeling and solving. OR-R1 first employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to help the model acquire the essential reasoning patterns for problem formulation and code generation from limited labeled data. In addition, it improves the capability and consistency through Test-Time Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO). This two-stage design enables OR-R1 to leverage both scarce labeled and abundant unlabeled data for effective learning. Experiments show that OR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average solving accuracy of $67.7\%$, using only $1/10$ the synthetic data required by prior methods such as ORLM, exceeding ORLM's solving accuracy by up to $4.2\%$. Remarkably, OR-R1 outperforms ORLM by over $2.4\%$ with just $100$ synthetic samples. Furthermore, TGRPO contributes an additional $3.1\%-6.4\%$ improvement in accuracy, significantly narrowing the gap between single-attempt (Pass@1) and multi-attempt (Pass@8) performance from $13\%$ to $7\%$. Extensive evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that OR-R1 provides a robust, scalable, and cost-effective solution for automated OR optimization problem modeling and solving, lowering the expertise and data barriers for industrial OR applications.

*Yuhao Wang,Xiaopeng Li,Cheng Gong,Ziru Liu,Suiyun Zhang,Rui Liu,Xiangyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新方法，通过训练简洁性奖励模型（CRM）和引入简洁性奖励函数（CRF），以减少大推理模型（LRMs）中的过度思考问题，提高推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大推理模型在推理过程中常产生冗余或无关的推理步骤（过度思考），导致计算成本增加。现有方法在奖励函数中引入长度惩罚，但存在长度坍塌和训练坍塌问题。

Method: 提出了一个训练简洁性奖励模型（CRM）的流程，并引入了一种名为简洁性奖励函数（CRF）的新奖励公式，明确依赖结果奖励和简洁性评分。

Result: 在五个数学基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法有效且具有良好的标记效率，在Qwen2.5-7B上实现了8.1%的准确率提升和19.9%的响应标记长度减少。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了推理的效率和效果，还展示了良好的泛化能力，适用于其他大语言模型，如Llama和Mistral。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling the development of large reasoning models (LRMs). However, LRMs such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 often generate verbose responses containing redundant or irrelevant reasoning step-a phenomenon known as overthinking-which substantially increases computational costs. Prior efforts to mitigate this issue commonly incorporate length penalties into the reward function, but we find they frequently suffer from two critical issues: length collapse and training collapse, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address them, we propose a pipeline for training a Conciseness Reward Model (CRM) that scores the conciseness of reasoning path. Additionally, we introduce a novel reward formulation named Conciseness Reward Function (CRF) with explicit dependency between the outcome reward and conciseness score, thereby fostering both more effective and more efficient reasoning. From a theoretical standpoint, we demonstrate the superiority of the new reward from the perspective of variance reduction and improved convergence properties. Besides, on the practical side, extensive experiments on five mathematical benchmark datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and token efficiency, which achieves an 8.1% accuracy improvement and a 19.9% reduction in response token length on Qwen2.5-7B. Furthermore, the method generalizes well to other LLMs including Llama and Mistral. The implementation code and datasets are publicly available for reproduction: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CRM.

*Yi-Hsien Hsieh,Ta-Jung Chien,Chun-Kai Huang,Shao-Hua Sun,Che Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出MedFuse框架，利用MuFuse模块通过乘法调制融合特征和数值嵌入，以处理不规则临床时间序列。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床时间序列具有不规则性，现有嵌入策略在捕捉值依赖性特征交互方面存在局限。

Method: MedFuse框架核心是MuFuse模块，通过乘法调制融合特征和值嵌入，以保留特征特定信息并建模特征间的高阶依赖关系。

Result: 在三个真实世界数据集上，MedFuse在关键预测任务中持续优于最先进的基线方法，并展示了乘法融合增强的表达能力和跨数据集预训练支持。

Conclusion: MedFuse为不规则临床时间序列建模提供了可推广的方法。

Abstract: Clinical time series derived from electronic health records (EHRs) are inherently irregular, with asynchronous sampling, missing values, and heterogeneous feature dynamics. While numerical laboratory measurements are highly informative, existing embedding strategies usually combine feature identity and value embeddings through additive operations, which constrains their ability to capture value-dependent feature interactions. We propose MedFuse, a framework for irregular clinical time series centered on the MuFuse (Multiplicative Embedding Fusion) module. MuFuse fuses value and feature embeddings through multiplicative modulation, preserving feature-specific information while modeling higher-order dependencies across features. Experiments on three real-world datasets covering both intensive and chronic care show that MedFuse consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on key predictive tasks. Analysis of the learned representations further demonstrates that multiplicative fusion enhances expressiveness and supports cross-dataset pretraining. These results establish MedFuse as a generalizable approach for modeling irregular clinical time series.

*Minlan Shao,Zijian Zhang,Yili Wang,Yiwei Dai,Xu Shen,Xin Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的交通流量预测框架HyperD，通过将交通数据分解为周期性和残差成分来提高预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通预测面临复杂空间依赖和多尺度周期性模式与不规则波动共存的挑战，需要一种更有效的建模方法。

Method: HyperD框架通过混合周期性表示模块和频率感知残差表示模块分别处理周期性和残差成分，并引入双视图对齐损失以确保语义分离。

Result: 在四个真实世界交通数据集上的实验表明，HyperD实现了最先进的预测精度，具有更强的抗干扰能力和更高的计算效率。

Conclusion: HyperD框架通过分离和专门处理交通数据的不同成分，显著提升了交通流量预测的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate traffic forecasting plays a vital role in intelligent transportation systems, enabling applications such as congestion control, route planning, and urban mobility optimization.However, traffic forecasting remains challenging due to two key factors: (1) complex spatial dependencies arising from dynamic interactions between road segments and traffic sensors across the network, and (2) the coexistence of multi-scale periodic patterns (e.g., daily and weekly periodic patterns driven by human routines) with irregular fluctuations caused by unpredictable events (e.g., accidents, weather, or construction). To tackle these challenges, we propose HyperD (Hybrid Periodic Decoupling), a novel framework that decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components. The periodic component is handled by the Hybrid Periodic Representation Module, which extracts fine-grained daily and weekly patterns using learnable periodic embeddings and spatial-temporal attention. The residual component, which captures non-periodic, high-frequency fluctuations, is modeled by the Frequency-Aware Residual Representation Module, leveraging complex-valued MLP in frequency domain. To enforce semantic separation between the two components, we further introduce a Dual-View Alignment Loss, which aligns low-frequency information with the periodic branch and high-frequency information with the residual branch. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that HyperD achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, while offering superior robustness under disturbances and improved computational efficiency compared to existing methods.

*Roland Aydin,Christian Cyron,Steve Bachelor,Ashton Anderson,Robert West*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出从“模型训练”到“模型养育”的范式转变，通过重新设计训练语料库将价值观融入AI模型开发的初始阶段，使知识、技能和价值观更紧密地结合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI训练方法在模型核心能力建立后才进行价值观对齐，导致模型容易失调和缺乏根深蒂固的价值观。

Method: 重新设计训练语料库，包括第一人称视角重构数据、将信息重新情境化为生活经验、模拟社交互动以及搭建训练数据的顺序结构。

Result: 期望从第一个训练标记开始，模型能够早期承诺价值观，使知识、技能和价值观内在更难分离。

Conclusion: 在大型语言模型能力在许多任务中超过人类能力的生态系统中，这种将价值观早期融入的方法是迫切需要的。

Abstract: Current AI training methods align models with human values only after their core capabilities have been established, resulting in models that are easily misaligned and lack deep-rooted value systems. We propose a paradigm shift from "model training" to "model raising", in which alignment is woven into a model's development from the start. We identify several key components for this paradigm, all centered around redesigning the training corpus: reframing training data from a first-person perspective, recontextualizing information as lived experience, simulating social interactions, and scaffolding the ordering of training data. We expect that this redesign of the training corpus will lead to an early commitment to values from the first training token onward, such that knowledge, skills, and values are intrinsically much harder to separate. In an ecosystem in which large language model capabilities start overtaking human capabilities in many tasks, this seems to us like a critical need.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI和LLM主要推动的是定量研究的自动化，而定性研究在科学意义构建和全面理解方面被忽视，存在AI应用的关键空白。

Method: 通过回顾最近的文献，提出应自下而上为解释性研究开发专用的定性AI系统，并探讨如何增强现有的自动化发现流程。

Result: 指出了现有通用AI工具在定性研究中的局限性，并强调了开发透明、可重复和隐私友好的定性AI系统的必要性。

Conclusion: 开发专门用于定性研究的AI系统可以推动多学科和混合方法研究的发展，填补AI在科学研究中定性维度的空白。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLM) are reshaping science, with most recent advances culminating in fully-automated scientific discovery pipelines. But qualitative research has been left behind. Researchers in qualitative methods are hesitant about AI adoption. Yet when they are willing to use AI at all, they have little choice but to rely on general-purpose tools like ChatGPT to assist with interview interpretation, data annotation, and topic modeling - while simultaneously acknowledging these system's well-known limitations of being biased, opaque, irreproducible, and privacy-compromising. This creates a critical gap: while AI has substantially advanced quantitative methods, the qualitative dimensions essential for meaning-making and comprehensive scientific understanding remain poorly integrated. We argue for developing dedicated qualitative AI systems built from the ground up for interpretive research. Such systems must be transparent, reproducible, and privacy-friendly. We review recent literature to show how existing automated discovery pipelines could be enhanced by robust qualitative capabilities, and identify key opportunities where safe qualitative AI could advance multidisciplinary and mixed-methods research.

Motivation: 研究大语言模型在规划任务中的推理能力，特别是在面对标准与混淆PDDL领域时的表现，旨在衡量这些模型与专用规划器的性能差距。

Method: 对DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5和基准规划器LAMA在最新国际规划竞赛学习赛道部分领域的表现进行了评估，测试了标准PDDL领域和混淆PDDL领域的任务解决能力。

Result: 在标准PDDL领域，GPT-5的任务解决性能与LAMA相当。在混淆PDDL领域，所有大语言模型的性能有所下降，但下降幅度小于早期模型的报告。

Conclusion: 前沿大语言模型在规划任务中表现出显著进步，缩小了与专用规划器在挑战性基准上的性能差距。

Abstract: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning remains an active area of research, with the capabilities of frontier models continually advancing. We provide an updated evaluation of the end-to-end planning performance of three frontier LLMs as of 2025, where models are prompted to generate a plan from PDDL domain and task descriptions. We evaluate DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5 and as reference the planner LAMA on a subset of domains from the most recent Learning Track of the International Planning Competition. Our results show that on standard PDDL domains, the performance of GPT-5 in terms of solved tasks is competitive with LAMA. When the PDDL domains and tasks are obfuscated to test for pure reasoning, the performance of all LLMs degrades, though less severely than previously reported for other models. These results show substantial improvements over prior generations of LLMs, reducing the performance gap to planners on a challenging benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在高维数据中科学发现时访问学习到的表示中的信息，需要分离条件信息和非条件信息。

Method: 使用latent flow matching结合classifier-free guidance，通过在潜在空间中分离条件信息和非条件信息。

Result: 在2D高斯合成问题、彩色MNIST和Galaxy10天文数据集上的实验表明，该方法能够访问高维数据的有意义特征。

Abstract: Accessing information in learned representations is critical for scientific discovery in high-dimensional domains. We introduce a novel method based on latent flow matching with classifier-free guidance that disentangles latent subspaces by explicitly separating information included in conditioning from information that remains in the residual representation. Across three experiments -- a synthetic 2D Gaussian toy problem, colored MNIST, and the Galaxy10 astronomy dataset -- we show that our method enables access to meaningful features of high dimensional data. Our results highlight a simple yet powerful mechanism for analyzing, controlling, and repurposing latent representations, providing a pathway toward using generative models for scientific exploration of what we don't capture, consider, or catalog.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出CrochetBench，一个用于评估多模态大语言模型在钩针领域细粒度、低层次过程推理能力的基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 与以往关注高层次描述或视觉问答的基准不同，CrochetBench强调从描述到实际操作，要求模型识别针法、选择结构合适的指令并生成可执行的钩针过程。

Method: 采用CrochetPARADE DSL作为中间表示，通过结构验证和执行进行功能评估，涵盖针法分类、指令接地、自然语言和图像到DSL的翻译任务。

Result: 在所有任务中，当评估从表面相似性转向可执行正确性时，性能显著下降，暴露出模型在长程符号推理和三维过程综合方面的局限性。

Conclusion: CrochetBench为评估多模态模型的过程能力提供了新视角，突显了表面理解和实际执行精度之间的差距。

Abstract: We present CrochetBench, a benchmark for evaluating the ability of multimodal large language models to perform fine-grained, low-level procedural reasoning in the domain of crochet. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on high-level description or visual question answering, CrochetBench shifts the emphasis from describing to doing: models are required to recognize stitches, select structurally appropriate instructions, and generate compilable crochet procedures. We adopt the CrochetPARADE DSL as our intermediate representation, enabling structural validation and functional evaluation via execution. The benchmark covers tasks including stitch classification, instruction grounding, and both natural language and image-to-DSL translation. Across all tasks, performance sharply declines as the evaluation shifts from surface-level similarity to executable correctness, exposing limitations in long-range symbolic reasoning and 3D-aware procedural synthesis. CrochetBench offers a new lens for assessing procedural competence in multimodal models and highlights the gap between surface-level understanding and executable precision in real-world creative domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过聚合多个生成模型来增强AI安全性的新方法，该方法是架构无关的，并采用共识采样算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多AI安全性方法依赖于检查模型输出或激活，但某些风险仅靠检查无法检测到，需要一种新的互补方法。

Method: 提出了一种共识采样算法，通过聚合多个生成模型，在给定k个模型和一个提示时，实现与k个模型中最安全s个模型平均风险相当的风险水平，并在模型间缺乏足够一致时放弃。

Result: 该方法在模型足够安全且表现一致时，能有效限制放弃的概率，并提供安全保证。

Conclusion: 尽管存在一些限制，如需要安全模型间有重叠和无法保护所有模型都不安全的情况，该方法通过聚合模型提供了一种新的、模型无关的AI安全性增强方式。

Abstract: Many approaches to AI safety rely on inspecting model outputs or activations, yet certain risks are inherently undetectable by inspection alone. We propose a complementary, architecture-agnostic approach that enhances safety through the aggregation of multiple generative models, with the aggregated model inheriting its safety from the safest subset of a given size among them. Specifically, we present a consensus sampling algorithm that, given $k$ models and a prompt, achieves risk competitive with the average risk of the safest $s$ of the $k$ models, where $s$ is a chosen parameter, while abstaining when there is insufficient agreement between them. The approach leverages the models' ability to compute output probabilities, and we bound the probability of abstention when sufficiently many models are safe and exhibit adequate agreement. The algorithm is inspired by the provable copyright protection algorithm of Vyas et al. (2023). It requires some overlap among safe models, offers no protection when all models are unsafe, and may accumulate risk over repeated use. Nonetheless, our results provide a new, model-agnostic approach for AI safety by amplifying safety guarantees from an unknown subset of models within a collection to that of a single reliable model.
