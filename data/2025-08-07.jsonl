Despite its advantages,\ndeveloping VR applications for training remains a significant challenge due to\nthe time, expertise, and resources required to create accurate and engaging\ninstructional content. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a\nnovel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the\ngeneration of virtual instructions from textual input. The system comprises two\ncore components: an LLM module that extracts task-relevant information from the\ntext, and an intelligent module that transforms this information into animated\ndemonstrations and visual cues within a VR environment. The intelligent module\nreceives input from the LLM module and interprets the extracted information.\nBased on this, an instruction generator creates training content using relevant\ndata from a database. The instruction generator generates the instruction by\nchanging the color of virtual objects and creating animations to illustrate\ntasks. This approach enhances training effectiveness and reduces development\noverhead, making VR-based training more scalable and adaptable to evolving\nindustrial needs."}

The\neffectiveness of these algorithms can be significantly compromised when the\npoint sets to be predicted are noisy. To mitigate this issue, outlier detection\nand removal algorithms are often applied before the circle fitting procedure.\nThis study introduces the Polar Coordinate-Based Outlier Detection (PCOD)\nalgorithm, which can be effectively employed in circle fitting applications. In\nthe proposed approach, the point set is first transformed into polar\ncoordinates, followed by the calculation of both local and global standard\ndeviations. Outliers are then identified by comparing local mean values with\nthe global standard deviation. The practicality and efficiency of the proposed\nmethod are demonstrated by focusing on the high-precision diameter measurement\nof industrial washer parts.

However,\ndespite the use of such equipment, measurement errors can occur due to\nmechanical and software-related factors within the system. These errors are\nparticularly evident in applications where parts of different diameters are\nmeasured using the same setup. This study proposes two innovative approaches to\nenhance measurement accuracy using multiple known reference parts: a conversion\nfactor-based method and a pixel-based method. In the first approach, the\nconversion factor is estimated from known references to calculate the diameter\n(mm) of the unknown part. In the second approach, the diameter (mm) is directly\nestimated using pixel-based diameter information from the references. The\nexperimental setup includes an industrial-grade camera and telecentric lenses.\nTests conducted on glass samples (1-12 mm) and metal workpieces (3-24 mm) show\nthat measurement errors, which originally ranged from 13-114 micrometers, were\nreduced to 1-2 micrometers using the proposed methods. By utilizing only a few\nknown reference parts, the proposed approach enables high-accuracy measurement\nof all parts within the camera's field of view.

We prompt GPT-4 Turbo to generate over 7,200 stories about\nsignificant life events (such as weddings) in India, using prompts designed to\nencourage diversity to varying extents.

The challenges and cognitive load experienced by facilitators\ncreate a critical gap for an embodied technology that can interpret social\nexchanges while remaining aware of the needs of the individuals in the group\nand providing transparent recommendations that go beyond powerful but \"black\nbox\" foundation models (FMs) that identify social cues. We address this\nimportant demand with a social robot co-facilitator that analyzes multimodal\nmeeting data and provides discreet cues to the facilitator. The robot's\nreasoning is powered by an agentic concept bottleneck model (CBM), which makes\ndecisions based on human-interpretable concepts like participant engagement and\nsentiments, ensuring transparency and trustworthiness. Our core contribution is\na transfer learning framework that distills the broad social understanding of\nan FM into our specialized and transparent CBM.

This paper examines the emergent properties of Deep Neural Networks\n(DNNs) through both theoretical analysis and empirical observation, addressing\nthe epistemological challenge of \"creation without understanding\" that\ncharacterises contemporary AI development. We explore how the neural approach's\nreliance on nonlinear, stochastic processes fundamentally differs from symbolic\ncomputational paradigms, creating systems whose macro-level behaviours cannot\nbe analytically derived from micro-level neuron activities. Through analysis of\nscaling laws, grokking phenomena, and phase transitions in model capabilities,\nI demonstrate that emergent abilities arise from the complex dynamics of highly\nsensitive nonlinear systems rather than simply from parameter scaling alone. My\ninvestigation reveals that current debates over metrics, pre-training loss\nthresholds, and in-context learning miss the fundamental ontological nature of\nemergence in DNNs. I argue that these systems exhibit genuine emergent\nproperties analogous to those found in other complex natural phenomena, where\nsystemic capabilities emerge from cooperative interactions among simple\ncomponents without being reducible to their individual behaviours. The paper\nconcludes that understanding LLM capabilities requires recognising DNNs as a\nnew domain of complex dynamical systems governed by universal principles of\nemergence, similar to those operating in physics, chemistry, and biology.

To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose an image\nstitching solution called PIS3R that is robust to very large parallax based on\nthe novel concept of deep 3D reconstruction. First, we apply visual geometry\ngrounded transformer to two input images with very large parallax to obtain\nboth intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, as well as the dense 3D scene\nreconstruction.

We explore how the neural approach's\nreliance on nonlinear, stochastic processes fundamentally differs from symbolic\ncomputational paradigms, creating systems whose macro-level behaviours cannot\nbe analytically derived from micro-level neuron activities. Through analysis of\nscaling laws, grokking phenomena, and phase transitions in model capabilities,\nI demonstrate that emergent abilities arise from the complex dynamics of highly\nsensitive nonlinear systems rather than simply from parameter scaling alone.

I argue that these systems exhibit genuine emergent\nproperties analogous to those found in other complex natural phenomena, where\nsystemic capabilities emerge from cooperative interactions among simple\ncomponents without being reducible to their individual behaviours. The paper\nconcludes that understanding LLM capabilities requires recognising DNNs as a\nnew domain of complex dynamical systems governed by universal principles of\nemergence, similar to those operating in physics, chemistry, and biology.

This phenomenon motivates us to systematically investigate the role of\ntraining data in hallucination. We introduce a new benchmark, POPEv2, which\nconsists of counterfactual images collected from the training data of LVLMs\nwith certain objects masked. Through comprehensive evaluation on POPEv2, we\nfind that current LVLMs suffer from training bias: they fail to fully leverage\ntheir training data and hallucinate more frequently on images seen during\ntraining. Specifically, they perform poorly on counterfactual images, often\nincorrectly answering ``Yes'' to questions about masked objects.

State-of-the-art methods formulate\nthis task as an optimization problem: they align all target concepts with\nsemantic-harmless anchor concepts, and apply closed-form solutions to update\nthe model accordingly. While these closed-form methods are efficient, we argue\nthat existing methods have two overlooked limitations: 1) They often result in\nincomplete erasure due to \"non-zero alignment residual\", especially when text\nprompts are relatively complex. 2) They may suffer from generation quality\ndegradation as they always concentrate parameter updates in a few deep layers.\nTo address these issues, we propose a novel closed-form method ErasePro: it is\ndesigned for more complete concept erasure and better preserving overall\ngenerative quality. Specifically, ErasePro first introduces a strict\nzero-residual constraint into the optimization objective, ensuring perfect\nalignment between target and anchor concept features and enabling more complete\nerasure. Secondly, it employs a progressive, layer-wise update strategy that\ngradually transfers target concept features to those of the anchor concept from\nshallow to deep layers.

To bridge this gap, we introduce TURA\n(Tool-Augmented Unified Retrieval Agent for AI Search), a novel three-stage\nframework that combines RAG with agentic tool-use to access both static content\nand dynamic, real-time information. TURA has three key components: an\nIntent-Aware Retrieval module to decompose queries and retrieve information\nsources encapsulated as Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers, a DAG-based Task\nPlanner that models task dependencies as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for\noptimal parallel execution, and a lightweight Distilled Agent Executor for\nefficient tool calling. TURA is the first architecture to systematically bridge\nthe gap between static RAG and dynamic information sources for a world-class AI\nsearch product. Serving tens of millions of users, it leverages an agentic\nframework to deliver robust, real-time answers while meeting the low-latency\ndemands of a large-scale industrial system."}

Specifically,\nwe propose that an intervention can be represented by a Causal Delta Embedding\nthat is invariant to the visual scene and sparse in terms of the causal\nvariables it affects. Leveraging this insight, we propose a framework that is\ncapable of learning causal representations from image pairs, without any\nadditional supervision. Experiments in the Causal Triplet challenge demonstrate\nthat Causal Delta Embeddings are highly effective in OOD settings,\nsignificantly exceeding baseline performance in both synthetic and real-world\nbenchmarks."}

We\nevaluate our framework on a novel multimodal benchmark dataset, assembled by\nintegrating WebGPT, ScienceQA, AVSD, and ScanQA datasets. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our CoQ method improves a foundation model's ability to\neffectively identify and integrate pertinent sensory information. This leads to\nimproved accuracy, interpretability, and alignment of the reasoning process\nwith diverse multimodal tasks."}

With the evolution\nof (multi-modal) large language models ((M)LLMs), this dream is closer to\nreality, as (M)LLM-based Agents using computing devices (e.g., computers and\nmobile phones) by operating within the environments and interfaces (e.g.,\nGraphical User Interface (GUI)) provided by operating systems (OS) to automate\ntasks have significantly advanced. This paper presents a comprehensive survey\nof these advanced agents, designated as OS Agents. We begin by elucidating the\nfundamentals of OS Agents, exploring their key components including the\nenvironment, observation space, and action space, and outlining essential\ncapabilities such as understanding, planning, and grounding. We then examine\nmethodologies for constructing OS Agents, focusing on domain-specific\nfoundation models and agent frameworks. A detailed review of evaluation\nprotocols and benchmarks highlights how OS Agents are assessed across diverse\ntasks. Finally, we discuss current challenges and identify promising directions\nfor future research, including safety and privacy, personalization and\nself-evolution. This survey aims to consolidate the state of OS Agents\nresearch, providing insights to guide both academic inquiry and industrial\ndevelopment.

To address this\nchallenge, we introduce Surf3R, an end-to-end feedforward approach that\nreconstructs 3D surfaces from sparse views without estimating camera poses and\ncompletes an entire scene in under 10 seconds. Our method employs a\nmulti-branch and multi-view decoding architecture in which multiple reference\nviews jointly guide the reconstruction process. Through the proposed\nbranch-wise processing, cross-view attention, and inter-branch fusion, the\nmodel effectively captures complementary geometric cues without requiring\ncamera calibration. Moreover, we introduce a D-Normal regularizer based on an\nexplicit 3D Gaussian representation for surface reconstruction. It couples\nsurface normals with other geometric parameters to jointly optimize the 3D\ngeometry, significantly improving 3D consistency and surface detail accuracy.\nExperimental results demonstrate that Surf3R achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on multiple surface reconstruction metrics on ScanNet++ and Replica\ndatasets, exhibiting excellent generalization and efficiency."}

However, these models often struggle with novel and specialized software,\nparticularly in scenarios lacking human annotations. To address this challenge,\nwe propose SEAgent, an agentic self-evolving framework enabling CUAs to\nautonomously evolve through interactions with unfamiliar software.\nSpecifically, SEAgent empowers computer-use agents to autonomously master novel\nsoftware environments via experiential learning, where agents explore new\nsoftware, learn through iterative trial-and-error, and progressively tackle\nauto-generated tasks organized from simple to complex. To achieve this goal, we\ndesign a World State Model for step-wise trajectory assessment, along with a\nCurriculum Generator that generates increasingly diverse and challenging tasks.\nThe agent's policy is updated through experiential learning, comprised of\nadversarial imitation of failure actions and Group Relative Policy Optimization\n(GRPO) on successful ones. Furthermore, we introduce a specialist-to-generalist\ntraining strategy that integrates individual experiential insights from\nspecialist agents, facilitating the development of a stronger generalist CUA\ncapable of continuous autonomous evolution. This unified agent ultimately\nachieves performance surpassing ensembles of individual specialist agents on\ntheir specialized software. We validate the effectiveness of SEAgent across\nfive novel software environments within OS-World. Our approach achieves a\nsignificant improvement of 23.2% in success rate, from 11.3% to 34.5%, over a\ncompetitive open-source CUA, i.e., UI-TARS."}
