Such models arise, for instance,\nwhen multiple domain experts disagree on how to model a problem. The goal is to\nfind a single policy that is robust against any choice of POMDP within the set,\ni.e., a policy that maximizes the worst-case reward across all POMDPs. We\ngeneralize and expand on existing work in the following way. First, we show\nthat ME-POMDPs can be generalized to POMDPs with sets of initial beliefs, which\nwe call adversarial-belief POMDPs (AB-POMDPs). Second, we show that any\narbitrary ME-POMDP can be reduced to a ME-POMDP that only varies in its\ntransition and reward functions or only in its observation and reward\nfunctions, while preserving (optimal) policies.

We find that state-of-the-art LLMs perform well on Global PIQA in\naggregate, but they exhibit weaker performance in lower-resource languages (up\nto a 37% accuracy gap, despite random chance at 50%). Open models generally\nperform worse than proprietary models.

Current LLM reasoning,\nhindered by computationally inefficient sequential generation and rigid\nreasoning strategies, creates a critical bottleneck for the Web services.\nExisting approaches typically optimize the LLM reasoning for either efficiency\nor quality but struggle to achieve both, and thus fail to meet the dual\nrequirements of modern Web platforms. To overcome these limitations, we propose\nOrion, a novel and efficient reasoning framework that enables dependency-aware\nquery decomposition and logic-parallel content expansion. Concretely, Orion\ndecomposes a single query reasoning process into two synergistic phases: (1)\n\\textit{key point generation}, which distills logically structured key points\nthrough retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting, and (2) \\textit{content\nparallel expansion}, which concurrently elaborates on these points based on a\ndependency graph to ensure logical consistency. Furthermore, Orion introduces a\npipeline scheduling mechanism that exploits the complementary computational\ncharacteristics of the two phases (generation imposes pressure on GPU computing\nand expansion stresses on GPU memory) across multiple queries, enabling\ncross-query parallelism and dramatically improving reasoning performance (\\ie,\nefficiency and quality). Experiments on diverse benchmarks show that Orion not\nonly delivers up to 4.33x higher token generation speed and 3.42x lower answer\nlatency over the baselines but also improves reasoning quality by up to 18.75%\nthrough explicitly modeling inter-point dependencies."}

On the other hand, agent benchmarks are typically\ndesigned for post-trained models, requiring multi-turn task execution abilities\nthat base models struggle to support. Thus, there is a compelling need for a\nbenchmark that can evaluate agentic potentials during pre-training and guide\nthe model training more effectively.

Unlike previous efforts that\nfocus on a limited set of crisis types, our benchmark covers seven types\ndefined in line with clinical standards and is the first to incorporate\ntemporal labels. Our benchmark provides 600 clinician-annotated evaluation\nexamples and 420 development examples, together with a training corpus of\naround 4K examples automatically labeled using a majority-vote ensemble of\nmultiple language models, which significantly outperforms single-model\nannotation. We further fine-tune six crisis detection models on subsets defined\nby consensus and unanimous ensemble agreement, providing complementary models\ntrained under different agreement criteria."}

To address this, we propose Critique-RL, an online RL\napproach for developing critiquing language models without stronger\nsupervision. Our approach operates on a two-player paradigm: the actor\ngenerates a response, the critic provides feedback, and the actor refines the\nresponse accordingly. We first reveal that relying solely on indirect reward\nsignals from the actor's outputs for RL optimization often leads to\nunsatisfactory critics: while their helpfulness (i.e., providing constructive\nfeedback) improves, the discriminability (i.e., determining whether a response\nis high-quality or not) remains poor, resulting in marginal performance gains.\nTo overcome this, Critique-RL adopts a two-stage optimization strategy. In\nstage I, it reinforces the discriminability of the critic with direct\nrule-based reward signals; in stage II, it introduces indirect rewards based on\nactor refinement to improve the critic's helpfulness, while maintaining its\ndiscriminability via appropriate regularization. Extensive experiments across\nvarious tasks and models show that Critique-RL delivers substantial performance\nimprovements. For example, it achieves a 9.02% gain on in-domain tasks and a\n5.70% gain on out-of-domain tasks for Qwen2.5-7B, highlighting its potential."}

We present MuSaG, the first German\nmultimodal sarcasm detection dataset, consisting of 33 minutes of manually\nselected and human-annotated statements from German television shows. Each\ninstance provides aligned text, audio, and video modalities, annotated\nseparately by humans, enabling evaluation in unimodal and multimodal settings.\nWe benchmark nine open-source and commercial models, spanning text, audio,\nvision, and multimodal architectures, and compare their performance to human\nannotations. Our results show that while humans rely heavily on audio in\nconversational settings, models perform best on text. This highlights a gap in\ncurrent multimodal models and motivates the use of MuSaG for developing models\nbetter suited to realistic scenarios. We release MuSaG publicly to support\nfuture research on multimodal sarcasm detection and human-model alignment."}

To address this, we propose Critique-RL, an online RL\napproach for developing critiquing language models without stronger\nsupervision. Our approach operates on a two-player paradigm: the actor\ngenerates a response, the critic provides feedback, and the actor refines the\nresponse accordingly. We first reveal that relying solely on indirect reward\nsignals from the actor's outputs for RL optimization often leads to\nunsatisfactory critics: while their helpfulness (i.e., providing constructive\nfeedback) improves, the discriminability (i.e., determining whether a response\nis high-quality or not) remains poor, resulting in marginal performance gains.\nTo overcome this, Critique-RL adopts a two-stage optimization strategy. In\nstage I, it reinforces the discriminability of the critic with direct\nrule-based reward signals; in stage II, it introduces indirect rewards based on\nactor refinement to improve the critic's helpfulness, while maintaining its\ndiscriminability via appropriate regularization. Extensive experiments across\nvarious tasks and models show that Critique-RL delivers substantial performance\nimprovements.

However,\nwhen a word appears in a text, this ambiguity is generally much reduced.\nDisambiguating POS involves using context to reduce the number of POS\nassociated with words, and is one of the main challenges of lexical tagging.\nThe problem of labeling words by POS frequently arises in natural language\nprocessing, for example for spelling correction, grammar or style checking,\nexpression recognition, text-to-speech conversion, text corpus analysis, etc.\nLexical tagging systems are thus useful as an initial component of many natural\nlanguage processing systems. A number of recent lexical tagging systems produce\nmultiple solutions when the text is lexically ambiguous or the uniquely correct\nsolution cannot be found. These contributions aim to guarantee a zero silence\nrate: the correct tag(s) for a word must never be discarded. This objective is\nunrealistic for systems that tag each word uniquely. This article concerns a\nlexical disambiguation method adapted to the objective of a zero silence rate\nand implemented in Silberztein's INTEX system (1993). We present here a formal\ndescription of this method. We show that to verify a local disambiguation\ngrammar in this framework, it is not sufficient to consider the transducer\npaths separately: one needs to verify their interactions. Similarly, if a\ncombination of multiple transducers is used, the result cannot be predicted by\nconsidering them in isolation. Furthermore, when examining the initial labeling\nof a text as produced by INTEX, ideas for disambiguation rules come\nspontaneously, but grammatical intuitions may turn out to be inaccurate, often\ndue to an unforeseen construction or ambiguity. If a zero silence rate is\ntargeted, local grammars must be carefully tested. This is where a detailed\nspecification of what a grammar will do once applied to texts would be\nnecessary."}

Built upon this, we propose OS-Sentinel, a novel hybrid safety\ndetection framework that synergistically combines a Formal Verifier for\ndetecting explicit system-level violations with a VLM-based Contextual Judge\nfor assessing contextual risks and agent actions. Experiments show that\nOS-Sentinel achieves 10%-30% improvements over existing approaches across\nmultiple metrics. Further analysis provides critical insights that foster the\ndevelopment of safer and more reliable autonomous mobile agents."}

Large Language Models (LLMs), with their world knowledge\nand role-playing capabilities, are strong candidates to serve as the foundation\nfor legal society simulation. However, the application of LLMs to simulate\nlegal systems remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce Law in Silico,\nan LLM-based agent framework for simulating legal scenarios with individual\ndecision-making and institutional mechanisms of legislation, adjudication, and\nenforcement. Our experiments, which compare simulated crime rates with\nreal-world data, demonstrate that LLM-based agents can largely reproduce\nmacro-level crime trends and provide insights that align with real-world\nobservations. At the same time, micro-level simulations reveal that a\nwell-functioning, transparent, and adaptive legal system offers better\nprotection of the rights of vulnerable individuals."}
