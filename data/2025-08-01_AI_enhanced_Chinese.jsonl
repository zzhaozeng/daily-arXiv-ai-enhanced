These channels enable the anonymous trade of\nillicit goods including drugs, weapons, and stolen credentials. Detecting and\ncategorizing such content remains challenging due to limited labeled data, the\nevolving nature of illicit language, and the structural heterogeneity of online\nsources. This paper presents a hierarchical classification framework that\ncombines fine-tuned language models with a semi-supervised ensemble learning\nstrategy to detect and classify illicit marketplace content across diverse\nplatforms. We extract semantic representations using ModernBERT, a transformer\nmodel for long documents, finetuned on domain-specific data from deep and dark\nweb pages, Telegram channels, Subreddits, and Pastebin pastes to capture\nspecialized jargon and ambiguous linguistic patterns. In addition, we\nincorporate manually engineered features such as document structure, embedded\npatterns including Bitcoin addresses, emails, and IPs, and metadata, which\ncomplement language model embeddings. The classification pipeline operates in\ntwo stages. The first stage uses a semi-supervised ensemble of XGBoost, Random\nForest, and SVM with entropy-based weighted voting to detect sales-related\ndocuments. The second stage further classifies these into drug, weapon, or\ncredential sales. Experiments on three datasets, including our multi-source\ncorpus, DUTA, and CoDA, show that our model outperforms several baselines,\nincluding BERT, ModernBERT, DarkBERT, ALBERT, Longformer, and BigBird.

Unfortunately, time favors the ill-intentioned in this\nrace, with fake videos growing increasingly difficult to distinguish from real\nones. At the root of this trend is a fundamental advantage held by those\nmanipulating media: equal access to a distribution of what we consider\nauthentic (i.e., \"natural\") video. In this paper, we show how coding very\nsubtle, noise-like modulations into the illumination of a scene can help combat\nthis advantage by creating an information asymmetry that favors verification.\nOur approach effectively adds a temporal watermark to any video recorded under\ncoded illumination.

However, during both training and\ninference, these models rely heavily on dense point sampling along rays from\nmultiple viewpoints, resulting in a surge in floating-point operations and\nseverely limiting their use in resource-constrained scenarios like edge\ncomputing.

We then conduct three\nevaluations with our notion of coherence. First, we assess the impact of\nenforcing coherence on human forecasters as well as on Large Language Model\n(LLM)-based forecasters, given that they have recently shown to be competitive\nwith human forecasters. In both cases, we show that filtering out incoherent\npredictions improves forecasting accuracy consistently, supporting the\npractical value of coherence in both human and LLM-based forecasting. Then, via\ncrowd-sourced user experiments, we show that, despite its apparent\nintuitiveness and usefulness, users do not generally align with this coherence\nproperty.

Synthetic\ndata methods are gaining prominence due to the cost and complexity of gathering\nreal-world data, but they demand a high degree of realism and controllability\nto be useful. This work introduces two novel methods for synthetic data\ngeneration in autonomous driving and medical image analysis, namely MObI and\nAnydoorMed, respectively. MObI is a first-of-its-kind framework for Multimodal\nObject Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to produce realistic and\ncontrollable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated\nsimultaneously for camera and lidar. Given a single reference RGB image, MObI\nenables seamless object insertion into existing multimodal scenes at a\nspecified 3D location, guided by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic\nconsistency and multimodal coherence. Unlike traditional inpainting methods\nthat rely solely on edit masks, this approach uses 3D bounding box conditioning\nto ensure accurate spatial positioning and realistic scaling. AnydoorMed\nextends this paradigm to the medical imaging domain, focusing on\nreference-guided inpainting for mammography scans. It leverages a\ndiffusion-based model to inpaint anomalies with impressive detail preservation,\nmaintaining the reference anomaly's structural integrity while semantically\nblending it with the surrounding tissue.

Recent research has\ndemonstrated that combining large language models (LLMs) with vision-language\nmodels (VLMs) makes open-set recognition possible without the need for\npredefined class labels. However, the existing methods are often limited in\nharnessing the power of LLMs at the classification phase, and also rely heavily\non the guessed class names provided by an LLM without thorough analysis and\nrefinement. To address these bottlenecks, we propose our training-free method,\nEnriched-FineR (or E-FineR for short), which demonstrates state-of-the-art\nresults in fine-grained visual recognition while also offering greater\ninterpretability, highlighting its strong potential in real-world scenarios and\nnew domains where expert annotations are difficult to obtain. Additionally, we\ndemonstrate the application of our proposed approach to zero-shot and few-shot\nclassification, where it demonstrated performance on par with the existing SOTA\nwhile being training-free and not requiring human interventions.

In conventional methods, the agent can retrieve\ninformation from its equipped memory module to help the person recall\nincomplete or vague memories. The limited size of memory module hinders the\nacquisition of complete memories and impacts the memory recall performance in\npractice. Memory theories suggest that the person's relevant memory can be\nproactively activated through some effective cues. Inspired by this, we propose\na novel strategy-guided agent-assisted memory recall method, allowing the agent\nto transform an original query into a cue-rich one via the judiciously designed\nstrategy to help the person recall memories. To this end, there are two key\nchallenges. (1) How to choose the appropriate recall strategy for diverse\nforgetting scenarios with distinct memory-recall characteristics? (2) How to\nobtain the high-quality responses leveraging recall strategies, given only\nabstract and sparsely annotated strategy patterns? To address the challenges,\nwe propose a Recall Router framework. Specifically, we design a 5W Recall Map\nto classify memory queries into five typical scenarios and define fifteen\nrecall strategy patterns across the corresponding scenarios. We then propose a\nhierarchical recall tree combined with the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to\noptimize the selection of strategy and the generation of strategy responses.

To address the above challenges, we propose an adversarial-guided\ndiffusion (AGD) approach for adversarial attack MLLMs. We introduce\nadversarial-guided noise to ensure attack efficacy. A key observation in our\ndesign is that, unlike most traditional adversarial attacks which embed\nhigh-frequency perturbations directly into the clean image, AGD injects target\nsemantics into the noise component of the reverse diffusion. Since the added\nnoise in a diffusion model spans the entire frequency spectrum, the adversarial\nsignal embedded within it also inherits this full-spectrum property.\nImportantly, during reverse diffusion, the adversarial image is formed as a\nlinear combination of the clean image and the noise. Thus, when applying\ndefenses such as a simple low-pass filtering, which act independently on each\ncomponent, the adversarial image within the noise component is less likely to\nbe suppressed, as it is not confined to the high-frequency band.

While deep learning-based detection\nmethods are now widely adopted, they still face two core challenges: first, the\ninadequate multi-scale feature extraction capabilities of existing networks for\ndiverse targets like cracks and potholes, leading to high miss rates for\nsmall-scale damage; and second, the substantial parameter counts and\ncomputational demands of mainstream models, which hinder their deployment for\nefficient, real-time detection in practical applications.

However,\nthese studies often assume that the source of unlabeled data is only confined\nto novel classes of the current session, which presents a narrow perspective\nand cannot align well with practical scenarios. To better reflect real-world\nscenarios, we redefine Semi-FSCIL as Generalized Semi-FSCIL (GSemi-FSCIL) by\nincorporating both base and all the ever-seen novel classes in the unlabeled\nset. This change in the composition of unlabeled samples poses a new challenge\nfor existing methods, as they struggle to distinguish between unlabeled samples\nfrom base and novel classes.

However, mapping a comprehensive and detailed\nCN atlas is challenging because of the unique anatomical structures of each CN\npair and the complexity of the skull base environment.In this work, we present\nwhat we believe to be the first study to develop a comprehensive diffusion\ntractography atlas for automated mapping of CN pathways in the human brain. The\nCN atlas is generated by fiber clustering by using the streamlines generated by\nmulti-parametric fiber tractography for each pair of CNs. Instead of disposable\nclustering, we explore a new strategy of multi-stage fiber clustering for\nmultiple analysis of approximately 1,000,000 streamlines generated from the 50\nsubjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Quantitative and visual\nexperiments demonstrate that our CN atlas achieves high spatial correspondence\nwith expert manual annotations on multiple acquisition sites, including the HCP\ndataset, the Multi-shell Diffusion MRI (MDM) dataset and two clinical cases of\npituitary adenoma patients. The proposed CN atlas can automatically identify 8\nfiber bundles associated with 5 pairs of CNs, including the optic nerve CN II,\noculomotor nerve CN III, trigeminal nerve CN V and facial-vestibulocochlear\nnerve CN VII/VIII, and its robustness is demonstrated experimentally.

These metrics can be used in quantitative bias analyses to assess the\nrobustness of results for an inferential study given potential bias from\noutcome misclassification. However, extensive time and resource allocation are\ntypically re-quired to create reference-standard labels through manual chart\nreview of free-text notes from linked electronic health records. Methods: We\ndescribe an expedited process that introduces efficiency in a validation study\nus-ing two distinct mechanisms: 1) use of natural language processing (NLP) to\nreduce time spent by human reviewers to review each chart, and 2) a multi-wave\nadaptive sampling approach with pre-defined criteria to stop the validation\nstudy once performance characteristics are identified with sufficient\nprecision. We illustrate this process in a case study that validates the\nperformance of a claims-based outcome algorithm for intentional self-harm in\npatients with obesity. Results: We empirically demonstrate that the\nNLP-assisted annotation process reduced the time spent on review per chart by\n40% and use of the pre-defined stopping rule with multi-wave samples would have\nprevented review of 77% of patient charts with limited compromise to precision\nin derived measurement characteristics.

Diverging from critical traditions that conflate\narbitrariness with injustice, it posits arbitrariness as a semiotic trait: a\nproperty enabling systems - linguistic, legal, or social - to operate\neffectively while withholding their internal rationale. Building on Ferdinand\nde Saussure's concept of l'arbitraire du signe, the analysis extends this\nprinciple beyond language to demonstrate its cross-domain applicability,\nparticularly in law and social dynamics. The paper introduces the \"Motivation\n-> Constatability -> Contestability\" chain, arguing that motivation functions\nas a crucial interface rendering an act's logic vulnerable to intersubjective\ncontestation. When this chain is broken through mechanisms like\n\"immotivization\" or \"Conflict Lateralization\" (exemplified by \"the blur of the\nwolf drowned in the fish\"), acts produce binding effects without exposing their\nrationale, thus precluding justiciability. This structural opacity, while\nappearing illogical, is a deliberate design protecting authority from\naccountability. Drawing on Shannon's entropy model, the paper formalizes\narbitrariness as A = H(L|M) (conditional entropy). It thereby proposes a modern\ntheory of arbitrariness as a neutral operator central to control as well as\ncare, an overlooked dimension of interpersonal relations.

While AI-powered tools hold promise for\naccelerating medical image analysis, adoption of commercial medical AI products\nremains limited in low- and middle-income countries due to high license costs,\nproprietary software, and infrastructure demands. In this work, we investigate\nwhether the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) can be adapted for low-cost,\nminimal-input 3D tumor segmentation in breast MRI. Using a single bounding box\nannotation on one slice, we propagate segmentation predictions across the 3D\nvolume using three different slice-wise tracking strategies: top-to-bottom,\nbottom-to-top, and center-outward. We evaluate these strategies across a large\ncohort of patients and find that center-outward propagation yields the most\nconsistent and accurate segmentations.

An comprehensive ablation study is\nundertaken to separate the effect of critical hyperparameters, including\nlearning rate schedules, batch sizes, input resolution, data augmentation,\nregularization approaches, and optimizer choice. To assess appropriateness for\nreal-time applications, each model is assessed not only in terms of Top-1 and\nTop-5 classification accuracy, but also in terms of inference time, parameter\ncount, model size, and frames-per-second (FPS) on a GPU-accelerated edge\ndeployment simulation. Results demonstrate that cosine learning rate decay and\nadjustable batch size may greatly boost both accuracy and convergence speed,\nwhile keeping low latency and memory cost.

Leveraging the\nintrinsic importance differences among experts, recent research has explored\nexpert-level compression techniques to improve the efficiency of MoE LLMs.\nHowever, existing approaches often rely on empirical criteria to identify\ncritical experts, lacking a deeper exploration and understanding of the\nheterogeneous importance of experts. In this study, we present the first\ndiscovery and investigation of a distinct subset of experts that play a crucial\nrole in the underlying mechanisms during the model's forward inference. These\nexperts are prevalent in open-source MoE LLMs, and despite their limited\nnumber, pruning them leads to a significant decline in model performance (e.g.,\npruning three causes Qwen3-30B-A3B to produce repetitive and uninformative\noutputs). We refer to these experts as Super Experts (SEs). Our comprehensive\nanalysis provides progressively deeper insights into SEs. (i) SEs are\ncharacterized by rare but extreme activation outliers in the output of the\ndown_proj, which give rise to massive activations in the hidden states between\ndecoder layers. Moreover, the distribution of SEs remains model-specific and is\nunaffected by post-training processes. (ii) By pruning SEs, we assess their\nsignificance across a variety of tasks, revealing their considerable impact on\nthe model's overall performance, particularly in mathematical reasoning.

Especially with the rapid development of the Text-to-Image (T2I)\nmodels, AI-Generated Talking Heads (AGTHs) have gradually become an emerging\ndigital human media. However, challenges persist regarding the quality of these\ntalkers and AGTHs they generate, and comprehensive studies addressing these\nissues remain limited. To address this gap, this paper presents the largest\nAGTH quality assessment dataset THQA-10K to date, which selects 12 prominent\nT2I models and 14 advanced talkers to generate AGTHs for 14 prompts. After\nexcluding instances where AGTH generation is unsuccessful, the THQA-10K dataset\ncontains 10,457 AGTHs. Then, volunteers are recruited to subjectively rate the\nAGTHs and give the corresponding distortion categories. In our analysis for\nsubjective experimental results, we evaluate the performance of talkers in\nterms of generalizability and quality, and also expose the distortions of\nexisting AGTHs. Finally, an objective quality assessment method based on the\nfirst frame, Y-T slice and tone-lip consistency is proposed. Experimental\nresults show that this method can achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance\nin AGTH quality assessment.

LDMs achieve high-fidelity synthesis with greater\ncomputational efficiency, representing the current state-of-the-art for image\ngeneration.

However, due to the modality divergence between vision\nand language, it is unclear whether these NLP techniques are still effective in\nLVLMs. In this paper, we empirically prove that directly applying these layer\npruning methods to LVLMs is ineffective. Through extensive experiments, we find\nthat non-essential vision-language (VL) tokens and inter-layer feature gaps\npose critical challenges to pruning layers in LVLMs. Based on these insights,\nwe propose a novel framework Short-LVLM (SVL) that can utilize important VL\ntokens and mitigate the layer-wise feature gaps.

Graph\nclustering is an effective paradigm for addressing this issue, as it models the\ncomplex relationships among documents using graph structures and reduces\ninformation redundancy through clustering, achieving significant research\nprogress. However, existing methods often only consider single-relational\ngraphs and require a predefined number of clusters, which hinders their ability\nto fully represent rich relational information and adaptively partition\nsentence groups to reduce redundancy. To overcome these limitations, we propose\nMRGSEM-Sum, an unsupervised multi-document summarization framework based on\nmulti-relational graphs and structural entropy minimization. Specifically, we\nconstruct a multi-relational graph that integrates semantic and discourse\nrelations between sentences, comprehensively modeling the intricate and dynamic\nconnections among sentences across documents. We then apply a two-dimensional\nstructural entropy minimization algorithm for clustering, automatically\ndetermining the optimal number of clusters and effectively organizing sentences\ninto coherent groups.

However, current\nvision-language pretraining methods in the medical domain often simplify\nclinical reports into single entities or fragmented tokens, ignoring their\ninherent structure. In addition, contrastive learning frameworks typically\ndepend on large quantities of hard negative samples, which is impractical for\nsmall-scale medical datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose Adaptive\nGrouped Alignment (AGA), a new framework that captures structured semantics\nfrom paired medical images and reports. AGA introduces a bidirectional grouping\nmechanism based on a sparse similarity matrix. For each image-report pair, we\ncompute fine-grained similarities between text tokens and image patches. Each\ntoken selects its top-matching patches to form a visual group, and each patch\nselects its most related tokens to form a language group. To enable adaptive\ngrouping, we design two threshold gating modules, called Language Grouped\nThreshold Gate and Vision Grouped Threshold Gate, which learn grouping\nthresholds dynamically. Group representations are computed as weighted averages\nbased on similarity scores. To align each token with its group representation,\nwe introduce an Instance Aware Group Alignment loss that operates within each\nimage-text pair, removing the need for external negatives.

To evaluate this capability, we present GSM-MC\nand GSM-MCE, two novel benchmarks based on GSM8K for assessing mathematical\nreasoning under incomplete or misleading conditions.

Existing zero-shot detectors often rely on\nstatistical measures that implicitly assume Gaussian distributions, a premise\nthat falters when confronted with the heavy-tailed statistical artifacts\ncharacteristic of adversarial or non-native English texts. This paper\nintroduces T-Detect, a novel detection method that fundamentally redesigns the\nstatistical core of curvature-based detectors.

To date, research has\nprimarily focused on addressing statistical heterogeneity and communication\nefficiency, through which FL has achieved success in classification tasks.\nHowever, its application to non-classification tasks, such as human pose\nestimation, remains underexplored. This paper identifies and investigates a\ncritical issue termed ``resolution-drift,'' where performance degrades\nsignificantly due to resolution variability across clients. Unlike class-level\nheterogeneity, resolution drift highlights the importance of resolution as\nanother axis of not independent or identically distributed (non-IID) data. To\naddress this issue, we present resolution-adaptive federated learning (RAF), a\nmethod that leverages heatmap-based knowledge distillation. Through\nmulti-resolution knowledge distillation between higher-resolution outputs\n(teachers) and lower-resolution outputs (students), our approach enhances\nresolution robustness without overfitting. Extensive experiments and\ntheoretical analysis demonstrate that RAF not only effectively mitigates\nresolution drift and achieves significant performance improvements, but also\ncan be integrated seamlessly into existing FL frameworks.

It serves as cold-start initialization data for 3D-R1.\nMoreover, we leverage RLHF policy such as GRPO in the reinforcement learning\ntraining process to enhance reasoning capabilities and introduce three reward\nfunctions: a perception reward, a semantic similarity reward and a format\nreward to maintain detection accuracy and answer semantic precision.\nFurthermore, we introduce a dynamic view selection strategy that adaptively\nchooses the most informative perspectives for 3D scene understanding. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that 3D-R1 delivers an average improvement of 10%\nacross various 3D scene benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing\nreasoning and generalization in 3D scene understanding.

Project page:\n  https://mutianxu.github.io/stable-sim2real/", "summary": "3D data simulation aims to bridge the gap between simulated and real-captured\n3D data, which is a fundamental problem for real-world 3D visual tasks. Most 3D\ndata simulation methods inject predefined physical priors but struggle to\ncapture the full complexity of real data. An optimal approach involves learning\nan implicit mapping from synthetic to realistic data in a data-driven manner,\nbut progress in this solution has met stagnation in recent studies. This work\nexplores a new solution path of data-driven 3D simulation, called\nStable-Sim2Real, based on a novel two-stage depth diffusion model. The initial\nstage finetunes Stable-Diffusion to generate the residual between the real and\nsynthetic paired depth, producing a stable but coarse depth, where some local\nregions may deviate from realistic patterns. To enhance this, both the\nsynthetic and initial output depth are fed into a second-stage diffusion, where\ndiffusion loss is adjusted to prioritize these distinct areas identified by a\n3D discriminator. We provide a new benchmark scheme to evaluate 3D data\nsimulation methods.

The main challenge lies in inferring unseen\nappearance and geometric details while ensuring 3D consistency and realism.\nMost previous methods rely on 2D diffusion models to synthesize unseen views;\nhowever, these generated views are sparse and inconsistent, resulting in\nunrealistic 3D artifacts and blurred appearance. To address these limitations,\nwe leverage a generative avatar model, that can generate diverse 3D avatars by\nsampling deformed Gaussians from a learned prior distribution. Due to the\nlimited amount of 3D training data such a 3D model alone cannot capture all\nimage details of unseen identities. Consequently, we integrate it as a prior,\nensuring 3D consistency by projecting input images into its latent space and\nenforcing additional 3D appearance and geometric constraints. Our novel\napproach formulates Gaussian avatar creation as a model inversion process by\nfitting the generative avatar to synthetic views from 2D diffusion models.

Recent studies\ndemonstrate that frequency features can not only enhance feature representation\nto compensate for appearance limitations but also perceive motion through\ndynamic variations in frequency energy.

However, current driving data is mainly collected by vehicles, which\nis expensive and inefficient. A potential solution lies in synthesizing data\nfrom real-world images. Recent advancements in 3D reconstruction demonstrate\nphotorealistic novel view synthesis, highlighting the potential of generating\ndriving data from images captured on the road. This paper introduces a novel\nmethod, I2V-GS, to transfer the Infrastructure view To the Vehicle view with\nGaussian Splatting. Reconstruction from sparse infrastructure viewpoints and\nrendering under large view transformations is a challenging problem. We adopt\nthe adaptive depth warp to generate dense training views. To further expand the\nrange of views, we employ a cascade strategy to inpaint warped images, which\nalso ensures inpainting content is consistent across views.

Methods that use this approach combine\nthe power and flexibility of the functional map framework, with data-driven\nlearning for improved accuracy and generality. However, most existing methods\nin this area restrict the learning aspect only to the feature functions and\nstill rely on axiomatic modeling for formulating the training loss or for\nfunctional map regularization inside the networks. This limits both the\naccuracy and the applicability of the resulting approaches only to scenarios\nwhere assumptions of the axiomatic models hold. In this work, we show, for the\nfirst time, that both in-network regularization and functional map training can\nbe replaced with data-driven methods. For this, we first train a generative\nmodel of functional maps in the spectral domain using score-based generative\nmodeling, built from a large collection of high-quality maps. We then exploit\nthe resulting model to promote the structural properties of ground truth\nfunctional maps on new shape collections. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the\nlearned models are category-agnostic, and can fully replace commonly used\nstrategies such as enforcing Laplacian commutativity or orthogonality of\nfunctional maps. Our key technical contribution is a novel distillation\nstrategy from diffusion models in the spectral domain.

To address these issues, we propose Slot Attention with\nre-Initialization and self-Distillation (DIAS): $\\emph{i)}$ We reduce\nredundancy in the aggregated slots and re-initialize extra aggregation to\nupdate the remaining slots; $\\emph{ii)}$ We drive the bad attention map at the\nfirst aggregation iteration to approximate the good at the last iteration to\nenable self-distillation.

To bridge this gap, we introduce the novel task of Sequential 3D\nGaussian Affordance Reasoning and establish SeqAffordSplat, a large-scale\nbenchmark featuring 1800+ scenes to support research on long-horizon affordance\nunderstanding in complex 3DGS environments. We then propose SeqSplatNet, an\nend-to-end framework that directly maps an instruction to a sequence of 3D\naffordance masks. SeqSplatNet employs a large language model that\nautoregressively generates text interleaved with special segmentation tokens,\nguiding a conditional decoder to produce the corresponding 3D mask. To handle\ncomplex scene geometry, we introduce a pre-training strategy, Conditional\nGeometric Reconstruction, where the model learns to reconstruct complete\naffordance region masks from known geometric observations, thereby building a\nrobust geometric prior.
