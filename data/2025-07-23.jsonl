As complex\nsystems grow, coherence becomes fragile unless a higher-order structure ensures\nsemantic consistency. This paper introduces the Recursive Coherence Principle\n(RCP): a foundational constraint stating that for any reasoning system of order\nN, composed of systems operating over conceptual spaces of order N-1, semantic\ncoherence is preserved only by a recursively evaluable generalization operator\nthat spans and aligns those lower-order conceptual spaces. Crucially, this\ncoherence enables structural alignment. Without recursive coherence, no system\ncan reliably preserve goals, meanings, or reasoning consistency at scale. We\nformally define the Functional Model of Intelligence (FMI) as the only known\noperator capable of satisfying the RCP at any scale. The FMI is a minimal,\ncomposable architecture with internal functions (evaluation, modeling,\nadaptation, stability, decomposition, bridging) and external functions\n(storage, recall, System 1 and System 2 reasoning) vital for preserving\nsemantic structure across inference and coordination layers. We prove that any\nsystem lacking the FMI will experience recursive coherence breakdown as it\nscales, arguing that common AI issues like misalignment, hallucination, and\ninstability are symptoms of this structural coherence loss. Unlike other\nfoundational principles, RCP uniquely captures the internal, recursive dynamics\nneeded for coherent, alignable intelligence, modeling semantic coherence under\nrecursion. This work significantly impacts AI alignment, advocating a shift\nfrom behavioral constraints to structural coherence, and offers a pathway for\nsafely generalizable, robustly coherent AI at scale."}

The advent of Large Language\nModels (LLMs) represents a fundamental shift, enabling computational systems to\nengage with this previously inaccessible domain using natural language. This\npaper introduces a unified framework to understand and contrast these\nproblem-solving paradigms. We define and delineate the problem spaces\naddressable by formal languages versus natural language. While solutions to the\nformer problem class can be evaluated using binary quality measures, the latter\nrequires a much more nuanced definition of approximate solution space taking\ninto account the vagueness, subjectivity and ambiguity inherent to natural\nlanguage. We therefore introduce a vector-valued trust index Q, which reflects\nsolution quality and distinguishes the binary correctness of formal solutions\nfrom the continuous adequacy spectrum characteristic of natural language\nsolutions.

We present MindGames: a novel `planning\ntheory of mind' (PToM) task which requires agents to infer an interlocutor's\nbeliefs and desires to persuade them to alter their behavior.

These results were not aimed\nat proving superiority, but at illustrating how theoretical structures may\nemerge through practical design choices rather than top-down theory.\n  We introduce PEACE as a descriptive meta-architecture that captures\ndesign-level regularities observed in Agentic Flow. Not intended as a new\ntheory, PEACE provides a shared vocabulary for understanding architectures\nshaped by real-world implementation demands.

Methodology: We systematically reviewed 31\nquantitative LLM evaluation papers (Jan 2019 May 2025) identifying 19 English\nmedical QA benchmarks. Alama Health QA was developed using a retrieval\naugmented generation framework anchored on the Kenyan Clinical Practice\nGuidelines.

Integrating these uncertainty-aware forecasts into the MARL\nframework enables agents to optimize trading strategies with a clear\nunderstanding of risk and variability. Experimental results show that the\nuncertainty-aware Deep Q-Network (DQN) reduces energy purchase costs by up to\n5.7% without P2P trading and 3.2% with P2P trading, while increasing\nelectricity sales revenue by 6.4% and 44.7%, respectively. Additionally, peak\nhour grid demand is reduced by 38.8% without P2P and 45.6% with P2P. These\nimprovements are even more pronounced when P2P trading is enabled, highlighting\nthe synergy between advanced forecasting and market mechanisms for resilient,\neconomically efficient energy communities."}

In\nthis work, we propose VGGT-Long, a simple yet effective system that pushes the\nlimits of monocular 3D reconstruction to kilometer-scale, unbounded outdoor\nenvironments. Our approach addresses the scalability bottlenecks of existing\nmodels through a chunk-based processing strategy combined with overlapping\nalignment and lightweight loop closure optimization. Without requiring camera\ncalibration, depth supervision or model retraining, VGGT-Long achieves\ntrajectory and reconstruction performance comparable to traditional methods. We\nevaluate our method on KITTI, Waymo, and Virtual KITTI datasets. VGGT-Long not\nonly runs successfully on long RGB sequences where foundation models typically\nfail, but also produces accurate and consistent geometry across various\nconditions.

This is achieved by leveraging\nmulti-view generation, 3D Gaussian lifting, and pose-aware UV-space mapping of\n3D Gaussians. Given an image, we first dream plausible multi-views using a\nvideo diffusion model, capturing rich geometric and appearance details. These\nviews are then lifted into unstructured 3D Gaussians. To enable animation, we\npropose a transformer-based encoder that models global spatial relationships\nand projects these Gaussians into a structured latent representation aligned\nwith the UV space of a parametric body model. This latent code is decoded into\nUV-space Gaussians that can be animated via body-driven deformation and\nrendered conditioned on pose and viewpoint. By anchoring Gaussians to the UV\nmanifold, our method ensures consistency during animation while preserving fine\nvisual details. DLA enables real-time rendering and intuitive editing without\nrequiring post-processing.

Single-image shadow\nremoval (SR), particularly under challenging indirect illumination, is hampered\nby non-uniform content degradation and inherent ambiguity. Consequently,\ntraditional methods often fail to simultaneously recover intra-shadow details\nand maintain sharp boundaries, resulting in inconsistent restoration and\nblurring that negatively affect both downstream applications and the overall\nviewing experience. To overcome these limitations, we propose the DenseSR,\napproaching the problem from a dense prediction perspective to emphasize\nrestoration quality. This framework uniquely synergizes two key strategies: (1)\ndeep scene understanding guided by geometric-semantic priors to resolve\nambiguity and implicitly localize shadows, and (2) high-fidelity restoration\nvia a novel Dense Fusion Block (DFB) in the decoder. The DFB employs adaptive\ncomponent processing-using an Adaptive Content Smoothing Module (ACSM) for\nconsistent appearance and a Texture-Boundary Recuperation Module (TBRM) for\nfine textures and sharp boundaries-thereby directly tackling the inconsistent\nrestoration and blurring issues. These purposefully processed components are\neffectively fused, yielding an optimized feature representation preserving both\nconsistency and fidelity.

Spelke objects thus operate on category-agnostic\ncausal motion relationships which potentially better support tasks like\nmanipulation and planning. In this paper, we first benchmark the Spelke object\nconcept, introducing the SpelkeBench dataset that contains a wide variety of\nwell-defined Spelke segments in natural images. Next, to extract Spelke\nsegments from images algorithmically, we build SpelkeNet, a class of visual\nworld models trained to predict distributions over future motions. SpelkeNet\nsupports estimation of two key concepts for Spelke object discovery: (1) the\nmotion affordance map, identifying regions likely to move under a poke, and (2)\nthe expected-displacement map, capturing how the rest of the scene will move.\nThese concepts are used for \"statistical counterfactual probing\", where diverse\n\"virtual pokes\" are applied on regions of high motion-affordance, and the\nresultant expected displacement maps are used define Spelke segments as\nstatistical aggregates of correlated motion statistics.

Overall, EESE provides a robust, scalable, and\nforward-compatible solution for science benchmark design, offering a realistic\nmeasure of how well foundation models handle science questions.

While monitoring tasks have\ntraditionally been carried out manually, advances in machine learning have made\nit possible to collect individualized information in an increasingly automated\nway. Central to these methods is the localization of animals across space\n(object detection) and time (multi-object tracking). Despite extensive research\nof these two tasks in pig farming, a systematic benchmarking study has not yet\nbeen conducted. In this work, we address this gap by curating two datasets:\nPigDetect for object detection and PigTrack for multi-object tracking. The\ndatasets are based on diverse image and video material from realistic barn\nconditions, and include challenging scenarios such as occlusions or bad\nvisibility. For object detection, we show that challenging training images\nimprove detection performance beyond what is achievable with randomly sampled\nimages alone. Comparing different approaches, we found that state-of-the-art\nmodels offer substantial improvements in detection quality over real-time\nalternatives. For multi-object tracking, we observed that SORT-based methods\nachieve superior detection performance compared to end-to-end trainable models.\nHowever, end-to-end models show better association performance, suggesting they\ncould become strong alternatives in the future. We also investigate\ncharacteristic failure cases of end-to-end models, providing guidance for\nfuture improvements. The detection and tracking models trained on our datasets\nperform well in unseen pens, suggesting good generalization capabilities. This\nhighlights the importance of high-quality training data.

Such scenarios can arise in operating\nroom video analysis, where different health systems may use different workflows\nand instrumentation, requiring flexible solutions for video analysis.

Our empirical results reveal that the self-contradiction\nmainly arises from weak generation that fails to align with prompts, rather\nthan misunderstanding.

Applying standard post-training methods (e.g.,\nSFT, DPO) with such internal supervision successfully improves both generation\nand unification.

However,\nexisting evaluation frameworks fail to align well with the goals of agentic\nsearch. First, the complex queries commonly used in current benchmarks often\ndeviate from realistic user search scenarios. Second, prior approaches tend to\nintroduce noise when extracting ground truth for end-to-end evaluations,\nleading to distorted assessments at a fine-grained level. Third, most current\nframeworks focus solely on the quality of final answers, neglecting the\nevaluation of the iterative process inherent to agentic search. To address\nthese limitations, we propose RAVine -- a Reality-Aligned eValuation framework\nfor agentic LLMs with search. RAVine targets multi-point queries and long-form\nanswers that better reflect user intents, and introduces an attributable ground\ntruth construction strategy to enhance the accuracy of fine-grained evaluation.\nMoreover, RAVine examines model's interaction with search tools throughout the\niterative process, and accounts for factors of efficiency. We benchmark a\nseries of models using RAVine and derive several insights, which we hope will\ncontribute to advancing the development of agentic search systems.

Our approach includes two\nkey designs: (1) MLLMs-driven Region-based Pose Guidance (MRPG), which utilizes\nMLLMs to identify the interaction region as well as the interaction type (e.g.,\nholding and lefting) to provide coarse-to-fine constraints to the generated\npose for the interaction while incorporating human pose landmarks to track\naction variations and enforcing fine-grained pose constraints; and (2)\nDetail-Consistent Appearance Preservation (DCAP), which unifies a shape-aware\nattention modulation mechanism, a multi-view appearance loss, and a background\nconsistency loss to ensure consistent shapes/textures of the foreground and\nfaithful reproduction of the background human. We then propose the first\ndataset, named Interaction-aware Human-Object Composition (IHOC), for the task.\nExperimental results on our dataset show that HOComp effectively generates\nharmonious human-object interactions with consistent appearances, and\noutperforms relevant methods qualitatively and quantitatively."}

Drawing on the E-T-C analysis (deployment\nenvironment, threat source, enabling capability) from the Frontier AI Risk\nManagement Framework (v1.0) (SafeWork-F1-Framework), we identify critical risks\nin seven areas: cyber offense, biological and chemical risks, persuasion and\nmanipulation, uncontrolled autonomous AI R\\&D, strategic deception and\nscheming, self-replication, and collusion. Guided by the \"AI-$45^\\circ$ Law,\"\nwe evaluate these risks using \"red lines\" (intolerable thresholds) and \"yellow\nlines\" (early warning indicators) to define risk zones: green (manageable risk\nfor routine deployment and continuous monitoring), yellow (requiring\nstrengthened mitigations and controlled deployment), and red (necessitating\nsuspension of development and/or deployment). Experimental results show that\nall recent frontier AI models reside in green and yellow zones, without\ncrossing red lines. Specifically, no evaluated models cross the yellow line for\ncyber offense or uncontrolled AI R\\&D risks. For self-replication, and\nstrategic deception and scheming, most models remain in the green zone, except\nfor certain reasoning models in the yellow zone. In persuasion and\nmanipulation, most models are in the yellow zone due to their effective\ninfluence on humans. For biological and chemical risks, we are unable to rule\nout the possibility of most models residing in the yellow zone, although\ndetailed threat modeling and in-depth assessment are required to make further\nclaims.
