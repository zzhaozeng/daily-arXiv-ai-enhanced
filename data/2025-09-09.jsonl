However, most existing mesh simplification methods exhibit\na few issues. Firstly, they often lead to self-intersections during decimation,\na major issue for applications such as 3D printing and soft-body simulation.\nSecond, to perform simplification on a mesh in the wild, one would first need\nto perform re-meshing, which often suffers from surface shifts and losses of\nsharp features. Finally, existing re-meshing and simplification methods can\ntake minutes when processing large-scale meshes, limiting their applications in\npractice. To address the challenges, we introduce a novel GPU-based mesh\noptimization approach containing three key components: (1) a parallel\nre-meshing algorithm to turn meshes in the wild into watertight, manifold, and\nintersection-free ones, and reduce the prevalence of poorly shaped triangles;\n(2) a robust parallel simplification algorithm with intersection-free\nguarantees; (3) an optimization-based safe projection algorithm to realign the\nsimplified mesh with the input, eliminating the surface shift introduced by\nre-meshing and recovering the original sharp features. The algorithm\ndemonstrates remarkable efficiency, simplifying a 2-million-face mesh to 20k\ntriangles in 3 seconds on RTX4090.

This study overcomes\nthis challenge by offering a fabrication algorithm for direct 3D printing of\nsuch networks with programmed tension gradients, an approach analogous to the\nspinning of spiderwebs. The algorithm: (i) defines the desired network and\nprescribes its tension gradients using the force density method; (ii) converts\nthe network into an unstretched counterpart by numerically optimizing vertex\nlocations toward target element lengths and converting straight elements into\narcs to resolve any remaining error; and (iii) decomposes the network into\nprintable toolpaths; Optional additional steps are: (iv) flattening curved 2D\nnetworks or 3D networks to ensure 3D printing compatibility; and (v)\nautomatically resolving any unwanted crossings introduced by the flattening\nprocess. The proposed method is experimentally validated using 2D unit cells of\nviscoelastic filaments, where accurate tension gradients are achieved with an\naverage element strain error of less than 1.0\\%.

Traditional skeletal animation methods maintain geometric\nconsistency but struggle with complex non-rigid elements like flowing hair and\nskirts, leading to unnatural deformation. Conversely, video diffusion models\nsynthesize realistic dynamics but often create geometric distortions in\nstylized drawings due to domain gaps. This work proposes a hybrid animation\nsystem that combines skeletal animation and video diffusion. Initially, coarse\nimages are generated from characters retargeted with skeletal animations for\ngeometric guidance. These images are then enhanced in texture and secondary\ndynamics using video diffusion priors, framing this enhancement as an\ninpainting task. A domain-adapted diffusion model refines user-masked regions\nneeding improvement, especially for secondary dynamics. To enhance motion\nrealism further, we introduce a Secondary Dynamics Injection (SDI) strategy in\nthe denoising process, incorporating features from a pre-trained diffusion\nmodel enriched with human motion priors.

On the other hand, methods for estimating\nbiomechanically accurate skeletal motion typically rely on complex motion\ncapture systems and expensive optimization methods. What is needed is a\nparametric 3D human model with a biomechanically accurate skeletal structure\nthat can be easily posed. To that end, we develop SKEL, which re-rigs the SMPL\nbody model with a biomechanics skeleton. To enable this, we need training data\nof skeletons inside SMPL meshes in diverse poses.\n  We build such a dataset by optimizing biomechanically accurate skeletons\ninside SMPL meshes from AMASS sequences.

Prior work has proposed representing a method\nas a pair of a question and its corresponding solution, enabling method reuse.\nHowever, existing approaches typically require the questions to be highly\nsimilar. In this paper, we extend the scope of method reuse to address\nquestions with low similarity or with hidden similarities that are not\nexplicitly observable. For questions that are similar in a general-specific\nsense (i.e., broader or narrower in scope), we propose to first separate the\nquestion and solution, rather than directly feeding the pair to the LLM. The\nLLM is then guided to adapt the solution to new but related questions, allowing\nit to focus on solution transfer rather than question recognition. Furthermore,\nwe extend this approach to cases where questions only share partial features or\nhidden characteristics. This enables cross-question method reuse beyond\nconventional similarity constraints. Experimental verification shows that our\nscope-extension approach increases the probability of filtering out reusable\nsolutions, thereby improving the effectiveness of cross-question method reuse."}

The quality of generation strongly depends on how expressive and\nwell-optimized these latent embeddings are. While various methods have been\nproposed to learn effective latent representations, the reconstructed images\noften lack realism, particularly in textured regions with sharp transitions,\ndue to loss of fine details governed by high frequencies. We conduct a detailed\nfrequency decomposition of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) latent tokenizers\nand show that conventional objectives inherently prioritize low-frequency\nreconstruction, often at the expense of high-frequency fidelity. Our analysis\nreveals these latent tokenizers exhibit a bias toward low-frequency\ninformation, when jointly optimized, leading to over-smoothed outputs and\nvisual artifacts that diminish perceptual quality.

To overcome this fundamental limitation, we previously proposed\nPREFACE, a model-agnostic framework based on reinforcement learning (RL) that\niteratively repairs the prompts provided to frozen LLMs, systematically\nsteering them toward generating formally verifiable Dafny code without costly\nfine-tuning. This work presents Proof2Silicon, a novel end-to-end synthesis\nframework that embeds the previously proposed PREFACE flow to enable the\ngeneration of correctness-by-construction hardware directly from natural\nlanguage specifications. Proof2Silicon operates by: (1) leveraging PREFACE's\nverifier-driven RL agent to optimize prompt generation iteratively, ensuring\nDafny code correctness; (2) automatically translating verified Dafny programs\ninto synthesizable high-level C using Dafny's Python backend and PyLog; and (3)\nemploying Vivado HLS to produce RTL implementations. Evaluated rigorously on a\nchallenging 100-task benchmark, PREFACE's RL-guided prompt optimization\nconsistently improved Dafny verification success rates across diverse LLMs by\nup to 21%.

More\nspecifically, it proposes a novel data augmentation strategy, 'Shuffle and\nWarp', which exploits diverse multi-action permutations. The latter effectively\nassists two surrogate tasks that are introduced in contrastive learning: Cross\nPermutation Contrasting (CPC) and Relative Order Reasoning (ROR). In\noptimization, CPC learns intra-class similarities by contrasting\nrepresentations of the same action class across different permutations, while\nROR reasons about inter-class contexts by predicting relative mapping between\ntwo permutations.

While\nadaptive computation methods like early-exiting promise to reduce these costs,\nthey introduce a fundamental conflict: the per-token dynamism intended to save\ncomputation often creates system-level bottlenecks that can paradoxically\nreduce throughput in batched inference. This dissertation resolves this\nconflict by co-designing adaptive algorithms and model architectures to strike\nan optimal balance between dynamism and efficiency. To this end, our work first\naddresses critical sources of overhead in conventional early-exiting by\nproposing an efficient parallel decoding mechanism. We then show that deep\nparameter sharing provides an architectural foundation that not only yields\ncompact, parameter-efficient models but also inherently mitigates the critical\nsynchronization issues affecting dynamic inference. Finally, this work presents\na unified framework where lightweight routers are pretrained to dynamically\nassign an optimal recursion depth for each token. This approach establishes a\nnew Pareto frontier between efficiency and performance by effectively\noptimizing for both adaptive computation and parameter efficiency within a\nsingle model."}

While few recent techniques successfully achieve these goals for NSFW\nconcepts, none could handle narrow concepts such as copyrighted characters or\ncelebrities. Erasing these narrow concepts is critical in addressing copyright\nand legal concerns.

To take the first step in bridging this gap, we\nintroduce MAS-Bench, a benchmark that pioneers the evaluation of GUI-shortcut\nhybrid agents with a specific focus on the mobile domain. Beyond merely using\npredefined shortcuts, MAS-Bench assesses an agent's capability to autonomously\ngenerate shortcuts by discovering and creating reusable, low-cost workflows. It\nfeatures 139 complex tasks across 11 real-world applications, a knowledge base\nof 88 predefined shortcuts (APIs, deep-links, RPA scripts), and 7 evaluation\nmetrics. The tasks are designed to be solvable via GUI-only operations, but can\nbe significantly accelerated by intelligently embedding shortcuts.

Our approach utilizes a\ndual-branch feature extraction framework, leveraging a Difference-Aware Fusion\nModule (DAFM) and Joint-Constrained Interaction Aggregation (JCIA) strategy to\nenable deep fusion and joint-constrained semantic and structural information\nrepresentation. Furthermore, we propose a 3D geographic augmentation technique\nto generate potential viewpoint variation samples, enhancing the network's\nability to learn viewpoint-invariant features. Extensive experiments on the\nUniversity-1652 and SUES-200 datasets validate the robustness of our method\nagainst complex viewpoint ariations, achieving state-of-the-art performance."}

Our investigation reveals a\nsignificant drawback to this approach: SDE-based sampling introduces pronounced\nnoise artifacts in the generated images, which we found to be detrimental to\nthe reward learning process. A rigorous theoretical analysis traces the origin\nof this noise to an excess of stochasticity injected during inference. To\naddress this, we draw inspiration from Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models\n(DDIM) to reformulate the sampling process. Our proposed method,\nCoefficients-Preserving Sampling (CPS), eliminates these noise artifacts. This\nleads to more accurate reward modeling, ultimately enabling faster and more\nstable convergence for reinforcement learning-based optimizers like Flow-GRPO\nand Dance-GRPO.

In this paper, we develop a novel fine-grained\ndynamic perception (FDP) framework for MER. We propose to rank frame-level\nfeatures of a sequence of raw frames in chronological order, in which the rank\nprocess encodes the dynamic information of both ME appearances and motions.\nSpecifically, a novel local-global feature-aware transformer is proposed for\nframe representation learning. A rank scorer is further adopted to calculate\nrank scores of each frame-level feature. Afterwards, the rank features from\nrank scorer are pooled in temporal dimension to capture dynamic representation.\nFinally, the dynamic representation is shared by a MER module and a dynamic\nimage construction module, in which the former predicts the ME category, and\nthe latter uses an encoder-decoder structure to construct the dynamic image.\nThe design of dynamic image construction task is beneficial for capturing\nfacial subtle actions associated with MEs and alleviating the data scarcity\nissue. Extensive experiments show that our method (i) significantly outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art MER methods, and (ii) works well for dynamic image\nconstruction.

Existing methods face two main issues: (1) SAM-based methods\nstruggle to separate camouflaged object edges due to model freezing, and (2)\nMLLM-based methods suffer from poor object separability as large language\nmodels merge foreground and background. To address these issues, we propose a\nnovel VCOD method based on SAM and MLLM, called Phantom-Insight. To enhance the\nseparability of object edge details, we represent video sequences with temporal\nand spatial clues and perform feature fusion via LLM to increase information\ndensity. Next, multiple cues are generated through the dynamic foreground\nvisual token scoring module and the prompt network to adaptively guide and\nfine-tune the SAM model, enabling it to adapt to subtle textures. To enhance\nthe separability of objects and background, we propose a decoupled\nforeground-background learning strategy.

In this paper, a\nselective Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is proposed for deblurring in\nthe preprocessing step, coupled with the state-of-the-art You-Only-Look-Once\n(YOLO)v5 object detection architectures for License-Plate Detection (LPD), and\nthe integrated Character Segmentation (CS) and Character Recognition (CR)\nsteps. The selective preprocessing bypasses unnecessary and sometimes\ncounter-productive input manipulations, while YOLOv5 LPD/CS+CR delivers high\naccuracy and low computing cost. As a result, YOLOv5 achieves a detection time\nof 0.026 seconds for both LP and CR detection stages, facilitating real-time\napplications with exceptionally rapid responsiveness. Moreover, the proposed\nmodel achieves accuracy rates of 95\\% and 97\\% in the LPD and CR detection\nphases, respectively. Furthermore, the inclusion of the Deblur-GAN\npre-processor significantly improves detection accuracy by nearly 40\\%,\nespecially when encountering blurred License Plates (LPs).To train and test the\nlearning components, we generated and publicly released our blur and ALPR\ndatasets (using Iranian license plates as a use-case), which are more\nrepresentative of close-to-real-life ad-hoc situations. The findings\ndemonstrate that employing the state-of-the-art YOLO model results in excellent\noverall precision and detection time, making it well-suited for portable\napplications.

Motivated by\nrecent advances in interleaving reasoning, we explore whether such reasoning\ncan further improve Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. We introduce Interleaving\nReasoning Generation (IRG), a framework that alternates between text-based\nthinking and image synthesis: the model first produces a text-based thinking to\nguide an initial image, then reflects on the result to refine fine-grained\ndetails, visual quality, and aesthetics while preserving semantics. To train\nIRG effectively, we propose Interleaving Reasoning Generation Learning (IRGL),\nwhich targets two sub-goals: (1) strengthening the initial think-and-generate\nstage to establish core content and base quality, and (2) enabling high-quality\ntextual reflection and faithful implementation of those refinements in a\nsubsequent image. We curate IRGL-300K, a dataset organized into six decomposed\nlearning modes that jointly cover learning text-based thinking, and full\nthinking-image trajectories. Starting from a unified foundation model that\nnatively emits interleaved text-image outputs, our two-stage training first\nbuilds robust thinking and reflection, then efficiently tunes the IRG pipeline\nin the full thinking-image trajectory data.

H$_{2}$OT begins with\nprogressively pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering\nfull-length sequences, resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate\ntransformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. It works with two\nkey modules, namely, a Token Pruning Module (TPM) and a Token Recovering Module\n(TRM).
