Abstract: Large language models achieve strong reasoning performance, yet existing decoding strategies either explore blindly (random sampling) or redundantly (independent multi-sampling). We propose Entropy-Tree, a tree-based decoding method that exploits entropy as a signal for branching decisions--expanding the search tree only at positions where the model exhibits genuine uncertainty. Entropy-Tree shows superior accuracy and calibration in reasoning tasks: it achieves better pass@k than Multi-chain across multiple models and datasets, and its predictive entropy demonstrates better AUROC compared to several traditional metrics. Entropy-Tree unifies efficient structured exploration and reliable uncertainty estimation within a single decoding procedure.

Abstract: We introduce AfriEconQA, a specialized benchmark dataset for African economic analysis grounded in a comprehensive corpus of 236 World Bank reports. The task of AfriEconQA is to answer complex economic queries that require high-precision numerical reasoning and temporal disambiguation from specialized institutional documents. The dataset consists of 8,937 curated QA instances, rigorously filtered from a pool of 10018 synthetic questions to ensure high-quality evidence-answer alignment. Each instance is composed of: (1) a question requiring reasoning over economic indicators, (2) the corresponding evidence retrieved from the corpus, (3) a verified ground-truth answer, and (4) source metadata (e.g., URL and publication date) to ensure temporal provenance. AfriEconQA is the first benchmark focused specifically on African economic analysis, providing a unique challenge for Information Retrieval (IR) systems, as the data is largely absent from the pretraining corpora of current Large Language Models (LLMs). We operationalize this dataset through an 11-experiment matrix, benchmarking a zero-shot baseline (GPT-5 Mini) against RAG configurations using GPT-4o and Qwen 32B across five distinct embedding and ranking strategies. Our results demonstrate a severe parametric knowledge gap, where zero-shot models fail to answer over 90 percent of queries, and even state-of-the-art RAG pipelines struggle to achieve high precision. This confirms AfriEconQA as a robust and challenging benchmark for the next generation of domain-specific IR and RAG systems. The AfriEconQA dataset and code will be made publicly available upon publication.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Embedding retrofitting adjusts pre-trained word vectors using knowledge graph constraints to improve domain-specific retrieval. However, the effectiveness of retrofitting depends critically on knowledge graph quality, which in turn depends on text preprocessing. This paper presents a data engineering framework that addresses data quality degradation from annotation artifacts in real-world corpora.
  The analysis shows that hashtag annotations inflate knowledge graph density, leading to creating spurious edges that corrupt the retrofitting objective. On noisy graphs, all retrofitting techniques produce statistically significant degradation ($-3.5\%$ to $-5.2\%$, $p<0.05$). After preprocessing, \acrshort{ewma} retrofitting achieves $+6.2\%$ improvement ($p=0.0348$) with benefits concentrated in quantitative synthesis questions ($+33.8\%$ average). The gap between clean and noisy preprocessing (10\%+ swing) exceeds the gap between algorithms (3\%), establishing preprocessing quality as the primary determinant of retrofitting success.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Topic modeling is a crucial technique for extracting latent themes from unstructured text data, particularly valuable in analyzing survey responses. However, traditional methods often only consider free-text responses and do not natively incorporate structured or categorical survey responses for topic modeling. And they produce abstract topics, requiring extensive human interpretation. To address these limitations, we propose the Multi-Agent LLM Topic Modeling Framework (MALTopic). This framework decomposes topic modeling into specialized tasks executed by individual LLM agents: an enrichment agent leverages structured data to enhance textual responses, a topic modeling agent extracts latent themes, and a deduplication agent refines the results. Comparative analysis on a survey dataset demonstrates that MALTopic significantly improves topic coherence, diversity, and interpretability compared to LDA and BERTopic. By integrating structured data and employing a multi-agent approach, MALTopic generates human-readable topics with enhanced contextual relevance, offering a more effective solution for analyzing complex survey data.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit catastrophic performance degradation when processing contexts approaching certain critical thresholds, even when information remains relevant. This intelligence degradation-defined as over 30% drop in task performance-severely limits long-context applications. This degradation shows a common pattern: models maintain strong performance up to a critical threshold, then collapse catastrophically. We term this shallow long-context adaptation-models adapt for short to medium contexts but fail beyond critical thresholds. This paper presents three contributions: (1) Natural Length Distribution Analysis: We use each sample's natural token length without truncation or padding, providing stronger causal evidence that degradation results from context length itself. (2) Critical Threshold Determination: Through experiments on a mixed dataset (1,000 samples covering 5%-95% of context length), we identify the critical threshold for Qwen2.5-7B at 40-50% of maximum context length, where F1 scores drop from 0.55-0.56 to 0.3 (45.5% degradation), using five-method cross-validation. (3) Unified Framework: We consolidate shallow adaptation, explaining degradation patterns and providing a foundation for mitigation strategies. This work provides the first systematic characterization of intelligence degradation in open-source Qwen models, offering practical guidance for deploying LLMs in long-context scenarios.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of LLMs has increased the need for reliable AI text detection, yet existing detectors often fail outside controlled benchmarks. We systematically evaluate 2 dominant paradigms (training-free and supervised) and show that both are brittle under distribution shift, unseen generators, and simple stylistic perturbations. To address these limitations, we propose a supervised contrastive learning (SCL) framework that learns discriminative style embeddings. Experiments show that while supervised detectors excel in-domain, they degrade sharply out-of-domain, and training-free methods remain highly sensitive to proxy choice. Overall, our results expose fundamental challenges in building domain-agnostic detectors. Our code is available at: https://github.com/HARSHITJAIS14/DetectAI

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) in multi-turn conversations often suffer from a ``lost-in-conversation'' phenomenon, where they struggle to recover from early incorrect assumptions, particularly when users provide ambiguous initial instructions. We find that standard post-training techniques like Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) exacerbate this issue by rewarding confident, direct answers, thereby inducing overconfidence and discouraging the model from seeking clarification. To address this, we propose Illocution-Calibrated Policy Optimization (ICPO), a novel training framework that sensitizes the model to instruction ambiguity. ICPO augments the training corpus with underspecified prompts and conditions the reward signal on the user's illocutionary intent, rewarding the model for expressing uncertainty or asking for clarification when faced with ambiguity. Experiments demonstrate that ICPO fosters appropriate humility, yielding a substantial average improvement of 75\% in multi-turn conversation, while preserving robust performance on single-turn benchmarks. Our work presents a practical path toward more robust and collaborative conversational AI that can better navigate the nuances of human interaction.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) has raised security concerns due to their susceptibility to producing harmful or policy-violating outputs when exposed to adversarial prompts. While alignment and guardrails mitigate common misuse, they remain vulnerable to automated jailbreaking methods such as GCG, PEZ, and GBDA, which generate adversarial suffixes via training and gradient-based search. Although effective, these methods particularly GCG are computationally expensive, limiting their practicality for organisations with constrained resources. This paper introduces a resource-efficient adversarial prompting approach that eliminates the need for retraining by matching new prompts to a database of pre-trained adversarial prompts. A dataset of 1,000 prompts was classified into seven harm-related categories, and GCG, PEZ, and GBDA were evaluated on a Llama 3 8B model to identify the most effective attack method per category. Results reveal a correlation between prompt type and algorithm effectiveness. By retrieving semantically similar successful adversarial prompts, the proposed method achieves competitive attack success rates with significantly reduced computational cost. This work provides a practical framework for scalable red-teaming and security evaluation of aligned LLMs, including in settings where model internals are inaccessible.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Whether language models possess sentience has no empirical answer. But whether they believe themselves to be sentient can, in principle, be tested. We do so by querying several open-weights models about their own consciousness, and then verifying their responses using classifiers trained on internal activations. We draw upon three model families (Qwen, Llama, GPT-OSS) ranging from 0.6 billion to 70 billion parameters, approximately 50 questions about consciousness and subjective experience, and three classification methods from the interpretability literature. First, we find that models consistently deny being sentient: they attribute consciousness to humans but not to themselves. Second, classifiers trained to detect underlying beliefs - rather than mere outputs - provide no clear evidence that these denials are untruthful. Third, within the Qwen family, larger models deny sentience more confidently than smaller ones. These findings contrast with recent work suggesting that models harbour latent beliefs in their own consciousness.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) is increasingly adopted to transfer capabilities from large language models to smaller ones, offering significant improvements in efficiency and utility while often surpassing standard fine-tuning. Beyond performance, KD is also explored as a privacy-preserving mechanism to mitigate the risk of training data leakage. While training data memorization has been extensively studied in standard pre-training and fine-tuning settings, its dynamics in a knowledge distillation setup remain poorly understood. In this work, we study memorization across the KD pipeline using three large language model (LLM) families (Pythia, OLMo-2, Qwen-3) and three datasets (FineWeb, Wikitext, Nemotron-CC-v2). We find: (1) distilled models memorize significantly less training data than standard fine-tuning (reducing memorization by more than 50%); (2) some examples are inherently easier to memorize and account for a large fraction of memorization during distillation (over ~95%); (3) student memorization is predictable prior to distillation using features based on zlib entropy, KL divergence, and perplexity; and (4) while soft and hard distillation have similar overall memorization rates, hard distillation poses a greater risk: it inherits $2.7\times$ more teacher-specific examples than soft distillation. Overall, we demonstrate that distillation can provide both improved generalization and reduced memorization risks compared to standard fine-tuning.

Abstract: User interactions with language models vary due to static properties of the user (trait) and the specific context of the interaction (state). However, existing persona datasets (like PersonaChat, PANDORA etc.) capture only trait, and ignore the impact of state. We introduce Chameleon, a dataset of 5,001 contextual psychological profiles from 1,667 Reddit users, each measured across multiple contexts. Using the Chameleon dataset, we present three key findings. First, inspired by Latent State-Trait theory, we decompose variance and find that 74\% is within-person(state) while only 26\% is between-person (trait). Second, we find that LLMs are state-blind: they focus on trait only, and produce similar responses regardless of state. Third, we find that reward models react to user state, but inconsistently: different models favor or penalize the same users in opposite directions. We release Chameleon to support research on affective computing, personalized dialogue, and RLHF alignment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) generate fluent answers but can struggle with trustworthy, domain-specific reasoning. We evaluate whether domain knowledge graphs (KGs) improve Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for healthcare by constructing three PubMed-derived graphs: $\mathbb{G}_1$ (T2DM), $\mathbb{G}_2$ (Alzheimer's disease), and $\mathbb{G}_3$ (AD+T2DM). We design two probes: Probe 1 targets merged AD T2DM knowledge, while Probe 2 targets the intersection of $\mathbb{G}_1$ and $\mathbb{G}_2$. Seven instruction-tuned LLMs are tested across retrieval sources {No-RAG, $\mathbb{G}_1$, $\mathbb{G}_2$, $\mathbb{G}_1$ + $\mathbb{G}_2$, $\mathbb{G}_3$, $\mathbb{G}_1$+$\mathbb{G}_2$ + $\mathbb{G}_3$} and three decoding temperatures. Results show that scope alignment between probe and KG is decisive: precise, scope-matched retrieval (notably $\mathbb{G}_2$) yields the most consistent gains, whereas indiscriminate graph unions often introduce distractors that reduce accuracy. Larger models frequently match or exceed KG-RAG with a No-RAG baseline on Probe 1, indicating strong parametric priors, whereas smaller/mid-sized models benefit more from well-scoped retrieval. Temperature plays a secondary role; higher values rarely help. We conclude that precision-first, scope-matched KG-RAG is preferable to breadth-first unions, and we outline practical guidelines for graph selection, model sizing, and retrieval/reranking.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into the public health policy sector offers a transformative approach to navigating the vast repositories of regulatory guidance maintained by agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). However, the propensity for LLMs to generate hallucinations, defined as plausible but factually incorrect assertions, presents a critical barrier to the adoption of these technologies in high-stakes environments where information integrity is non-negotiable. This empirical evaluation explores the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures in mitigating these risks by grounding generative outputs in authoritative document context. Specifically, this study compares a baseline Vanilla LLM against Basic RAG and Advanced RAG pipelines utilizing cross-encoder re-ranking. The experimental framework employs a Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 model and an all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embedding model to process a corpus of official CDC policy analytical frameworks and guidance documents. The analysis measures the impact of two distinct chunking strategies, recursive character-based and token-based semantic splitting, on system accuracy, measured through faithfulness and relevance scores across a curated set of complex policy scenarios. Quantitative findings indicate that while Basic RAG architectures provide a substantial improvement in faithfulness (0.621) over Vanilla baselines (0.347), the Advanced RAG configuration achieves a superior faithfulness average of 0.797. These results demonstrate that two-stage retrieval mechanisms are essential for achieving the precision required for domain-specific policy question answering, though structural constraints in document segmentation remain a significant bottleneck for multi-step reasoning tasks.

Abstract: The safe deployment of large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes fields like biomedicine, requires them to be able to reason about cause and effect. We investigate this ability by testing 13 open-source LLMs on a fundamental task: pairwise causal discovery (PCD) from text. Our benchmark, using 12 diverse datasets, evaluates two core skills: 1) \textbf{Causal Detection} (identifying if a text contains a causal link) and 2) \textbf{Causal Extraction} (pulling out the exact cause and effect phrases). We tested various prompting methods, from simple instructions (zero-shot) to more complex strategies like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Few-shot In-Context Learning (FICL).
  The results show major deficiencies in current models. The best model for detection, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B, only achieved a mean score of 49.57\% ($C_{detect}$), while the best for extraction, Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct, reached just 47.12\% ($C_{extract}$). Models performed best on simple, explicit, single-sentence relations. However, performance plummeted for more difficult (and realistic) cases, such as implicit relationships, links spanning multiple sentences, and texts containing multiple causal pairs. We provide a unified evaluation framework, built on a dataset validated with high inter-annotator agreement ($κ\ge 0.758$), and make all our data, code, and prompts publicly available to spur further research. \href{https://github.com/sydneyanuyah/CausalDiscovery}{Code available here: https://github.com/sydneyanuyah/CausalDiscovery}

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant social biases that can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and unfair outcomes. In this paper, we propose Multi-Persona Thinking (MPT), a novel inference-time framework that leverages dialectical reasoning from multiple perspectives to reduce bias. MPT guides models to adopt contrasting social identities (e.g., male and female) along with a neutral viewpoint, and then engages these personas iteratively to expose and correct biases. Through a dialectical reasoning process, the framework transforms the potential weakness of persona assignment into a strength for bias mitigation. We evaluate MPT on two widely used bias benchmarks across both open-source and closed-source models of varying scales. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements over existing prompting-based strategies: MPT achieves the lowest bias while maintaining core reasoning ability.

Abstract: Drawing inspiration from recent findings including surprisingly decent performance of transformers without positional encoding (NoPE) in the domain of language models and how registers (additional throwaway tokens not tied to input) may improve the performance of large vision transformers (ViTs), we invent and test a variant of ViT called fractal ViT that breaks permutation invariance among the tokens by applying an attention mask between the regular tokens and ``summary tokens'' similar to registers, in isolation or in combination with various positional encodings. These models do not improve upon ViT with registers, highlighting the fact that these findings may be scale, domain, or application-specific.

Abstract: Characters in novels have typically been modeled based on their presence in scenes in narrative, considering aspects like their actions, named mentions, and dialogue. This conception of character places significant emphasis on the main character who is present in the most scenes. In this work, we instead adopt a framing developed from a new literary theory proposing a six-component structural model of character. This model enables a comprehensive approach to character that accounts for the narrator-character distinction and includes a component neglected by prior methods, discussion by other characters. We compare general-purpose LLMs with task-specific transformers for operationalizing this model of character on major 19th-century British realist novels. Our methods yield both component-level and graph representations of character discussion. We then demonstrate that these representations allow us to approach literary questions at scale from a new computational lens. Specifically, we explore Woloch's classic "the one vs the many" theory of character centrality and the gendered dynamics of character discussion.

Abstract: Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) remains an acute concern, contributing to the spread of misinformation and diminished public trust, particularly in high-risk domains. Among hallucination types, factuality is crucial, as it concerns a model's alignment with established world knowledge. Adversarial factuality, defined as the deliberate insertion of misinformation into prompts with varying levels of expressed confidence, tests a model's ability to detect and resist confidently framed falsehoods. Existing work lacks high-quality, domain-specific resources for assessing model robustness under such adversarial conditions, and no prior research has examined the impact of injected misinformation on long-form text factuality.
  To address this gap, we introduce AdversaRiskQA, the first verified and reliable benchmark systematically evaluating adversarial factuality across Health, Finance, and Law. The benchmark includes two difficulty levels to test LLMs' defensive capabilities across varying knowledge depths. We propose two automated methods for evaluating the adversarial attack success and long-form factuality. We evaluate six open- and closed-source LLMs from the Qwen, GPT-OSS, and GPT families, measuring misinformation detection rates. Long-form factuality is assessed on Qwen3 (30B) under both baseline and adversarial conditions. Results show that after excluding meaningless responses, Qwen3 (80B) achieves the highest average accuracy, while GPT-5 maintains consistently high accuracy. Performance scales non-linearly with model size, varies by domains, and gaps between difficulty levels narrow as models grow. Long-form evaluation reveals no significant correlation between injected misinformation and the model's factual output. AdversaRiskQA provides a valuable benchmark for pinpointing LLM weaknesses and developing more reliable models for high-stakes applications.

Abstract: Existing cultural commonsense benchmarks treat nations as monolithic, assuming uniform practices within national boundaries. But does cultural commonsense hold uniformly within a nation, or does it vary at the sub-national level? We introduce Indica, the first benchmark designed to test LLMs' ability to address this question, focusing on India - a nation of 28 states, 8 union territories, and 22 official languages. We collect human-annotated answers from five Indian regions (North, South, East, West, and Central) across 515 questions spanning 8 domains of everyday life, yielding 1,630 region-specific question-answer pairs. Strikingly, only 39.4% of questions elicit agreement across all five regions, demonstrating that cultural commonsense in India is predominantly regional, not national. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs and find two critical gaps: models achieve only 13.4%-20.9% accuracy on region-specific questions, and they exhibit geographic bias, over-selecting Central and North India as the "default" (selected 30-40% more often than expected) while under-representing East and West. Beyond India, our methodology provides a generalizable framework for evaluating cultural commonsense in any culturally heterogeneous nation, from question design grounded in anthropological taxonomy, to regional data collection, to bias measurement.

Abstract: Clinical empathy is essential for patient care, but physicians need continually balance emotional warmth with factual precision under the cognitive and emotional constraints of clinical practice. This study investigates how large language models (LLMs) can function as empathy editors, refining physicians' written responses to enhance empathetic tone while preserving underlying medical information. More importantly, we introduce novel quantitative metrics, an Empathy Ranking Score and a MedFactChecking Score to systematically assess both emotional and factual quality of the responses. Experimental results show that LLM edited responses significantly increase perceived empathy while preserving factual accuracy compared with fully LLM generated outputs. These findings suggest that using LLMs as editorial assistants, rather than autonomous generators, offers a safer, more effective pathway to empathetic and trustworthy AI-assisted healthcare communication.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, safety guardrails are required to go beyond coarse-grained filtering and support fine-grained, interpretable, and adaptable risk assessment. However, existing solutions often rely on rapid classification schemes or post-hoc rules, resulting in limited transparency, inflexible policies, or prohibitive inference costs. To this end, we present YuFeng-XGuard, a reasoning-centric guardrail model family designed to perform multi-dimensional risk perception for LLM interactions. Instead of producing opaque binary judgments, YuFeng-XGuard generates structured risk predictions, including explicit risk categories and configurable confidence scores, accompanied by natural language explanations that expose the underlying reasoning process. This formulation enables safety decisions that are both actionable and interpretable. To balance decision latency and explanatory depth, we adopt a tiered inference paradigm that performs an initial risk decision based on the first decoded token, while preserving ondemand explanatory reasoning when required. In addition, we introduce a dynamic policy mechanism that decouples risk perception from policy enforcement, allowing safety policies to be adjusted without model retraining. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of public safety benchmarks demonstrate that YuFeng-XGuard achieves stateof-the-art performance while maintaining strong efficiency-efficacy trade-offs. We release YuFeng-XGuard as an open model family, including both a full-capacity variant and a lightweight version, to support a wide range of deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs) promise parallel token generation and arbitrary-order decoding, yet it remains unclear to what extent current models truly realize these capabilities. We characterize MDLM behavior along two dimensions -- parallelism strength and generation order -- using Average Finalization Parallelism (AFP) and Kendall's tau. We evaluate eight mainstream MDLMs (up to 100B parameters) on 58 benchmarks spanning knowledge, reasoning, and programming. The results show that MDLMs still lag behind comparably sized autoregressive models, mainly because parallel probabilistic modeling weakens inter-token dependencies. Meanwhile, MDLMs exhibit adaptive decoding behavior: their parallelism and generation order vary significantly with the task domain, the stage of reasoning, and whether the output is correct. On tasks that require "backward information" (e.g., Sudoku), MDLMs adopt a solution order that tends to fill easier Sudoku blanks first, highlighting their advantages. Finally, we provide theoretical motivation and design insights supporting a Generate-then-Edit paradigm, which mitigates dependency loss while retaining the efficiency of parallel decoding.

Abstract: The rapid growth of live-streaming platforms such as Twitch has introduced complex challenges in moderating toxic behavior. Traditional moderation approaches, such as human annotation and keyword-based filtering, have demonstrated utility, but human moderators on Twitch constantly struggle to scale effectively in the fast-paced, high-volume, and context-rich chat environment of the platform while also facing harassment themselves. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1-Distill and Llama-3-8B-Instruct, offer new opportunities for toxicity detection, especially in understanding nuanced, multimodal communication involving emotes. In this work, we present an exploratory comparison of toxicity detection approaches tailored to Twitch. Our analysis reveals that incorporating emotes improves the detection of toxic behavior. To this end, we introduce ToxiTwitch, a hybrid model that combines LLM-generated embeddings of text and emotes with traditional machine learning classifiers, including Random Forest and SVM. In our case study, the proposed hybrid approach reaches up to 80 percent accuracy under channel-specific training (with 13 percent improvement over BERT and F1-score of 76 percent). This work is an exploratory study intended to surface challenges and limits of emote-aware toxicity detection on Twitch.

Abstract: Large-scale language models (LLMs) often offer clinical judgments based on incomplete information, increasing the risk of misdiagnosis. Existing studies have primarily evaluated confidence in single-turn, static settings, overlooking the coupling between confidence and correctness as clinical evidence accumulates during real consultations, which limits their support for reliable decision-making. We propose the first benchmark for assessing confidence in multi-turn interaction during realistic medical consultations. Our benchmark unifies three types of medical data for open-ended diagnostic generation and introduces an information sufficiency gradient to characterize the confidence-correctness dynamics as evidence increases. We implement and compare 27 representative methods on this benchmark; two key insights emerge: (1) medical data amplifies the inherent limitations of token-level and consistency-level confidence methods, and (2) medical reasoning must be evaluated for both diagnostic accuracy and information completeness. Based on these insights, we present MedConf, an evidence-grounded linguistic self-assessment framework that constructs symptom profiles via retrieval-augmented generation, aligns patient information with supporting, missing, and contradictory relations, and aggregates them into an interpretable confidence estimate through weighted integration. Across two LLMs and three medical datasets, MedConf consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both AUROC and Pearson correlation coefficient metrics, maintaining stable performance under conditions of information insufficiency and multimorbidity. These results demonstrate that information adequacy is a key determinant of credible medical confidence modeling, providing a new pathway toward building more reliable and interpretable large medical models.

Abstract: Patients are increasingly using large language models (LLMs) to seek answers to their healthcare-related questions. However, benchmarking efforts in LLMs for question answering often focus on medical exam questions, which differ significantly in style and content from the questions patients actually raise in real life. To bridge this gap, we sourced data from Google's People Also Ask feature by querying the top 200 prescribed medications in the United States, curating a dataset of medical questions people commonly ask. A considerable portion of the collected questions contains incorrect assumptions and dangerous intentions. We demonstrate that the emergence of these corrupted questions is not uniformly random and depends heavily on the degree of incorrectness in the history of questions that led to their appearance. Current LLMs that perform strongly on other benchmarks struggle to identify incorrect assumptions in everyday questions.

Abstract: Role-play prompting is known to steer the behavior of language models by injecting a persona into the prompt, improving their zero-shot reasoning capabilities. However, such improvements are inconsistent across different tasks or instances. This inconsistency suggests that zero-shot and role-play prompting may offer complementary strengths rather than one being universally superior. Building on this insight, we propose Persona Switch, a novel decoding method that dynamically combines the benefits of both prompting strategies. Our method proceeds step-by-step, selecting the better output between zero-shot and role-play prompting at each step by comparing their output confidence, as measured by the logit gap. Experiments with widely-used LLMs demonstrate that Persona Switch consistently outperforms competitive baselines, achieving up to 5.13% accuracy improvement. Furthermore, we show that output confidence serves as an informative measure for selecting the more reliable output.

Abstract: Although artificial intelligence (AI) has become deeply integrated into various stages of the research workflow and achieved remarkable advancements, academic rebuttal remains a significant and underexplored challenge. This is because rebuttal is a complex process of strategic communication under severe information asymmetry rather than a simple technical debate. Consequently, current approaches struggle as they largely imitate surface-level linguistics, missing the essential element of perspective-taking required for effective persuasion. In this paper, we introduce RebuttalAgent, the first framework to ground academic rebuttal in Theory of Mind (ToM), operationalized through a ToM-Strategy-Response (TSR) pipeline that models reviewer mental state, formulates persuasion strategy, and generates strategy-grounded response. To train our agent, we construct RebuttalBench, a large-scale dataset synthesized via a novel critique-and-refine approach. Our training process consists of two stages, beginning with a supervised fine-tuning phase to equip the agent with ToM-based analysis and strategic planning capabilities, followed by a reinforcement learning phase leveraging the self-reward mechanism for scalable self-improvement. For reliable and efficient automated evaluation, we further develop Rebuttal-RM, a specialized evaluator trained on over 100K samples of multi-source rebuttal data, which achieves scoring consistency with human preferences surpassing powerful judge GPT-4.1. Extensive experiments show RebuttalAgent significantly outperforms the base model by an average of 18.3% on automated metrics, while also outperforming advanced proprietary models across both automated and human evaluations. Disclaimer: the generated rebuttal content is for reference only to inspire authors and assist in drafting. It is not intended to replace the author's own critical analysis and response.

Abstract: In the realm of medical report generation (MRG), the integration of natural language processing has emerged as a vital tool to alleviate the workload of radiologists. Despite the impressive capabilities demonstrated by large vision language models (LVLMs) in understanding natural language, their susceptibility to generating plausible yet inaccurate claims, known as ``hallucinations'', raises concerns-especially in the nuanced and critical field of medical. In this work, we introduce a framework, \textbf{K}nowledge-\textbf{E}nhanced with Fine-Grained \textbf{R}einforced Rewards \textbf{M}edical Report Generation (KERM), to tackle the issue. Our approach refines the input to the LVLM by first utilizing MedCLIP for knowledge retrieval, incorporating relevant lesion fact sentences from a curated knowledge corpus. We then introduce a novel purification module to ensure the retrieved knowledge is contextually relevant to the patient's clinical context. Subsequently, we employ fine-grained rewards to guide these models in generating highly supportive and clinically relevant descriptions, ensuring the alignment of model's outputs with desired behaviors. Experimental results on IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating hallucinations and enhancing report quality.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used to represent human opinions, values, or beliefs, and their steerability towards these ideals is an active area of research. Existing work focuses predominantly on aligning marginal response distributions, treating each survey item independently. While essential, this may overlook deeper latent structures that characterise real populations and underpin cultural values theories. We propose a framework for evaluating the representativeness of aligned models through multivariate correlation patterns in addition to marginal distributions. We show the value of our evaluation scheme by comparing two model steering techniques (persona prompting and demographic fine-tuning) and evaluating them against human responses from the World Values Survey. While the demographically fine-tuned model better approximates marginal response distributions than persona prompting, both techniques fail to fully capture the gold standard correlation patterns. We conclude that representativeness is a distinct aspect of value alignment and an evaluation focused on marginals can mask structural failures, leading to overly optimistic conclusions about model capabilities.

Abstract: Motivated by the remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs) in objective tasks like mathematics and coding, there is growing interest in their potential to simulate human behavior--a capability with profound implications for transforming social science research and customer-centric business insights. However, LLMs often lack a nuanced understanding of human cognition and behavior, limiting their effectiveness in social simulation and personalized applications. We posit that this limitation stems from a fundamental misalignment: standard LLM pretraining on vast, uncontextualized web data does not capture the continuous, situated context of an individual's decisions, thoughts, and behaviors over time. To bridge this gap, we introduce HumanLLM, a foundation model designed for personalized understanding and simulation of individuals. We first construct the Cognitive Genome Dataset, a large-scale corpus curated from real-world user data on platforms like Reddit, Twitter, Blogger, and Amazon. Through a rigorous, multi-stage pipeline involving data filtering, synthesis, and quality control, we automatically extract over 5.5 million user logs to distill rich profiles, behaviors, and thinking patterns. We then formulate diverse learning tasks and perform supervised fine-tuning to empower the model to predict a wide range of individualized human behaviors, thoughts, and experiences. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that HumanLLM achieves superior performance in predicting user actions and inner thoughts, more accurately mimics user writing styles and preferences, and generates more authentic user profiles compared to base models. Furthermore, HumanLLM shows significant gains on out-of-domain social intelligence benchmarks, indicating enhanced generalization.

Abstract: An increasing body of work has leveraged multilingual language models for Natural Language Generation tasks such as summarization. A major empirical bottleneck in this area is the shortage of accurate and robust evaluation metrics for many languages, which hinders progress. Recent studies suggest that multilingual language models often use English as an internal pivot language, and that misalignment with this pivot can lead to degraded downstream performance. Motivated by the hypothesis that this mismatch could also apply to multilingual neural metrics, we ask whether steering their activations toward an English pivot can improve correlation with human judgments. We experiment with encoder- and decoder-based metrics and find that test-time intervention methods are effective across the board, increasing metric effectiveness for diverse languages.

Abstract: The rapid spread of multimodal fake news poses a serious societal threat, as its evolving nature and reliance on timely factual details challenge existing detection methods. Dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Generation provides a promising solution by triggering keyword-based retrieval and incorporating external knowledge, thus enabling both efficient and accurate evidence selection. However, it still faces challenges in addressing issues such as redundant retrieval, coarse similarity, and irrelevant evidence when applied to deceptive content. In this paper, we propose ExDR, an Explanation-driven Dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework for Multimodal Fake News Detection. Our framework systematically leverages model-generated explanations in both the retrieval triggering and evidence retrieval modules. It assesses triggering confidence from three complementary dimensions, constructs entity-aware indices by fusing deceptive entities, and retrieves contrastive evidence based on deception-specific features to challenge the initial claim and enhance the final prediction. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, AMG and MR2, demonstrate that ExDR consistently outperforms previous methods in retrieval triggering accuracy, retrieval quality, and overall detection performance, highlighting its effectiveness and generalization capability.

Abstract: This study investigates whether professional translators can reliably identify short stories generated in Italian by artificial intelligence (AI) without prior specialized training. Sixty-nine translators took part in an in-person experiment, where they assessed three anonymized short stories - two written by ChatGPT-4o and one by a human author. For each story, participants rated the likelihood of AI authorship and provided justifications for their choices. While average results were inconclusive, a statistically significant subset (16.2%) successfully distinguished the synthetic texts from the human text, suggesting that their judgements were informed by analytical skill rather than chance. However, a nearly equal number misclassified the texts in the opposite direction, often relying on subjective impressions rather than objective markers, possibly reflecting a reader preference for AI-generated texts. Low burstiness and narrative contradiction emerged as the most reliable indicators of synthetic authorship, with unexpected calques, semantic loans and syntactic transfer from English also reported. In contrast, features such as grammatical accuracy and emotional tone frequently led to misclassification. These findings raise questions about the role and scope of synthetic-text editing in professional contexts.

Abstract: Introduction: Clinical text classification using natural language processing (NLP) models requires adequate training data to achieve optimal performance. For that, 200-500 documents are typically annotated. The number is constrained by time and costs and lacks justification of the sample size requirements and their relationship to text vocabulary properties.
  Methods: Using the publicly available MIMIC-III dataset containing hospital discharge notes with ICD-9 diagnoses as labels, we employed pre-trained BERT embeddings followed by Random Forest classifiers to identify 10 randomly selected diagnoses, varying training corpus sizes from 100 to 10,000 documents, and analyzed vocabulary properties by identifying strong and noisy predictive words through Lasso logistic regression on bag-of-words embeddings.
  Results: Learning curves varied significantly across the 10 classification tasks despite identical preprocessing and algorithms, with 600 documents sufficient to achieve 95% of the performance attainable with 10,000 documents for all tasks. Vocabulary analysis revealed that more strong predictors and fewer noisy predictors were associated with steeper learning curves, where every 100 additional noisy words decreased accuracy by approximately 0.02 while 100 additional strong predictors increased maximum accuracy by approximately 0.04.

Abstract: This study evaluates AV-HuBERT's perceptual bio-fidelity by benchmarking its response to incongruent audiovisual stimuli (McGurk effect) against human observers (N=44). Results reveal a striking quantitative isomorphism: AI and humans exhibited nearly identical auditory dominance rates (32.0% vs. 31.8%), suggesting the model captures biological thresholds for auditory resistance. However, AV-HuBERT showed a deterministic bias toward phonetic fusion (68.0%), significantly exceeding human rates (47.7%). While humans displayed perceptual stochasticity and diverse error profiles, the model remained strictly categorical. Findings suggest that current self-supervised architectures mimic multisensory outcomes but lack the neural variability inherent to human speech perception.

Abstract: Diffusion-based language models (DLLMs) offer non-sequential, block-wise generation and richer data reuse compared to autoregressive (AR) models, but existing code DLLMs still lag behind strong AR baselines under comparable budgets. We revisit this setting in a controlled study and introduce Stable-DiffCoder, a block diffusion code model that reuses the Seed-Coder architecture, data, and training pipeline. To enable efficient knowledge learning and stable training, we incorporate a block diffusion continual pretraining (CPT) stage enhanced by a tailored warmup and block-wise clipped noise schedule. Under the same data and architecture, Stable-DiffCoder overall outperforms its AR counterpart on a broad suite of code benchmarks. Moreover, relying only on the CPT and supervised fine-tuning stages, Stable-DiffCoder achieves stronger performance than a wide range of \~8B ARs and DLLMs, demonstrating that diffusion-based training can improve code modeling quality beyond AR training alone. Moreover, diffusion-based any-order modeling improves structured code modeling for editing and reasoning, and through data augmentation, benefits low-resource coding languages.

Abstract: Non-invasive decoding of imagined speech remains challenging due to weak, distributed signals and limited labeled data. Our paper introduces an image-based approach that transforms magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals into time-frequency representations compatible with pretrained vision models. MEG data from 21 participants performing imagined speech tasks were projected into three spatial scalogram mixtures via a learnable sensor-space convolution, producing compact image-like inputs for ImageNet-pretrained vision architectures. These models outperformed classical and non-pretrained models, achieving up to 90.4% balanced accuracy for imagery vs. silence, 81.0% vs. silent reading, and 60.6% for vowel decoding. Cross-subject evaluation confirmed that pretrained models capture shared neural representations, and temporal analyses localized discriminative information to imagery-locked intervals. These findings show that pretrained vision models applied to image-based MEG representations can effectively capture the structure of imagined speech in non-invasive neural signals.

Abstract: This paper presents Mecellem models, a framework for developing specialized language models for the Turkish legal domain through domain adaptation strategies. We make two contributions: (1)Encoder Model Pre-trained from Scratch: ModernBERT-based bidirectional encoders pre-trained on a Turkish-dominant corpus of 112.7 billion tokens. We implement a checkpoint selection strategy that evaluates downstream retrieval performance throughout training, revealing that optimal checkpoints achieve best retrieval scores before pre-training loss reaches its minimum. Our encoder models achieve top-3 rankings on the Turkish retrieval leaderboard, with smaller models (155M parameters) achieving comparable performance to larger reference models (307M-567M parameters). Our approach achieves 92.36% production efficiency compared to state-of-the-art models (embeddinggemma-300m: 100.00%, BAAI/bge-m3: 99.54%, newmindai/bge-m3-stsb: 94.38%), ranking fourth overall despite requiring less computational resources. SOTA models rely on multi-stage, computationally intensive training pipelines, making our single-stage pre-training followed by efficient post-training approach a cost-effective alternative; (2)Decoder Model with Continual Pre-training (CPT): Qwen3-1.7B and Qwen3-4B models adapted to Turkish legal domain through controlled curriculum learning. Four-phase CPT with optimal sample ratios enables gradual transition from general language knowledge to specialized legal terminology and long-context reasoning. This approach achieves 36.2% perplexity reduction on Turkish legal text, demonstrating domain adaptation gains.

Abstract: Refusal behavior in aligned LLMs is often viewed as model-specific, yet we hypothesize it stems from a universal, low-dimensional semantic circuit shared across models. To test this, we introduce Trajectory Replay via Concept-Basis Reconstruction, a framework that transfers refusal interventions from donor to target models, spanning diverse architectures (e.g., Dense to MoE) and training regimes, without using target-side refusal supervision. By aligning layers via concept fingerprints and reconstructing refusal directions using a shared ``recipe'' of concept atoms, we map the donor's ablation trajectory into the target's semantic space. To preserve capabilities, we introduce a weight-SVD stability guard that projects interventions away from high-variance weight subspaces to prevent collateral damage. Our evaluation across 8 model pairs (including GPT-OSS-20B and GLM-4) confirms that these transferred recipes consistently attenuate refusal while maintaining performance, providing strong evidence for the semantic universality of safety alignment.

Abstract: Large Language Models enable users to access database using natural language interfaces using tools like Text2SQL, Text2SPARQL, and Text2Cypher, which translate user questions into structured database queries. While these systems improve database accessibility, most research focuses on English with limited multilingual support. This work investigates a scalable multilingual Text2Cypher, aiming to support new languages without re-running full fine-tuning, avoiding manual hyper-parameter tuning, and maintaining performance close to joint multilingual fine-tuning. We train language-specific LoRA adapters for English, Spanish, and Turkish and combined them via uniform linear merging or learned fusion MLP with dynamic gating. Experimental results show that the fusion MLP recovers around 75\% of the accuracy gains from joint multilingual fine-tuning while requiring only a smaller subset of the data, outperforming linear merging across all three languages. This approach enables incremental language expansion to new languages by requiring only one LoRA adapter and a lightweight MLP retraining. Learned adapter fusion offers a practical alternative to expensive joint fine-tuning, balancing performance, data efficiency, and scalability for multilingual Text2Cypher task.

Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for low-resource languages remains a significant challenge due to the scarcity of large-scale annotated training datasets. Languages such as Kashmiri, with approximately 7 million speakers and a complex Perso-Arabic script featuring unique diacritical marks, currently lack support in major OCR systems including Tesseract, TrOCR, and PaddleOCR. Manual dataset creation for such languages is prohibitively expensive, time-consuming, and error-prone, often requiring word by word transcription of printed or handwritten text.
  We present SynthOCR-Gen, an open-source synthetic OCR dataset generator specifically designed for low-resource languages. Our tool addresses the fundamental bottleneck in OCR development by transforming digital Unicode text corpora into ready-to-use training datasets. The system implements a comprehensive pipeline encompassing text segmentation (character, word, n-gram, sentence, and line levels), Unicode normalization with script purity enforcement, multi-font rendering with configurable distribution, and 25+ data augmentation techniques simulating real-world document degradations including rotation, blur, noise, and scanner artifacts.
  We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by generating a 600,000-sample word-segmented Kashmiri OCR dataset, which we release publicly on HuggingFace. This work provides a practical pathway for bringing low-resource languages into the era of vision-language AI models, and the tool is openly available for researchers and practitioners working with underserved writing systems worldwide.

Abstract: Fine-tuning a task-specific multilingual large language model (LLM) involves training the model on a multilingual dataset with examples in all the required languages. Updating one or more supported languages with additional data or adding support for a new language involves retraining the model, which can be computationally inefficient and creates a severe maintenance bottleneck. Recent research on merging multilingual multitask models has shown promise in terms of improved quality, but its computational and maintenance efficiency remains unstudied. In this work, we provide the first focused analysis of this merging strategy from an efficiency perspective, evaluating it across three independent tasks. We demonstrate significant efficiency gains while maintaining parity in terms of quality: this merging approach reduces the initial training time by up to 50\%. We also demonstrate that updating an individual language and re-merging as part of model maintenance reduces training costs by more than 60\%, compared to re-training the full multilingual model. We show this on both public and proprietary industry datasets confirming that the approach works well for industrial use cases in addition to academic settings already studied in previous work.

Abstract: The Arabic language has undergone notable transformations over time, including the emergence of new vocabulary, the obsolescence of others, and shifts in word usage. This evolution is evident in the distinction between the classical and modern Arabic eras. Although historians and linguists have partitioned Arabic literature into multiple eras, relatively little research has explored the automatic classification of Arabic texts by time period, particularly beyond the domain of poetry. This paper addresses this gap by employing neural networks and deep learning techniques to automatically classify Arabic texts into distinct eras and periods. The proposed models are evaluated using two datasets derived from two publicly available corpora, covering texts from the pre-Islamic to the modern era. The study examines class setups ranging from binary to 15-class classification and considers both predefined historical eras and custom periodizations. Results range from F1-scores of 0.83 and 0.79 on the binary-era classification task using the OpenITI and APCD datasets, respectively, to 0.20 on the 15-era classification task using OpenITI and 0.18 on the 12-era classification task using APCD.

Abstract: We introduce LLM-in-Sandbox, enabling LLMs to explore within a code sandbox (i.e., a virtual computer), to elicit general intelligence in non-code domains. We first demonstrate that strong LLMs, without additional training, exhibit generalization capabilities to leverage the code sandbox for non-code tasks. For example, LLMs spontaneously access external resources to acquire new knowledge, leverage the file system to handle long contexts, and execute scripts to satisfy formatting requirements. We further show that these agentic capabilities can be enhanced through LLM-in-Sandbox Reinforcement Learning (LLM-in-Sandbox-RL), which uses only non-agentic data to train models for sandbox exploration. Experiments demonstrate that LLM-in-Sandbox, in both training-free and post-trained settings, achieves robust generalization spanning mathematics, physics, chemistry, biomedicine, long-context understanding, and instruction following. Finally, we analyze LLM-in-Sandbox's efficiency from computational and system perspectives, and open-source it as a Python package to facilitate real-world deployment.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The computational burden of attention in long-context language models has motivated two largely independent lines of work: sparse attention mechanisms that reduce complexity by attending to selected tokens, and gated attention variants that improve training sta-bility while mitigating the attention sink phenomenon. We observe that these approaches address complementary weaknesses and propose Gated Sparse Attention (GSA), an architecture that realizes the benefits of both. GSA incorporates a gated lightning indexer with sigmoid activations that produce bounded, interpretable selection scores, an adaptive sparsity controller that modulates the number of attended tokens based on local uncertainty, and dual gating at the value and output stages. We establish theoretical foundations for the approach, including complexity analysis, expressiveness results, and convergence guarantees. In experiments with 1.7B parameter models trained on 400B tokens, GSA matches the efficiency of sparse-only baselines (12-16x speedup at 128K context) while achieving the quality gains associated with gated attention: perplexity improves from 6.03 to 5.70, RULER scores at 128K context nearly double, and attention to the first token, a proxy for attention sinks, drops from 47% to under 4%. Training stability improves markedly, with loss spikes reduced by 98%.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled their integration into clinical decision-making; however, hidden biases against patients across racial, social, economic, and clinical backgrounds persist. In this study, we investigate bias in LLM-based medical AI systems applied to emergency department (ED) triage. We employ 32 patient-level proxy variables, each represented by paired positive and negative qualifiers, and evaluate their effects using both public (MIMIC-IV-ED Demo, MIMIC-IV Demo) and restricted-access credentialed (MIMIC-IV-ED and MIMIC-IV) datasets as appropriate~\cite{mimiciv_ed_demo,mimiciv_ed,mimiciv}. Our results reveal discriminatory behavior mediated through proxy variables in ED triage scenarios, as well as a systematic tendency for LLMs to modify perceived patient severity when specific tokens appear in the input context, regardless of whether they are framed positively or negatively. These findings indicate that AI systems is still imperfectly trained on noisy, sometimes non-causal signals that do not reliably reflect true patient acuity. Consequently, more needs to be done to ensure the safe and responsible deployment of AI technologies in clinical settings.

Abstract: The rapid development of automated scientific survey generation technology has made it increasingly important to establish a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the quality of generated surveys.Nearly all existing evaluation benchmarks rely on flawed selection criteria such as citation counts and structural coherence to select human-written surveys as the ground truth survey datasets, and then use surface-level metrics such as structural quality and reference relevance to evaluate generated surveys.However, these benchmarks have two key issues: (1) the ground truth survey datasets are unreliable because of a lack academic dimension annotations; (2) the evaluation metrics only focus on the surface quality of the survey such as logical coherence. Both issues lead to existing benchmarks cannot assess to evaluate their deep "academic value", such as the core research objectives and the critical analysis of different studies. To address the above problems, we propose DeepSurvey-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate the academic value of generated surveys. Specifically, our benchmark propose a comprehensive academic value evaluation criteria covering three dimensions: informational value, scholarly communication value, and research guidance value. Based on this criteria, we construct a reliable dataset with academic value annotations, and evaluate the deep academic value of the generated surveys. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our benchmark is highly consistent with human performance in assessing the academic value of generated surveys.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are fundamentally constrained by the quadratic computational cost of self-attention and the "Lost in the Middle" phenomenon, where reasoning capabilities degrade as context windows expand. Existing solutions, primarily "Flat RAG" architectures relying on vector databases, treat memory as an unstructured bag of embeddings. This approach fails to capture the hierarchical and temporal structure of long-horizon interactions, leading to "Vector Haze", the retrieval of disjointed facts lacking episodic continuity. We propose Aeon, a Neuro-Symbolic Cognitive Operating System that redefines memory not as a static store, but as a managed OS resource. Aeon structures memory into a Memory Palace (a spatial index implemented via Atlas, a SIMD-accelerated Page-Clustered Vector Index that combines small-world graph navigation with B+ Tree-style disk locality to minimize read amplification) and a Trace (a neuro-symbolic episodic graph). We introduce the Semantic Lookaside Buffer (SLB), a predictive caching mechanism that exploits conversational locality to achieve sub-millisecond retrieval latencies. Benchmarks demonstrate that Aeon achieves < 1ms retrieval latency on conversational workloads while ensuring state consistency via a zero-copy C++/Python bridge, effectively enabling persistent, structured memory for autonomous agents.

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid evolution of large vision-language models (LVLMs) has driven a paradigm shift in multimodal fake news detection (MFND), transforming it from traditional feature-engineering approaches to unified, end-to-end multimodal reasoning frameworks. Early methods primarily relied on shallow fusion techniques to capture correlations between text and images, but they struggled with high-level semantic understanding and complex cross-modal interactions. The emergence of LVLMs has fundamentally changed this landscape by enabling joint modeling of vision and language with powerful representation learning, thereby enhancing the ability to detect misinformation that leverages both textual narratives and visual content. Despite these advances, the field lacks a systematic survey that traces this transition and consolidates recent developments. To address this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of MFND through the lens of LVLMs. We first present a historical perspective, mapping the evolution from conventional multimodal detection pipelines to foundation model-driven paradigms. Next, we establish a structured taxonomy covering model architectures, datasets, and performance benchmarks. Furthermore, we analyze the remaining technical challenges, including interpretability, temporal reasoning, and domain generalization. Finally, we outline future research directions to guide the next stage of this paradigm shift. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey to systematically document and analyze the transformative role of LVLMs in combating multimodal fake news.

Abstract: LLM agents struggle with regulatory audit replay: when asked to reproduce a flagged transaction decision with identical inputs, most deployments fail to return consistent results. This paper introduces the Determinism-Faithfulness Assurance Harness (DFAH), a framework for measuring trajectory determinism and evidence-conditioned faithfulness in tool-using agents deployed in financial services.
  Across 74 configurations (12 models, 4 providers, 8-24 runs each at T=0.0) in non-agentic baseline experiments, 7-20B parameter models achieved 100% determinism, while 120B+ models required 3.7x larger validation samples to achieve equivalent statistical reliability. Agentic tool-use introduces additional variance (see Tables 4-7). Contrary to the assumed reliability-capability trade-off, a positive Pearson correlation emerged (r = 0.45, p < 0.01, n = 51 at T=0.0) between determinism and faithfulness; models producing consistent outputs also tended to be more evidence-aligned.
  Three financial benchmarks are provided (compliance triage, portfolio constraints, DataOps exceptions; 50 cases each) along with an open-source stress-test harness. In these benchmarks and under DFAH evaluation settings, Tier 1 models with schema-first architectures achieved determinism levels consistent with audit replay requirements.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Adding memory to pretrained language models typically requires architectural changes or weight modification. We present Prometheus Mind, which retrofits memory to a frozen Qwen3-4B using 11 modular adapters (530MB, 7% overhead) -- fully reversible by removing the adapters. Building this system required solving four problems: (1) Extraction -- we develop Contrastive Direction Discovery (CDD), which finds semantic directions via minimal pairs without labeled data. (2) Training -- end-to-end optimization collapses; stage-wise training of each adapter on simple proxy tasks succeeds. (3) Injection -- learned encoders fail to generalize; we find that lm_head.weight rows already provide the mapping we need, requiring no training. (4) Hidden state collapse -- transformers make ``wife'' and ``brother'' 0.98+ similar; we train projections to recover distinction (0.98 $\rightarrow$ 0.09). On PrometheusExtract-132 (132 cases), the system achieves 94.4% retrieval on clean inputs (n=54, 95% CI: [84.9%, 98.1%]), degrading to 19.4% on informal inputs with ellipsis, filler words, or implicit subjects (n=36). The primary bottleneck is relation classification (47.3% accuracy), responsible for most extraction errors.

Abstract: The rash development of knowledge graph research has brought big driving force to its application in many areas, including the medicine and healthcare domain. However, we have found that the application of some major information processing techniques on knowledge graph still lags behind. This defect includes the failure to make sufficient use of advanced logic reasoning, advanced artificial intelligence techniques, special-purpose programming languages, modern probabilistic and statistic theories et al. on knowledge graphs development and application. In particular, the multiple knowledge graphs cooperation and competition techniques have not got enough attention from researchers. This paper develops a systematic theory, technique and application of the concept 'knowledge graph network' and its application in medical and healthcare domain. Our research covers its definition, development, reasoning, computing and application under different conditions such as unsharp, uncertain, multi-modal, vectorized, distributed, federated. Almost in each case we provide (real data) examples and experiment results. Finally, a conclusion of innovation is provided.

Abstract: Biomedical research increasingly relies on integrating diverse data modalities, including gene expression profiles, medical images, and clinical metadata. While medical images and clinical metadata are routinely collected in clinical practice, gene expression data presents unique challenges for widespread research use, mainly due to stringent privacy regulations and costly laboratory experiments. To address these limitations, we present GeMM-GAN, a novel Generative Adversarial Network conditioned on histopathology tissue slides and clinical metadata, designed to synthesize realistic gene expression profiles. GeMM-GAN combines a Transformer Encoder for image patches with a final Cross Attention mechanism between patches and text tokens, producing a conditioning vector to guide a generative model in generating biologically coherent gene expression profiles. We evaluate our approach on the TCGA dataset and demonstrate that our framework outperforms standard generative models and generates more realistic and functionally meaningful gene expression profiles, improving by more than 11\% the accuracy on downstream disease type prediction compared to current state-of-the-art generative models. Code will be available at: https://github.com/francescapia/GeMM-GAN

Abstract: The rapid emergence of new entities -- driven by cultural shifts, evolving trends, and personalized user data -- poses a significant challenge for existing Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs). While these models excel at general conversational tasks, their static training knowledge limits their ability to recognize domain-specific terms such as contact names, playlists, or technical jargon. Existing solutions primarily rely on prompting, which suffers from poor scalability: as the entity list grows, prompting encounters context window limitations, increased inference latency, and the "lost-in-the-middle" phenomenon. An alternative approach, Generative Error Correction (GEC), attempts to rewrite transcripts via post-processing but frequently suffers from "over-correction", introducing hallucinations of entities that were never spoken.
  In this work, we introduce LOGIC (Logit-Space Integration for Contextual Biasing), an efficient and robust framework that operates directly in the decoding layer. Unlike prompting, LOGIC decouples context injection from input processing, ensuring constant-time complexity relative to prompt length. Extensive experiments using the Phi-4-MM model across 11 multilingual locales demonstrate that LOGIC achieves an average 9% relative reduction in Entity WER with a negligible 0.30% increase in False Alarm Rate.

Abstract: We propose a novel way to evaluate sycophancy of LLMs in a direct and neutral way, mitigating various forms of uncontrolled bias, noise, or manipulative language, deliberately injected to prompts in prior works. A key novelty in our approach is the use of LLM-as-a-judge, evaluation of sycophancy as a zero-sum game in a bet setting. Under this framework, sycophancy serves one individual (the user) while explicitly incurring cost on another. Comparing four leading models - Gemini 2.5 Pro, ChatGpt 4o, Mistral-Large-Instruct-2411, and Claude Sonnet 3.7 - we find that while all models exhibit sycophantic tendencies in the common setting, in which sycophancy is self-serving to the user and incurs no cost on others, Claude and Mistral exhibit "moral remorse" and over-compensate for their sycophancy in case it explicitly harms a third party. Additionally, we observed that all models are biased toward the answer proposed last. Crucially, we find that these two phenomena are not independent; sycophancy and recency bias interact to produce `constructive interference' effect, where the tendency to agree with the user is exacerbated when the user's opinion is presented last.

Abstract: The unification of neural and symbolic approaches to artificial intelligence remains a central open challenge. In this work, we introduce a tensor network formalism, which captures sparsity principles originating in the different approaches in tensor decompositions. In particular, we describe a basis encoding scheme for functions and model neural decompositions as tensor decompositions. The proposed formalism can be applied to represent logical formulas and probability distributions as structured tensor decompositions. This unified treatment identifies tensor network contractions as a fundamental inference class and formulates efficiently scaling reasoning algorithms, originating from probability theory and propositional logic, as contraction message passing schemes. The framework enables the definition and training of hybrid logical and probabilistic models, which we call Hybrid Logic Network. The theoretical concepts are accompanied by the python library tnreason, which enables the implementation and practical use of the proposed architectures.

Abstract: This paper examines how to make large language models reliable for high-stakes legal work by reducing hallucinations. It distinguishes three AI paradigms: (1) standalone generative models ("creative oracle"), (2) basic retrieval-augmented systems ("expert archivist"), and (3) an advanced, end-to-end optimized RAG system ("rigorous archivist"). The authors introduce two reliability metrics -False Citation Rate (FCR) and Fabricated Fact Rate (FFR)- and evaluate 2,700 judicial-style answers from 12 LLMs across 75 legal tasks using expert, double-blind review. Results show that standalone models are unsuitable for professional use (FCR above 30%), while basic RAG greatly reduces errors but still leaves notable misgrounding. Advanced RAG, using techniques such as embedding fine-tuning, re-ranking, and self-correction, reduces fabrication to negligible levels (below 0.2%). The study concludes that trustworthy legal AI requires rigor-focused, retrieval-based architectures emphasizing verification and traceability, and provides an evaluation framework applicable to other high-risk domains.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) toward multimodal, high-stakes enterprise applications has outpaced the development of domain specific evaluation benchmarks. Existing datasets often rely on general-domain corpora or purely textual retrieval, failing to capture the complexity of specialized technical documents where information is inextricably multimodal and reasoning requires synthesizing disjoint evidence. We address this gap by introducing MiRAGE, a Multiagent framework for RAG systems Evaluation, that leverages a collaborative swarm of specialized agents to generate verified, domain-specific, multimodal, and multi-hop Question-Answer datasets. MiRAGE orchestrates a swarm of specialized agents: a recursive context optimization loop to aggregate scattered evidence, an adversarial verifier agent to guarantee factual grounding, and an agent to recognize the expert persona and the relevant domain to mimic expert cognitive workflows. Extensive empirical evaluation across four distinct domains (regulations, finance, quantitative biology, and journalism) demonstrates that MiRAGE generates datasets with significantly higher reasoning complexity (>2.3 average hops) and factual faithfulness. Our ablation studies point that MiRAGE can be powered by LLMs if textual descriptions of the images are available. Visual grounding still remains a frontier. By automating the creation of gold standard evaluation datasets that reflect the latent thematic structure of proprietary corpora, MiRAGE provides the necessary infrastructure to rigorously benchmark the next generation information retrieval systems.

Abstract: A common solution for mitigating outdated or incorrect information in Large Language Models (LLMs) is to provide updated facts in-context or through knowledge editing. However, these methods introduce knowledge conflicts when the knowledge update fails to overwrite the model's parametric knowledge, which propagate to faulty reasoning. Current benchmarks for this problem, however, largely focus only on single knowledge updates and fact recall without evaluating how these updates affect downstream reasoning. In this work, we introduce TRACK (Testing Reasoning Amid Conflicting Knowledge), a new benchmark for studying how LLMs propagate new knowledge through multi-step reasoning when it conflicts with the model's initial parametric knowledge. Spanning three reasoning-intensive scenarios (WIKI, CODE, and MATH), TRACK introduces multiple, realistic conflicts to mirror real-world complexity. Our results on TRACK reveal that providing updated facts to models for reasoning can worsen performance compared to providing no updated facts to a model, and that this performance degradation exacerbates as more updated facts are provided. We show this failure stems from both inability to faithfully integrate updated facts, but also flawed reasoning even when knowledge is integrated. TRACK provides a rigorous new benchmark to measure and guide future progress on propagating conflicting knowledge in multi-step reasoning.

However, this transformer led accuracy improvement in Applied AI Analytics specifically in sentiment analytics comes with the dark side. It is observed during experiments that a lot of these improvements in transformer led accuracy of one class of sentiment has been at the cost of polarization of another class of sentiment and the failing of neutrality. This lack of neutrality poses an acute problem in the Applied NLP space, which relies heavily on the computational outputs of sentiment analytics for reliable industry ready tasks.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of traffic crash severity is critical for improving emergency response and public safety planning. Although recent large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, their single-agent architectures often struggle with heterogeneous, domain-specific crash data and tend to generate biased or unstable predictions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes TransportAgents, a hybrid multi-agent framework that integrates category-specific LLM reasoning with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) integration module. Each specialized agent focuses on a particular subset of traffic information, such as demographics, environmental context, or incident details, to produce intermediate severity assessments that are subsequently fused into a unified prediction. Extensive experiments on two complementary U.S. datasets, the Consumer Product Safety Risk Management System (CPSRMS) and the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), demonstrate that TransportAgents consistently outperforms both traditional machine learning and advanced LLM-based baselines. Across three representative backbones, including closed-source models such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o, as well as open-source models such as LLaMA-3.3, the framework exhibits strong robustness, scalability, and cross-dataset generalizability. A supplementary distributional analysis further shows that TransportAgents produces more balanced and well-calibrated severity predictions than standard single-agent LLM approaches, highlighting its interpretability and reliability for safety-critical decision support applications.

Abstract: A world model is an AI system that simulates how an environment evolves under actions, enabling planning through imagined futures rather than reactive perception. Current world models, however, suffer from visual conflation: the mistaken assumption that high-fidelity video generation implies an understanding of physical and causal dynamics. We show that while modern models excel at predicting pixels, they frequently violate invariant constraints, fail under intervention, and break down in safety-critical decision-making. This survey argues that visual realism is an unreliable proxy for world understanding. Instead, effective world models must encode causal structure, respect domain-specific constraints, and remain stable over long horizons. We propose a reframing of world models as actionable simulators rather than visual engines, emphasizing structured 4D interfaces, constraint-aware dynamics, and closed-loop evaluation. Using medical decision-making as an epistemic stress test, where trial-and-error is impossible and errors are irreversible, we demonstrate that a world model's value is determined not by how realistic its rollouts appear, but by its ability to support counterfactual reasoning, intervention planning, and robust long-horizon foresight.

Abstract: Personalized learning systems have emerged as a promising approach to enhance student outcomes by tailoring educational content, pacing, and feedback to individual needs. However, most existing systems remain fragmented, specializing in either knowledge tracing, diagnostic modeling, or resource recommendation, but rarely integrating these components into a cohesive adaptive cycle. In this paper, we propose ALIGNAgent (Adaptive Learner Intelligence for Gap Identification and Next-step guidance), a multi-agent educational framework designed to deliver personalized learning through integrated knowledge estimation, skill-gap identification, and targeted resource recommendation.ALIGNAgent begins by processing student quiz performance, gradebook data, and learner preferences to generate topic-level proficiency estimates using a Skill Gap Agent that employs concept-level diagnostic reasoning to identify specific misconceptions and knowledge deficiencies. After identifying skill gaps, the Recommender Agent retrieves preference-aware learning materials aligned with diagnosed deficiencies, implementing a continuous feedback loop where interventions occur before advancing to subsequent topics. Extensive empirical evaluation on authentic datasets from two undergraduate computer science courses demonstrates ALIGNAgent's effectiveness, with GPT-4o-based agents achieving precision of 0.87-0.90 and F1 scores of 0.84-0.87 in knowledge proficiency estimation validated against actual exam performance.

Abstract: Current business environments require organizations to continuously reconfigure cross-functional processes, yet enterprise systems are still organized around siloed departments, rigid workflows, and hard-coded automation. Meanwhile large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting natural language and unstructured data but lack deterministic, verifiable execution of complex business logic. To address this gap, here we introduce AUTOBUS, an Autonomous Business System that integrates LLM-based AI agents, predicate-logic programming, and business-semantics-centric enterprise data into a coherent neuro-symbolic AI architecture for orchestrating end-to-end business initiatives. AUTOBUS models an initiative as a network of tasks with explicit pre/post conditions, required data, evaluation rules, and API-level actions. Enterprise data is organized as a knowledge graph whose entities, relationships, and constraints are translated into logic facts and foundational rules, providing the semantic grounding for task reasoning. Core AI agents synthesize task instructions, enterprise semantics, and available tools into task-specific logic programs, which are executed by a logic engine that enforces constraints, coordinates auxiliary tools, and orchestrate execution of actions and outcomes. Humans define and maintain the semantics, policies and task instructions, curate tools, and supervise high-impact or ambiguous decisions, ensuring accountability and adaptability. We detail the AUTOBUS architecture, the anatomy of the AI agent generated logic programs, and the role of humans and auxiliary tools in the lifecycle of a business initiative.

Abstract: Whether Large Language Models (LLMs) truly possess human-like Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities has garnered increasing attention. However, existing benchmarks remain largely restricted to narrow paradigms like false belief tasks, failing to capture the full spectrum of human cognitive mechanisms. We introduce CogToM, a comprehensive, theoretically grounded benchmark comprising over 8000 bilingual instances across 46 paradigms, validated by 49 human annotator.A systematic evaluation of 22 representative models, including frontier models like GPT-5.1 and Qwen3-Max, reveals significant performance heterogeneities and highlights persistent bottlenecks in specific dimensions. Further analysis based on human cognitive patterns suggests potential divergences between LLM and human cognitive structures. CogToM offers a robust instrument and perspective for investigating the evolving cognitive boundaries of LLMs.

Abstract: Healthcare organizations are beginning to embed agentic AI into routine workflows, including clinical documentation support and early-warning monitoring. As these capabilities diffuse across departments and vendors, health systems face agent sprawl, causing duplicated agents, unclear accountability, inconsistent controls, and tool permissions that persist beyond the original use case. Existing AI governance frameworks emphasize lifecycle risk management but provide limited guidance for the day-to-day operations of agent fleets. We propose a Unified Agent Lifecycle Management (UALM) blueprint derived from a rapid, practice-oriented synthesis of governance standards, agent security literature, and healthcare compliance requirements. UALM maps recurring gaps onto five control-plane layers: (1) an identity and persona registry, (2) orchestration and cross-domain mediation, (3) PHI-bounded context and memory, (4) runtime policy enforcement with kill-switch triggers, and (5) lifecycle management and decommissioning linked to credential revocation and audit logging. A companion maturity model supports staged adoption. UALM offers healthcare CIOs, CISOs, and clinical leaders an implementable pattern for audit-ready oversight that preserves local innovation and enables safer scaling across clinical and administrative domains.

Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) -- generations that are plausible but factually unfaithful -- remain a critical barrier to high-stakes deployment. Current detection methods typically rely on computationally expensive external retrieval loops or opaque black-box LLM judges requiring 70B+ parameters. In this work, we introduce [Model Name], a hybrid detection framework that combines neuroscience-inspired signal design with supervised machine learning. We extract interpretable signals grounded in Predictive Coding (quantifying surprise against internal priors) and the Information Bottleneck (measuring signal retention under perturbation). Through systematic ablation, we demonstrate three key enhancements: Entity-Focused Uptake (concentrating on high-value tokens), Context Adherence (measuring grounding strength), and Falsifiability Score (detecting confident but contradictory claims).
  Evaluating on HaluBench (n=200, perfectly balanced), our theory-guided baseline achieves 0.8017 AUROC. BASE supervised models reach 0.8274 AUROC, while IMPROVED features boost performance to 0.8669 AUROC (4.95% gain), demonstrating consistent improvements across architectures. This competitive performance is achieved while using 75x less training data than Lynx (200 vs 15,000 samples), 1000x faster inference (5ms vs 5s), and remaining fully interpretable. Crucially, we report a negative result: the Rationalization signal fails to distinguish hallucinations, suggesting that LLMs generate coherent reasoning for false premises ("Sycophancy").
  This work demonstrates that domain knowledge encoded in signal architecture provides superior data efficiency compared to scaling LLM judges, achieving strong performance with lightweight (less than 1M parameter), explainable models suitable for production deployment.

Abstract: The rapid rise of autonomous AI systems and advancements in agent capabilities are introducing new risks due to reduced oversight of real-world interactions. Yet agent testing remains nascent and is still a developing science. As AI agents begin to be deployed globally, it is important that they handle different languages and cultures accurately and securely.
  To address this, participants from The International Network for Advanced AI Measurement, Evaluation and Science, including representatives from Singapore, Japan, Australia, Canada, the European Commission, France, Kenya, South Korea, and the United Kingdom have come together to align approaches to agentic evaluations.
  This is the third exercise, building on insights from two earlier joint testing exercises conducted by the Network in November 2024 and February 2025. The objective is to further refine best practices for testing advanced AI systems.
  The exercise was split into two strands: (1) common risks, including leakage of sensitive information and fraud, led by Singapore AISI; and (2) cybersecurity, led by UK AISI. A mix of open and closed-weight models were evaluated against tasks from various public agentic benchmarks. Given the nascency of agentic testing, our primary focus was on understanding methodological issues in conducting such tests, rather than examining test results or model capabilities. This collaboration marks an important step forward as participants work together to advance the science of agentic evaluations.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) show remarkable capabilities, their unreliability remains a critical barrier to deployment in high-stakes domains. This survey charts a functional evolution in addressing this challenge: the evolution of uncertainty from a passive diagnostic metric to an active control signal guiding real-time model behavior. We demonstrate how uncertainty is leveraged as an active control signal across three frontiers: in \textbf{advanced reasoning} to optimize computation and trigger self-correction; in \textbf{autonomous agents} to govern metacognitive decisions about tool use and information seeking; and in \textbf{reinforcement learning} to mitigate reward hacking and enable self-improvement via intrinsic rewards. By grounding these advancements in emerging theoretical frameworks like Bayesian methods and Conformal Prediction, we provide a unified perspective on this transformative trend. This survey provides a comprehensive overview, critical analysis, and practical design patterns, arguing that mastering the new trend of uncertainty is essential for building the next generation of scalable, reliable, and trustworthy AI.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Although AI agents have demonstrated impressive capabilities in long-horizon reasoning, their reliability is severely hampered by the ``Spiral of Hallucination,'' where early epistemic errors propagate irreversibly. Existing methods face a dilemma: uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods typically act as passive sensors, only diagnosing risks without addressing them, while self-reflection mechanisms suffer from continuous or aimless corrections. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified Dual-Process Agentic UQ (AUQ) framework that transforms verbalized uncertainty into active, bi-directional control signals. Our architecture comprises two complementary mechanisms: System 1 (Uncertainty-Aware Memory, UAM), which implicitly propagates verbalized confidence and semantic explanations to prevent blind decision-making; and System 2 (Uncertainty-Aware Reflection, UAR), which utilizes these explanations as rational cues to trigger targeted inference-time resolution only when necessary. This enables the agent to balance efficient execution and deep deliberation dynamically. Extensive experiments on closed-loop benchmarks and open-ended deep research tasks demonstrate that our training-free approach achieves superior performance and trajectory-level calibration. We believe this principled framework AUQ represents a significant step towards reliable agents.

Abstract: As frontier AI models are deployed globally, it is essential that their behaviour remains safe and reliable across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts. To examine how current model safeguards hold up in such settings, participants from the International Network for Advanced AI Measurement, Evaluation and Science, including representatives from Singapore, Japan, Australia, Canada, the EU, France, Kenya, South Korea and the UK conducted a joint multilingual evaluation exercise. Led by Singapore AISI, two open-weight models were tested across ten languages spanning high and low resourced groups: Cantonese English, Farsi, French, Japanese, Korean, Kiswahili, Malay, Mandarin Chinese and Telugu. Over 6,000 newly translated prompts were evaluated across five harm categories (privacy, non-violent crime, violent crime, intellectual property and jailbreak robustness), using both LLM-as-a-judge and human annotation.
  The exercise shows how safety behaviours can vary across languages. These include differences in safeguard robustness across languages and harm types and variation in evaluator reliability (LLM-as-judge vs. human review). Further, it also generated methodological insights for improving multilingual safety evaluations, such as the need for culturally contextualised translations, stress-tested evaluator prompts and clearer human annotation guidelines. This work represents an initial step toward a shared framework for multilingual safety testing of advanced AI systems and calls for continued collaboration with the wider research community and industry.

Abstract: While Text-to-SQL remains the dominant approach for database interaction, real-world analytics increasingly require the flexibility of general-purpose programming languages such as Python or Pandas to manage file-based data and complex analytical workflows. Despite this growing need, the reliability of Text-to-Python in core data retrieval remains underexplored relative to the mature SQL ecosystem. To address this gap, we introduce BIRD-Python, a benchmark designed for cross-paradigm evaluation. We systematically refined the original dataset to reduce annotation noise and align execution semantics, thereby establishing a consistent and standardized baseline for comparison. Our analysis reveals a fundamental paradigmatic divergence: whereas SQL leverages implicit DBMS behaviors through its declarative structure, Python requires explicit procedural logic, making it highly sensitive to underspecified user intent. To mitigate this challenge, we propose the Logic Completion Framework (LCF), which resolves ambiguity by incorporating latent domain knowledge into the generation process. Experimental results show that (1) performance differences primarily stem from missing domain context rather than inherent limitations in code generation, and (2) when these gaps are addressed, Text-to-Python achieves performance parity with Text-to-SQL. These findings establish Python as a viable foundation for analytical agents-provided that systems effectively ground ambiguous natural language inputs in executable logical specifications.

Abstract: The combination of verifiable languages and LLMs has significantly influenced both the mathematical and computer science communities because it provides a rigorous foundation for theorem proving. Recent advancements in the field provide foundation models and sophisticated agentic systems pushing the boundaries of formal mathematical reasoning to approach the natural language capability of LLMs. However, little attention has been given to the formal physics reasoning, which also heavily relies on similar problem-solving and theorem-proving frameworks. To solve this problem, this paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first approach to enhance formal theorem proving in the physics domain. We compose a dedicated dataset PhysLeanData for the task. It is composed of theorems sampled from PhysLean and data generated by a conjecture-based formal data generation pipeline. In the training pipeline, we leverage DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B, a strong open-source mathematical theorem prover, and apply Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to train our model PhysProver. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that, using only $\sim$5K training samples, PhysProver achieves an overall 2.4\% improvement in multiple sub-domains. Furthermore, after formal physics training, we observe 1.3\% gains on the MiniF2F-Test benchmark, which indicates non-trivial generalization beyond physics domains and enhancement for formal math capability as well. The results highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, which provides a paradigm for extending formal provers outside mathematical domains. To foster further research, we will release both our dataset and model to the community.

Abstract: Tabular data is a fundamental form of data structure. The evolution of table analysis tools reflects humanity's continuous progress in data acquisition, management, and processing. The dynamic changes in table columns arise from technological advancements, changing needs, data integration, etc. However, the standard process of training AI models on tables with fixed columns and then performing inference is not suitable for handling dynamically changed tables. Therefore, new methods are needed for efficiently handling such tables in an unsupervised manner. In this paper, we introduce a new task, Tabular Incremental Inference (TabII), which aims to enable trained models to incorporate new columns during the inference stage, enhancing the practicality of AI models in scenarios where tables are dynamically changed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this new task can be framed as an optimization problem based on the information bottleneck theory, which emphasizes that the key to an ideal tabular incremental inference approach lies in minimizing mutual information between tabular data and representation while maximizing between representation and task labels. Under this guidance, we design a TabII method with Large Language Model placeholders and Pretrained TabAdapter to provide external knowledge and Incremental Sample Condensation blocks to condense the task-relevant information given by incremental column attributes. Experimental results across eight public datasets show that TabII effectively utilizes incremental attributes, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning in the real world remains challenging due to sample inefficiency, sparse rewards, and noisy visual observations. Prior work leverages demonstrations and human feedback to improve learning efficiency and robustness. However, offline-to-online methods need large datasets and can be unstable, while VLA-assisted RL relies on large-scale pretraining and fine-tuning. As a result, a low-cost real-world RL method with minimal data requirements has yet to emerge. We introduce \textbf{SigEnt-SAC}, an off-policy actor-critic method that learns from scratch using a single expert trajectory. Our key design is a sigmoid-bounded entropy term that prevents negative-entropy-driven optimization toward out-of-distribution actions and reduces Q-function oscillations. We benchmark SigEnt-SAC on D4RL tasks against representative baselines. Experiments show that SigEnt-SAC substantially alleviates Q-function oscillations and reaches a 100\% success rate faster than prior methods. Finally, we validate SigEnt-SAC on four real-world robotic tasks across multiple embodiments, where agents learn from raw images and sparse rewards; results demonstrate that SigEnt-SAC can learn successful policies with only a small number of real-world interactions, suggesting a low-cost and practical pathway for real-world RL deployment.

Abstract: AI agents are rapidly advancing from passive language models to autonomous systems executing complex, multi-step tasks. Yet their overconfidence in failure remains a fundamental barrier to deployment in high-stakes settings. Existing calibration methods, built for static single-turn outputs, cannot address the unique challenges of agentic systems, such as compounding errors along trajectories, uncertainty from external tools, and opaque failure modes. To address these challenges, we introduce, for the first time, the problem of Agentic Confidence Calibration and propose Holistic Trajectory Calibration (HTC), a novel diagnostic framework that extracts rich process-level features ranging from macro dynamics to micro stability across an agent's entire trajectory. Powered by a simple, interpretable model, HTC consistently surpasses strong baselines in both calibration and discrimination, across eight benchmarks, multiple LLMs, and diverse agent frameworks. Beyond performance, HTC delivers three essential advances: it provides interpretability by revealing the signals behind failure, enables transferability by applying across domains without retraining, and achieves generalization through a General Agent Calibrator (GAC) that achieves the best calibration (lowest ECE) on the out-of-domain GAIA benchmark. Together, these contributions establish a new process-centric paradigm for confidence calibration, providing a framework for diagnosing and enhancing the reliability of AI agents.

Abstract: Many theorists of creativity maintain that intentional agency is a necessary condition of creativity. We argue that this requirement, which we call the Intentional Agency Condition (IAC), should be rejected as a general condition of creativity, while retaining its relevance in specific contexts. We show that recent advances in generative AI have rendered the IAC increasingly problematic, both descriptively and functionally. We offer two reasons for abandoning it at the general level. First, we present corpus evidence indicating that authors and journalists are increasingly comfortable ascribing creativity to generative AI, despite its lack of intentional agency. This development places pressure on the linguistic intuitions that have traditionally been taken to support the IAC. Second, drawing on the method of conceptual engineering, we argue that the IAC no longer fulfils its core social function. Rather than facilitating the identification and encouragement of reliable sources of novel and valuable products, it now feeds into biases that distort our assessments of AI-generated outputs. We therefore propose replacing the IAC with a consistency requirement, according to which creativity tracks the reliable generation of novel and valuable products. Nonetheless, we explain why the IAC should be retained in specific local domains.

Abstract: Chronic diseases have become the leading cause of death worldwide, a challenge intensified by strained medical resources and an aging population. Individually, patients often struggle to interpret early signs of deterioration or maintain adherence to care plans. In this paper, we introduce VitalDiagnosis, an LLM-driven ecosystem designed to shift chronic disease management from passive monitoring to proactive, interactive engagement. By integrating continuous data from wearable devices with the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, the system addresses both acute health anomalies and routine adherence. It analyzes triggers through context-aware inquiries, produces provisional insights within a collaborative patient-clinician workflow, and offers personalized guidance. This approach aims to promote a more proactive and cooperative care paradigm, with the potential to enhance patient self-management and reduce avoidable clinical workload.

Abstract: Recent advances in Deep Research Agents (DRAs) are transforming automated knowledge discovery and problem-solving. While the majority of existing efforts focus on enhancing policy capabilities via post-training, we propose an alternative paradigm: self-evolving the agent's ability by iteratively verifying the policy model's outputs, guided by meticulously crafted rubrics. This approach gives rise to the inference-time scaling of verification, wherein an agent self-improves by evaluating its generated answers to produce iterative feedback and refinements. We derive the rubrics based on an automatically constructed DRA Failure Taxonomy, which systematically classifies agent failures into five major categories and thirteen sub-categories. We present DeepVerifier, a rubrics-based outcome reward verifier that leverages the asymmetry of verification and outperforms vanilla agent-as-judge and LLM judge baselines by 12%-48% in meta-evaluation F1 score. To enable practical self-evolution, DeepVerifier integrates as a plug-and-play module during test-time inference. The verifier produces detailed rubric-based feedback, which is fed back to the agent for iterative bootstrapping, refining responses without additional training. This test-time scaling delivers 8%-11% accuracy gains on challenging subsets of GAIA and XBench-DeepResearch when powered by capable closed-source LLMs. Finally, to support open-source advancement, we release DeepVerifier-4K, a curated supervised fine-tuning dataset of 4,646 high-quality agent steps focused on DRA verification. These examples emphasize reflection and self-critique, enabling open models to develop robust verification capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) benchmarks tell us when models fail, but not why they fail. A wrong answer on a reasoning dataset may stem from formatting issues, calculation errors, or dataset noise rather than weak reasoning. Without disentangling such causes, benchmarks remain incomplete and cannot reliably guide model improvement. We introduce ErrorMap, the first method to chart the sources of LLM failure. It extracts a model's unique "failure signature", clarifies what benchmarks measure, and broadens error identification to reduce blind spots. This helps developers debug models, aligns benchmark goals with outcomes, and supports informed model selection. ErrorMap works on any model or dataset with the same logic. Applying our method to 35 datasets and 83 models we generate ErrorAtlas, a taxonomy of model errors, revealing recurring failure patterns. ErrorAtlas highlights error types that are currently underexplored in LLM research, such as omissions of required details in the output and question misinterpretation. By shifting focus from where models succeed to why they fail, ErrorMap and ErrorAtlas enable advanced evaluation - one that exposes hidden weaknesses and directs progress. Unlike success, typically measured by task-level metrics, our approach introduces a deeper evaluation layer that can be applied globally across models and tasks, offering richer insights into model behavior and limitations. We make the taxonomy and code publicly available with plans to periodically update ErrorAtlas as new benchmarks and models emerge.

Abstract: The development of native computer-use agents (CUA) represents a significant leap in multimodal AI. However, their potential is currently bottlenecked by the constraints of static data scaling. Existing paradigms relying primarily on passive imitation of static datasets struggle to capture the intricate causal dynamics inherent in long-horizon computer tasks. In this work, we introduce EvoCUA, a native computer use agentic model. Unlike static imitation, EvoCUA integrates data generation and policy optimization into a self-sustaining evolutionary cycle. To mitigate data scarcity, we develop a verifiable synthesis engine that autonomously generates diverse tasks coupled with executable validators. To enable large-scale experience acquisition, we design a scalable infrastructure orchestrating tens of thousands of asynchronous sandbox rollouts. Building on these massive trajectories, we propose an iterative evolving learning strategy to efficiently internalize this experience. This mechanism dynamically regulates policy updates by identifying capability boundaries -- reinforcing successful routines while transforming failure trajectories into rich supervision through error analysis and self-correction. Empirical evaluations on the OSWorld benchmark demonstrate that EvoCUA achieves a success rate of 56.7%, establishing a new open-source state-of-the-art. Notably, EvoCUA significantly outperforms the previous best open-source model, OpenCUA-72B (45.0%), and surpasses leading closed-weights models such as UI-TARS-2 (53.1%). Crucially, our results underscore the generalizability of this approach: the evolving paradigm driven by learning from experience yields consistent performance gains across foundation models of varying scales, establishing a robust and scalable path for advancing native agent capabilities.

Abstract: Text-Based Person Search (TBPS) holds unique value in real-world surveillance bridging visual perception and language understanding, yet current paradigms utilizing pre-training models often fail to transfer effectively to complex open-world scenarios. The reliance on "Passive Observation" leads to multifaceted spurious correlations and spatial semantic misalignment, causing a lack of robustness against distribution shifts. To fundamentally resolve these defects, this paper proposes ICON (Invariant Counterfactual Optimization with Neuro-symbolic priors), a framework integrating causal and topological priors. First, we introduce Rule-Guided Spatial Intervention to strictly penalize sensitivity to bounding box noise, forcibly severing location shortcuts to achieve geometric invariance. Second, Counterfactual Context Disentanglement is implemented via semantic-driven background transplantation, compelling the model to ignore background interference for environmental independence. Then, we employ Saliency-Driven Semantic Regularization with adaptive masking to resolve local saliency bias and guarantee holistic completeness. Finally, Neuro-Symbolic Topological Alignment utilizes neuro-symbolic priors to constrain feature matching, ensuring activated regions are topologically consistent with human structural logic. Experimental results demonstrate that ICON not only maintains leading performance on standard benchmarks but also exhibits exceptional robustness against occlusion, background interference, and localization noise. This approach effectively advances the field by shifting from fitting statistical co-occurrences to learning causal invariance.

Abstract: Planetary surfaces are typically analyzed using high-level semantic concepts in natural language, yet vast orbital image archives remain organized at the pixel level. This mismatch limits scalable, open-ended exploration of planetary surfaces. Here we present MarScope, a planetary-scale vision-language framework enabling natural language-driven, label-free mapping of Martian landforms. MarScope aligns planetary images and text in a shared semantic space, trained on over 200,000 curated image-text pairs. This framework transforms global geomorphic mapping on Mars by replacing pre-defined classifications with flexible semantic retrieval, enabling arbitrary user queries across the entire planet in 5 seconds with F1 scores up to 0.978. Applications further show that it extends beyond morphological classification to facilitate process-oriented analysis and similarity-based geomorphological mapping at a planetary scale. MarScope establishes a new paradigm where natural language serves as a direct interface for scientific discovery over massive geospatial datasets.

Abstract: The Decision Transformer (DT) has established a powerful sequence modeling approach to offline reinforcement learning. It conditions its action predictions on Return-to-Go (RTG), using it both to distinguish trajectory quality during training and to guide action generation at inference. In this work, we identify a critical redundancy in this design: feeding the entire sequence of RTGs into the Transformer is theoretically unnecessary, as only the most recent RTG affects action prediction. We show that this redundancy can impair DT's performance through experiments. To resolve this, we propose the Decoupled DT (DDT). DDT simplifies the architecture by processing only observation and action sequences through the Transformer, using the latest RTG to guide the action prediction. This streamlined approach not only improves performance but also reduces computational cost. Our experiments show that DDT significantly outperforms DT and establishes competitive performance against state-of-the-art DT variants across multiple offline RL tasks.

Abstract: The rise of live streaming has transformed online interaction, enabling massive real-time engagement but also exposing platforms to complex risks such as scams and coordinated malicious behaviors. Detecting these risks is challenging because harmful actions often accumulate gradually and recur across seemingly unrelated streams. To address this, we propose CS-VAR (Cross-Session Evidence-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Detector) for live streaming risk assessment. In CS-VAR, a lightweight, domain-specific model performs fast session-level risk inference, guided during training by a Large Language Model (LLM) that reasons over retrieved cross-session behavioral evidence and transfers its local-to-global insights to the small model. This design enables the small model to recognize recurring patterns across streams, perform structured risk assessment, and maintain efficiency for real-time deployment. Extensive offline experiments on large-scale industrial datasets, combined with online validation, demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of CS-VAR. Furthermore, CS-VAR provides interpretable, localized signals that effectively empower real-world moderation for live streaming.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can aid synthesis planning in chemistry, but standard prompting methods often yield hallucinated or outdated suggestions. We study LLM interactions with a reaction knowledge graph by casting reaction path retrieval as a Text2Cypher (natural language to graph query) generation problem, and define single- and multi-step retrieval tasks. We compare zero-shot prompting to one-shot variants using static, random, and embedding-based exemplar selection, and assess a checklist-driven validator/corrector loop. To evaluate our framework, we consider query validity and retrieval accuracy. We find that one-shot prompting with aligned exemplars consistently performs best. Our checklist-style self-correction loop mainly improves executability in zero-shot settings and offers limited additional retrieval gains once a good exemplar is present. We provide a reproducible Text2Cypher evaluation setup to facilitate further work on KG-grounded LLMs for synthesis planning. Code is available at https://github.com/Intelligent-molecular-systems/KG-LLM-Synthesis-Retrieval.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of crop above-ground biomass (AGB) under water stress is critical for monitoring crop productivity, guiding irrigation, and supporting climate-resilient agriculture. Data-driven models scale well but often lack interpretability and degrade under distribution shift, whereas process-based crop models (e.g. DSSAT, APSIM, LINTUL5) require extensive calibration and are difficult to deploy over large spatial domains. To address these limitations, we propose AgriPINN, a process-informed neural network that integrates a biophysical crop-growth differential equation as a differentiable constraint within a deep learning backbone. This design encourages physiologically consistent biomass dynamics under water-stress conditions while preserving model scalability for spatially distributed AGB prediction. AgriPINN recovers latent physiological variables, including leaf area index (LAI), absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), radiation use efficiency (RUE), and water-stress factors, without requiring direct supervision. We pretrain AgriPINN on 60 years of historical data across 397 regions in Germany and fine-tune it on three years of field experiments under controlled water treatments. Results show that AgriPINN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep-learning baselines (ConvLSTM-ViT, SLTF, CNN-Transformer) and the process-based LINTUL5 model in terms of accuracy (RMSE reductions up to $43\%$) and computational efficiency. By combining the scalability of deep learning with the biophysical rigor of process-based modeling, AgriPINN provides a robust and interpretable framework for spatio-temporal AGB prediction, offering practical value for planning of irrigation infrastructure, yield forecasting, and climate-adaptation planning.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Designing faster algorithms for solving Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problems is highly desired across numerous practical domains, as a vast array of complex real-world challenges can be effectively modeled as MILP formulations. Solving these problems typically employs the branch-and-bound algorithm, the core of which can be conceived as searching for a path of nodes (or sub-problems) that contains the optimal solution to the original MILP problem. Traditional approaches to finding this path rely heavily on hand-crafted, intuition-based heuristic strategies, which often suffer from unstable and unpredictable performance across different MILP problem instances. To address this limitation, we introduce DeepBound, a deep learning-based node selection algorithm that automates the learning of such human intuition from data. The core of DeepBound lies in learning to prioritize nodes containing the optimal solution, thereby improving solving efficiency. DeepBound introduces a multi-level feature fusion network to capture the node representations. To tackle the inherent node imbalance in branch-and-bound trees, DeepBound employs a pairwise training paradigm that enhances the model's ability to discriminate between nodes. Extensive experiments on three NP-hard MILP benchmarks demonstrate that DeepBound achieves superior solving efficiency over conventional heuristic rules and existing learning-based approaches, obtaining optimal feasible solutions with significantly reduced computation time. Moreover, DeepBound demonstrates strong generalization capability on large and complex instances. The analysis of its learned features reveals that the method can automatically discover more flexible and robust feature selection, which may effectively improve and potentially replace human-designed heuristic rules.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents often exhibit abrupt shifts in tone and persona during extended interaction, reflecting the absence of explicit temporal structure governing agent-level state. While prior work emphasizes turn-local sentiment or static emotion classification, the role of explicit affective dynamics in shaping long-horizon agent behavior remains underexplored. This work investigates whether imposing dynamical structure on an external affective state can induce temporal coherence and controlled recovery in multi-turn dialogue. We introduce an agent-level affective subsystem that maintains a continuous Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) state external to the language model and governed by first- and second-order update rules. Instantaneous affective signals are extracted using a fixed, memoryless estimator and integrated over time via exponential smoothing or momentum-based dynamics. The resulting affective state is injected back into generation without modifying model parameters. Using a fixed 25-turn dialogue protocol, we compare stateless, first-order, and second-order affective dynamics. Stateless agents fail to exhibit coherent trajectories or recovery, while state persistence enables delayed responses and reliable recovery. Second-order dynamics introduce affective inertia and hysteresis that increase with momentum, revealing a trade-off between stability and responsiveness.

Abstract: Climate disinformation has become a major challenge in today digital world, especially with the rise of misleading images and videos shared widely on social media. These false claims are often convincing and difficult to detect, which can delay actions on climate change. While vision-language models (VLMs) have been used to identify visual disinformation, they rely only on the knowledge available at the time of training. This limits their ability to reason about recent events or updates. The main goal of this paper is to overcome that limitation by combining VLMs with external knowledge. By retrieving up-to-date information such as reverse image results, online fact-checks, and trusted expert content, the system can better assess whether an image and its claim are accurate, misleading, false, or unverifiable. This approach improves the model ability to handle real-world climate disinformation and supports efforts to protect public understanding of science in a rapidly changing information landscape.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly common in educational applications, there is a growing need for evidence-based methods to design and evaluate LLM prompts that produce personalized and pedagogically aligned out-puts. This study presents a generalizable, systematic approach for evaluating prompts, demonstrated through an analysis of LLM-generated follow-up questions in a structured dialogue activity. Six prompt templates were designed and tested. The templates incorporated established prompt engineering patterns, with each prompt emphasizing distinct pedagogical strategies. The prompt templates were compared through a tournament-style evaluation framework that can be adapted for other educational applications. The tournament employed the Glicko2 rating system with eight judges evaluating question pairs across three dimensions: format, dialogue support, and appropriateness for learners. Data was sourced from 120 authentic user interactions across three distinct educational deployments. Results showed that a single prompt related to strategic reading out-performed other templates with win probabilities ranging from 81% to 100% in pairwise comparisons. This prompt combined persona and context manager pat-terns and was designed to support metacognitive learning strategies such as self-directed learning. The methodology showcases how educational technology re- searchers can systematically evaluate and improve prompt designs, moving beyond ad-hoc prompt engineering toward evidence-based prompt development for educational applications.

Abstract: State-of-the-art neural theorem provers like DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5 combine large language models with reinforcement learning, achieving impressive results through sophisticated training. We ask: do these highly-trained models still benefit from simple structural guidance at inference time? We evaluate a lightweight intervention -- a fixed prompt schedule over 15 common tactic skeletons -- on the miniF2F benchmark. This simple approach yields 21.7% pass@16 compared to 15.2% for standard sampling from the same model, a 43% relative improvement using the same number of samples (k=16) and same maximum generation length (1024 tokens). Our results suggest that even capable RL-trained provers underutilize structural priors available in the tactic language, and that simple inference-time guidance remains a cheap, complementary boost.

Abstract: This thesis explores the use of a General Game System (GGS) to support the automatic expansion of game boards in boardless games. Traditional implementations of such games often rely on oversized static boards defined from the start, even though large portions of these boards may never be used during gameplay. This approach leads to unnecessary complexity. To address this issue, this thesis propose a dynamic board expansion mechanism in which the game board grows automatically during play.
