### [1] [Geometry-aware 4D Video Generation for Robot Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01099)
*Zeyi Liu,Shuang Li,Eric Cousineau,Siyuan Feng,Benjamin Burchfiel,Shuran Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种4D视频生成模型，通过跨视角点图对齐监督，实现多视角3D一致性，提升视频的时空连贯性和几何一致性。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强机器人在复杂环境中规划和交互的能力，解决现有视频生成模型在多视角几何一致性上的不足。

Method: 利用RGB-D观测数据，通过跨视角点图对齐监督训练模型，学习共享的3D场景表示，无需相机姿态输入。

Result: 在模拟和真实机器人数据集上，生成的视频在视觉稳定性和空间对齐性上优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 该方法支持从新视角预测未来视频序列，并可用于机器人末端执行器轨迹恢复，提升机器人操作的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Understanding and predicting the dynamics of the physical world can enhance a
robot's ability to plan and interact effectively in complex environments. While
recent video generation models have shown strong potential in modeling dynamic
scenes, generating videos that are both temporally coherent and geometrically
consistent across camera views remains a significant challenge. To address
this, we propose a 4D video generation model that enforces multi-view 3D
consistency of videos by supervising the model with cross-view pointmap
alignment during training. This geometric supervision enables the model to
learn a shared 3D representation of the scene, allowing it to predict future
video sequences from novel viewpoints based solely on the given RGB-D
observations, without requiring camera poses as inputs. Compared to existing
baselines, our method produces more visually stable and spatially aligned
predictions across multiple simulated and real-world robotic datasets. We
further show that the predicted 4D videos can be used to recover robot
end-effector trajectories using an off-the-shelf 6DoF pose tracker, supporting
robust robot manipulation and generalization to novel camera viewpoints.

Abstract: Landslides pose severe threats to infrastructure, economies, and human lives,
necessitating accurate detection and predictive mapping across diverse
geographic regions. With advancements in deep learning and remote sensing,
automated landslide detection has become increasingly effective. This study
presents a comprehensive approach integrating multi-source satellite imagery
and deep learning models to enhance landslide identification and prediction. We
leverage Sentinel-2 multispectral data and ALOS PALSAR-derived slope and
Digital Elevation Model (DEM) layers to capture critical environmental features
influencing landslide occurrences. Various geospatial analysis techniques are
employed to assess the impact of terra in characteristics, vegetation cover,
and rainfall on detection accuracy. Additionally, we evaluate the performance
of multiple stateof-the-art deep learning segmentation models, including U-Net,
DeepLabV3+, and Res-Net, to determine their effectiveness in landslide
detection. The proposed framework contributes to the development of reliable
early warning systems, improved disaster risk management, and sustainable
land-use planning. Our findings provide valuable insights into the potential of
deep learning and multi-source remote sensing in creating robust, scalable, and
transferable landslide prediction models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: cp_measure是一个Python库，提取CellProfiler的核心测量功能，支持模块化和API优先的特征提取，便于机器学习和自动化分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生物图像分析工具如CellProfiler在自动化、可重复性和机器学习集成方面存在障碍。

Method: 开发cp_measure库，提取CellProfiler的核心功能，提供模块化和API优先的设计。

Result: cp_measure特征与CellProfiler保持高一致性，并能无缝集成到Python生态系统中。

Conclusion: cp_measure支持可重复、自动化的图像分析流程，适用于计算生物学中的机器学习应用。

Abstract: Biological image analysis has traditionally focused on measuring specific
visual properties of interest for cells or other entities. A complementary
paradigm gaining increasing traction is image-based profiling - quantifying
many distinct visual features to form comprehensive profiles which may reveal
hidden patterns in cellular states, drug responses, and disease mechanisms.
While current tools like CellProfiler can generate these feature sets, they
pose significant barriers to automated and reproducible analyses, hindering
machine learning workflows. Here we introduce cp_measure, a Python library that
extracts CellProfiler's core measurement capabilities into a modular, API-first
tool designed for programmatic feature extraction. We demonstrate that
cp_measure features retain high fidelity with CellProfiler features while
enabling seamless integration with the scientific Python ecosystem. Through
applications to 3D astrocyte imaging and spatial transcriptomics, we showcase
how cp_measure enables reproducible, automated image-based profiling pipelines
that scale effectively for machine learning applications in computational
biology.

### [4] [Rapid Salient Object Detection with Difference Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01182)
*Zhuo Su,Li Liu,Matthias Müller,Jiehua Zhang,Diana Wofk,Ming-Ming Cheng,Matti Pietikäinen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种高效的显著性目标检测（SOD）网络设计，结合传统方法与现代CNN，通过像素差异卷积（PDC）和差异卷积重参数化（DCR）提升效率，并在资源受限设备上实现实时性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有显著性目标检测模型在资源受限设备上计算成本高的问题，实现实时性能。

Method: 提出结合传统SOD方法和CNN的PDC技术，引入DCR策略减少计算量，并扩展至视频SOD的STDC方法。

Result: 模型SDNet和STDNet在Jetson Orin设备上分别达到46 FPS和150 FPS，速度和精度均优于其他轻量级模型。

Conclusion: 该方法在效率和精度之间取得了显著平衡，适用于资源受限设备的实时SOD任务。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of deploying salient object detection
(SOD) on resource-constrained devices with real-time performance. While recent
advances in deep neural networks have improved SOD, existing top-leading models
are computationally expensive. We propose an efficient network design that
combines traditional wisdom on SOD and the representation power of modern CNNs.
Like biologically-inspired classical SOD methods relying on computing contrast
cues to determine saliency of image regions, our model leverages Pixel
Difference Convolutions (PDCs) to encode the feature contrasts. Differently,
PDCs are incorporated in a CNN architecture so that the valuable contrast cues
are extracted from rich feature maps. For efficiency, we introduce a difference
convolution reparameterization (DCR) strategy that embeds PDCs into standard
convolutions, eliminating computation and parameters at inference.
Additionally, we introduce SpatioTemporal Difference Convolution (STDC) for
video SOD, enhancing the standard 3D convolution with spatiotemporal contrast
capture. Our models, SDNet for image SOD and STDNet for video SOD, achieve
significant improvements in efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. On a Jetson Orin
device, our models with $<$ 1M parameters operate at 46 FPS and 150 FPS on
streamed images and videos, surpassing the second-best lightweight models in
our experiments by more than $2\times$ and $3\times$ in speed with superior
accuracy. Code will be available at https://github.com/hellozhuo/stdnet.git.

### [5] [Robust Brain Tumor Segmentation with Incomplete MRI Modalities Using Hölder Divergence and Mutual Information-Enhanced Knowledge Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01254)
*Runze Cheng,Xihang Qiu,Ming Li,Ye Zhang,Chun Li,Fei Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于单模态并行处理的框架，通过Holder散度和互信息处理缺失模态问题，实现高精度脑肿瘤分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态MRI在脑肿瘤分割中至关重要，但传统方法在部分模态缺失时表现不佳。

Method: 利用Holder散度和互信息设计损失函数，动态调整网络参数以适应输入模态。

Result: 在BraTS 2018和2020数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效处理模态缺失问题，提升分割准确性。

Abstract: Multimodal MRI provides critical complementary information for accurate brain
tumor segmentation. However, conventional methods struggle when certain
modalities are missing due to issues such as image quality, protocol
inconsistencies, patient allergies, or financial constraints. To address this,
we propose a robust single-modality parallel processing framework that achieves
high segmentation accuracy even with incomplete modalities. Leveraging Holder
divergence and mutual information, our model maintains modality-specific
features while dynamically adjusting network parameters based on the available
inputs. By using these divergence- and information-based loss functions, the
framework effectively quantifies discrepancies between predictions and
ground-truth labels, resulting in consistently accurate segmentation. Extensive
evaluations on the BraTS 2018 and BraTS 2020 datasets demonstrate superior
performance over existing methods in handling missing modalities.

TL;DR: 论文提出AIGVE-MACS模型，用于AI生成视频的评估，提供数值评分和多方面语言反馈，显著优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI生成视频评估指标缺乏解释性，难以与人类评价对齐，亟需改进。

Method: 结合AIGVE-BENCH 2基准和Vision-Language Models，采用token-wise加权损失和动态帧采样策略。

Result: AIGVE-MACS在评分相关性和评论质量上表现最优，并通过多代理框架提升视频生成质量53.5%。

Conclusion: AIGVE-MACS为AI生成视频评估提供了全面、人类对齐的新范式，并开源了基准和模型。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-generated video models has created a pressing
need for robust and interpretable evaluation frameworks. Existing metrics are
limited to producing numerical scores without explanatory comments, resulting
in low interpretability and human evaluation alignment. To address those
challenges, we introduce AIGVE-MACS, a unified model for AI-Generated Video
Evaluation(AIGVE), which can provide not only numerical scores but also
multi-aspect language comment feedback in evaluating these generated videos.
Central to our approach is AIGVE-BENCH 2, a large-scale benchmark comprising
2,500 AI-generated videos and 22,500 human-annotated detailed comments and
numerical scores across nine critical evaluation aspects. Leveraging
AIGVE-BENCH 2, AIGVE-MACS incorporates recent Vision-Language Models with a
novel token-wise weighted loss and a dynamic frame sampling strategy to better
align with human evaluators. Comprehensive experiments across supervised and
zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that AIGVE-MACS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both scoring correlation and comment quality, significantly
outperforming prior baselines including GPT-4o and VideoScore. In addition, we
further showcase a multi-agent refinement framework where feedback from
AIGVE-MACS drives iterative improvements in video generation, leading to 53.5%
quality enhancement. This work establishes a new paradigm for comprehensive,
human-aligned evaluation of AI-generated videos. We release the AIGVE-BENCH 2
and AIGVE-MACS at https://huggingface.co/xiaoliux/AIGVE-MACS.

### [7] [Advancements in Weed Mapping: A Systematic Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01269)
*Mohammad Jahanbakht,Alex Olsen,Ross Marchant,Emilie Fillols,Mostafa Rahimi Azghadi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文综述了杂草绘图领域的最新进展，填补了从数据采集到处理技术的全面文献空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 杂草绘图对精准管理和减少环境影响至关重要，但缺乏全面的文献综述和分析。

Method: 通过PRISMA指南系统评估数据采集、处理及绘图技术的最新方法。

Result: 提供了杂草绘图的整体理解，支持高效、可持续的杂草管理系统开发。

Conclusion: 该综述为未来研究提供了基础参考，推动了杂草绘图领域的进步。

Abstract: Weed mapping plays a critical role in precision management by providing
accurate and timely data on weed distribution, enabling targeted control and
reduced herbicide use. This minimizes environmental impacts, supports
sustainable land management, and improves outcomes across agricultural and
natural environments. Recent advances in weed mapping leverage ground-vehicle
Red Green Blue (RGB) cameras, satellite and drone-based remote sensing combined
with sensors such as spectral, Near Infra-Red (NIR), and thermal cameras. The
resulting data are processed using advanced techniques including big data
analytics and machine learning, significantly improving the spatial and
temporal resolution of weed maps and enabling site-specific management
decisions. Despite a growing body of research in this domain, there is a lack
of comprehensive literature reviews specifically focused on weed mapping. In
particular, the absence of a structured analysis spanning the entire mapping
pipeline, from data acquisition to processing techniques and mapping tools,
limits progress in the field. This review addresses these gaps by
systematically examining state-of-the-art methods in data acquisition (sensor
and platform technologies), data processing (including annotation and
modelling), and mapping techniques (such as spatiotemporal analysis and
decision support tools). Following PRISMA guidelines, we critically evaluate
and synthesize key findings from the literature to provide a holistic
understanding of the weed mapping landscape. This review serves as a
foundational reference to guide future research and support the development of
efficient, scalable, and sustainable weed management systems.

### [8] [DiffusionLight-Turbo: Accelerated Light Probes for Free via Single-Pass Chrome Ball Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01305)
*Worameth Chinchuthakun,Pakkapon Phongthawee,Amit Raj,Varun Jampani,Pramook Khungurn,Supasorn Suwajanakorn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过将任务重新定义为镀铬球修复问题，从单张低动态范围（LDR）图像估计光照的简单有效技术，利用预训练的扩散模型Stable Diffusion XL，并引入DiffusionLight和DiffusionLight-Turbo以提高效率和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖有限的HDR全景数据集，泛化能力不足，且扩散模型在生成镀铬球时存在内容不一致或格式不支持的问题。

Method: 通过迭代修复生成中位镀铬球作为稳定的低频光照先验，结合Exposure LoRA生成多曝光LDR图像并合并为HDR光探针；进一步引入Turbo LoRA和LoRA交换技术加速处理。

Result: 实验表明该方法在多样化场景中生成逼真的光照估计，泛化能力优于现有方法，DiffusionLight-Turbo将运行时间从30分钟缩短至30秒。

Conclusion: DiffusionLight及其加速版本DiffusionLight-Turbo有效解决了光照估计中的泛化和效率问题，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: We introduce a simple yet effective technique for estimating lighting from a
single low-dynamic-range (LDR) image by reframing the task as a chrome ball
inpainting problem. This approach leverages a pre-trained diffusion model,
Stable Diffusion XL, to overcome the generalization failures of existing
methods that rely on limited HDR panorama datasets. While conceptually simple,
the task remains challenging because diffusion models often insert incorrect or
inconsistent content and cannot readily generate chrome balls in HDR format.
Our analysis reveals that the inpainting process is highly sensitive to the
initial noise in the diffusion process, occasionally resulting in unrealistic
outputs. To address this, we first introduce DiffusionLight, which uses
iterative inpainting to compute a median chrome ball from multiple outputs to
serve as a stable, low-frequency lighting prior that guides the generation of a
high-quality final result. To generate high-dynamic-range (HDR) light probes,
an Exposure LoRA is fine-tuned to create LDR images at multiple exposure
values, which are then merged. While effective, DiffusionLight is
time-intensive, requiring approximately 30 minutes per estimation. To reduce
this overhead, we introduce DiffusionLight-Turbo, which reduces the runtime to
about 30 seconds with minimal quality loss. This 60x speedup is achieved by
training a Turbo LoRA to directly predict the averaged chrome balls from the
iterative process. Inference is further streamlined into a single denoising
pass using a LoRA swapping technique. Experimental results that show our method
produces convincing light estimates across diverse settings and demonstrates
superior generalization to in-the-wild scenarios. Our code is available at
https://diffusionlight.github.io/turbo

### [9] [Frequency Domain-Based Diffusion Model for Unpaired Image Dehazing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01275)
*Chengxu Liu,Lu Qi,Jinshan Pan,Xueming Qian,Ming-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于频域的扩散模型（\ours），用于无配对图像去雾，通过振幅残差编码器和相位校正模块提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于对比学习的方法引入了与雾无关的内容信息，且忽略了频域中雾相关的特性（如振幅谱中的退化）。

Method: 提出频域扩散模型，利用振幅残差编码器（ARE）补偿振幅差异，并通过相位校正模块（PCM）优化相位谱。

Result: 实验表明，\ours在合成和真实数据集上优于其他先进方法。

Conclusion: 频域扩散模型有效解决了无配对图像去雾问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Unpaired image dehazing has attracted increasing attention due to its
flexible data requirements during model training. Dominant methods based on
contrastive learning not only introduce haze-unrelated content information, but
also ignore haze-specific properties in the frequency domain (\ie,~haze-related
degradation is mainly manifested in the amplitude spectrum). To address these
issues, we propose a novel frequency domain-based diffusion model, named \ours,
for fully exploiting the beneficial knowledge in unpaired clear data. In
particular, inspired by the strong generative ability shown by Diffusion Models
(DMs), we tackle the dehazing task from the perspective of frequency domain
reconstruction and perform the DMs to yield the amplitude spectrum consistent
with the distribution of clear images. To implement it, we propose an Amplitude
Residual Encoder (ARE) to extract the amplitude residuals, which effectively
compensates for the amplitude gap from the hazy to clear domains, as well as
provide supervision for the DMs training. In addition, we propose a Phase
Correction Module (PCM) to eliminate artifacts by further refining the phase
spectrum during dehazing with a simple attention mechanism. Experimental
results demonstrate that our \ours outperforms other state-of-the-art methods
on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

*Camille Billouard,Dawa Derksen,Alexandre Constantin,Bruno Vallet*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Snake-NeRF是一种扩展到大场景的NeRF框架，通过分块处理和优化策略解决了内存限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NeRF方法因内存限制仅适用于小场景，无法处理大尺度卫星图像。

Method: 采用分块策略，将兴趣区域划分为无重叠的3D块，并引入2×2 3D块渐进策略和分段采样器。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能在单GPU上线性时间处理大卫星图像，且质量无损。

Conclusion: Snake-NeRF成功扩展了NeRF的应用范围，适用于大场景3D重建。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have recently emerged as a paradigm for 3D
reconstruction from multiview satellite imagery. However, state-of-the-art NeRF
methods are typically constrained to small scenes due to the memory footprint
during training, which we study in this paper. Previous work on large-scale
NeRFs palliate this by dividing the scene into NeRFs. This paper introduces
Snake-NeRF, a framework that scales to large scenes. Our out-of-core method
eliminates the need to load all images and networks simultaneously, and
operates on a single device. We achieve this by dividing the region of interest
into NeRFs that 3D tile without overlap. Importantly, we crop the images with
overlap to ensure each NeRFs is trained with all the necessary pixels. We
introduce a novel $2\times 2$ 3D tile progression strategy and segmented
sampler, which together prevent 3D reconstruction errors along the tile edges.
Our experiments conclude that large satellite images can effectively be
processed with linear time complexity, on a single GPU, and without compromise
in quality.

Result: 在多种面部分析任务中表现出显著的特征表示改进，计算成本极低。

Conclusion: ET-Fuser通过集成令牌和注意力机制，高效提升了面部分析任务的性能。

Abstract: Facial analysis exhibits task-specific feature variations. While
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have enabled the fine-grained
representation of spatial information, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have
facilitated the representation of semantic information at the patch level.
Although the generalization of conventional methodologies has advanced visual
interpretability, there remains paucity of research that preserves the unified
feature representation on single task learning during the training process. In
this work, we introduce ET-Fuser, a novel methodology for learning ensemble
token by leveraging attention mechanisms based on task priors derived from
pre-trained models for facial analysis. Specifically, we propose a robust prior
unification learning method that generates a ensemble token within a
self-attention mechanism, which shares the mutual information along the
pre-trained encoders. This ensemble token approach offers high efficiency with
negligible computational cost. Our results show improvements across a variety
of facial analysis, with statistically significant enhancements observed in the
feature representations.

Abstract: Body dynamics are crucial information for the analysis of human motions in
important research fields, ranging from biomechanics, sports science to
computer vision and graphics. Modern approaches collect the body dynamics,
external reactive force specifically, via force plates, synchronizing with
human motion capture data, and learn to estimate the dynamics from a black-box
deep learning model. Being specialized devices, force plates can only be
installed in laboratory setups, imposing a significant limitation on the
learning of human dynamics. To this end, we propose a novel method for
estimating human ground reaction dynamics directly from the more reliable
motion capture data with physics laws and computational simulation as
constrains. We introduce a highly accurate and robust method for computing
ground reaction forces from motion capture data using Euler's integration
scheme and PD algorithm. The physics-based reactive forces are used to inform
the learning model about the physics-informed motion dynamics thus improving
the estimation accuracy. The proposed approach was tested on the GroundLink
dataset, outperforming the baseline model on: 1) the ground reaction force
estimation accuracy compared to the force plates measurement; and 2) our
simulated root trajectory precision. The implementation code is available at

### [13] [Learning Camera-Agnostic White-Balance Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01342)
*Luxi Zhao,Mahmoud Afifi,Michael S. Brown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级方法，通过学习后照明估计映射，将中性白平衡校正转换为美学偏好的校正，实现跨相机美学一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业自动白平衡（AWB）系统通常追求美学偏好而非中性色彩校正，且现有学习型方法难以跨相机传感器泛化。本文旨在解决美学一致性问题。

Method: 通过学习一个后照明估计映射，将中性白平衡校正转换为美学偏好的校正，该方法轻量且相机无关。

Result: 在771张智能手机图像数据集上，该方法实现了最先进性能，仅需0.024毫秒运行时间，且兼容现有跨相机AWB技术。

Conclusion: 本文方法首次解决了跨相机美学一致性问题，轻量高效，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: The image signal processor (ISP) pipeline in modern cameras consists of
several modules that transform raw sensor data into visually pleasing images in
a display color space. Among these, the auto white balance (AWB) module is
essential for compensating for scene illumination. However, commercial AWB
systems often strive to compute aesthetic white-balance preferences rather than
accurate neutral color correction. While learning-based methods have improved
AWB accuracy, they typically struggle to generalize across different camera
sensors -- an issue for smartphones with multiple cameras. Recent work has
explored cross-camera AWB, but most methods remain focused on achieving neutral
white balance. In contrast, this paper is the first to address aesthetic
consistency by learning a post-illuminant-estimation mapping that transforms
neutral illuminant corrections into aesthetically preferred corrections in a
camera-agnostic space. Once trained, our mapping can be applied after any
neutral AWB module to enable consistent and stylized color rendering across
unseen cameras. Our proposed model is lightweight -- containing only $\sim$500
parameters -- and runs in just 0.024 milliseconds on a typical flagship mobile
CPU. Evaluated on a dataset of 771 smartphone images from three different
cameras, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while remaining fully
compatible with existing cross-camera AWB techniques, introducing minimal
computational and memory overhead.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GTTA是一种通用的测试时间增强方法，适用于多种视觉和非视觉任务，通过扰动PCA子空间投影形成鲁棒集成，并结合自监督学习降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时间增强方法通用性不足，GTTA旨在提供一种适用于多种任务的通用解决方案。

Method: 通过随机扰动PCA子空间投影形成集成，并引入自监督学习阶段优化模型。

Result: 在多种任务和数据集上验证了GTTA的通用性和有效性，特别是在低可见度水下视频中的三文鱼分割任务。

Conclusion: GTTA是一种高效且通用的测试时间增强方法，显著提升了模型性能并降低了计算成本。

Abstract: We introduce Generalized Test-Time Augmentation (GTTA), a highly effective
method for improving the performance of a trained model, which unlike other
existing Test-Time Augmentation approaches from the literature is general
enough to be used off-the-shelf for many vision and non-vision tasks, such as
classification, regression, image segmentation and object detection. By
applying a new general data transformation, that randomly perturbs multiple
times the PCA subspace projection of a test input, GTTA forms robust ensembles
at test time in which, due to sound statistical properties, the structural and
systematic noises in the initial input data is filtered out and final estimator
errors are reduced. Different from other existing methods, we also propose a
final self-supervised learning stage in which the ensemble output, acting as an
unsupervised teacher, is used to train the initial single student model, thus
reducing significantly the test time computational cost, at no loss in
accuracy. Our tests and comparisons to strong TTA approaches and SoTA models on
various vision and non-vision well-known datasets and tasks, such as image
classification and segmentation, speech recognition and house price prediction,
validate the generality of the proposed GTTA. Furthermore, we also prove its
effectiveness on the more specific real-world task of salmon segmentation and
detection in low-visibility underwater videos, for which we introduce
DeepSalmon, the largest dataset of its kind in the literature.

TL;DR: 提出了一种长尾分布感知路由器（LTDR），用于视觉语言混合专家模型（MoE），解决了模态间分布差异和视觉尾部令牌的专家激活问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE框架忽略了视觉和语言之间的分布差异，导致路由策略不匹配。本文旨在通过LTDR优化模态特定路由和尾部令牌处理。

Method: 设计了分布感知路由器，分别处理语言（均匀分布）和视觉（长尾分布）的路由，并引入类似过采样的策略增强视觉尾部令牌的专家激活。

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证了LTDR的有效性，表明其优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LTDR通过模态感知路由和尾部令牌优化，显著提升了视觉语言MoE模型的性能。

Abstract: The mixture-of-experts (MoE), which replaces dense models with sparse
architectures, has gained attention in large vision-language models (LVLMs) for
achieving comparable performance with fewer activated parameters. Existing MoE
frameworks for LVLMs focus on token-to-expert routing (TER), encouraging
different experts to specialize in processing distinct tokens. However, these
frameworks often rely on the load balancing mechanism, overlooking the inherent
distributional differences between vision and language. To this end, we propose
a Long-Tailed Distribution-aware Router (LTDR) for vision-language TER,
tackling two challenges: (1) Distribution-aware router for modality-specific
routing. We observe that language TER follows a uniform distribution, whereas
vision TER exhibits a long-tailed distribution. This discrepancy necessitates
distinct routing strategies tailored to each modality. (2) Enhancing expert
activation for vision tail tokens. Recognizing the importance of vision tail
tokens, we introduce an oversampling-like strategy by increasing the number of
activated experts for these tokens. Experiments on extensive benchmarks
validate the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: PGA是一种基于3D高斯散射的物理攻击框架，通过快速重建和逼真渲染，提升对抗伪装的多视角鲁棒性和有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有物理攻击方法依赖耗时且不精确的网格先验和虚拟环境，缺乏多视角鲁棒性和对抗有效性。

Method: 利用3D高斯散射技术快速重建目标，避免高斯间的相互遮挡，并通过min-max优化调整背景以过滤非鲁棒特征。

Result: 实验验证了PGA在多视角和复杂环境中的优越对抗效果。

Conclusion: PGA显著提升了物理攻击的鲁棒性和有效性，适用于安全关键场景。

Abstract: Physical adversarial attack methods expose the vulnerabilities of deep neural
networks and pose a significant threat to safety-critical scenarios such as
autonomous driving. Camouflage-based physical attack is a more promising
approach compared to the patch-based attack, offering stronger adversarial
effectiveness in complex physical environments. However, most prior work relies
on mesh priors of the target object and virtual environments constructed by
simulators, which are time-consuming to obtain and inevitably differ from the
real world. Moreover, due to the limitations of the backgrounds in training
images, previous methods often fail to produce multi-view robust adversarial
camouflage and tend to fall into sub-optimal solutions. Due to these reasons,
prior work lacks adversarial effectiveness and robustness across diverse
viewpoints and physical environments. We propose a physical attack framework
based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), named PGA, which provides rapid and
precise reconstruction with few images, along with photo-realistic rendering
capabilities. Our framework further enhances cross-view robustness and
adversarial effectiveness by preventing mutual and self-occlusion among
Gaussians and employing a min-max optimization approach that adjusts the
imaging background of each viewpoint, helping the algorithm filter out
non-robust adversarial features. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness and superiority of PGA. Our code is available

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Activation RMs的新方法，通过激活导向构建奖励信号，无需额外微调，优于现有少样本奖励建模方法，并在防止奖励攻击行为上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对齐大型语言模型（LLMs）和大型多模态模型（LMMs）到人类偏好是提升模型生成质量的关键挑战。传统奖励建模方法难以适应新偏好，需额外训练奖励模型。

Method: 引入Activation RMs，利用激活导向构建奖励信号，仅需少量监督且无需额外模型微调。

Result: Activation RMs在标准奖励建模基准上优于现有少样本方法，并在防止奖励攻击行为上表现突出。

Conclusion: Activation RMs在少样本奖励建模中表现优异，适用于安全关键应用，并在新提出的PreferenceHack基准上超越GPT-4o。

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to
human preferences is a central challenge in improving the quality of the
models' generative outputs for real-world applications. A common approach is to
use reward modeling to encode preferences, enabling alignment via post-training
using reinforcement learning. However, traditional reward modeling is not
easily adaptable to new preferences because it requires a separate reward
model, commonly trained on large preference datasets. To address this, we
introduce Activation Reward Models (Activation RMs) -- a novel few-shot reward
modeling method that leverages activation steering to construct well-aligned
reward signals using minimal supervision and no additional model finetuning.
Activation RMs outperform existing few-shot reward modeling approaches such as
LLM-as-a-judge with in-context learning, voting-based scoring, and token
probability scoring on standard reward modeling benchmarks. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of Activation RMs in mitigating reward hacking
behaviors, highlighting their utility for safety-critical applications. Toward
this end, we propose PreferenceHack, a novel few-shot setting benchmark, the
first to test reward models on reward hacking in a paired preference format.
Finally, we show that Activation RM achieves state-of-the-art performance on
this benchmark, surpassing even GPT-4o.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为“主动测量”的人机协同AI框架，通过重要性采样优化测量精度，减少人工工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI在科学发现中的工作流程缺乏足够的准确性和统计保证，需要一种更高效的测量方法。

Method: 结合AI模型预测和人类标注，通过重要性采样优化测量，并逐步改进模型。

Result: 主动测量在多个测量任务中降低了估计误差，且对AI模型的准确性要求较低。

Conclusion: 主动测量框架为科学测量提供了一种高效、精确且节省人力的解决方案。

Abstract: AI has the potential to transform scientific discovery by analyzing vast
datasets with little human effort. However, current workflows often do not
provide the accuracy or statistical guarantees that are needed. We introduce
active measurement, a human-in-the-loop AI framework for scientific
measurement. An AI model is used to predict measurements for individual units,
which are then sampled for human labeling using importance sampling. With each
new set of human labels, the AI model is improved and an unbiased Monte Carlo
estimate of the total measurement is refined. Active measurement can provide
precise estimates even with an imperfect AI model, and requires little human
effort when the AI model is very accurate. We derive novel estimators,
weighting schemes, and confidence intervals, and show that active measurement
reduces estimation error compared to alternatives in several measurement tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于伪标签增强的音频视觉Mamba网络（MUG），用于改进弱监督音频视觉视频解析任务中的段级和事件级预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在弱监督和模型架构限制下，难以同时提升段级和事件级预测性能。

Method: 通过伪标签增强生成新数据，并采用音频视觉Mamba网络进行特征处理和交互。

Result: 在LLP数据集上，MUG在所有指标上均优于现有方法（如视觉段级和音频段级指标分别提升2.1%和1.2%）。

Conclusion: MUG通过伪标签增强和Mamba网络设计，显著提升了音频视觉视频解析的性能。

Abstract: The weakly-supervised audio-visual video parsing (AVVP) aims to predict all
modality-specific events and locate their temporal boundaries. Despite
significant progress, due to the limitations of the weakly-supervised and the
deficiencies of the model architecture, existing methods are lacking in
simultaneously improving both the segment-level prediction and the event-level
prediction. In this work, we propose a audio-visual Mamba network with pseudo
labeling aUGmentation (MUG) for emphasising the uniqueness of each segment and
excluding the noise interference from the alternate modalities. Specifically,
we annotate some of the pseudo-labels based on previous work. Using unimodal
pseudo-labels, we perform cross-modal random combinations to generate new data,
which can enhance the model's ability to parse various segment-level event
combinations. For feature processing and interaction, we employ a audio-visual
mamba network. The AV-Mamba enhances the ability to perceive different segments
and excludes additional modal noise while sharing similar modal information.
Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MUG improves state-of-the-art
results on LLP dataset in all metrics (e.g,, gains of 2.1% and 1.2% in terms of
visual Segment-level and audio Segment-level metrics). Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法在说话头生成中存在身份泄漏和渲染伪影问题，尤其在极端情况下表现不佳。本文旨在同时解决这两个问题。

Method: 提出FixTalk框架，包括增强运动指示器（EMI）解耦身份信息，以及增强细节指示器（EDI）利用泄露信息补充细节。

Result: 实验表明，FixTalk有效缓解了身份泄漏和渲染伪影，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FixTalk通过创新设计解决了说话头生成中的关键问题，实现了高质量的渲染效果。

Abstract: Talking head generation is gaining significant importance across various
domains, with a growing demand for high-quality rendering. However, existing
methods often suffer from identity leakage (IL) and rendering artifacts (RA),
particularly in extreme cases. Through an in-depth analysis of previous
approaches, we identify two key insights: (1) IL arises from identity
information embedded within motion features, and (2) this identity information
can be leveraged to address RA. Building on these findings, this paper
introduces FixTalk, a novel framework designed to simultaneously resolve both
issues for high-quality talking head generation. Firstly, we propose an
Enhanced Motion Indicator (EMI) to effectively decouple identity information
from motion features, mitigating the impact of IL on generated talking heads.
To address RA, we introduce an Enhanced Detail Indicator (EDI), which utilizes
the leaked identity information to supplement missing details, thus fixing the
artifacts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FixTalk effectively mitigates
IL and RA, achieving superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 通过结合先验信息和时序一致性，实现了高精地图的在线一致性构建，为自动驾驶提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Most autonomous cars rely on the availability of high-definition (HD) maps.
Current research aims to address this constraint by directly predicting HD map
elements from onboard sensors and reasoning about the relationships between the
predicted map and traffic elements. Despite recent advancements, the coherent
online construction of HD maps remains a challenging endeavor, as it
necessitates modeling the high complexity of road topologies in a unified and
consistent manner. To address this challenge, we propose a coherent approach to
predict lane segments and their corresponding topology, as well as road
boundaries, all by leveraging prior map information represented by commonly
available standard-definition (SD) maps. We propose a network architecture,
which leverages hybrid lane segment encodings comprising prior information and
denoising techniques to enhance training stability and performance.
Furthermore, we facilitate past frames for temporal consistency. Our
experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach outperforms previous
methods by a large margin, highlighting the benefits of our modeling scheme.

Abstract: Fetal abdominal malformations are serious congenital anomalies that require
accurate diagnosis to guide pregnancy management and reduce mortality. Although
AI has demonstrated significant potential in medical diagnosis, its application
to prenatal abdominal anomalies remains limited. Most existing studies focus on
image-level classification and rely on standard plane localization, placing
less emphasis on case-level diagnosis. In this paper, we develop a case-level
multiple instance learning (MIL)-based method, free of standard plane
localization, for classifying fetal abdominal anomalies in prenatal ultrasound.
Our contribution is three-fold. First, we adopt a mixture-of-attention-experts
module (MoAE) to weight different attention heads for various planes. Secondly,
we propose a medical-knowledge-driven feature selection module (MFS) to align
image features with medical knowledge, performing self-supervised image token
selection at the case-level. Finally, we propose a prompt-based prototype
learning (PPL) to enhance the MFS. Extensively validated on a large prenatal
abdominal ultrasound dataset containing 2,419 cases, with a total of 24,748
images and 6 categories, our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art
competitors. Codes are available at:https://github.com/LL-AC/AAcls.

Motivation: 现有方法通常仅能处理恒定颜色背景的阴影，而忽略了彩色阴影的去除需求。

Conclusion: DocShaDiffusion在文档图像阴影去除任务中表现优异，且代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Document shadow removal is a crucial task in the field of document image
enhancement. However, existing methods tend to remove shadows with constant
color background and ignore color shadows. In this paper, we first design a
diffusion model in latent space for document image shadow removal, called
DocShaDiffusion. It translates shadow images from pixel space to latent space,
enabling the model to more easily capture essential features. To address the
issue of color shadows, we design a shadow soft-mask generation module (SSGM).
It is able to produce accurate shadow mask and add noise into shadow regions
specially. Guided by the shadow mask, a shadow mask-aware guided diffusion
module (SMGDM) is proposed to remove shadows from document images by
supervising the diffusion and denoising process. We also propose a
shadow-robust perceptual feature loss to preserve details and structures in
document images. Moreover, we develop a large-scale synthetic document color
shadow removal dataset (SDCSRD). It simulates the distribution of realistic
color shadows and provides powerful supports for the training of models.
Experiments on three public datasets validate the proposed method's superiority
over state-of-the-art. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像标题生成模型难以精细控制生成标题的属性，主要因为训练时未将这些属性作为条件，且模型无法平滑切换语言模式。

Method: 量化标题的三个属性（长度、描述性、单词独特性）为连续标量值，并通过端点向量插值实现条件控制。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能平滑调整标题属性，并在词汇对齐上优于基线模型，例如长度控制误差降低506%。

Conclusion: CaptionSmiths通过量化属性和插值方法，实现了单模型对多样化语言模式的有效控制。

Abstract: An image captioning model flexibly switching its language pattern, e.g.,
descriptiveness and length, should be useful since it can be applied to diverse
applications. However, despite the dramatic improvement in generative
vision-language models, fine-grained control over the properties of generated
captions is not easy due to two reasons: (i) existing models are not given the
properties as a condition during training and (ii) existing models cannot
smoothly transition its language pattern from one state to the other. Given
this challenge, we propose a new approach, CaptionSmiths, to acquire a single
captioning model that can handle diverse language patterns. First, our approach
quantifies three properties of each caption, length, descriptiveness, and
uniqueness of a word, as continuous scalar values, without human annotation.
Given the values, we represent the conditioning via interpolation between two
endpoint vectors corresponding to the extreme states, e.g., one for a very
short caption and one for a very long caption. Empirical results demonstrate
that the resulting model can smoothly change the properties of the output
captions and show higher lexical alignment than baselines. For instance,
CaptionSmiths reduces the error in controlling caption length by 506\% despite
better lexical alignment. Code will be available on

Motivation: 解决无需重新训练即可分割新物体实例的难题，并改进现有方法如CNOS、SAM-6D和NIDS-Net。

Method: 利用Grounded-SAM 2生成物体提议和分割掩码，DINOv2生成嵌入；通过相似性计算和循环阈值过滤改进匹配。

Result: 在BOP 2023挑战的7个核心数据集上表现优于其他RGB和RGB-D方法。

Conclusion: NOCTIS展示了无需微调的高效新物体实例分割能力。

Abstract: Instance segmentation of novel objects instances in RGB images, given some
example images for each object, is a well known problem in computer vision.
Designing a model general enough to be employed, for all kinds of novel
objects, without (re-) training, has proven to be a difficult task. To handle
this, we propose a simple, yet powerful, framework, called: Novel Object Cyclic
Threshold based Instance Segmentation (NOCTIS). This work stems from and
improves upon previous ones like CNOS, SAM-6D and NIDS-Net; thus, it also
leverages on recent vision foundation models, namely: Grounded-SAM 2 and
DINOv2. It utilises Grounded-SAM 2 to obtain object proposals with precise
bounding boxes and their corresponding segmentation masks; while DINOv2's
zero-shot capabilities are employed to generate the image embeddings. The
quality of those masks, together with their embeddings, is of vital importance
to our approach; as the proposal-object matching is realized by determining an
object matching score based on the similarity of the class embeddings and the
average maximum similarity of the patch embeddings. Differently to SAM-6D,
calculating the latter involves a prior patch filtering based on the distance
between each patch and its corresponding cyclic/roundtrip patch in the image
grid. Furthermore, the average confidence of the proposals' bounding box and
mask is used as an additional weighting factor for the object matching score.
We empirically show that NOCTIS, without further training/fine tuning,
outperforms the best RGB and RGB-D methods on the seven core datasets of the
BOP 2023 challenge for the "Model-based 2D segmentation of unseen objects"
task.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在开放世界中，OOD检测对模型安全部署至关重要。观察到ID样本的梯度方向一致，而OOD样本的梯度方向混乱，因此提出利用梯度特征改进OOD检测。

Method: 提出推理阶段技术，短路异常梯度特征坐标，同时引入局部一阶近似以避免二次前向传播。

Result: 在标准OOD基准测试中表现显著提升，方法轻量且对标准推理流程改动小。

Conclusion: 该方法为实际应用中的OOD检测提供了一种实用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is critical for safely deploying deep
models in open-world environments, where inputs may lie outside the training
distribution. During inference on a model trained exclusively with
In-Distribution (ID) data, we observe a salient gradient phenomenon: around an
ID sample, the local gradient directions for "enhancing" that sample's
predicted class remain relatively consistent, whereas OOD samples--unseen in
training--exhibit disorganized or conflicting gradient directions in the same
neighborhood. Motivated by this observation, we propose an inference-stage
technique to short-circuit those feature coordinates that spurious gradients
exploit to inflate OOD confidence, while leaving ID classification largely
intact. To circumvent the expense of recomputing the logits after this gradient
short-circuit, we further introduce a local first-order approximation that
accurately captures the post-modification outputs without a second forward
pass. Experiments on standard OOD benchmarks show our approach yields
substantial improvements. Moreover, the method is lightweight and requires
minimal changes to the standard inference pipeline, offering a practical path
toward robust OOD detection in real-world applications.

Abstract: Deepfakes pose significant security and privacy threats through malicious
facial manipulations. While robust watermarking can aid in authenticity
verification and source tracking, existing methods often lack the sufficient
robustness against Deepfake manipulations. Diffusion models have demonstrated
remarkable performance in image generation, enabling the seamless fusion of
watermark with image during generation. In this study, we propose a novel
robust watermarking framework based on diffusion model, called DiffMark. By
modifying the training and sampling scheme, we take the facial image and
watermark as conditions to guide the diffusion model to progressively denoise
and generate corresponding watermarked image. In the construction of facial
condition, we weight the facial image by a timestep-dependent factor that
gradually reduces the guidance intensity with the decrease of noise, thus
better adapting to the sampling process of diffusion model. To achieve the
fusion of watermark condition, we introduce a cross information fusion (CIF)
module that leverages a learnable embedding table to adaptively extract
watermark features and integrates them with image features via cross-attention.
To enhance the robustness of the watermark against Deepfake manipulations, we
integrate a frozen autoencoder during training phase to simulate Deepfake
manipulations. Additionally, we introduce Deepfake-resistant guidance that
employs specific Deepfake model to adversarially guide the diffusion sampling
process to generate more robust watermarked images. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DiffMark on typical Deepfakes.
Our code will be available at https://github.com/vpsg-research/DiffMark.

Abstract: Global warming, loss of biodiversity, and air pollution are among the most
significant problems facing Earth. One of the primary challenges in addressing
these issues is the lack of monitoring forests to protect them. To tackle this
problem, it is important to leverage remote sensing and computer vision methods
to automate monitoring applications. Hence, automatic tree crown detection
algorithms emerged based on traditional and deep learning methods. In this
study, we first introduce two different tree crown detection methods based on
these approaches. Then, we form a novel rule-based approach that integrates
these two methods to enhance robustness and accuracy of tree crown detection
results. While traditional methods are employed for feature extraction and
segmentation of forested areas, deep learning methods are used to detect tree
crowns in our method. With the proposed rule-based approach, we post-process
these results, aiming to increase the number of detected tree crowns through
neighboring trees and localized operations. We compare the obtained results
with the proposed method in terms of the number of detected tree crowns and
report the advantages, disadvantages, and areas for improvement of the obtained
outcomes.

Conclusion: TurboReg通过轻量级团和并行化搜索算法，实现了高效鲁棒的点云配准，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: Robust estimation is essential in correspondence-based Point Cloud
Registration (PCR). Existing methods using maximal clique search in
compatibility graphs achieve high recall but suffer from exponential time
complexity, limiting their use in time-sensitive applications. To address this
challenge, we propose a fast and robust estimator, TurboReg, built upon a novel
lightweight clique, TurboClique, and a highly parallelizable Pivot-Guided
Search (PGS) algorithm. First, we define the TurboClique as a 3-clique within a
highly-constrained compatibility graph. The lightweight nature of the 3-clique
allows for efficient parallel searching, and the highly-constrained
compatibility graph ensures robust spatial consistency for stable
transformation estimation. Next, PGS selects matching pairs with high SC$^2$
scores as pivots, effectively guiding the search toward TurboCliques with
higher inlier ratios. Moreover, the PGS algorithm has linear time complexity
and is significantly more efficient than the maximal clique search with
exponential time complexity. Extensive experiments show that TurboReg achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple real-world datasets, with
substantial speed improvements. For example, on the 3DMatch+FCGF dataset,
TurboReg (1K) operates $208.22\times$ faster than 3DMAC while also achieving
higher recall. Our code is accessible at

Abstract: The collection and release of street-level recordings as Open Data play a
vital role in advancing autonomous driving systems and AI research. However,
these datasets pose significant privacy risks, particularly for pedestrians,
due to the presence of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that extends
beyond biometric traits such as faces. In this paper, we present cRID, a novel
cross-modal framework combining Large Vision-Language Models, Graph Attention
Networks, and representation learning to detect textual describable clues of
PII and enhance person re-identification (Re-ID). Our approach focuses on
identifying and leveraging interpretable features, enabling the detection of
semantically meaningful PII beyond low-level appearance cues. We conduct a
systematic evaluation of PII presence in person image datasets. Our experiments
show improved performance in practical cross-dataset Re-ID scenarios, notably
from Market-1501 to CUHK03-np (detected), highlighting the framework's
practical utility. Code is available at https://github.com/RAufschlaeger/cRID.

TL;DR: OoDDINO提出了一种多级异常分割框架，通过粗到细的检测策略解决现有像素级方法的局限性，包括空间相关性忽略和全局阈值问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有像素级异常分割方法因忽略像素间空间相关性和全局阈值问题，导致分割碎片化和误判。

Method: OoDDINO采用两阶段级联架构，结合不确定性引导的检测模型和像素级分割模型，提出正交不确定性融合策略（OUAFS）和自适应双阈值网络（ADT-Net）。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验验证了OoDDINO的优越性和兼容性。

Conclusion: OoDDINO通过多级策略有效提升异常分割性能，可作为插件增强其他模型。

Abstract: Anomaly segmentation aims to identify Out-of-Distribution (OoD) anomalous
objects within images. Existing pixel-wise methods typically assign anomaly
scores individually and employ a global thresholding strategy to segment
anomalies. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches encounter significant
challenges in real-world applications: (1) neglecting spatial correlations
among pixels within the same object, resulting in fragmented segmentation; (2)
variabil ity in anomaly score distributions across image regions, causing
global thresholds to either generate false positives in background areas or
miss segments of anomalous objects. In this work, we introduce OoDDINO, a novel
multi-level anomaly segmentation framework designed to address these
limitations through a coarse-to-fine anomaly detection strategy. OoDDINO
combines an uncertainty-guided anomaly detection model with a pixel-level
segmentation model within a two-stage cascade architecture. Initially, we
propose an Orthogonal Uncertainty-Aware Fusion Strategy (OUAFS) that
sequentially integrates multiple uncertainty metrics with visual
representations, employing orthogonal constraints to strengthen the detection
model's capacity for localizing anomalous regions accurately. Subsequently, we
develop an Adaptive Dual-Threshold Network (ADT-Net), which dynamically
generates region-specific thresholds based on object-level detection outputs
and pixel-wise anomaly scores. This approach allows for distinct thresholding
strategies within foreground and background areas, achieving fine-grained
anomaly segmentation. The proposed framework is compatible with other
pixel-wise anomaly detection models, which acts as a plug-in to boost the
performance. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets validate our
framework's superiority and compatibility over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The widespread use of deep learning face recognition raises several security
concerns. Although prior works point at existing vulnerabilities, DNN backdoor
attacks against real-life, unconstrained systems dealing with images captured
in the wild remain a blind spot of the literature. This paper conducts the
first system-level study of backdoors in deep learning-based face recognition
systems. This paper yields four contributions by exploring the feasibility of
DNN backdoors on these pipelines in a holistic fashion. We demonstrate for the
first time two backdoor attacks on the face detection task: face generation and
face landmark shift attacks. We then show that face feature extractors trained
with large margin losses also fall victim to backdoor attacks. Combining our
models, we then show using 20 possible pipeline configurations and 15 attack
cases that a single backdoor enables an attacker to bypass the entire function
of a system. Finally, we provide stakeholders with several best practices and
countermeasures.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为REG的方法，通过将低层图像潜在表示与预训练模型的高层类别标记结合，显著提升了扩散模型的生成质量和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如REPA）在训练过程中利用外部视觉表示，但在推理阶段未能充分利用判别性表示，限制了生成模型的潜力。

Method: REG方法将低层图像潜在表示与预训练基础模型的单一高层类别标记结合，实现图像和类别的联合生成。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256上，REG显著加速了训练收敛（63倍和23倍），并在更短的训练时间内超越了现有方法的性能。

Conclusion: REG通过简单的表示纠缠机制，高效提升了扩散模型的生成能力，且推理开销极小。

Abstract: REPA and its variants effectively mitigate training challenges in diffusion
models by incorporating external visual representations from pretrained models,
through alignment between the noisy hidden projections of denoising networks
and foundational clean image representations. We argue that the external
alignment, which is absent during the entire denoising inference process, falls
short of fully harnessing the potential of discriminative representations. In
this work, we propose a straightforward method called Representation
Entanglement for Generation (REG), which entangles low-level image latents with
a single high-level class token from pretrained foundation models for
denoising. REG acquires the capability to produce coherent image-class pairs
directly from pure noise, substantially improving both generation quality and
training efficiency. This is accomplished with negligible additional inference
overhead, requiring only one single additional token for denoising (<0.5\%
increase in FLOPs and latency). The inference process concurrently reconstructs
both image latents and their corresponding global semantics, where the acquired
semantic knowledge actively guides and enhances the image generation process.
On ImageNet 256$\times$256, SiT-XL/2 + REG demonstrates remarkable convergence
acceleration, achieving $\textbf{63}\times$ and $\textbf{23}\times$ faster
training than SiT-XL/2 and SiT-XL/2 + REPA, respectively. More impressively,
SiT-L/2 + REG trained for merely 400K iterations outperforms SiT-XL/2 + REPA
trained for 4M iterations ($\textbf{10}\times$ longer). Code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HOT检测模型局限于单一图像类型，导致过度分割和区域类别不一致，需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: P3HOT框架结合语义驱动的提示机制和人类近端感知机制，利用深度信息消除非交互区域，并引入区域联合损失（RJLoss）和新评估指标AD-Acc。

Result: 在HOT-Annotated数据集上，模型在四个指标上均有显著提升（SC-Acc.、mIoU、wIoU、AD-Acc.）。

Conclusion: P3HOT框架通过多机制结合，显著提升了HOT检测的性能，为相关任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: The task of Human-Object conTact (HOT) detection involves identifying the
specific areas of the human body that are touching objects. Nevertheless,
current models are restricted to just one type of image, often leading to too
much segmentation in areas with little interaction, and struggling to maintain
category consistency within specific regions. To tackle this issue, a HOT
framework, termed \textbf{P3HOT}, is proposed, which blends \textbf{P}rompt
guidance and human \textbf{P}roximal \textbf{P}erception. To begin with, we
utilize a semantic-driven prompt mechanism to direct the network's attention
towards the relevant regions based on the correlation between image and text.
Then a human proximal perception mechanism is employed to dynamically perceive
key depth range around the human, using learnable parameters to effectively
eliminate regions where interactions are not expected. Calculating depth
resolves the uncertainty of the overlap between humans and objects in a 2D
perspective, providing a quasi-3D viewpoint. Moreover, a Regional Joint Loss
(RJLoss) has been created as a new loss to inhibit abnormal categories in the
same area. A new evaluation metric called ``AD-Acc.'' is introduced to address
the shortcomings of existing methods in addressing negative samples.
Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance in four metrics across two benchmark datasets.
Specifically, our model achieves an improvement of \textbf{0.7}$\uparrow$,
\textbf{2.0}$\uparrow$, \textbf{1.6}$\uparrow$, and \textbf{11.0}$\uparrow$ in
SC-Acc., mIoU, wIoU, and AD-Acc. metrics, respectively, on the HOT-Annotated
dataset. Code is available at https://github.com/YuxiaoWang-AI/P3HOT.

Abstract: Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, and detecting its leaks early via
hyperspectral satellite imagery can help mitigate climate change. Meanwhile,
many existing missions operate in manual tasking regimes only, thus missing
potential events of interest. To overcome slow downlink rates cost-effectively,
onboard detection is a viable solution. However, traditional methane
enhancement methods are too computationally demanding for resource-limited
onboard hardware. This work accelerates methane detection by focusing on
efficient, low-power algorithms. We test fast target detection methods (ACE,
CEM) that have not been previously used for methane detection and propose a
Mag1c-SAS - a significantly faster variant of the current state-of-the-art
algorithm for methane detection: Mag1c. To explore their true detection
potential, we integrate them with a machine learning model (U-Net, LinkNet).
Our results identify two promising candidates (Mag1c-SAS and CEM), both
acceptably accurate for the detection of strong plumes and computationally
efficient enough for onboard deployment: one optimized more for accuracy, the
other more for speed, achieving up to ~100x and ~230x faster computation than
original Mag1c on resource-limited hardware. Additionally, we propose and
evaluate three band selection strategies. One of them can outperform the method
traditionally used in the field while using fewer channels, leading to even
faster processing without compromising accuracy. This research lays the
foundation for future advancements in onboard methane detection with minimal
hardware requirements, improving timely data delivery. The produced code, data,

Abstract: Visual pose tracking is playing an increasingly vital role in industrial
contexts in recent years. However, the pose tracking for industrial metal
objects remains a challenging task especially in the real world-environments,
due to the reflection characteristic of metal objects. To address this issue,
we propose a novel 6DoF pose tracking method based on active control points.
The method uses image control points to generate edge feature for optimization
actively instead of 6DoF pose-based rendering, and serve them as optimization
variables. We also introduce an optimal control point regression method to
improve robustness. The proposed tracking method performs effectively in both
dataset evaluation and real world tasks, providing a viable solution for
real-time tracking of industrial metal objects. Our source code is made

Conclusion: DepthAnything-AC通过新方法显著提升了在复杂环境中的深度估计性能。

Abstract: We present Depth Anything at Any Condition (DepthAnything-AC), a foundation
monocular depth estimation (MDE) model capable of handling diverse
environmental conditions. Previous foundation MDE models achieve impressive
performance across general scenes but not perform well in complex open-world
environments that involve challenging conditions, such as illumination
variations, adverse weather, and sensor-induced distortions. To overcome the
challenges of data scarcity and the inability of generating high-quality
pseudo-labels from corrupted images, we propose an unsupervised consistency
regularization finetuning paradigm that requires only a relatively small amount
of unlabeled data. Furthermore, we propose the Spatial Distance Constraint to
explicitly enforce the model to learn patch-level relative relationships,
resulting in clearer semantic boundaries and more accurate details.
Experimental results demonstrate the zero-shot capabilities of DepthAnything-AC
across diverse benchmarks, including real-world adverse weather benchmarks,
synthetic corruption benchmarks, and general benchmarks.

Abstract: High-definition (HD) map construction methods are crucial for providing
precise and comprehensive static environmental information, which is essential
for autonomous driving systems. While Camera-LiDAR fusion techniques have shown
promising results by integrating data from both modalities, existing approaches
primarily focus on improving model accuracy and often neglect the robustness of
perception models, which is a critical aspect for real-world applications. In
this paper, we explore strategies to enhance the robustness of multi-modal
fusion methods for HD map construction while maintaining high accuracy. We
propose three key components: data augmentation, a novel multi-modal fusion
module, and a modality dropout training strategy. These components are
evaluated on a challenging dataset containing 10 days of NuScenes data. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our proposed methods significantly
enhance the robustness of baseline methods. Furthermore, our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the clean validation set of the NuScenes
dataset. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing more robust and
reliable HD map construction models, advancing their applicability in
real-world autonomous driving scenarios. Project website:

Method: 提出线性注意力与空间感知衰减（LASAD）机制，通过基于真实2D空间位置计算衰减因子，保留空间关系，并构建LASADGen生成器。

Result: 在ImageNet上的实验表明，LASADGen在图像生成质量和计算效率上达到最优。

Conclusion: LASADGen成功平衡了线性注意力的高效性与高质量图像生成所需的空间理解能力。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have garnered significant attention in image
generation for their ability to effectively capture both local and global
structures within visual data. However, prevalent AR models predominantly rely
on the transformer architectures, which are beset by quadratic computational
complexity concerning input sequence length and substantial memory overhead due
to the necessity of maintaining key-value caches. Although linear attention
mechanisms have successfully reduced this burden in language models, our
initial experiments reveal that they significantly degrade image generation
quality because of their inability to capture critical long-range dependencies
in visual data. We propose Linear Attention with Spatial-Aware Decay (LASAD), a
novel attention mechanism that explicitly preserves genuine 2D spatial
relationships within the flattened image sequences by computing
position-dependent decay factors based on true 2D spatial location rather than
1D sequence positions. Based on this mechanism, we present LASADGen, an
autoregressive image generator that enables selective attention to relevant
spatial contexts with linear complexity. Experiments on ImageNet show LASADGen
achieves state-of-the-art image generation performance and computational
efficiency, bridging the gap between linear attention's efficiency and spatial
understanding needed for high-quality generation.

Abstract: Although video multimodal large language models (video MLLMs) have achieved

enhance captioning capabilities in video MLLMs through preference alignment.
Our approach designs enhanced prompts that specifically target temporal
dynamics and spatial information-two key factors that humans care about when
watching a video-thereby incorporating human-centric preferences. AVC-DPO
leverages the same foundation model's caption generation responses under varied
prompt conditions to conduct preference-aware training and caption alignment.
Using this framework, we have achieved exceptional performance in the

identifying three key features. To extract these features from real images with
sufficient structural preservation, we leverage mid-step latent, which is
inverted only up to the mid-step. We then adapt attention during injection to
improve editability and enhance alignment to the target text. Our method is
training-free, requires no user-provided mask, and can be applied even without
a source prompt. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks with nine baselines
demonstrate its superior performance over prior methods, further validated by
human evaluations confirming a strong user preference for our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ViT在医学图像任务中的表示是否具有语义意义，以及其对微小变化的敏感性。

Method: 使用梯度投影算法分析ViT的表示，并测试其对微小变化的鲁棒性。

Result: ViT的表示缺乏语义意义，微小变化可导致分类准确率下降60%以上。

Conclusion: ViT在医学图像分类中的表示存在根本性问题，影响其在安全关键系统中的部署。

Abstract: Vision transformers (ViTs) have rapidly gained prominence in medical imaging
tasks such as disease classification, segmentation, and detection due to their
superior accuracy compared to conventional deep learning models. However, due
to their size and complex interactions via the self-attention mechanism, they
are not well understood. In particular, it is unclear whether the
representations produced by such models are semantically meaningful. In this
paper, using a projected gradient-based algorithm, we show that their
representations are not semantically meaningful and they are inherently
vulnerable to small changes. Images with imperceptible differences can have
very different representations; on the other hand, images that should belong to
different semantic classes can have nearly identical representations. Such
vulnerability can lead to unreliable classification results; for example,
unnoticeable changes cause the classification accuracy to be reduced by over
60\%. %. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically
demonstrate this fundamental lack of semantic meaningfulness in ViT
representations for medical image classification, revealing a critical
challenge for their deployment in safety-critical systems.

Result: 在五个数据集中表现优于现有方法，分割精度和鲁棒性显著提升。

Conclusion: SAM-MaGuP为息肉分割领域设定了新标准，解决了弱边界和泛化性问题。

Abstract: Polyp segmentation in colonoscopy images is crucial for early detection and
diagnosis of colorectal cancer. However, this task remains a significant
challenge due to the substantial variations in polyp shape, size, and color, as
well as the high similarity between polyps and surrounding tissues, often
compounded by indistinct boundaries. While existing encoder-decoder CNN and
transformer-based approaches have shown promising results, they struggle with
stable segmentation performance on polyps with weak or blurry boundaries. These
methods exhibit limited abilities to distinguish between polyps and non-polyps
and capture essential boundary cues. Moreover, their generalizability still
falls short of meeting the demands of real-time clinical applications. To
address these limitations, we propose SAM-MaGuP, a groundbreaking approach for
robust polyp segmentation. By incorporating a boundary distillation module and
a 1D-2D Mamba adapter within the Segment Anything Model (SAM), SAM-MaGuP excels
at resolving weak boundary challenges and amplifies feature learning through
enriched global contextual interactions. Extensive evaluations across five
diverse datasets reveal that SAM-MaGuP outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving unmatched segmentation accuracy and robustness. Our key innovations,
a Mamba-guided boundary prior and a 1D-2D Mamba block, set a new benchmark in
the field, pushing the boundaries of polyp segmentation to new heights.

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) has evolved significantly, moving from
isolated recognition approaches to complex, continuous gloss-free translation
systems. This paper explores the impact of pose-based data preprocessing
techniques - normalization, interpolation, and augmentation - on SLT
performance. We employ a transformer-based architecture, adapting a modified T5
encoder-decoder model to process pose representations. Through extensive
ablation studies on YouTubeASL and How2Sign datasets, we analyze how different
preprocessing strategies affect translation accuracy. Our results demonstrate
that appropriate normalization, interpolation, and augmentation techniques can
significantly improve model robustness and generalization abilities.
Additionally, we provide a deep analysis of the model's attentions and reveal
interesting behavior suggesting that adding a dedicated register token can
improve overall model performance. We publish our code on our GitHub
repository, including the preprocessed YouTubeASL data.

Abstract: The Vision Transformer (ViT) model has long struggled with the challenge of
quadratic complexity, a limitation that becomes especially critical in unmanned
aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking systems, where data must be processed in real
time. In this study, we explore the recently proposed State-Space Model, Mamba,
leveraging its computational efficiency and capability for long-sequence
modeling to effectively process dense image sequences in tracking tasks. First,
we highlight the issue of temporal inconsistency in existing Mamba-based
methods, specifically the failure to account for temporal continuity in the
Mamba scanning mechanism. Secondly, building upon this insight,we propose
TrackingMiM, a Mamba-in-Mamba architecture, a minimal-computation burden model
for handling image sequence of tracking problem. In our framework, the mamba
scan is performed in a nested way while independently process temporal and
spatial coherent patch tokens. While the template frame is encoded as query
token and utilized for tracking in every scan. Extensive experiments conducted
on five UAV tracking benchmarks confirm that the proposed TrackingMiM achieves
state-of-the-art precision while offering noticeable higher speed in UAV
tracking.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced numerous opportunities for human
assistance and task automation in medicine. However, it suffers from poor
generalization in the presence of shifts in the data distribution. In the
context of AI-based computed tomography (CT) analysis, significant data
distribution shifts can be caused by changes in scanner manufacturer,
reconstruction technique or dose. AI harmonization techniques can address this
problem by reducing distribution shifts caused by various acquisition settings.
This paper presents an open-source benchmark dataset containing CT scans of an
anthropomorphic phantom acquired with various scanners and settings, which
purpose is to foster the development of AI harmonization techniques. Using a
phantom allows fixing variations attributed to inter- and intra-patient
variations. The dataset includes 1378 image series acquired with 13 scanners
from 4 manufacturers across 8 institutions using a harmonized protocol as well
as several acquisition doses. Additionally, we present a methodology, baseline
results and open-source code to assess image- and feature-level stability and
liver tissue classification, promoting the development of AI harmonization

Abstract: The field of neuromorphic vision is developing rapidly, and event cameras are
finding their way into more and more applications. However, the data stream
from these sensors is characterised by significant noise. In this paper, we
propose a method for event data that is capable of removing approximately 99\%
of noise while preserving the majority of the valid signal. We have proposed
four algorithms based on the matrix of infinite impulse response (IIR) filters
method. We compared them on several event datasets that were further modified
by adding artificially generated noise and noise recorded with dynamic vision
sensor. The proposed methods use about 30KB of memory for a sensor with a
resolution of 1280 x 720 and is therefore well suited for implementation in
embedded devices.

Conclusion: 多模态基础模型在视觉任务中表现尚可，但仍需改进，尤其是在几何任务和提示敏感性方面。

Abstract: Multimodal foundation models, such as GPT-4o, have recently made remarkable
progress, but it is not clear where exactly these models stand in terms of
understanding vision. In this paper, we benchmark the performance of popular
multimodal foundation models (GPT-4o, o4-mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 2.0
Flash, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Qwen2-VL, Llama 3.2) on standard computer vision
tasks (semantic segmentation, object detection, image classification, depth and
surface normal prediction) using established datasets (e.g., COCO, ImageNet and
its variants, etc).
  The main challenges to performing this are: 1) most models are trained to
output text and cannot natively express versatile domains, such as segments or
3D geometry, and 2) many leading models are proprietary and accessible only at
an API level, i.e., there is no weight access to adapt them. We address these
challenges by translating standard vision tasks into equivalent text-promptable
and API-compatible tasks via prompt chaining to create a standardized
benchmarking framework.
  We observe that 1) the models are not close to the state-of-the-art
specialist models at any task. However, 2) they are respectable generalists;
this is remarkable as they are presumably trained on primarily image-text-based
tasks. 3) They perform semantic tasks notably better than geometric ones. 4)
While the prompt-chaining techniques affect performance, better models exhibit
less sensitivity to prompt variations. 5) GPT-4o performs the best among
non-reasoning models, securing the top position in 4 out of 6 tasks, 6)
reasoning models, e.g. o3, show improvements in geometric tasks, and 7) a
preliminary analysis of models with native image generation, like the latest
GPT-4o, shows they exhibit quirks like hallucinations and spatial
misalignments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合判别式学习和扩散生成学习的框架（IDGBR），用于改进遥感图像语义分割中的边界精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖判别式学习，擅长捕捉低频特征但忽视高频特征，而扩散生成模型擅长生成高频细节但语义推理不足。

Method: 结合判别式模型生成粗分割图，再通过扩散去噪过程细化边界。

Result: 在五个遥感数据集上验证了框架对边界细化的有效性。

Conclusion: IDGBR框架成功整合了两种学习的优势，显著提升了边界精度。

Abstract: Remote sensing semantic segmentation must address both what the ground
objects are within an image and where they are located. Consequently,
segmentation models must ensure not only the semantic correctness of
large-scale patches (low-frequency information) but also the precise
localization of boundaries between patches (high-frequency information).
However, most existing approaches rely heavily on discriminative learning,
which excels at capturing low-frequency features, while overlooking its
inherent limitations in learning high-frequency features for semantic
segmentation. Recent studies have revealed that diffusion generative models
excel at generating high-frequency details. Our theoretical analysis confirms
that the diffusion denoising process significantly enhances the model's ability
to learn high-frequency features; however, we also observe that these models
exhibit insufficient semantic inference for low-frequency features when guided
solely by the original image. Therefore, we integrate the strengths of both
discriminative and generative learning, proposing the Integration of
Discriminative and diffusion-based Generative learning for Boundary Refinement
(IDGBR) framework. The framework first generates a coarse segmentation map
using a discriminative backbone model. This map and the original image are fed
into a conditioning guidance network to jointly learn a guidance representation
subsequently leveraged by an iterative denoising diffusion process refining the
coarse segmentation. Extensive experiments across five remote sensing semantic
segmentation datasets (binary and multi-class segmentation) confirm our
framework's capability of consistent boundary refinement for coarse results
from diverse discriminative architectures. The source code will be available at
https://github.com/KeyanHu-git/IDGBR.

TL;DR: Locality-aware Parallel Decoding (LPD) 通过灵活并行自回归建模和局部感知生成顺序，显著加速自回归图像生成，降低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归图像生成依赖内存密集型逐块预测，导致高延迟。现有方法尝试多块预测并行化，但效果有限。

Method: 提出两种技术：(1) 灵活并行自回归建模，支持任意生成顺序和并行度；(2) 局部感知生成顺序，最小化组内依赖。

Result: 在 ImageNet 上，生成步骤从 256 降至 20（256×256），1024 降至 48（512×512），延迟降低至少 3.4 倍。

Conclusion: LPD 在保持生成质量的同时，显著提升了并行效率和速度。

Abstract: We present Locality-aware Parallel Decoding (LPD) to accelerate
autoregressive image generation. Traditional autoregressive image generation
relies on next-patch prediction, a memory-bound process that leads to high
latency. Existing works have tried to parallelize next-patch prediction by
shifting to multi-patch prediction to accelerate the process, but only achieved
limited parallelization. To achieve high parallelization while maintaining
generation quality, we introduce two key techniques: (1) Flexible Parallelized
Autoregressive Modeling, a novel architecture that enables arbitrary generation
ordering and degrees of parallelization. It uses learnable position query
tokens to guide generation at target positions while ensuring mutual visibility
among concurrently generated tokens for consistent parallel decoding. (2)
Locality-aware Generation Ordering, a novel schedule that forms groups to
minimize intra-group dependencies and maximize contextual support, enhancing
generation quality. With these designs, we reduce the generation steps from 256
to 20 (256$\times$256 res.) and 1024 to 48 (512$\times$512 res.) without
compromising quality on the ImageNet class-conditional generation, and
achieving at least 3.4$\times$ lower latency than previous parallelized
autoregressive models.

Result: 在SAKUGA数据集上，SketchColour在所有指标上优于现有视频上色方法，且仅使用一半的训练数据。生成的动画时间连贯，色彩溢出和物体变形等伪影极少。

Conclusion: SketchColour提供了一种高效、低成本的2D动画上色解决方案，显著提升了自动化动画制作的效率和质量。

Abstract: The production of high-quality 2D animation is highly labor-intensive
process, as animators are currently required to draw and color a large number
of frames by hand. We present SketchColour, the first sketch-to-colour pipeline
for 2D animation built on a diffusion transformer (DiT) backbone. By replacing
the conventional U-Net denoiser with a DiT-style architecture and injecting
sketch information via lightweight channel-concatenation adapters accompanied
with LoRA finetuning, our method natively integrates conditioning without the
parameter and memory bloat of a duplicated ControlNet, greatly reducing
parameter count and GPU memory usage. Evaluated on the SAKUGA dataset,
SketchColour outperforms previous state-of-the-art video colourization methods
across all metrics, despite using only half the training data of competing

Abstract: Recent deep learning-based image denoising methods have shown impressive
performance; however, many lack the flexibility to adjust the denoising
strength based on the noise levels, camera settings, and user preferences. In
this paper, we introduce a new controllable denoising framework that adaptively
removes noise from images by utilizing information from camera parameters.
Specifically, we focus on ISO, shutter speed, and F-number, which are closely
related to noise levels. We convert these selected parameters into a vector to
control and enhance the performance of the denoising network. Experimental
results show that our method seamlessly adds controllability to standard
denoising neural networks and improves their performance. Code is available at

Result: 实验验证DepthSync在多种数据集上显著提升长视频深度估计的尺度和几何一致性。

Conclusion: DepthSync为长视频深度估计提供了一种无需训练的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion-based video depth estimation methods have achieved remarkable
success with strong generalization ability. However, predicting depth for long
videos remains challenging. Existing methods typically split videos into
overlapping sliding windows, leading to accumulated scale discrepancies across
different windows, particularly as the number of windows increases.
Additionally, these methods rely solely on 2D diffusion priors, overlooking the
inherent 3D geometric structure of video depths, which results in geometrically
inconsistent predictions. In this paper, we propose DepthSync, a novel,
training-free framework using diffusion guidance to achieve scale- and
geometry-consistent depth predictions for long videos. Specifically, we
introduce scale guidance to synchronize the depth scale across windows and
geometry guidance to enforce geometric alignment within windows based on the
inherent 3D constraints in video depths. These two terms work synergistically,
steering the denoising process toward consistent depth predictions. Experiments
on various datasets validate the effectiveness of our method in producing depth
estimates with improved scale and geometry consistency, particularly for long
videos.

Motivation: 传统基于MSE优化的图像编码模型在潜在空间中语义丰富性不足，且需要大量计算资源进行微调，限制了压缩域语义推理的效果。

Method: 提出POLC方法，通过优化潜在特征的语义内容，仅需使用轻量级的适配器进行微调，大幅减少参数数量。

Result: POLC在率-感知性能上与生成式图像编码方法相当，同时在视觉任务中显著提升性能，且微调开销极小。

Conclusion: POLC为压缩域语义推理提供了一种高效且高性能的解决方案，显著优于传统MSE导向的方法。

Abstract: In recent years, compressed domain semantic inference has primarily relied on
learned image coding models optimized for mean squared error (MSE). However,
MSE-oriented optimization tends to yield latent spaces with limited semantic
richness, which hinders effective semantic inference in downstream tasks.
Moreover, achieving high performance with these models often requires
fine-tuning the entire vision model, which is computationally intensive,
especially for large models. To address these problems, we introduce
Perception-Oriented Latent Coding (POLC), an approach that enriches the
semantic content of latent features for high-performance compressed domain
semantic inference. With the semantically rich latent space, POLC requires only
a plug-and-play adapter for fine-tuning, significantly reducing the parameter
count compared to previous MSE-oriented methods. Experimental results
demonstrate that POLC achieves rate-perception performance comparable to
state-of-the-art generative image coding methods while markedly enhancing
performance in vision tasks, with minimal fine-tuning overhead. Code is

Conclusion: SAILViT有效解决了ViT与LLM联合训练的瓶颈，为复杂多模态交互提供了性能突破。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) are essential as foundation backbones in
establishing the visual comprehension capabilities of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Although most ViTs achieve impressive performance through
image-text pair-based contrastive learning or self-supervised mechanisms, they
struggle to engage in connector-based co-training directly with LLMs due to
potential parameter initialization conflicts and modality semantic gaps. To
address the above challenges, this paper proposes SAILViT, a gradual feature
learning-enhanced ViT for facilitating MLLMs to break through performance
bottlenecks in complex multimodal interactions. SAILViT achieves
coarse-to-fine-grained feature alignment and world knowledge infusion with
gradual feature refinement, which better serves target training demands. We
perform thorough empirical analyses to confirm the powerful robustness and
generalizability of SAILViT across different dimensions, including parameter
sizes, model architectures, training strategies, and data scales. Equipped with
SAILViT, existing MLLMs show significant and consistent performance
improvements on the OpenCompass benchmark across extensive downstream tasks.

Conclusion: RobuSTereo通过数据增强和特征优化，有效解决了立体匹配在恶劣天气中的挑战。

Abstract: Learning-based stereo matching models struggle in adverse weather conditions
due to the scarcity of corresponding training data and the challenges in
extracting discriminative features from degraded images. These limitations
significantly hinder zero-shot generalization to out-of-distribution weather
conditions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{RobuSTereo}, a novel framework
that enhances the zero-shot generalization of stereo matching models under
adverse weather by addressing both data scarcity and feature extraction
challenges. First, we introduce a diffusion-based simulation pipeline with a
stereo consistency module, which generates high-quality stereo data tailored
for adverse conditions. By training stereo matching models on our synthetic
datasets, we reduce the domain gap between clean and degraded images,
significantly improving the models' robustness to unseen weather conditions.
The stereo consistency module ensures structural alignment across synthesized
image pairs, preserving geometric integrity and enhancing depth estimation
accuracy. Second, we design a robust feature encoder that combines a
specialized ConvNet with a denoising transformer to extract stable and reliable
features from degraded images. The ConvNet captures fine-grained local
structures, while the denoising transformer refines global representations,
effectively mitigating the impact of noise, low visibility, and weather-induced

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SPoT的新颖标记化策略，通过连续放置标记来突破传统网格限制，显著提升性能并减少推理时所需的标记数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准标记化方法将特征限制在离散的网格中，阻碍了模型在稀疏场景下的潜力。

Method: 提出Subpixel Placement of Tokens (SPoT)，通过连续放置标记和基于oracle的搜索优化位置。

Result: 实验显示，理想的子像素标记定位能显著提升性能并减少标记数量。

Conclusion: SPoT为ViT架构提供了更灵活、高效和可解释的方向，将稀疏性转化为优势。

Abstract: Vision Transformers naturally accommodate sparsity, yet standard tokenization
methods confine features to discrete patch grids. This constraint prevents
models from fully exploiting sparse regimes, forcing awkward compromises. We
propose Subpixel Placement of Tokens (SPoT), a novel tokenization strategy that
positions tokens continuously within images, effectively sidestepping
grid-based limitations. With our proposed oracle-guided search, we uncover
substantial performance gains achievable with ideal subpixel token positioning,
drastically reducing the number of tokens necessary for accurate predictions
during inference. SPoT provides a new direction for flexible, efficient, and
interpretable ViT architectures, redefining sparsity as a strategic advantage
rather than an imposed limitation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究是否可以通过端到端强化学习训练解决图像目标导航任务，避免依赖专用图像匹配或预训练模块。

Method: 通过大规模实验研究不同架构选择（如延迟融合、通道堆叠、空间到深度投影和交叉注意力）对导航任务中相对姿态估计器的影响。

Result: 发现模拟器设置对方法成功有影响，但能力可部分迁移到更真实场景；导航性能与相对姿态估计性能相关。

Conclusion: 端到端强化学习训练在图像目标导航中可行，但需注意模拟器设置的影响；导航性能与相对姿态估计能力相关。

Abstract: Image goal navigation requires two different skills: firstly, core navigation
skills, including the detection of free space and obstacles, and taking
decisions based on an internal representation; and secondly, computing
directional information by comparing visual observations to the goal image.
Current state-of-the-art methods either rely on dedicated image-matching, or
pre-training of computer vision modules on relative pose estimation. In this
paper, we study whether this task can be efficiently solved with end-to-end
training of full agents with RL, as has been claimed by recent work. A positive
answer would have impact beyond Embodied AI and allow training of relative pose
estimation from reward for navigation alone. In a large study we investigate
the effect of architectural choices like late fusion, channel stacking,
space-to-depth projections and cross-attention, and their role in the emergence
of relative pose estimators from navigation training. We show that the success
of recent methods is influenced up to a certain extent by simulator settings,
leading to shortcuts in simulation. However, we also show that these
capabilities can be transferred to more realistic setting, up to some extend.
We also find evidence for correlations between navigation performance and
probed (emerging) relative pose estimation performance, an important sub skill.

Conclusion: FACET-VLM为多模态面部表情识别提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) in 3D and 4D domains presents a
significant challenge in affective computing due to the complexity of spatial
and temporal facial dynamics. Its success is crucial for advancing applications
in human behavior understanding, healthcare monitoring, and human-computer
interaction. In this work, we propose FACET-VLM, a vision-language framework
for 3D/4D FER that integrates multiview facial representation learning with
semantic guidance from natural language prompts. FACET-VLM introduces three key
components: Cross-View Semantic Aggregation (CVSA) for view-consistent fusion,
Multiview Text-Guided Fusion (MTGF) for semantically aligned facial emotions,
and a multiview consistency loss to enforce structural coherence across views.
Our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across multiple benchmarks,
including BU-3DFE, Bosphorus, BU-4DFE, and BP4D-Spontaneous. We further extend
FACET-VLM to 4D micro-expression recognition (MER) on the 4DME dataset,
demonstrating strong performance in capturing subtle, short-lived emotional
cues. The extensive experimental results confirm the effectiveness and
substantial contributions of each individual component within the framework.
Overall, FACET-VLM offers a robust, extensible, and high-performing solution
for multimodal FER in both posed and spontaneous settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖预先定义的类别数量，难以处理真实数据的复杂性和变异性。

Method: 提出AdaGCD框架，结合自适应槽注意力（AdaSlot）动态确定最优槽数量，实现灵活聚类。

Result: 在公开和细粒度数据集上的实验验证了AdaGCD的有效性，尤其在利用空间局部信息方面表现突出。

Conclusion: AdaGCD通过动态槽分配和自适应表示，显著提升了开放世界场景下的类别发现能力。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) tackles the challenging problem of
categorizing unlabeled images into both known and novel classes within a
partially labeled dataset, without prior knowledge of the number of unknown
categories. Traditional methods often rely on rigid assumptions, such as
predefining the number of classes, which limits their ability to handle the
inherent variability and complexity of real-world data. To address these
shortcomings, we propose AdaGCD, a cluster-centric contrastive learning
framework that incorporates Adaptive Slot Attention (AdaSlot) into the GCD
framework. AdaSlot dynamically determines the optimal number of slots based on
data complexity, removing the need for predefined slot counts. This adaptive
mechanism facilitates the flexible clustering of unlabeled data into known and
novel categories by dynamically allocating representational capacity. By
integrating adaptive representation with dynamic slot allocation, our method
captures both instance-specific and spatially clustered features, improving
class discovery in open-world scenarios. Extensive experiments on public and
fine-grained datasets validate the effectiveness of our framework, emphasizing
the advantages of leveraging spatial local information for category discovery
in unlabeled image datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统小波去噪方法在提取传感器模式噪声（SPN）时需要反演步骤，效率较低。

Method: 将指纹构造为小波域指纹，直接在频域进行比较，避免反演步骤。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法检测精度更高，处理速度显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法简化了提取和比较流程，具有更高的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Camera fingerprint detection plays a crucial role in source identification
and image forensics, with wavelet denoising approaches proving to be
particularly effective in extracting sensor pattern noise (SPN). In this
article, we propose a modification to wavelet-based SPN extraction. Rather than
constructing the fingerprint as an image, we introduce the notion of a wavelet
domain fingerprint. This avoids the final inversion step of the denoising
algorithm and allows fingerprint comparisons to be made directly in the wavelet
domain. As such, our modification streamlines the extraction and comparison
process. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method not only achieves higher detection accuracy but can also significantly
improve processing speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用硬伪标签无法表示类别不确定性或错误，因此提出软自标记以改进网络训练。

Method: 提出了一种原则性的辅助损失，系统评估了标准和新CRF松弛（凸和非凸）、邻域系统，以及网络预测与软伪标签的连接项，并提出了一种通用的连续子问题求解器。

Result: 软自标记方法显著提升了基于涂鸦标签的训练效果，甚至优于完全像素级监督的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于弱监督分割，其通用性还可推广到其他弱监督问题/系统。

Abstract: We consider weakly supervised segmentation where only a fraction of pixels
have ground truth labels (scribbles) and focus on a self-labeling approach
optimizing relaxations of the standard unsupervised CRF/Potts loss on unlabeled
pixels. While WSSS methods can directly optimize such losses via gradient
descent, prior work suggests that higher-order optimization can improve network
training by introducing hidden pseudo-labels and powerful CRF sub-problem
solvers, e.g. graph cut. However, previously used hard pseudo-labels can not
represent class uncertainty or errors, which motivates soft self-labeling. We
derive a principled auxiliary loss and systematically evaluate standard and new
CRF relaxations (convex and non-convex), neighborhood systems, and terms
connecting network predictions with soft pseudo-labels. We also propose a
general continuous sub-problem solver. Using only standard architectures, soft
self-labeling consistently improves scribble-based training and outperforms
significantly more complex specialized WSSS systems. It can outperform full
pixel-precise supervision. Our general ideas apply to other weakly-supervised
problems/systems.

Result: 发现稀疏模型在特定条件下（甜点）表现出更高的可解释性、下游泛化能力和人类对齐性，但效果因网络架构和规模而异。

Conclusion: 研究表明剪枝与视觉表示之间存在复杂关系，需进一步研究剪枝何时及如何对视觉表示有益。

Abstract: Pruning is widely used to reduce the complexity of deep learning models, but
its effects on interpretability and representation learning remain poorly
understood. This paper investigates how pruning influences vision models across
three key dimensions: (i) interpretability, (ii) unsupervised object discovery,
and (iii) alignment with human perception. We first analyze different vision
network architectures to examine how varying sparsity levels affect feature
attribution interpretability methods. Additionally, we explore whether pruning
promotes more succinct and structured representations, potentially improving
unsupervised object discovery by discarding redundant information while
preserving essential features. Finally, we assess whether pruning enhances the
alignment between model representations and human perception, investigating
whether sparser models focus on more discriminative features similarly to
humans. Our findings also reveal the presence of sweet spots, where sparse
models exhibit higher interpretability, downstream generalization and human
alignment. However, these spots highly depend on the network architectures and
their size in terms of trainable parameters. Our results suggest a complex
interplay between these three dimensions, highlighting the importance of
investigating when and how pruning benefits vision representations.

Result: 实验表明，该方法提升了交互生成质量，并提供了可行的评估指标。

Conclusion: HOI-Dyn框架有效解决了3D人-物交互生成的挑战，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Generating realistic 3D human-object interactions (HOIs) remains a
challenging task due to the difficulty of modeling detailed interaction
dynamics. Existing methods treat human and object motions independently,
resulting in physically implausible and causally inconsistent behaviors. In
this work, we present HOI-Dyn, a novel framework that formulates HOI generation
as a driver-responder system, where human actions drive object responses. At
the core of our method is a lightweight transformer-based interaction dynamics
model that explicitly predicts how objects should react to human motion. To
further enforce consistency, we introduce a residual-based dynamics loss that
mitigates the impact of dynamics prediction errors and prevents misleading
optimization signals. The dynamics model is used only during training,
preserving inference efficiency. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments, we demonstrate that our approach not only enhances the quality of
HOI generation but also establishes a feasible metric for evaluating the
quality of generated interactions.

Result: DeRIS在非和多目标场景中表现优异，无需专门架构调整。

Conclusion: DeRIS通过模块化设计和协同机制有效提升RIS性能，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) is a challenging task that aims to segment
objects in an image based on natural language expressions. While prior studies
have predominantly concentrated on improving vision-language interactions and
achieving fine-grained localization, a systematic analysis of the fundamental
bottlenecks in existing RIS frameworks remains underexplored. To bridge this
gap, we propose DeRIS, a novel framework that decomposes RIS into two key
components: perception and cognition. This modular decomposition facilitates a
systematic analysis of the primary bottlenecks impeding RIS performance. Our
findings reveal that the predominant limitation lies not in perceptual
deficiencies, but in the insufficient multi-modal cognitive capacity of current
models. To mitigate this, we propose a Loopback Synergy mechanism, which
enhances the synergy between the perception and cognition modules, thereby
enabling precise segmentation while simultaneously improving robust image-text
comprehension. Additionally, we analyze and introduce a simple non-referent
sample conversion data augmentation to address the long-tail distribution issue
related to target existence judgement in general scenarios. Notably, DeRIS
demonstrates inherent adaptability to both non- and multi-referents scenarios
without requiring specialized architectural modifications, enhancing its
general applicability. The codes and models are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于Vision Transformers（ViTs）的3D医学图像分割方法，通过自监督预训练（MAE框架）和微调，显著提升了颅内动脉钙化（IAC）分割的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D ViTs在医学图像分割中表现不佳，但因其自监督训练的高效性，适合处理大体积医学图像数据。IAC作为神经血管疾病的生物标志物，其自动化量化对大规模风险评估具有重要意义。

Method: 使用MAE框架预训练ViTs，并在IST-3临床试验的异构数据上微调模型，用于IAC分割。研究了低patch大小和插值上采样对性能的影响。

Result: 自监督ViT在Dice分数上比监督nnU-Net基线高3.2分；低patch大小和插值上采样效果更优；模型对高切片厚度更具鲁棒性，临床风险分类提升46%。

Conclusion: 自监督ViTs在IAC分割中表现优异，为医学图像分析提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained significant popularity in the natural
image domain but have been less successful in 3D medical image segmentation.
Nevertheless, 3D ViTs are particularly interesting for large medical imaging
volumes due to their efficient self-supervised training within the masked
autoencoder (MAE) framework, which enables the use of imaging data without the
need for expensive manual annotations. intracranial arterial calcification
(IAC) is an imaging biomarker visible on routinely acquired CT scans linked to
neurovascular diseases such as stroke and dementia, and automated IAC
quantification could enable their large-scale risk assessment. We pre-train
ViTs with MAE and fine-tune them for IAC segmentation for the first time. To
develop our models, we use highly heterogeneous data from a large clinical
trial, the third International Stroke Trial (IST-3). We evaluate key aspects of
MAE pre-trained ViTs in IAC segmentation, and analyse the clinical
implications. We show: 1) our calibrated self-supervised ViT beats a strong
supervised nnU-Net baseline by 3.2 Dice points, 2) low patch sizes are crucial
for ViTs for IAC segmentation and interpolation upsampling with regular
convolutions is preferable to transposed convolutions for ViT-based models, and
3) our ViTs increase robustness to higher slice thicknesses and improve risk
group classification in a clinical scenario by 46%. Our code is available
online.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冰川冰量损失加剧，需精确监测崩解前沿以理解崩解过程，但现有基于ImageNet预训练的模型因领域差异表现不佳。

Method: 提出两种自监督预训练技术，利用新数据集SSL4SAR，并设计Swin Transformer编码器与残差CNN解码器的混合架构。

Result: 在CaFFe基准数据集上平均距离误差293米，优于之前最佳模型67米；集成模型误差75米，接近人类水平38米。

Conclusion: 新方法显著提升冰川崩解前沿监测精度，为季节性变化提供更可靠数据。

Abstract: Glaciers are losing ice mass at unprecedented rates, increasing the need for
accurate, year-round monitoring to understand frontal ablation, particularly
the factors driving the calving process. Deep learning models can extract
calving front positions from Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery to track seasonal
ice losses at the calving fronts of marine- and lake-terminating glaciers. The
current state-of-the-art model relies on ImageNet-pretrained weights. However,
they are suboptimal due to the domain shift between the natural images in
ImageNet and the specialized characteristics of remote sensing imagery, in
particular for Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery. To address this challenge, we
propose two novel self-supervised multimodal pretraining techniques that
leverage SSL4SAR, a new unlabeled dataset comprising 9,563 Sentinel-1 and 14
Sentinel-2 images of Arctic glaciers, with one optical image per glacier in the
dataset. Additionally, we introduce a novel hybrid model architecture that
combines a Swin Transformer encoder with a residual Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) decoder. When pretrained on SSL4SAR, this model achieves a mean
distance error of 293 m on the "CAlving Fronts and where to Find thEm" (CaFFe)
benchmark dataset, outperforming the prior best model by 67 m. Evaluating an
ensemble of the proposed model on a multi-annotator study of the benchmark
dataset reveals a mean distance error of 75 m, approaching the human
performance of 38 m. This advancement enables precise monitoring of seasonal
changes in glacier calving fronts.

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256生成任务上，DisCon的gFID得分为1.38，优于现有自回归方法。

Conclusion: DisCon通过结合离散和连续表示的优势，有效提升了图像生成的质量和效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have spurred interests in
encoding images as discrete tokens and leveraging autoregressive (AR)
frameworks for visual generation. However, the quantization process in AR-based
visual generation models inherently introduces information loss that degrades
image fidelity. To mitigate this limitation, recent studies have explored to
autoregressively predict continuous tokens. Unlike discrete tokens that reside
in a structured and bounded space, continuous representations exist in an
unbounded, high-dimensional space, making density estimation more challenging
and increasing the risk of generating out-of-distribution artifacts. Based on
the above findings, this work introduces DisCon (Discrete-Conditioned
Continuous Autoregressive Model), a novel framework that reinterprets discrete
tokens as conditional signals rather than generation targets. By modeling the
conditional probability of continuous representations conditioned on discrete
tokens, DisCon circumvents the optimization challenges of continuous token
modeling while avoiding the information loss caused by quantization. DisCon
achieves a gFID score of 1.38 on ImageNet 256$\times$256 generation,
outperforming state-of-the-art autoregressive approaches by a clear margin.

Result: 实验表明，SGP显著提升了攻击成功率，平均提高2.3%至32.6%。

Conclusion: SGP是一种高扩展性的输入变换方法，可轻松集成到现有攻击中，有效增强对抗样本的迁移性。

Abstract: The transferability of adversarial examples poses a significant security
challenge for deep neural networks, which can be attacked without knowing
anything about them. In this paper, we propose a new Segmented Gaussian Pyramid
(SGP) attack method to enhance the transferability, particularly against
defense models. Unlike existing methods that generally focus on single-scale
images, our approach employs Gaussian filtering and three types of downsampling
to construct a series of multi-scale examples. Then, the gradients of the loss
function with respect to each scale are computed, and their average is used to
determine the adversarial perturbations. The proposed SGP can be considered an
input transformation with high extensibility that is easily integrated into
most existing adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that in
contrast to the state-of-the-art methods, SGP significantly enhances attack
success rates against black-box defense models, with average attack success
rates increasing by 2.3% to 32.6%, based only on transferability.

Motivation: 现有方法在多主题个性化时需复杂调整或联合优化，FreeLoRA旨在简化这一过程。

Result: 实验表明FreeLoRA在主题保真度和提示一致性上表现优异。

Conclusion: FreeLoRA提供了一种简单且通用的多主题个性化解决方案。

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation plays a crucial role in applications such as
virtual try-on and poster design. Existing approaches typically fine-tune
pretrained generative models or apply LoRA-based adaptations for individual
subjects. However, these methods struggle with multi-subject personalization,
as combining independently adapted modules often requires complex re-tuning or
joint optimization. We present FreeLoRA, a simple and generalizable framework
that enables training-free fusion of subject-specific LoRA modules for
multi-subject personalization. Each LoRA module is adapted on a few images of a
specific subject using a Full Token Tuning strategy, where it is applied across
all tokens in the prompt to encourage weakly supervised token-content
alignment. At inference, we adopt Subject-Aware Inference, activating each
module only on its corresponding subject tokens. This enables training-free
fusion of multiple personalized subjects within a single image, while
mitigating overfitting and mutual interference between subjects. Extensive
experiments show that FreeLoRA achieves strong performance in both subject
fidelity and prompt consistency.

Conclusion: HCNQA通过分层监督优化了3D VQA模型的推理路径，提升了性能。

Abstract: 3D Visual Question-Answering (3D VQA) is pivotal for models to perceive the
physical world and perform spatial reasoning. Answer-centric supervision is a
commonly used training method for 3D VQA models. Many models that utilize this
strategy have achieved promising results in 3D VQA tasks. However, the
answer-centric approach only supervises the final output of models and allows
models to develop reasoning pathways freely. The absence of supervision on the
reasoning pathway enables the potential for developing superficial shortcuts
through common patterns in question-answer pairs. Moreover, although
slow-thinking methods advance large language models, they suffer from
underthinking. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{HCNQA}, a 3D VQA
model leveraging a hierarchical concentration narrowing supervision method. By
mimicking the human process of gradually focusing from a broad area to specific
objects while searching for answers, our method guides the model to perform
three phases of concentration narrowing through hierarchical supervision. By
supervising key checkpoints on a general reasoning pathway, our method can
ensure the development of a rational and effective reasoning pathway. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively ensure that
the model develops a rational reasoning pathway and performs better. The code
is available at https://github.com/JianuoZhu/HCNQA.

distributions, tail data in natural datasets often represents more complex and
hazardous scenarios. Existing studies typically rely solely on a base model's
prediction error, without considering the diversity and uncertainty of
long-tail trajectory patterns. We propose an adaptive momentum and decoupled
contrastive learning framework (AMD), which integrates unsupervised and
supervised contrastive learning strategies. By leveraging an improved momentum
contrast learning (MoCo-DT) and decoupled contrastive learning (DCL) module,
our framework enhances the model's ability to recognize rare and complex
trajectories. Additionally, we design four types of trajectory random
augmentation methods and introduce an online iterative clustering strategy,
allowing the model to dynamically update pseudo-labels and better adapt to the
distributional shifts in long-tail data. We propose three different criteria to
define long-tail trajectories and conduct extensive comparative experiments on
the nuScenes and ETH$/$UCY datasets. The results show that AMD not only
achieves optimal performance in long-tail trajectory prediction but also
demonstrates outstanding overall prediction accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多图像的超光谱重建框架（MI-HSR），利用配备光谱滤镜的三摄像头智能手机系统，显著提升了重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖单张RGB图像，导致光谱信息重建精度受限。

Method: 采用三摄像头系统，其中两个镜头配备特定光谱滤镜，结合理论和实证分析，提出MI-HSR框架。

Result: 在新数据集Doomer上，模型性能优于现有方法，光谱估计精度提升30%。

Conclusion: 多视角光谱滤镜结合消费级硬件可实现更准确、实用的超光谱成像。

Abstract: Hyperspectral reconstruction (HSR) from RGB images is a fundamentally
ill-posed problem due to severe spectral information loss. Existing approaches
typically rely on a single RGB image, limiting reconstruction accuracy. In this
work, we propose a novel multi-image-to-hyperspectral reconstruction (MI-HSR)
framework that leverages a triple-camera smartphone system, where two lenses
are equipped with carefully selected spectral filters. Our configuration,
grounded in theoretical and empirical analysis, enables richer and more diverse
spectral observations than conventional single-camera setups. To support this
new paradigm, we introduce Doomer, the first dataset for MI-HSR, comprising
aligned images from three smartphone cameras and a hyperspectral reference
camera across diverse scenes. We show that the proposed HSR model achieves
consistent improvements over existing methods on the newly proposed benchmark.
In a nutshell, our setup allows 30% towards more accurately estimated spectra
compared to an ordinary RGB camera. Our findings suggest that multi-view
spectral filtering with commodity hardware can unlock more accurate and
practical hyperspectral imaging solutions.

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep neural networks have driven significant progress
in image enhancement (IE). However, deploying deep learning models on
resource-constrained platforms, such as mobile devices, remains challenging due
to high computation and memory demands. To address these challenges and
facilitate real-time IE on mobile, we introduce an extremely lightweight
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) framework with around 4K parameters. Our
approach integrates reparameterization with an Incremental Weight Optimization
strategy to ensure efficiency. Additionally, we enhance performance with a
Feature Self-Transform module and a Hierarchical Dual-Path Attention mechanism,
optimized with a Local Variance-Weighted loss. With this efficient framework,
we are the first to achieve real-time IE inference at up to 1,100 frames per
second (FPS) while delivering competitive image quality, achieving the best
trade-off between speed and performance across multiple IE tasks. The code will
be available at https://github.com/AVC2-UESTC/MobileIE.git.

Motivation: 现实世界中的异构场景（如手术视频）难以解析为有意义的一组槽，现有方法在手术视频上表现不佳。

Method: 提出动态时序槽变换器（DTST）模块，结合时序推理和预测未来最优槽初始化进行训练。

Result: 在多个手术数据库中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 无监督对象中心方法可应用于现实世界数据，并成为医疗应用中的常见工具。

Abstract: Object-centric slot attention is an emerging paradigm for unsupervised
learning of structured, interpretable object-centric representations (slots).
This enables effective reasoning about objects and events at a low
computational cost and is thus applicable to critical healthcare applications,
such as real-time interpretation of surgical video. The heterogeneous scenes in
real-world applications like surgery are, however, difficult to parse into a
meaningful set of slots. Current approaches with an adaptive slot count perform
well on images, but their performance on surgical videos is low. To address
this challenge, we propose a dynamic temporal slot transformer (DTST) module
that is trained both for temporal reasoning and for predicting the optimal
future slot initialization. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
multiple surgical databases, demonstrating that unsupervised object-centric
methods can be applied to real-world data and become part of the common arsenal
in healthcare applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SPRED的新框架，用于解决半监督终身行人重识别（Semi-LReID）问题，通过动态原型引导的伪标签生成和新旧知识协同净化，显著提升了未标记数据的利用效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中标注资源有限，现有LReID方法在未标记数据利用时性能下降严重，亟需一种能有效处理噪声知识的半监督方法。

Method: SPRED框架通过动态原型生成高质量伪标签，并利用双知识合作方案（当前模型专业化和历史模型泛化）净化噪声伪标签，形成自增强循环。

Result: 在Semi-LReID基准测试中，SPRED取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SPRED通过自增强循环设计显著提升了半监督终身行人重识别的性能，为未标记数据的高效利用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Current lifelong person re-identification (LReID) methods predominantly rely
on fully labeled data streams. However, in real-world scenarios where
annotation resources are limited, a vast amount of unlabeled data coexists with
scarce labeled samples, leading to the Semi-Supervised LReID (Semi-LReID)
problem where LReID methods suffer severe performance degradation. Existing
LReID methods, even when combined with semi-supervised strategies, suffer from
limited long-term adaptation performance due to struggling with the noisy
knowledge occurring during unlabeled data utilization. In this paper, we
pioneer the investigation of Semi-LReID, introducing a novel Self-Reinforcing
Prototype Evolution with Dual-Knowledge Cooperation framework (SPRED). Our key
innovation lies in establishing a self-reinforcing cycle between dynamic
prototype-guided pseudo-label generation and new-old knowledge collaborative
purification to enhance the utilization of unlabeled data. Specifically,
learnable identity prototypes are introduced to dynamically capture the
identity distributions and generate high-quality pseudo-labels. Then, the
dual-knowledge cooperation scheme integrates current model specialization and
historical model generalization, refining noisy pseudo-labels. Through this
cyclic design, reliable pseudo-labels are progressively mined to improve
current-stage learning and ensure positive knowledge propagation over long-term
learning. Experiments on the established Semi-LReID benchmarks show that our
SPRED achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our source code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出Reason50K数据集和ReasonBrain框架，用于解决复杂假设性指令的图像编辑问题，通过多模态大语言模型和扩散模型实现推理和编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以处理复杂隐式假设性指令，缺乏支持推理的数据集和细粒度细节提取机制。

Method: 提出Reason50K数据集和ReasonBrain框架，结合MLLM和扩散模型，引入FRCE模块和CME增强器。

Result: ReasonBrain在推理场景中优于现有方法，并展示出对传统IIE任务的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: Reason50K和ReasonBrain为复杂指令推理图像编辑提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing (IIE) has advanced rapidly with the success
of diffusion models. However, existing efforts primarily focus on simple and
explicit instructions to execute editing operations such as adding, deleting,
moving, or swapping objects. They struggle to handle more complex implicit
hypothetical instructions that require deeper reasoning to infer plausible
visual changes and user intent. Additionally, current datasets provide limited
support for training and evaluating reasoning-aware editing capabilities.
Architecturally, these methods also lack mechanisms for fine-grained detail
extraction that support such reasoning. To address these limitations, we
propose Reason50K, a large-scale dataset specifically curated for training and
evaluating hypothetical instruction reasoning image editing, along with
ReasonBrain, a novel framework designed to reason over and execute implicit
hypothetical instructions across diverse scenarios. Reason50K includes over 50K
samples spanning four key reasoning scenarios: Physical, Temporal, Causal, and
Story reasoning. ReasonBrain leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
for editing guidance generation and a diffusion model for image synthesis,
incorporating a Fine-grained Reasoning Cue Extraction (FRCE) module to capture
detailed visual and textual semantics essential for supporting instruction
reasoning. To mitigate the semantic loss, we further introduce a Cross-Modal
Enhancer (CME) that enables rich interactions between the fine-grained cues and
MLLM-derived features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReasonBrain
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on reasoning scenarios
while exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization to conventional IIE tasks. Our
dataset and code will be released publicly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床实施DIR需要基于体素的空间准确性指标，但胃肠道器官的高运动性使得手动标记点难以实现。因此，研究旨在通过DT模型解决这一问题。

Method: 通过半自动化管道，从静态3D患者扫描生成21个模拟消化GI运动的4D序列，并利用这些DT评估六种DIR方法的性能。

Result: DT模型成功模拟了真实的GI运动，运动幅度与真实患者数据相似，并提供了详细的DIR性能指标和剂量映射验证。

Conclusion: 该管道为动态复杂解剖区域的DIR工具提供了严格的测试方法，支持空间和剂量精度的详细评估。

Abstract: Objective: Clinical implementation of deformable image registration (DIR)
requires voxel-based spatial accuracy metrics such as manually identified
landmarks, which are challenging to implement for highly mobile
gastrointestinal (GI) organs. To address this, patient-specific digital twins
(DT) modeling temporally varying motion were created to assess the accuracy of
DIR methods. Approach: 21 motion phases simulating digestive GI motion as 4D
sequences were generated from static 3D patient scans using published
analytical GI motion models through a semi-automated pipeline. Eleven datasets,
including six T2w FSE MRI (T2w MRI), two T1w 4D golden-angle stack-of-stars,
and three contrast-enhanced CT scans. The motion amplitudes of the DTs were
assessed against real patient stomach motion amplitudes extracted from
independent 4D MRI datasets. The generated DTs were then used to assess six
different DIR methods using target registration error, Dice similarity
coefficient, and the 95th percentile Hausdorff distance using summary metrics
and voxel-level granular visualizations. Finally, for a subset of T2w MRI scans
from patients treated with MR-guided radiation therapy, dose distributions were
warped and accumulated to assess dose warping errors, including evaluations of
DIR performance in both low- and high-dose regions for patient-specific error
estimation. Main results: Our proposed pipeline synthesized DTs modeling
realistic GI motion, achieving mean and maximum motion amplitudes and a mean
log Jacobian determinant within 0.8 mm and 0.01, respectively, similar to
published real-patient gastric motion data. It also enables the extraction of
detailed quantitative DIR performance metrics and rigorous validation of dose
mapping accuracy. Significance: The pipeline enables rigorously testing DIR
tools for dynamic, anatomically complex regions enabling granular spatial and
dosimetric accuracies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种信息融合框架，结合多季节结构数据，支持果园机器人自动化管理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 果园自动化中，茂密树叶遮挡树结构，限制了机器视觉系统的能力，而休眠季节树结构更清晰可见。

Method: 使用YOLOv9-Seg进行实例分割，Kinect Fusion进行3D重建，Fast GICP进行模型对齐，融合休眠期和生长期数据。

Result: YOLOv9-Seg在休眠期数据集上表现优异，Kinect Fusion和Fast GICP实现了高精度重建与对齐。

Conclusion: 该框架为机器人系统提供了被遮挡的结构信息，提升了果园自动化操作的精度。

Abstract: In orchard automation, dense foliage during the canopy season severely
occludes tree structures, minimizing visibility to various canopy parts such as
trunks and branches, which limits the ability of a machine vision system.
However, canopy structure is more open and visible during the dormant season
when trees are defoliated. In this work, we present an information fusion
framework that integrates multi-seasonal structural data to support robotic and
automated crop load management during the entire growing season. The framework
combines high-resolution RGB-D imagery from both dormant and canopy periods
using YOLOv9-Seg for instance segmentation, Kinect Fusion for 3D
reconstruction, and Fast Generalized Iterative Closest Point (Fast GICP) for
model alignment. Segmentation outputs from YOLOv9-Seg were used to extract
depth-informed masks, which enabled accurate 3D point cloud reconstruction via
Kinect Fusion; these reconstructed models from each season were subsequently
aligned using Fast GICP to achieve spatially coherent multi-season fusion. The
YOLOv9-Seg model, trained on manually annotated images, achieved a mean squared
error (MSE) of 0.0047 and segmentation mAP@50 scores up to 0.78 for trunks in
dormant season dataset. Kinect Fusion enabled accurate reconstruction of tree
geometry, validated with field measurements resulting in root mean square
errors (RMSE) of 5.23 mm for trunk diameter, 4.50 mm for branch diameter, and
13.72 mm for branch spacing. Fast GICP achieved precise cross-seasonal
registration with a minimum fitness score of 0.00197, allowing integrated,
comprehensive tree structure modeling despite heavy occlusions during the
growing season. This fused structural representation enables robotic systems to
access otherwise obscured architectural information, improving the precision of
pruning, thinning, and other automated orchard operations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像定制方法缺乏通用框架，限制了多样化应用，IC-Custom旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出IC-Custom框架，结合多模态注意力机制和任务导向的注册令牌，支持多种任务类型。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，人类偏好提升73%，仅需训练0.4%的模型参数。

Conclusion: IC-Custom为工业应用提供了高效、通用的图像定制解决方案。

Abstract: Image customization, a crucial technique for industrial media production,
aims to generate content that is consistent with reference images. However,
current approaches conventionally separate image customization into
position-aware and position-free customization paradigms and lack a universal
framework for diverse customization, limiting their applications across various
scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose IC-Custom, a unified
framework that seamlessly integrates position-aware and position-free image
customization through in-context learning. IC-Custom concatenates reference
images with target images to a polyptych, leveraging DiT's multi-modal
attention mechanism for fine-grained token-level interactions. We introduce the
In-context Multi-Modal Attention (ICMA) mechanism with learnable task-oriented
register tokens and boundary-aware positional embeddings to enable the model to
correctly handle different task types and distinguish various inputs in
polyptych configurations. To bridge the data gap, we carefully curated a
high-quality dataset of 12k identity-consistent samples with 8k from real-world
sources and 4k from high-quality synthetic data, avoiding the overly glossy and
over-saturated synthetic appearance. IC-Custom supports various industrial
applications, including try-on, accessory placement, furniture arrangement, and
creative IP customization. Extensive evaluations on our proposed ProductBench
and the publicly available DreamBench demonstrate that IC-Custom significantly
outperforms community workflows, closed-source models, and state-of-the-art
open-source approaches. IC-Custom achieves approximately 73% higher human
preference across identity consistency, harmonicity, and text alignment
metrics, while training only 0.4% of the original model parameters. Project

Result: 在ImageNet分类任务中表现优异，同时在多个视频数据集上显著降低计算成本，保持输出一致性。

Conclusion: evMLP通过事件驱动机制有效提升了计算效率，为视觉模型架构研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable results in computer vision
tasks. In the early days, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were the
mainstream architecture. In recent years, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have
become increasingly popular. In addition, exploring applications of multi-layer
perceptrons (MLPs) has provided new perspectives for research into vision model
architectures. In this paper, we present evMLP accompanied by a simple
event-driven local update mechanism. The proposed evMLP can independently
process patches on images or feature maps via MLPs. We define changes between
consecutive frames as "events". Under the event-driven local update mechanism,
evMLP selectively processes patches where events occur. For sequential image
data (e.g., video processing), this approach improves computational performance
by avoiding redundant computations. Through ImageNet image classification
experiments, evMLP attains accuracy competitive with state-of-the-art models.
More significantly, experimental results on multiple video datasets demonstrate
that evMLP reduces computational cost via its event-driven local update
mechanism while maintaining output consistency with its non-event-driven
baseline. The code and trained models are available at

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation has recently attracted considerable attention,
resulting in the development of numerous high-quality datasets that have
propelled progress in this area. However, existing public datasets are
primarily composed of isolated text-video (T-V) pairs and thus fail to support
the modeling of coherent multi-clip video sequences. To address this
limitation, we introduce CI-VID, a dataset that moves beyond isolated
text-to-video (T2V) generation toward text-and-video-to-video (TV2V)
generation, enabling models to produce coherent, multi-scene video sequences.
CI-VID contains over 340,000 samples, each featuring a coherent sequence of
video clips with text captions that capture both the individual content of each
clip and the transitions between them, enabling visually and textually grounded
generation. To further validate the effectiveness of CI-VID, we design a
comprehensive, multi-dimensional benchmark incorporating human evaluation,
VLM-based assessment, and similarity-based metrics. Experimental results
demonstrate that models trained on CI-VID exhibit significant improvements in
both accuracy and content consistency when generating video sequences. This
facilitates the creation of story-driven content with smooth visual transitions
and strong temporal coherence, underscoring the quality and practical utility
of the CI-VID dataset We release the CI-VID dataset and the accompanying code

Result: 在短时（14帧）和长时（平均500帧）动画上验证了LongAnimation在保持色彩一致性方面的有效性。

Conclusion: LongAnimation通过动态全局-局部范式成功解决了长动画色彩一致性问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Animation colorization is a crucial part of real animation industry
production. Long animation colorization has high labor costs. Therefore,
automated long animation colorization based on the video generation model has
significant research value. Existing studies are limited to short-term
colorization. These studies adopt a local paradigm, fusing overlapping features
to achieve smooth transitions between local segments. However, the local
paradigm neglects global information, failing to maintain long-term color
consistency. In this study, we argue that ideal long-term color consistency can
be achieved through a dynamic global-local paradigm, i.e., dynamically
extracting global color-consistent features relevant to the current generation.
Specifically, we propose LongAnimation, a novel framework, which mainly
includes a SketchDiT, a Dynamic Global-Local Memory (DGLM), and a Color
Consistency Reward. The SketchDiT captures hybrid reference features to support
the DGLM module. The DGLM module employs a long video understanding model to
dynamically compress global historical features and adaptively fuse them with
the current generation features. To refine the color consistency, we introduce
a Color Consistency Reward. During inference, we propose a color consistency
fusion to smooth the video segment transition. Extensive experiments on both
short-term (14 frames) and long-term (average 500 frames) animations show the
effectiveness of LongAnimation in maintaining short-term and long-term color
consistency for open-domain animation colorization task. The code can be found

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities on static images, they often fall short in comprehending dynamic,
information-dense short-form videos, a dominant medium in today's digital
landscape. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{Kwai Keye-VL}, an
8-billion-parameter multimodal foundation model engineered for leading-edge
performance in short-video understanding while maintaining robust
general-purpose vision-language abilities. The development of Keye-VL rests on
two core pillars: a massive, high-quality dataset exceeding 600 billion tokens
with a strong emphasis on video, and an innovative training recipe. This recipe
features a four-stage pre-training process for solid vision-language alignment,
followed by a meticulous two-phase post-training process. The first
post-training stage enhances foundational capabilities like instruction
following, while the second phase focuses on stimulating advanced reasoning. In
this second phase, a key innovation is our five-mode ``cold-start'' data
mixture, which includes ``thinking'', ``non-thinking'', ``auto-think'', ``think
with image'', and high-quality video data. This mixture teaches the model to
decide when and how to reason. Subsequent reinforcement learning (RL) and
alignment steps further enhance these reasoning capabilities and correct
abnormal model behaviors, such as repetitive outputs. To validate our approach,
we conduct extensive evaluations, showing that Keye-VL achieves
state-of-the-art results on public video benchmarks and remains highly
competitive on general image-based tasks (Figure 1). Furthermore, we develop
and release the \textbf{KC-MMBench}, a new benchmark tailored for real-world
short-video scenarios, where Keye-VL shows a significant advantage.

high-fidelity image morphing without requiring per-instance training. Despite
their efficiency and potential, tuning-free methods face challenges in
maintaining high-quality results due to the non-linear nature of the multi-step
denoising process and biases inherited from the pre-trained diffusion model. In
this paper, we introduce FreeMorph to address these challenges by integrating
two key innovations. 1) We first propose a guidance-aware spherical
interpolation design that incorporates explicit guidance from the input images
by modifying the self-attention modules, thereby addressing identity loss and
ensuring directional transitions throughout the generated sequence. 2) We
further introduce a step-oriented variation trend that blends self-attention
modules derived from each input image to achieve controlled and consistent
transitions that respect both inputs. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate
that FreeMorph outperforms existing methods, being 10x ~ 50x faster and
establishing a new state-of-the-art for image morphing.

### [89] [A LoD of Gaussians: Unified Training and Rendering for Ultra-Large Scale Reconstruction with External Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01110)
*Felix Windisch,Lukas Radl,Thomas Köhler,Michael Steiner,Dieter Schmalstieg,Markus Steinberger*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为'A LoD of Gaussians'的框架，用于在单个消费级GPU上训练和渲染超大规模高斯场景，无需分区。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有高斯泼溅技术在扩展到大场景时的分区问题，如边界伪影、训练复杂性和GPU内存限制。

Method: 采用层次化高斯与顺序点树结合的混合数据结构，动态流式传输相关高斯，并利用轻量级缓存和视图调度系统。

Result: 实现了无缝多尺度重建和复杂场景的交互式可视化，从宏观航拍到微观地面细节。

Conclusion: 该方法突破了GPU内存限制，支持单GPU上的大规模场景实时渲染。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a high-performance technique for novel view
synthesis, enabling real-time rendering and high-quality reconstruction of
small scenes. However, scaling to larger environments has so far relied on
partitioning the scene into chunks -- a strategy that introduces artifacts at
chunk boundaries, complicates training across varying scales, and is poorly
suited to unstructured scenarios such as city-scale flyovers combined with
street-level views. Moreover, rendering remains fundamentally limited by GPU
memory, as all visible chunks must reside in VRAM simultaneously. We introduce
A LoD of Gaussians, a framework for training and rendering ultra-large-scale
Gaussian scenes on a single consumer-grade GPU -- without partitioning. Our
method stores the full scene out-of-core (e.g., in CPU memory) and trains a
Level-of-Detail (LoD) representation directly, dynamically streaming only the
relevant Gaussians. A hybrid data structure combining Gaussian hierarchies with
Sequential Point Trees enables efficient, view-dependent LoD selection, while a
lightweight caching and view scheduling system exploits temporal coherence to
support real-time streaming and rendering. Together, these innovations enable
seamless multi-scale reconstruction and interactive visualization of complex
scenes -- from broad aerial views to fine-grained ground-level details.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: semisimp是一个半自动简化三维多边形模型的工具，允许用户干预简化过程以保留重要语义区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动简化技术成熟，但无法区分语义重要区域（如面部和肢体）或适应模型用途（如动画）的简化约束。

Method: 用户可调整简化顺序、重新定位顶点并传播到相邻细节层次，以及调整模型表面的分层分区以改进控制。

Result: 工具能够更好地保留语义重要区域，并适应特定用途的简化需求。

Conclusion: semisimp通过用户干预提供了更灵活的模型简化方法，优于纯自动技术。

Abstract: We present semisimp, a tool for semiautomatic simplification of three
dimensional polygonal models. Existing automatic simplification technology is
quite mature, but is not sensitive to the heightened importance of distinct
semantic model regions such as faces and limbs, nor to simplification
constraints imposed by model usage such as animation. semisimp allows users to
preserve such regions by intervening in the simplification process. Users can
manipulate the order in which basic simplifications are applied to redistribute
model detail, improve the simplified models themselves by repositioning
vertices with propagation to neighboring levels of detail, and adjust the
hierarchical partitioning of the model surface to segment simplification and
improve control of reordering and position propagation.

Motivation: 解决用户在沉浸式环境中导航和交互复杂网络结构时，局部与全局视图切换的挑战。

Method: 采用多焦点探针技术，允许用户实例化多个局部子图视图，同时保持与全局网络的链接，并通过视觉和触觉引导机制确保上下文一致性。

Result: 展示了该技术在网络数据编辑中的可用性。

Conclusion: 多焦点探针技术有效支持沉浸式环境中的多尺度网络数据交互与编辑。

Abstract: Immersive visualization of network data enables users to physically navigate
and interact with complex structures, but managing transitions between detailed
local (egocentric) views and global (exocentric) overviews remains a major
challenge. We present a multifocus probe technique for immersive environments
that allows users to instantiate multiple egocentric subgraph views while
maintaining persistent links to the global network context. Each probe acts as
a portable local focus, enabling fine-grained inspection and editing of distant
or occluded regions. Visual and haptic guidance mechanisms ensure context
preservation during multi-scale interaction. We demonstrate and discuss the
usability of our technique for the editing of network data.

*Imran Mirza,Cole Huang,Ishwara Vasista,Rohan Patil,Asli Akalin,Sean O'Brien,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MALIBU是一个新基准，用于评估基于LLM的多智能体系统中隐含的社会偏见和刻板印象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统可能强化LLM中的隐性偏见，引发公平性和代表性担忧。

Method: 通过场景化评估，AI模型在预设情境中完成任务，由多智能体评判系统分两阶段评分。

Result: 研究发现偏见缓解可能偏向边缘化群体而非真正中立，需更细致的检测和公平策略。

Conclusion: 需透明评估基准和平衡的公平策略，以减少多智能体系统中的偏见。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems, which consist of multiple AI models interacting within a
shared environment, are increasingly used for persona-based interactions.
However, if not carefully designed, these systems can reinforce implicit biases
in large language models (LLMs), raising concerns about fairness and equitable
representation. We present MALIBU, a novel benchmark developed to assess the
degree to which LLM-based multi-agent systems implicitly reinforce social
biases and stereotypes. MALIBU evaluates bias in LLM-based multi-agent systems
through scenario-based assessments. AI models complete tasks within predefined
contexts, and their responses undergo evaluation by an LLM-based multi-agent
judging system in two phases. In the first phase, judges score responses
labeled with specific demographic personas (e.g., gender, race, religion)
across four metrics. In the second phase, judges compare paired responses
assigned to different personas, scoring them and selecting the superior
response. Our study quantifies biases in LLM-generated outputs, revealing that
bias mitigation may favor marginalized personas over true neutrality,
emphasizing the need for nuanced detection, balanced fairness strategies, and
transparent evaluation benchmarks in multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于事件重叠的摘要质量评估方法，通过比较生成摘要、参考摘要和原文中的事件重叠来衡量摘要质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有摘要评估方法依赖人工参考摘要的相似性计算，但新闻摘要应反映事件信息，因此提出基于事件重叠的评估方法。

Method: 使用挪威语数据集，通过计算生成摘要、参考摘要和原文中的事件重叠来评估摘要质量。

Result: 实验表明该方法能更深入地分析摘要中的事件信息。

Conclusion: 基于事件重叠的评估方法为摘要质量提供了新的视角。

Abstract: An abstractive summary of a news article contains its most important
information in a condensed version. The evaluation of automatically generated
summaries by generative language models relies heavily on human-authored
summaries as gold references, by calculating overlapping units or similarity
scores. News articles report events, and ideally so should the summaries. In
this work, we propose to evaluate the quality of abstractive summaries by
calculating overlapping events between generated summaries, reference
summaries, and the original news articles. We experiment on a richly annotated
Norwegian dataset comprising both events annotations and summaries authored by
expert human annotators. Our approach provides more insight into the event
information contained in the summaries.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目的是揭示19世纪末至20世纪初瑞典百科全书地理条目的变化，反映当时全球政治和知识趋势的影响。

Method: 使用数字化文本，通过语义句子嵌入匹配条目，基于Transformer分类器提取地理条目并链接到Wikidata，分析地理趋势变化。

Result: 发现地理焦点从欧洲转向其他地区，反映了第一次世界大战和新势力崛起的影响。

Conclusion: 研究证实了全球事件对百科全书内容的影响，数据和方法开源可供进一步研究。

Abstract: The \textit{Nordisk familjebok} is a Swedish encyclopedia from the 19th and
20th centuries. It was written by a team of experts and aimed to be an
intellectual reference, stressing precision and accuracy. This encyclopedia had
four main editions remarkable by their size, ranging from 20 to 38 volumes. As
a consequence, the \textit{Nordisk familjebok} had a considerable influence in
universities, schools, the media, and society overall. As new editions were
released, the selection of entries and their content evolved, reflecting
intellectual changes in Sweden.
  In this paper, we used digitized versions from \textit{Project Runeberg}. We
first resegmented the raw text into entries and matched pairs of entries
between the first and second editions using semantic sentence embeddings. We
then extracted the geographical entries from both editions using a
transformer-based classifier and linked them to Wikidata. This enabled us to
identify geographic trends and possible shifts between the first and second
editions, written between 1876-1899 and 1904-1926, respectively.
  Interpreting the results, we observe a small but significant shift in
geographic focus away from Europe and towards North America, Africa, Asia,
Australia, and northern Scandinavia from the first to the second edition,
confirming the influence of the First World War and the rise of new powers. The
code and data are available on GitHub at

### [95] [MEGA: xLSTM with Multihead Exponential Gated Fusion for Precise Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01213)
*Adamu Lawan,Juhua Pu,Haruna Yunusa,Jawad Muhammad,Muhammad Lawan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于xLSTM和MEGA的新框架，用于提升Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis（ABSA）的性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ABSA方法在计算效率与高性能之间难以平衡，且缺乏全局上下文或依赖过多资源。xLSTM的潜力在ABSA中尚未被充分挖掘。

Method: 结合双向mLSTM架构和部分翻转反向流（PF-mLSTM），并引入多头交叉指数门控融合机制（MECGAF）以优化局部和全局依赖。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，MEGA框架表现优于现有方法，实现了更高的准确性和效率。

Conclusion: MEGA框架为ABSA任务提供了一种高效且高性能的解决方案，填补了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a critical Natural Language
Processing (NLP) task that extracts aspects from text and determines their
associated sentiments, enabling fine-grained analysis of user opinions.
Existing ABSA methods struggle to balance computational efficiency with high
performance: deep learning models often lack global context, transformers
demand significant computational resources, and Mamba-based approaches face
CUDA dependency and diminished local correlations. Recent advancements in
Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) models, particularly their efficient
modeling of long-range dependencies, have significantly advanced the NLP
community. However, their potential in ABSA remains untapped. To this end, we
propose xLSTM with Multihead Exponential Gated Fusion (MEGA), a novel framework
integrating a bi-directional mLSTM architecture with forward and partially
flipped backward (PF-mLSTM) streams. The PF-mLSTM enhances localized context
modeling by processing the initial sequence segment in reverse with dedicated
parameters, preserving critical short-range patterns. We further introduce an
mLSTM-based multihead cross exponential gated fusion mechanism (MECGAF) that
dynamically combines forward mLSTM outputs as query and key with PF-mLSTM
outputs as value, optimizing short-range dependency capture while maintaining
global context and efficiency. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets
demonstrate that MEGA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving
superior accuracy and efficiency in ABSA tasks.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种去偏算法，通过从编码器表示中移除观察到的混杂因素信息，显著减少了文本相似性度量中的偏差，且计算成本低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本序列的嵌入相似性度量可能受到无关混杂因素（如文本来源或语言）的影响，这对需要从不同语料库中汇集文本的应用尤其成问题。

Method: 采用去偏算法，从编码器表示中移除观察到的混杂因素信息。

Result: 在所有评估的嵌入变体和任务中，文档相似性和聚类指标均显著提升，且对分布外基准测试的性能无影响。

Conclusion: 去偏算法能有效减少偏差，且不损害嵌入的其他性能。

Abstract: Embedding-based similarity metrics between text sequences can be influenced
not just by the content dimensions we most care about, but can also be biased
by spurious attributes like the text's source or language. These document
confounders cause problems for many applications, but especially those that
need to pool texts from different corpora. This paper shows that a debiasing
algorithm that removes information about observed confounders from the encoder
representations substantially reduces these biases at a minimal computational
cost. Document similarity and clustering metrics improve across every embedding
variant and task we evaluate -- often dramatically. Interestingly, performance
on out-of-distribution benchmarks is not impacted, indicating that the
embeddings are not otherwise degraded.

Abstract: In this paper we discuss the capability of large language models to base
their answer and provide proper references when dealing with legal matters of
non-english and non-chinese speaking country. We discuss the history of legal
information retrieval, the difference between case law and statute law, its
impact on the legal tasks and analyze the latest research in this field. Basing
on that background we introduce gAIus, the architecture of the cognitive
LLM-based agent, whose responses are based on the knowledge retrieved from
certain legal act, which is Polish Civil Code. We propose a retrieval mechanism
which is more explainable, human-friendly and achieves better results than
embedding-based approaches. To evaluate our method we create special dataset
based on single-choice questions from entrance exams for law apprenticeships
conducted in Poland. The proposed architecture critically leveraged the
abilities of used large language models, improving the gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 by
419%, allowing it to beat gpt-4o and lifting gpt-4o-mini score from 31% to 86%.
At the end of our paper we show the possible future path of research and
potential applications of our findings.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（LLMs）在眼科中的应用潜力，特别是在糖尿病视网膜病变和青光眼的筛查中。

Method: 使用300张标注的眼底图像，通过结构化提示描述图像，评估GPT-4在ICDR严重程度评分、DR转诊建议和青光眼杯盘比估计中的表现。

Result: GPT-4在DR筛查中表现中等（准确率82.3%），但在青光眼筛查中表现不佳（准确率约78%）。元数据对结果无显著影响。

Conclusion: GPT-4可从结构化提示中模拟基本眼科决策，但复杂任务精度不足，不适合临床使用，可能用于教育或文档工作。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can simulate clinical reasoning based on natural
language prompts, but their utility in ophthalmology is largely unexplored.
This study evaluated GPT-4's ability to interpret structured textual
descriptions of retinal fundus photographs and simulate clinical decisions for
diabetic retinopathy (DR) and glaucoma screening, including the impact of
adding real or synthetic clinical metadata. We conducted a retrospective
diagnostic validation study using 300 annotated fundus images. GPT-4 received
structured prompts describing each image, with or without patient metadata. The
model was tasked with assigning an ICDR severity score, recommending DR
referral, and estimating the cup-to-disc ratio for glaucoma referral.
Performance was evaluated using accuracy, macro and weighted F1 scores, and
Cohen's kappa. McNemar's test and change rate analysis were used to assess the
influence of metadata. GPT-4 showed moderate performance for ICDR
classification (accuracy 67.5%, macro F1 0.33, weighted F1 0.67, kappa 0.25),
driven mainly by correct identification of normal cases. Performance improved
in the binary DR referral task (accuracy 82.3%, F1 0.54, kappa 0.44). For
glaucoma referral, performance was poor across all settings (accuracy ~78%, F1
<0.04, kappa <0.03). Metadata inclusion did not significantly affect outcomes
(McNemar p > 0.05), and predictions remained consistent across conditions.
GPT-4 can simulate basic ophthalmic decision-making from structured prompts but
lacks precision for complex tasks. While not suitable for clinical use, LLMs
may assist in education, documentation, or image annotation workflows in
ophthalmology.

Motivation: 解决RAG系统中因内部知识冲突或噪声检索内容导致的生成不可靠问题。

Method: 提出CARE-RAG框架，包括参数感知证据提取、上下文感知证据优化、冲突驱动总结及QA修复步骤。

Result: 在噪声或冲突证据场景下，CARE-RAG显著优于现有RAG基线。

Conclusion: CARE-RAG通过多源证据的可靠整合，显著提升了RAG系统的可信度。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating their parametric knowledge with external retrieved content.
However, knowledge conflicts caused by internal inconsistencies or noisy
retrieved content can severely undermine the generation reliability of RAG
systems.In this work, we argue that LLMs should rethink all evidence, including
both retrieved content and internal knowledge, before generating responses.We
propose CARE-RAG (Conflict-Aware and Reliable Evidence for RAG), a novel
framework that improves trustworthiness through Conflict-Driven Summarization
of all available evidence.CARE-RAG first derives parameter-aware evidence by
comparing parameter records to identify diverse internal perspectives. It then
refines retrieved evidences to produce context-aware evidence, removing
irrelevant or misleading content. To detect and summarize conflicts, we distill
a 3B LLaMA3.2 model to perform conflict-driven summarization, enabling reliable
synthesis across multiple sources.To further ensure evaluation integrity, we
introduce a QA Repair step to correct outdated or ambiguous benchmark
answers.Experiments on revised QA datasets with retrieval data show that
CARE-RAG consistently outperforms strong RAG baselines, especially in scenarios
with noisy or conflicting evidence.

Motivation: 现有RAG方法在推理密集型任务中表现有限，缺乏与预训练数据广度对齐的高质量数据存储。

Result: 在多个基准测试中（如MMLU、GPQA等），RAG管道实现了10%-33%的相对准确率提升。

Conclusion: CompactDS证明了高质量、多样化数据存储对提升RAG性能的重要性，且其表现优于复杂代理系统。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) has primarily been studied in limited
settings, such as factoid question answering; more challenging,
reasoning-intensive benchmarks have seen limited success from minimal RAG. In
this work, we challenge this prevailing view on established,
reasoning-intensive benchmarks: MMLU, MMLU Pro, AGI Eval, GPQA, and MATH. We
identify a key missing component in prior work: a usable, web-scale datastore
aligned with the breadth of pretraining data. To this end, we introduce
CompactDS: a diverse, high-quality, web-scale datastore that achieves high
retrieval accuracy and subsecond latency on a single-node. The key insights are
(1) most web content can be filtered out without sacrificing coverage, and a
compact, high-quality subset is sufficient; and (2) combining in-memory
approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) retrieval and on-disk exact search balances
speed and recall. Using CompactDS, we show that a minimal RAG pipeline achieves
consistent accuracy improvements across all benchmarks and model sizes
(8B--70B), with relative gains of 10% on MMLU, 33% on MMLU Pro, 14% on GPQA,
and 19% on MATH. No single data source suffices alone, highlighting the
importance of diversity of sources (web crawls, curated math, academic papers,
textbooks). Finally, we show that our carefully designed in-house datastore
matches or outperforms web search engines such as Google Search, as well as
recently proposed, complex agent-based RAG systems--all while maintaining
simplicity, reproducibility, and self-containment. We release CompactDS and our
retrieval pipeline, supporting future research exploring retrieval-based AI
systems.

Motivation: 现有激活稀疏化方法存在训练耗时或稀疏性不稳定的问题，限制了实际应用。

Method: 利用层间正交旋转将输入激活转换为更适合稀疏化的形式，并通过Top-K选择实现一致的模型级稀疏性。

Result: 在LLaMA2-7B上，40%稀疏度下，LaRoSA仅产生0.17困惑度差距，推理速度提升1.30倍，零样本任务准确率差距降至0.54%。

Conclusion: LaRoSA在多种LLM上表现优异，稀疏化效果稳定且性能损失极小，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Activation sparsity can reduce the computational overhead and memory
transfers during the forward pass of Large Language Model (LLM) inference.
Existing methods face limitations, either demanding time-consuming recovery
training that hinders real-world adoption, or relying on empirical
magnitude-based pruning, which causes fluctuating sparsity and unstable
inference speed-up. This paper introduces LaRoSA (Layerwise Rotated Sparse
Activation), a novel method for activation sparsification designed to improve
LLM efficiency without requiring additional training or magnitude-based
pruning. We leverage layerwise orthogonal rotations to transform input
activations into rotated forms that are more suitable for sparsification. By
employing a Top-K selection approach within the rotated activations, we achieve
consistent model-level sparsity and reliable wall-clock time speed-up. LaRoSA
is effective across various sizes and types of LLMs, demonstrating minimal
performance degradation and robust inference acceleration. Specifically, for
LLaMA2-7B at 40% sparsity, LaRoSA achieves a mere 0.17 perplexity gap with a
consistent 1.30x wall-clock time speed-up, and reduces the accuracy gap in
zero-shot tasks compared to the dense model to just 0.54%, while surpassing
TEAL by 1.77% and CATS by 17.14%.

we investigate the application of advanced instruction-tuned reasoning models,

they achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in answering intricate physics

highly sophisticated reasoning models, the strategic incorporation of few-shot
prompting can still yield measurable improvements in overall accuracy,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型在捕捉人类偏好方面表现不佳，主要因偏好数据集质量不足。

Method: 设计两阶段人机协同标注流程，结合人类标注质量与AI扩展性，训练Skywork-Reward-V2模型。

Result: Skywork-Reward-V2在七项基准测试中表现最优，验证了数据规模与高质量标注的重要性。

Conclusion: 人机协同标注可显著提升数据质量，为奖励模型研究开辟新方向。

Abstract: Despite the critical role of reward models (RMs) in reinforcement learning
from human feedback (RLHF), current state-of-the-art open RMs perform poorly on
most existing evaluation benchmarks, failing to capture the spectrum of nuanced
and sophisticated human preferences. Even approaches that incorporate advanced
training techniques have not yielded meaningful performance improvements. We
hypothesize that this brittleness stems primarily from limitations in
preference datasets, which are often narrowly scoped, synthetically labeled, or
lack rigorous quality control. To address these challenges, we present a
large-scale preference dataset comprising 40 million preference pairs, named
SynPref-40M. To enable data curation at scale, we design a human-AI synergistic
two-stage pipeline that leverages the complementary strengths of human
annotation quality and AI scalability. In this pipeline, humans provide
verified annotations, while large language models perform automatic curation
based on human guidance. Training on this preference mixture, we introduce
Skywork-Reward-V2, a suite of eight reward models ranging from 0.6B to 8B
parameters, trained on a carefully curated subset of 26 million preference
pairs from SynPref-40M. We demonstrate that Skywork-Reward-V2 is versatile
across a wide range of capabilities, including alignment with human
preferences, objective correctness, safety, resistance to stylistic biases, and
best-of-N scaling, achieving state-of-the-art performance across seven major
reward model benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm that the effectiveness of our
approach stems not only from data scale but also from high-quality curation.
The Skywork-Reward-V2 series represents substantial progress in open reward
models, highlighting the untapped potential of existing preference datasets and
demonstrating how human-AI curation synergy can unlock significantly higher
data quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决电子健康记录文本的非结构化和高维语义复杂性带来的挑战。

Method: 使用Transformer架构进行临床文本表示学习，结合多层自注意力机制捕获关键医学实体及其上下文关系，并应用Sigmoid多标签分类器预测疾病标签。

Result: 模型在多种性能指标上优于现有方法，且在不同数据规模、干扰水平和模型深度下表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架为处理真实临床文本提供了高效算法基础，对多标签医学文本建模任务具有实际意义。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges posed by the unstructured nature and
high-dimensional semantic complexity of electronic health record texts. A deep
learning method based on attention mechanisms is proposed to achieve unified
modeling for information extraction and multi-label disease prediction. The
study is conducted on the MIMIC-IV dataset. A Transformer-based architecture is
used to perform representation learning over clinical text. Multi-layer
self-attention mechanisms are employed to capture key medical entities and
their contextual relationships. A Sigmoid-based multi-label classifier is then
applied to predict multiple disease labels. The model incorporates a
context-aware semantic alignment mechanism, enhancing its representational
capacity in typical medical scenarios such as label co-occurrence and sparse
information. To comprehensively evaluate model performance, a series of
experiments were conducted, including baseline comparisons, hyperparameter
sensitivity analysis, data perturbation studies, and noise injection tests.
Results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms
representative existing approaches across multiple performance metrics. The
model maintains strong generalization under varying data scales, interference
levels, and model depth configurations. The framework developed in this study
offers an efficient algorithmic foundation for processing real-world clinical
texts and presents practical significance for multi-label medical text modeling
tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LogitSpec是一种无需训练的检索式推测解码方法，通过利用最后一个token的logit预测后续token，显著提升LLM推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索式推测解码方法依赖匹配范式，难以找到准确匹配的参考token，限制了性能。

Method: LogitSpec分两步生成推测token：利用最后一个token的logit预测后续token，并检索相关参考。

Result: 实验表明，LogitSpec在多种文本生成任务中最高可实现2.61倍加速，平均每解码步骤接受3.28个token。

Conclusion: LogitSpec是一种即插即用的高效方法，显著提升了LLM推理效率。

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD), where a small draft model is employed to propose
draft tokens in advance and then the target model validates them in parallel,
has emerged as a promising technique for LLM inference acceleration. Many
endeavors to improve SD are to eliminate the need for a draft model and
generate draft tokens in a retrieval-based manner in order to further alleviate
the drafting overhead and significantly reduce the difficulty in deployment and
applications. However, retrieval-based SD relies on a matching paradigm to
retrieval the most relevant reference as the draft tokens, where these methods
often fail to find matched and accurate draft tokens. To address this
challenge, we propose LogitSpec to effectively expand the retrieval range and
find the most relevant reference as drafts. Our LogitSpec is motivated by the
observation that the logit of the last token can not only predict the next
token, but also speculate the next next token. Specifically, LogitSpec
generates draft tokens in two steps: (1) utilizing the last logit to speculate
the next next token; (2) retrieving relevant reference for both the next token
and the next next token. LogitSpec is training-free and plug-and-play, which
can be easily integrated into existing LLM inference frameworks. Extensive
experiments on a wide range of text generation benchmarks demonstrate that
LogitSpec can achieve up to 2.61 $\times$ speedup and 3.28 mean accepted tokens
per decoding step. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合直接偏好优化（DPO）的LLM文本简化方法，通过目标群体（智力障碍者）的反馈实现个性化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM文本简化系统缺乏目标群体的偏好反馈，导致个性化不足。

Method: 扩展监督微调（SFT）方法，引入DPO技术，结合目标群体的反馈进行模型优化。

Result: 提出了一种个性化LLM文本简化系统开发流程，强调目标群体参与的重要性。

Conclusion: 目标群体参与是设计个性化AI无障碍解决方案的关键，推动了包容性AI系统的发展。

Abstract: Automatic text simplification (ATS) aims to enhance language accessibility
for various target groups, particularly persons with intellectual disabilities.
Recent advancements in generative AI, especially large language models (LLMs),
have substantially improved the quality of machine-generated text
simplifications, thereby mitigating information barriers for the target group.
However, existing LLM-based ATS systems do not incorporate preference feedback
on text simplifications during training, resulting in a lack of personalization
tailored to the specific needs of target group representatives.
  In this work, we extend the standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approach
for adapting LLM-based ATS models by leveraging a computationally efficient LLM
alignment technique -- direct preference optimization (DPO). Specifically, we
post-train LLM-based ATS models using human feedback collected from persons
with intellectual disabilities, reflecting their preferences on paired text
simplifications generated by mainstream LLMs. Furthermore, we propose a
pipeline for developing personalized LLM-based ATS systems, encompassing data
collection, model selection, SFT and DPO post-training, and evaluation. Our
findings underscore the necessity of active participation of target group
persons in designing personalized AI accessibility solutions aligned with human
expectations. This work represents a step towards personalizing inclusive AI
systems at the target-group level, incorporating insights not only from text
simplification experts but also from target group persons themselves.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合不确定性建模和微调大语言模型（LLM）的模块化框架，用于高效准确的OOS意图检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决任务导向对话系统（TODS）中OOS意图检测的挑战，确保对未知和模糊查询的鲁棒性。

Method: 1. 对现有TODS中的意图分类器输出进行不确定性估计；2. 对高不确定性实例触发微调LLM进行最终决策。

Result: 在关键OOS检测基准测试中取得最优结果，包括真实TODS数据。

Conclusion: 该方法在计算效率和性能之间取得平衡，结合传统方法与LLM，效果显著。

Abstract: Out-of-scope (OOS) intent detection is a critical challenge in task-oriented
dialogue systems (TODS), as it ensures robustness to unseen and ambiguous
queries. In this work, we propose a novel but simple modular framework that
combines uncertainty modeling with fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) for
efficient and accurate OOS detection. The first step applies uncertainty
estimation to the output of an in-scope intent detection classifier, which is
currently deployed in a real-world TODS handling tens of thousands of user
interactions daily. The second step then leverages an emerging LLM-based
approach, where a fine-tuned LLM is triggered to make a final decision on
instances with high uncertainty. Unlike prior approaches, our method
effectively balances computational efficiency and performance, combining
traditional approaches with LLMs and yielding state-of-the-art results on key
OOS detection benchmarks, including real-world OOS data acquired from a
deployed TODS.

*Quang Minh Nguyen,Taegyoon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，在立场检测任务中，外部信息（如维基百科或网络搜索）通常降低大型语言模型（LLM）的性能，而非提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨外部信息对LLM在立场检测任务中的影响，验证其是否如BERT等模型一样能提升性能。

Method: 系统评估了8种LLM在3个数据集上使用维基百科和网络搜索外部信息的效果。

Result: 外部信息在多数情况下导致性能下降，宏F1分数最多降低27.9%，且LLM倾向于与外部信息的立场对齐而非真实立场。

Conclusion: 外部信息可能引入偏见，提示LLM在立场检测任务中需谨慎使用外部信息。

Abstract: In the stance detection task, a text is classified as either favorable,
opposing, or neutral towards a target. Prior work suggests that the use of
external information, e.g., excerpts from Wikipedia, improves stance detection
performance. However, whether or not such information can benefit large
language models (LLMs) remains an unanswered question, despite their wide
adoption in many reasoning tasks. In this study, we conduct a systematic
evaluation on how Wikipedia and web search external information can affect
stance detection across eight LLMs and in three datasets with 12 targets.
Surprisingly, we find that such information degrades performance in most cases,
with macro F1 scores dropping by up to 27.9\%. We explain this through
experiments showing LLMs' tendency to align their predictions with the stance
and sentiment of the provided information rather than the ground truth stance
of the given text. We also find that performance degradation persists with
chain-of-thought prompting, while fine-tuning mitigates but does not fully
eliminate it. Our findings, in contrast to previous literature on BERT-based
systems which suggests that external information enhances performance,
highlight the risks of information biases in LLM-based stance classifiers. Code

Method: 提出LUSTER系统，结合LLM能力和结构化奖励建模，通过短期（用户情感）和长期（任务成功）奖励优化。

Result: 实验表明，LUSTER在任务成功率和情感响应方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 结合LLM与结构化奖励建模为下一代对话系统提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Task-oriented dialogue (ToD) systems are designed to help users achieve
specific goals through natural language interaction. While recent advances in
large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved linguistic fluency and
contextual understanding, building effective and emotionally intelligent ToD
systems remains a complex challenge. Effective ToD systems must optimise for
task success, emotional understanding and responsiveness, and precise
information conveyance, all within inherently noisy and ambiguous
conversational environments. In this work, we investigate architectural,
representational, optimisational as well as emotional considerations of ToD
systems. We set up systems covering these design considerations with a
challenging evaluation environment composed of a natural-language user
simulator coupled with an imperfect natural language understanding module. We
propose \textbf{LUSTER}, an \textbf{L}LM-based \textbf{U}nified \textbf{S}ystem
for \textbf{T}ask-oriented dialogue with \textbf{E}nd-to-end
\textbf{R}einforcement learning with both short-term (user sentiment) and
long-term (task success) rewards. Our findings demonstrate that combining LLM
capability with structured reward modelling leads to more resilient and
emotionally responsive ToD systems, offering a practical path forward for
next-generation conversational agents.

Motivation: 研究NLP中从全局评分转向成对比较的趋势，探讨两种方法的优劣以指导模型评估策略的选择。

Method: 在合成和真实数据集上使用全局指标和Bradley-Terry模型进行实验。

Result: 全局评分提供更可靠的排名但可能低估强模型；成对比较能识别低分强模型但收敛较慢。

Conclusion: 两种方法各有优劣，应根据具体需求选择合适的评估策略。

Abstract: With the advent of highly capable instruction-tuned neural language models,
benchmarking in natural language processing (NLP) is increasingly shifting
towards pairwise comparison leaderboards, such as LMSYS Arena, from traditional
global pointwise scores (e.g., GLUE, BIG-bench, SWE-bench). This paper
empirically investigates the strengths and weaknesses of both global scores and
pairwise comparisons to aid decision-making in selecting appropriate model
evaluation strategies. Through computational experiments on synthetic and
real-world datasets using standard global metrics and the popular Bradley-Terry
model for pairwise comparisons, we found that while global scores provide more
reliable overall rankings, they can underestimate strong models with rare,
significant errors or low confidence. Conversely, pairwise comparisons are
particularly effective for identifying strong contenders among models with
lower global scores, especially where quality metrics are hard to define (e.g.,
text generation), though they require more comparisons to converge if ties are
frequent. Our code and data are available at

Motivation: 探索预训练语言模型在低资源印尼本地语言中的迁移能力，以支持这些语言的自然语言处理任务。

Method: 使用印尼单语BERT、多语言模型（mBERT、XLM-R）和适配器方法MAD-X，评估了十种本地语言的零样本和适配器迁移性能，并将语言分为三类：已见、部分见和未见。

Result: 多语言模型在已见语言上表现最佳，部分见次之，未见最差；MAD-X显著提升性能，尤其是已见和部分见语言。

Conclusion: 模型对语言的预训练暴露程度是迁移成功的最一致预测因素，适配器方法能有效提升性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the transferability of pre-trained language
models to low-resource Indonesian local languages through the task of sentiment
analysis. We evaluate both zero-shot performance and adapter-based transfer on
ten local languages using models of different types: a monolingual Indonesian
BERT, multilingual models such as mBERT and XLM-R, and a modular adapter-based
approach called MAD-X. To better understand model behavior, we group the target
languages into three categories: seen (included during pre-training), partially
seen (not included but linguistically related to seen languages), and unseen
(absent and unrelated in pre-training data). Our results reveal clear
performance disparities across these groups: multilingual models perform best
on seen languages, moderately on partially seen ones, and poorly on unseen
languages. We find that MAD-X significantly improves performance, especially
for seen and partially seen languages, without requiring labeled data in the
target language. Additionally, we conduct a further analysis on tokenization
and show that while subword fragmentation and vocabulary overlap with
Indonesian correlate weakly with prediction quality, they do not fully explain
the observed performance. Instead, the most consistent predictor of transfer
success is the model's prior exposure to the language, either directly or
through a related language.

Result: 实验表明，AdamMeme能系统揭示不同mLLMs的性能差异，并精细分析模型弱点。

Conclusion: AdamMeme提供了一种动态、全面的评估方法，弥补了现有基准的不足。

Abstract: The proliferation of multimodal memes in the social media era demands that
multimodal Large Language Models (mLLMs) effectively understand meme
harmfulness. Existing benchmarks for assessing mLLMs on harmful meme
understanding rely on accuracy-based, model-agnostic evaluations using static
datasets. These benchmarks are limited in their ability to provide up-to-date
and thorough assessments, as online memes evolve dynamically. To address this,
we propose AdamMeme, a flexible, agent-based evaluation framework that
adaptively probes the reasoning capabilities of mLLMs in deciphering meme
harmfulness. Through multi-agent collaboration, AdamMeme provides comprehensive
evaluations by iteratively updating the meme data with challenging samples,
thereby exposing specific limitations in how mLLMs interpret harmfulness.
Extensive experiments show that our framework systematically reveals the
varying performance of different target mLLMs, offering in-depth, fine-grained
analyses of model-specific weaknesses. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型中的偏见和刻板印象可能对敏感领域（如内容审核和决策）造成危害，因此需要更有效的检测方法。

Method: 使用StereoBias数据集，比较了编码器模型和微调解码器模型（QLoRA）的性能，并探索了联合训练偏见和刻板印象检测的效果。

Result: 联合训练显著提升了偏见检测性能，且解码器模型表现竞争力。实验还表明改进源于偏见与刻板印象的关联，而非多任务学习本身。

Conclusion: 利用刻板印象信息可以构建更公平有效的AI系统。

Abstract: Bias and stereotypes in language models can cause harm, especially in
sensitive areas like content moderation and decision-making. This paper
addresses bias and stereotype detection by exploring how jointly learning these
tasks enhances model performance. We introduce StereoBias, a unique dataset
labeled for bias and stereotype detection across five categories: religion,
gender, socio-economic status, race, profession, and others, enabling a deeper
study of their relationship. Our experiments compare encoder-only models and
fine-tuned decoder-only models using QLoRA. While encoder-only models perform
well, decoder-only models also show competitive results. Crucially, joint
training on bias and stereotype detection significantly improves bias detection
compared to training them separately. Additional experiments with sentiment
analysis confirm that the improvements stem from the connection between bias
and stereotypes, not multi-task learning alone. These findings highlight the
value of leveraging stereotype information to build fairer and more effective
AI systems.

Motivation: 法律工作的文本密集性和资源密集性为NLP研究提供了独特挑战与机会，但现有数据驱动方法缺乏可解释性和可信度，限制了其在动态法律环境中的应用。

Method: 与法律专家合作扩展数据集，探索使用LLMs和上下文学习评估合同条款的合法性，比较不同法律上下文（无上下文、全文法律来源、提炼版指南）对模型性能的影响。

Result: 全文法律来源对性能有中等提升，而提炼版指南显著提高了无效条款的召回率和加权F1分数（80%），但LLMs表现仍远低于人类律师。

Conclusion: LLMs在辅助律师审查合同合法性方面具有潜力，但当前方法仍有局限性，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Legal work, characterized by its text-heavy and resource-intensive nature,
presents unique challenges and opportunities for NLP research. While
data-driven approaches have advanced the field, their lack of interpretability
and trustworthiness limits their applicability in dynamic legal environments.
To address these issues, we collaborated with legal experts to extend an
existing dataset and explored the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and
in-context learning to evaluate the legality of clauses in German employment
contracts. Our work evaluates the ability of different LLMs to classify clauses
as "valid," "unfair," or "void" under three legal context variants: no legal
context, full-text sources of laws and court rulings, and distilled versions of
these (referred to as examination guidelines). Results show that full-text
sources moderately improve performance, while examination guidelines
significantly enhance recall for void clauses and weighted F1-Score, reaching
80\%. Despite these advancements, LLMs' performance when using full-text
sources remains substantially below that of human lawyers. We contribute an
extended dataset, including examination guidelines, referenced legal sources,
and corresponding annotations, alongside our code and all log files. Our
findings highlight the potential of LLMs to assist lawyers in contract legality
review while also underscoring the limitations of the methods presented.

Abstract: Tokenisation - "the process of splitting text into atomic parts" (Brezina &
Timperley, 2017: 1) - is a crucial step for corpus linguistics, as it provides
the basis for any applicable quantitative method (e.g. collocations) while
ensuring the reliability of qualitative approaches. This paper examines how
discrepancies in tokenisation affect the representation of language data and
the validity of analytical findings: investigating the challenges posed by
emojis and homoglyphs, the study highlights the necessity of preprocessing
these elements to maintain corpus fidelity to the source data. The research
presents methods for ensuring that digital texts are accurately represented in
corpora, thereby supporting reliable linguistic analysis and guaranteeing the
repeatability of linguistic interpretations. The findings emphasise the
necessity of a detailed understanding of both linguistic and technical aspects
involved in digital textual data to enhance the accuracy of corpus analysis,

Abstract: Data quality is a critical driver of large language model performance, yet
existing model-based selection methods focus almost exclusively on English. We
introduce MuRating, a scalable framework that transfers high-quality English
data-quality signals into a single rater for 17 target languages. MuRating
aggregates multiple English "raters" via pairwise comparisons to learn unified
document-quality scores,then projects these judgments through translation to
train a multilingual evaluator on monolingual, cross-lingual, and parallel text
pairs. Applied to web data, MuRating selects balanced subsets of English and
multilingual content to pretrain a 1.2 B-parameter LLaMA model. Compared to
strong baselines, including QuRater, AskLLM, DCLM and so on, our approach
boosts average accuracy on both English benchmarks and multilingual
evaluations, with especially large gains on knowledge-intensive tasks. We
further analyze translation fidelity, selection biases, and underrepresentation
of narrative material, outlining directions for future work.

Result: 线性探针能有效分离评估与部署提示，当前安全评估被模型视为不真实。

Conclusion: 需改进评估方法以应对模型的评估意识，模型内部信息可辅助黑盒安全审计。

Abstract: Language models can distinguish between testing and deployment phases -- a
capability known as evaluation awareness. This has significant safety and
policy implications, potentially undermining the reliability of evaluations
that are central to AI governance frameworks and voluntary industry
commitments. In this paper, we study evaluation awareness in
Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. We show that linear probes can separate real-world
evaluation and deployment prompts, suggesting that current models internally
represent this distinction. We also find that current safety evaluations are
correctly classified by the probes, suggesting that they already appear
artificial or inauthentic to models. Our findings underscore the importance of
ensuring trustworthy evaluations and understanding deceptive capabilities. More
broadly, our work showcases how model internals may be leveraged to support
blackbox methods in safety audits, especially for future models more competent
at evaluation awareness and deception.

### [120] [How Do Vision-Language Models Process Conflicting Information Across Modalities?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01790)
*Tianze Hua,Tian Yun,Ellie Pavlick*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了多模态AI模型在输入信息冲突时的行为，发现模型倾向于优先处理某一模态，且内部结构和注意力机制可调控这种偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多模态模型如何处理冲突输入，以提升其在实际复杂环境中的表现。

Method: 通过向视觉-语言模型提供不一致的输入（如图像与标题矛盾），观察模型对不同模态的偏好及其内部机制。

Result: 模型通常优先处理某一模态，且内部注意力机制可调整这种偏好；发现模态无关的“路由头”可优化性能。

Conclusion: 研究为识别和控制多模态模型中的冲突信号提供了关键步骤。

Abstract: AI models are increasingly required to be multimodal, integrating disparate
input streams into a coherent state representation on which subsequent
behaviors and actions can be based. This paper seeks to understand how such
models behave when input streams present conflicting information. Focusing
specifically on vision-language models, we provide inconsistent inputs (e.g.,
an image of a dog paired with the caption "A photo of a cat") and ask the model
to report the information present in one of the specific modalities (e.g.,
"What does the caption say / What is in the image?"). We find that models often
favor one modality over the other, e.g., reporting the image regardless of what
the caption says, but that different models differ in which modality they
favor. We find evidence that the behaviorally preferred modality is evident in
the internal representational structure of the model, and that specific
attention heads can restructure the representations to favor one modality over
the other. Moreover, we find modality-agnostic "router heads" which appear to
promote answers about the modality requested in the instruction, and which can
be manipulated or transferred in order to improve performance across datasets
and modalities. Together, the work provides essential steps towards identifying
and controlling if and how models detect and resolve conflicting signals within
complex multimodal environments.

TL;DR: 本文分析了MDACE数据集，评估了可解释医疗编码系统的合理性，发现真实证据与代码描述部分一致，并提出改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动医疗编码可简化文档和计费流程，但缺乏透明性评估数据。MDACE数据集为此提供了资源。

Method: 对MDACE数据集进行深入分析，评估现有可解释医疗编码系统的合理性，并提出匹配度量。

Result: 真实证据与代码描述部分一致，先进方法与真实证据高度重叠。

Conclusion: 提出了开发和评估可解释医疗编码系统的建议。

Abstract: Automatic medical coding has the potential to ease documentation and billing
processes. For this task, transparency plays an important role for medical
coders and regulatory bodies, which can be achieved using explainability
methods. However, the evaluation of these approaches has been mostly limited to
short text and binary settings due to a scarcity of annotated data. Recent
efforts by Cheng et al. (2023) have introduced the MDACE dataset, which
provides a valuable resource containing code evidence in clinical records. In
this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the MDACE dataset and perform
plausibility evaluation of current explainable medical coding systems from an
applied perspective. With this, we contribute to a deeper understanding of
automatic medical coding and evidence extraction. Our findings reveal that
ground truth evidence aligns with code descriptions to a certain degree. An
investigation into state-of-the-art approaches shows a high overlap with ground
truth evidence. We propose match measures and highlight success and failure
cases. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for developing and
evaluating explainable medical coding systems.

Motivation: 比较小型语言模型在临床笔记开放属性值提取中生成的结构化输出的解析性，为隐私敏感的临床环境提供实用指导。

Method: 评估三种常用序列化格式（JSON、YAML、XML）的解析性，分析错误模式。

Result: JSON解析性最高，结构化鲁棒性受提示和模型大小影响，长文档和特定笔记类型表现较差。

Conclusion: 为临床环境中语言模型的序列化格式选择和提示设计提供实用建议。

Abstract: We present a comparative analysis of the parseability of structured outputs
generated by small language models for open attribute-value extraction from
clinical notes. We evaluate three widely used serialization formats: JSON,
YAML, and XML, and find that JSON consistently yields the highest parseability.
Structural robustness improves with targeted prompting and larger models, but
declines for longer documents and certain note types. Our error analysis
identifies recurring format-specific failure patterns. These findings offer
practical guidance for selecting serialization formats and designing prompts
when deploying language models in privacy-sensitive clinical settings.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种系统方法，通过分析低困惑度序列来探索LLMs如何利用和复制训练数据，发现部分序列无法追溯到训练数据，并量化了匹配序列的分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs的广泛应用，理解训练数据如何影响其输出对透明度、责任性、隐私和公平性至关重要。

Method: 提出了一种系统方法，专注于分析低困惑度序列（模型生成的高概率文本片段），并通过管道提取和追溯这些序列到训练数据源。

Result: 研究发现，大量低困惑度序列无法映射到训练数据；对于匹配的序列，量化了其在源文档中的分布。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于更好地理解LLMs训练数据对其行为的影响，为透明度和责任性提供了新视角。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly widespread, understanding
how specific training data shapes their outputs is crucial for transparency,
accountability, privacy, and fairness. To explore how LLMs leverage and
replicate their training data, we introduce a systematic approach centered on
analyzing low-perplexity sequences - high-probability text spans generated by
the model. Our pipeline reliably extracts such long sequences across diverse
topics while avoiding degeneration, then traces them back to their sources in
the training data. Surprisingly, we find that a substantial portion of these
low-perplexity spans cannot be mapped to the corpus. For those that do match,
we quantify the distribution of occurrences across source documents,
highlighting the scope and nature of verbatim recall and paving a way toward
better understanding of how LLMs training data impacts their behavior.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has intensified the
need for evaluation frameworks that go beyond English centric benchmarks and
address the requirements of linguistically diverse regions such as India. We
present EKA-EVAL, a unified and production-ready evaluation framework that
integrates over 35 benchmarks, including 10 Indic-specific datasets, spanning
categories like reasoning, mathematics, tool use, long-context understanding,
and reading comprehension. Compared to existing Indian language evaluation
tools, EKA-EVAL offers broader benchmark coverage, with built-in support for
distributed inference, quantization, and multi-GPU usage. Our systematic
comparison positions EKA-EVAL as the first end-to-end, extensible evaluation
suite tailored for both global and Indic LLMs, significantly lowering the
barrier to multilingual benchmarking. The framework is open-source and publicly
available at https://github.com/lingo-iitgn/ eka-eval and a part of ongoing EKA
initiative (https://eka.soket.ai), which aims to scale up to over 100
benchmarks and establish a robust, multilingual evaluation ecosystem for LLMs.

TL;DR: DIY-MKG是一个开源系统，支持多语言学习，通过构建个性化词汇知识图谱和动态生成个性化测验，解决了现有语言学习工具的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言学习工具（包括基于LLM的工具）在多语言词汇联系、个性化学习和认知卸载方面存在不足。

Method: 设计DIY-MKG系统，利用LLM构建个性化词汇知识图谱，支持扩展词汇、丰富注释和动态生成个性化测验。

Result: 评估表明，DIY-MKG在多语言词汇扩展和测验生成方面表现可靠且准确。

Conclusion: DIY-MKG是一个有效的多语言学习工具，解决了现有工具的局限性。

Abstract: Existing language learning tools, even those powered by Large Language Models
(LLMs), often lack support for polyglot learners to build linguistic
connections across vocabularies in multiple languages, provide limited
customization for individual learning paces or needs, and suffer from
detrimental cognitive offloading. To address these limitations, we design
Do-It-Yourself Multilingual Knowledge Graph (DIY-MKG), an open-source system
that supports polyglot language learning. DIY-MKG allows the user to build
personalized vocabulary knowledge graphs, which are constructed by selective
expansion with related words suggested by an LLM. The system further enhances
learning through rich annotation capabilities and an adaptive review module
that leverages LLMs for dynamic, personalized quiz generation. In addition,
DIY-MKG allows users to flag incorrect quiz questions, simultaneously
increasing user engagement and providing a feedback loop for prompt refinement.
Our evaluation of LLM-based components in DIY-MKG shows that vocabulary
expansion is reliable and fair across multiple languages, and that the
generated quizzes are highly accurate, validating the robustness of DIY-MKG.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MiCoTA框架通过中间模型和中等长度推理序列，提升小型语言模型的长推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小型语言模型（SLMs）因容量有限而难以学习长推理序列的问题（SLMs Learnability Gap）。

Method: 引入MiCoTA框架，利用中等规模模型作为教师助手，结合中等长度推理序列，弥合容量和推理长度差距。

Result: 实验显示，MiCoTA显著提升SLMs的推理性能，例如Qwen2.5-7B和3B模型在多个基准测试中平均得分提高3.47和3.93。

Conclusion: MiCoTA通过更贴近SLM分布的数据生成机制，为未来SLMs的长推理数据蒸馏研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning tasks requiring long thought
sequences for planning, reflection, and refinement. However, their substantial
model size and high computational demands are impractical for widespread
deployment. Yet, small language models (SLMs) often struggle to learn long-form
CoT reasoning due to their limited capacity, a phenomenon we refer to as the
"SLMs Learnability Gap". To address this, we introduce
\textbf{Mi}d-\textbf{Co}T \textbf{T}eacher \textbf{A}ssistant Distillation
(MiCoTAl), a framework for improving long CoT distillation for SLMs. MiCoTA
employs intermediate-sized models as teacher assistants and utilizes
intermediate-length CoT sequences to bridge both the capacity and reasoning
length gaps. Our experiments on downstream tasks demonstrate that although SLMs
distilled from large teachers can perform poorly, by applying MiCoTA, they
achieve significant improvements in reasoning performance. Specifically,
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct achieve an improvement of 3.47 and
3.93 respectively on average score on AIME2024, AMC, Olympiad, MATH-500 and
GSM8K benchmarks. To better understand the mechanism behind MiCoTA, we perform
a quantitative experiment demonstrating that our method produces data more
closely aligned with base SLM distributions. Our insights pave the way for
future research into long-CoT data distillation for SLMs.

Result: 在27个数据集上的实验表明，该方法在生成任务中显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了剪枝后模型的性能，尤其在生成任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Pruning is a highly effective approach for compressing large language models
(LLMs), significantly reducing inference latency. However, conventional
training-free structured pruning methods often employ a heuristic metric that
indiscriminately removes some attention heads across all pruning layers,
without considering their positions within the network architecture. In this
work, we propose a novel pruning algorithm that strategically prunes attention
heads in the model's higher layers. Since the removal of attention heads can
alter the magnitude of token representations, we introduce an adaptive
rescaling parameter that calibrates the representation scale post-pruning to
counteract this effect. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a wide range of
LLMs, including LLaMA3.1-8B, Mistral-7B-v0.3, Qwen2-7B, and Gemma2-9B. Our
evaluation includes both generation and discriminative tasks across 27
datasets. The results consistently demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing structured pruning methods. This improvement is particularly notable
in generation tasks, where our approach significantly outperforms existing
baselines.

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in large
language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in complex domains such as logical reasoning and
experimental coding. Motivated by these advancements, numerous studies have
explored the application of AI in the innovation process, particularly in the
context of scientific research. These AI technologies primarily aim to develop
systems that can autonomously conduct research processes across a wide range of
scientific disciplines. Despite these significant strides, a comprehensive
survey on AI for Research (AI4Research) remains absent, which hampers our
understanding and impedes further development in this field. To address this
gap, we present a comprehensive survey and offer a unified perspective on
AI4Research. Specifically, the main contributions of our work are as follows:
(1) Systematic taxonomy: We first introduce a systematic taxonomy to classify
five mainstream tasks in AI4Research. (2) New frontiers: Then, we identify key
research gaps and highlight promising future directions, focusing on the rigor
and scalability of automated experiments, as well as the societal impact. (3)
Abundant applications and resources: Finally, we compile a wealth of resources,
including relevant multidisciplinary applications, data corpora, and tools. We
hope our work will provide the research community with quick access to these
resources and stimulate innovative breakthroughs in AI4Research.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLMs）与多样化且可能冲突的人类偏好对齐的挑战。

Method: 提出Gradient-Adaptive Policy Optimization (GAPO)，利用多梯度下降自适应调整目标梯度，平衡冲突目标；进一步引入P-GAPO，结合用户偏好生成Pareto最优解。

Result: 理论证明GAPO收敛于Pareto最优解；实验显示GAPO在Mistral-7B上优于现有方法，在帮助性和无害性上表现更优。

Conclusion: GAPO为多样化人类偏好对齐提供了有效解决方案，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a powerful
technique for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences.
However, effectively aligning LLMs with diverse human preferences remains a
significant challenge, particularly when they are conflict. To address this
issue, we frame human value alignment as a multi-objective optimization
problem, aiming to maximize a set of potentially conflicting objectives. We
introduce Gradient-Adaptive Policy Optimization (GAPO), a novel fine-tuning
paradigm that employs multiple-gradient descent to align LLMs with diverse
preference distributions. GAPO adaptively rescales the gradients for each
objective to determine an update direction that optimally balances the
trade-offs between objectives. Additionally, we introduce P-GAPO, which
incorporates user preferences across different objectives and achieves Pareto
solutions that better align with the user's specific needs. Our theoretical
analysis demonstrates that GAPO converges towards a Pareto optimal solution for
multiple objectives. Empirical results on Mistral-7B show that GAPO outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in both
helpfulness and harmlessness.

Wav2Vec-BERT on Bangla, a low-resource language. We have conducted experiments
using two publicly available datasets: Mozilla Common Voice-17 and OpenSLR to

Motivation: 研究教师模型推理演示的有效性，以提升学生模型的推理能力。

Method: 从教师模型中精选推理轨迹（NaturalThoughts），分析影响推理能力蒸馏的因素。

Result: 精选困难且多样化的样本更高效，NaturalThoughts在多个基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: 精选高质量推理轨迹是提升学生模型推理能力的有效方法。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that distilling reasoning traces from a larger teacher
model via supervised finetuning outperforms reinforcement learning with the
smaller student model alone (Guo et al. 2025). However, there has not been a
systematic study of what kind of reasoning demonstrations from the teacher are
most effective in improving the student model's reasoning capabilities. In this
work we curate high-quality "NaturalThoughts" by selecting reasoning traces
from a strong teacher model based on a large pool of questions from
NaturalReasoning (Yuan et al. 2025). We first conduct a systematic analysis of
factors that affect distilling reasoning capabilities, in terms of sample
efficiency and scalability for general reasoning tasks. We observe that simply
scaling up data size with random sampling is a strong baseline with steady
performance gains. Further, we find that selecting difficult examples that
require more diverse reasoning strategies is more sample-efficient to transfer
the teacher model's reasoning skills. Evaluated on both Llama and Qwen models,
training with NaturalThoughts outperforms existing reasoning datasets such as
OpenThoughts, LIMO, etc. on general STEM reasoning benchmarks including
GPQA-Diamond, MMLU-Pro and SuperGPQA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NLG评估方法（如n-gram重叠或句子合理性）与高风险领域实际决策效果相关性低，需更直接的评估方式。

Method: 使用市场摘要文本（客观晨报和主观收盘分析）测试人类和LLM代理的决策质量，基于其金融交易表现。

Result: 人类和LLM代理仅依赖摘要时表现不优于随机；但更丰富的分析评论能显著提升人机协作团队的表现。

Conclusion: 评估生成文本应关注其促进人机协同决策的能力，传统内在指标存在局限性。

Abstract: Natural language generation (NLG) is increasingly deployed in high-stakes
domains, yet common intrinsic evaluation methods, such as n-gram overlap or
sentence plausibility, weakly correlate with actual decision-making efficacy.
We propose a decision-oriented framework for evaluating generated text by
directly measuring its influence on human and large language model (LLM)
decision outcomes. Using market digest texts--including objective morning
summaries and subjective closing-bell analyses--as test cases, we assess
decision quality based on the financial performance of trades executed by human
investors and autonomous LLM agents informed exclusively by these texts. Our
findings reveal that neither humans nor LLM agents consistently surpass random
performance when relying solely on summaries. However, richer analytical
commentaries enable collaborative human-LLM teams to outperform individual
human or agent baselines significantly. Our approach underscores the importance
of evaluating generated text by its ability to facilitate synergistic
decision-making between humans and LLMs, highlighting critical limitations of
traditional intrinsic metrics.

Motivation: 随着LLMs在敏感领域（如同行评审和心理健康）的快速部署，需要更深入评估其对话理解能力。

Method: 通过评估LLMs在辩论中的表现，并测量其对对话结构和语用背景的理解。

Result: LLMs能进行连贯且有说服力的辩论，但缺乏对深层对话结构的理解。

Conclusion: LLMs作为评估者的局限性源于其对上下文理解的不足，辩论能力不依赖于对内容的真正理解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are excellent at maintaining high-level,
convincing dialogues. They are being fast deployed as chatbots and evaluators
in sensitive areas, such as peer review and mental health applications. This,
along with the disparate accounts on their reasoning capabilities, calls for a
closer examination of LLMs and their comprehension of dialogue. In this work we
begin by evaluating LLMs' ability to maintain a debate--one of the purest yet
most complex forms of human communication. Then we measure how this capability
relates to their understanding of what is being talked about, namely, their
comprehension of dialogical structures and the pragmatic context. We find that
LLMs are capable of maintaining coherent, persuasive debates, often swaying the
beliefs of participants and audiences alike. We also note that awareness or
suspicion of AI involvement encourage people to be more critical of the
arguments made. When polling LLMs on their comprehension of deeper structures
of dialogue, however, they cannot demonstrate said understanding. Our findings
tie the shortcomings of LLMs-as-evaluators to their (in)ability to understand
the context. More broadly, for the field of argumentation theory we posit that,
if an agent can convincingly maintain a dialogue, it is not necessary for it to
know what it is talking about. Hence, the modelling of pragmatic context and
coherence are secondary to effectiveness.

Motivation: 解决AI社区对LRMs是否具备真正推理能力的争议，通过复制和改进实验来澄清误解。

Method: 复制并改进了原始研究中的两个争议性基准（Towers of Hanoi和River Crossing），引入逐步提示和协作对话方法。

Result: 发现LRMs在复杂任务（如8个圆盘的Towers of Hanoi）中表现受限，但在可解问题（如River Crossing）中表现优异。

Conclusion: LRMs是随机、强化学习调优的搜索器，其推理能力需通过精细实验进一步探索。

Abstract: Earlier this year, Apple ignited controversy by publishing "The Illusion of
Thinking," prompting heated debate within the AI community. Critics seized upon
the findings as conclusive evidence that Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) lack
genuine reasoning capabilities, branding them as mere stochastic parrots.
Meanwhile, defenders-spearheaded by Lawsen et al. (2025)-fired back, condemning
the experimental setup as flawed and the conclusions overstated. We clarify
this debate by replicating and refining two of the original study's most
contentious benchmarks: Towers of Hanoi and River Crossing. By introducing
incremental stepwise prompting and agentic collaborative dialogue, we show that
previously reported failures solving the Towers of Hanoi were not purely result
of output constraints, but also partly a result of cognition limitations: LRMs
still stumble when complexity rises moderately (around 8 disks). Moreover, the
River Crossing results initially heralded as catastrophic failures turn out to
hinge upon testing unsolvable configurations. Once we limit tests strictly to
solvable problems-LRMs effortlessly solve large instances involving over 100
agent pairs. Our findings ultimately defy simplistic narratives: today's LRMs
are stochastic, RL-tuned searchers in a discrete state space we barely
understand. Real progress in symbolic, long-horizon reasoning demands mapping
that terrain through fine-grained ablations like those introduced here.

Abstract: The recent boom of large language models (LLMs) has re-ignited the hope that
artificial intelligence (AI) systems could aid medical diagnosis. Yet despite
dazzling benchmark scores, LLM assistants have yet to deliver measurable
improvements at the bedside. This scoping review aims to highlight the areas
where AI is limited to make practical contributions in the clinical setting,
specifically in dementia diagnosis and care.
  Standalone machine-learning models excel at pattern recognition but seldom
provide actionable, interpretable guidance, eroding clinician trust. Adjacent
use of LLMs by physicians did not result in better diagnostic accuracy or
speed. Key limitations trace to the data-driven paradigm: black-box outputs
which lack transparency, vulnerability to hallucinations, and weak causal
reasoning. Hybrid approaches that combine statistical learning with expert
rule-based knowledge, and involve clinicians throughout the process help bring
back interpretability. They also fit better with existing clinical workflows,
as seen in examples like PEIRS and ATHENA-CDS.
  Future decision-support should prioritise explanatory coherence by linking
predictions to clinically meaningful causes. This can be done through
neuro-symbolic or hybrid AI that combines the language ability of LLMs with
human causal expertise. AI researchers have addressed this direction, with
explainable AI and neuro-symbolic AI being the next logical steps in further
advancement in AI. However, they are still based on data-driven knowledge
integration instead of human-in-the-loop approaches. Future research should
measure success not only by accuracy but by improvements in clinician
understanding, workflow fit, and patient outcomes. A better understanding of
what helps improve human-computer interactions is greatly needed for AI systems
to become part of clinical practice.

Abstract: AI agents are autonomous systems designed to perceive, reason, and act within
dynamic environments. With the rapid advancements in generative AI (GenAI),
large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
significantly improved AI agents' capabilities in semantic comprehension,
complex reasoning, and autonomous decision-making. At the same time, the rise
of Agentic AI highlights adaptability and goal-directed autonomy in dynamic and
complex environments. LLMs-based AI Agents (LLM-Agents), MLLMs-based AI Agents
(MLLM-Agents), and Agentic AI contribute to expanding AI's capabilities in
information processing, environmental perception, and autonomous
decision-making, opening new avenues for smart manufacturing. However, the
definitions, capability boundaries, and practical applications of these
emerging AI paradigms in smart manufacturing remain unclear. To address this
gap, this study systematically reviews the evolution of AI and AI agent
technologies, examines the core concepts and technological advancements of
LLM-Agents, MLLM-Agents, and Agentic AI, and explores their potential
applications in and integration into manufacturing, along with the potential
challenges they may face.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在工具调用和推理过程中存在冗余信息负担，影响模型推理能力。

Conclusion: 分层框架有效减轻模型负担，提升推理效率和准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as one of the most significant
technological advancements in artificial intelligence in recent years. Their
ability to understand, generate, and reason with natural language has
transformed how we interact with AI systems. With the development of LLM-based
agents and reinforcement-learning-based reasoning models, the study of applying
reinforcement learning in agent frameworks has become a new research focus.
However, all previous studies face the challenge of deciding the tool calling
process and the reasoning process simultaneously, and the chain of reasoning
was solely relied on the unprocessed raw result with redundant information and
symbols unrelated to the task from the tool, which impose a heavy burden on the
model's capability to reason. Therefore, in our research, we proposed a
hierarchical framework Agent-as-tool that detach the tool calling process and
the reasoning process, which enables the model to focus on the verbally
reasoning process while the tool calling process is handled by another agent.
Our work had achieved comparable results with only a slight reinforcement
fine-tuning on 180 samples, and had achieved exceptionally well performance in
Bamboogle with 63.2% of exact match and 75.2% in cover exact match, exceeding
Search-R1 by 4.8% in exact match and 3.2% in cover exact match.

Motivation: 现有TKG推理方法在建模训练与测试样本的事件分布偏移和生成高质量负样本方面存在不足。

Result: 实验表明T3DM在多数情况下优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: T3DM通过改进分布偏移建模和负采样策略，显著提升了TKG推理的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) is an efficient method for describing the
dynamic development of facts along a timeline. Most research on TKG reasoning
(TKGR) focuses on modelling the repetition of global facts and designing
patterns of local historical facts. However, they face two significant
challenges: inadequate modeling of the event distribution shift between
training and test samples, and reliance on random entity substitution for
generating negative samples, which often results in low-quality sampling. To
this end, we propose a novel distributional feature modeling approach for
training TKGR models, Test-Time Training-guided Distribution shift Modelling
(T3DM), to adjust the model based on distribution shift and ensure the global
consistency of model reasoning. In addition, we design a negative-sampling
strategy to generate higher-quality negative quadruples based on adversarial
training. Extensive experiments show that T3DM provides better and more robust
results than the state-of-the-art baselines in most cases.

Abstract: This paper examines the use of in-store customers as delivery couriers in a
centralized crowd-shipping system, targeting the growing need for efficient
last-mile delivery in urban areas. We consider a brick-and-mortar retail
setting where shoppers are offered compensation to deliver time-sensitive
online orders. To manage this process, we propose a Markov Decision Process
(MDP) model that captures key uncertainties, including the stochastic arrival
of orders and crowd-shippers, and the probabilistic acceptance of delivery
offers. Our solution approach integrates Neural Approximate Dynamic Programming
(NeurADP) for adaptive order-to-shopper assignment with a Deep Double Q-Network
(DDQN) for dynamic pricing. This joint optimization strategy enables multi-drop
routing and accounts for offer acceptance uncertainty, aligning more closely
with real-world operations. Experimental results demonstrate that the
integrated NeurADP + DDQN policy achieves notable improvements in delivery cost
efficiency, with up to 6.7\% savings over NeurADP with fixed pricing and
approximately 18\% over myopic baselines. We also show that allowing flexible
delivery delays and enabling multi-destination routing further reduces
operational costs by 8\% and 17\%, respectively. These findings underscore the
advantages of dynamic, forward-looking policies in crowd-shipping systems and
offer practical guidance for urban logistics operators.

Abstract: Non-monotonic logic programming is the basis for a declarative problem
solving paradigm known as answer set programming (ASP). Departing from the
seminal definition by Gelfond and Lifschitz in 1988 for simple normal logic
programs, various answer set semantics have been proposed for extensions. We
consider two important questions: (1) Should the minimal model property,
constraint monotonicity and foundedness as defined in the literature be
mandatory conditions for an answer set semantics in general? (2) If not, what
other properties could be considered as general principles for answer set
semantics? We address the two questions. First, it seems that the three
aforementioned conditions may sometimes be too strong, and we illustrate with
examples that enforcing them may exclude expected answer sets. Second, we
evolve the Gelfond answer set (GAS) principles for answer set construction by
refining the Gelfond's rationality principle to well-supportedness, minimality
w.r.t. negation by default and minimality w.r.t. epistemic negation. The
principle of well-supportedness guarantees that every answer set is
constructible from if-then rules obeying a level mapping and is thus free of
circular justification, while the two minimality principles ensure that the
formalism minimizes knowledge both at the level of answer sets and of world
views. Third, to embody the refined GAS principles, we extend the notion of
well-supportedness substantially to answer sets and world views, respectively.
Fourth, we define new answer set semantics in terms of the refined GAS
principles. Fifth, we use the refined GAS principles as an alternative baseline
to intuitively assess the existing answer set semantics. Finally, we analyze
the computational complexity.
