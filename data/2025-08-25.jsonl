With the astounding\nadvances in large language models (LLMs), a variety of methods have been\ndeveloped to adapt LLMs for time series forecasting. Despite unlocking the\npotential of LLMs in comprehending TS data, existing methods are inherently\nconstrained by their shallow integration of TS information, wherein LLMs\ntypically access TS representations at shallow layers, primarily at the input\nlayer. This causes the influence of TS representations to progressively fade in\ndeeper layers and eventually leads to ineffective adaptation between textual\nembeddings and TS representations. In this paper, we propose the Multi-layer\nSteerable Embedding Fusion (MSEF), a novel framework that enables LLMs to\ndirectly access time series patterns at all depths, thereby mitigating the\nprogressive loss of TS information in deeper layers. Specifically, MSEF\nleverages off-the-shelf time series foundation models to extract semantically\nrich embeddings, which are fused with intermediate text representations across\nLLM layers via layer-specific steering vectors.

In this paper, we introduce the Multimodal Academic\nCover benchmark (MAC), a live benchmark that could continuously evolve with\nscientific advancement and model progress. MAC leverages over 25,000 image-text\npairs sourced from issues of top-tier scientific journals such as Nature,\nScience, and Cell, challenging MLLMs to reason across abstract visual and\ntextual scientific content. Experiments on our most recent yearly snapshot,\nMAC-2025, reveal that while MLLMs demonstrate strong perceptual abilities,\ntheir cross-modal scientific reasoning remains limited. To bridge this gap, we\npropose DAD, a lightweight inference-time approach that enhances MLLMs by\nextending MLLM visual features with language space reasoning, achieving\nperformance improvements of up to 11%.

The dataset\ncomprises 28 operationally critical classes, including structurally compromised\nbuildings, access points such as doors, windows, and gaps, multiple debris\nlevels, rescue personnel, vehicles, and civilian visibility. A distinctive\nfeature of DRespNeT is its fine-grained annotation detail, enabling\ndifferentiation between accessible and obstructed areas, thereby improving\noperational planning and response efficiency. Performance evaluations using\nYOLO-based instance segmentation models, specifically YOLOv8-seg, demonstrate\nsignificant gains in real-time situational awareness and decision-making.

The evaluation is\nconducted using a dataset of Arabic textual speech and memes proposed in the\nArabicNLP MAHED 2025 challenge. The results underscore the capacity of LLMs\nsuch as GPT-4o-mini, fine-tuned with Arabic textual speech, and Gemini Flash\n2.5, fine-tuned with Arabic memes, to deliver the superior performance. They\nachieve up to 72.1%, 57.8%, and 79.6% macro F1 scores for tasks 1, 2, and 3,\nrespectively, and secure first place overall in the Mahed 2025 challenge. The\nproposed solutions offer a more nuanced understanding of both text and memes\nfor accurate and efficient Arabic content moderation systems."}

However, voxelbased representations in these models require strict\nconsistency in input and output dimensions due to their serialized processing,\nwhich limits the spatial diffusion capability typically offered by\nconvolutional operations. This limitation significantly affects detection\naccuracy. Inspired by CNN-based object detection architectures, we propose a\nnovel Voxel Diffusion Module (VDM) to enhance voxel-level representation and\ndiffusion in point cloud data. VDM is composed of sparse 3D convolutions,\nsubmanifold sparse convolutions, and residual connections. To ensure\ncomputational efficiency, the output feature maps are downsampled to one-fourth\nof the original input resolution. VDM serves two primary functions: (1)\ndiffusing foreground voxel features through sparse 3D convolutions to enrich\nspatial context, and (2) aggregating fine-grained spatial information to\nstrengthen voxelwise feature representation. The enhanced voxel features\nproduced by VDM can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream Transformer- or\nSSM-based detection models for accurate object classification and localization,\nhighlighting the generalizability of our method. We evaluate VDM on several\nbenchmark datasets by embedding it into both Transformerbased and SSM-based\nmodels. Experimental results show that our approach consistently improves\ndetection accuracy over baseline models. Specifically, VDM-SSMs achieve 74.7\nmAPH (L2) on Waymo, 72.9 NDS on nuScenes, 42.3 mAP on Argoverse 2, and 67.6 mAP\non ONCE, setting new stateof-the-art performance across all datasets.

While\nrecent advances in LLMs and MLLMs have shown that incorporating explicit\nreasoning significantly improves understanding and generalization, reasoning in\nLSMs remains in a nascent stage. Early efforts attempt to transfer the\n\"Thinking-before-Speaking\" paradigm from textual models to speech. However,\nthis sequential formulation introduces notable latency, as spoken responses are\ndelayed until reasoning is fully completed, impairing real-time interaction and\ncommunication efficiency. To address this, we propose Mini-Omni-Reasoner, a\nframework that enables reasoning within speech via a novel\n\"Thinking-in-Speaking\" formulation. Rather than completing reasoning before\nproducing any verbal output, Mini-Omni-Reasoner interleaves silent reasoning\ntokens with spoken response tokens at the token level. This design allows\ncontinuous speech generation while embedding structured internal reasoning,\nleveraging the model's high-frequency token processing capability. Although\ninterleaved, local semantic alignment is enforced to ensure that each response\ntoken is informed by its preceding reasoning. To support this framework, we\nintroduce Spoken-Math-Problems-3M, a large-scale dataset tailored for\ninterleaved reasoning and response. The dataset ensures that verbal tokens\nconsistently follow relevant reasoning content, enabling accurate and efficient\nlearning of speech-coupled reasoning.

To assess their capabilities, several benchmarks have been introduced.\nHowever, current benchmarks in the e-commerce domain face two major problems.\nFirst, they primarily focus on product search tasks (e.g., Find an Apple\nWatch), failing to capture the broader range of functionalities offered by\nreal-world e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, including account management\nand gift card operations. Second, existing benchmarks typically evaluate\nwhether the agent completes the user query, but ignore the potential risks\ninvolved. In practice, web agents can make unintended changes that negatively\nimpact the user account or status. For instance, an agent might purchase the\nwrong item, delete a saved address, or incorrectly configure an auto-reload\nsetting. To address these gaps, we propose a new benchmark called Amazon-Bench.\nTo generate user queries that cover a broad range of tasks, we propose a data\ngeneration pipeline that leverages webpage content and interactive elements\n(e.g., buttons, check boxes) to create diverse, functionality-grounded user\nqueries covering tasks such as address management, wish list management, and\nbrand store following. To improve the agent evaluation, we propose an automated\nevaluation framework that assesses both the performance and the safety of web\nagents. We systematically evaluate different agents, finding that current\nagents struggle with complex queries and pose safety risks. These results\nhighlight the need for developing more robust and reliable web agents."}

The result shows that o1\nis the best-performing text-only model with an overall accuracy of 67.3%, but\nstill lags significantly behind human experts with 12.5%, especially in\ntemporal reasoning and scenario planning capabilities. We further construct a\nknowledge bank with 3,032 finance terms for knowledge augmentation analysis,\nand find that relevant knowledge to the question only brings consistent\naccuracy improvements to small open-source model. Additionally, our error\nanalysis reveals that rounding errors during calculation and blindness to\nposition and intersection of curves in the image are two primary issues leading\nto model's poor performance in calculating and visual-context questions,\nrespectively.

In this work, we introduce HAMSt3R, an\nextension of MASt3R for joint human and scene 3D reconstruction from sparse,\nuncalibrated multi-view images. First, we exploit DUNE, a strong image encoder\nobtained by distilling, among others, the encoders from MASt3R and from a\nstate-of-the-art Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) model, multi-HMR, for a better\nunderstanding of scene geometry and human bodies.

In this work, we investigate the\neffects of existing fine-tuning video generation approaches on structured\ndriving datasets and uncover a potential trade-off: although visual fidelity\nimproves, spatial accuracy in modeling dynamic elements may degrade. We\nattribute this degradation to a shift in the alignment between visual quality\nand dynamic understanding objectives. In datasets with diverse scene structures\nwithin temporal space, where objects or perspective shift in varied ways, these\nobjectives tend to highly correlated. However, the very regular and repetitive\nnature of driving scenes allows visual quality to improve by modeling dominant\nscene motion patterns, without necessarily preserving fine-grained dynamic\nbehavior. As a result, fine-tuning encourages the model to prioritize\nsurface-level realism over dynamic accuracy. To further examine this\nphenomenon, we show that simple continual learning strategies, such as replay\nfrom diverse domains, can offer a balanced alternative by preserving spatial\naccuracy while maintaining strong visual quality."}

Our\nexperimental results demonstrate that current LLMs exhibit considerable room\nfor improvement, highlighting the importance of integrating domain-specific\nknowledge into these models. To facilitate further research, we will\nopen-source the proposed CEQuest dataset, aiming to foster the development of\nspecialized large language models (LLMs) tailored to the construction domain."}

However, deploying these\nmodels as reliable, robust, and scalable classifiers in production environments\npresents significant methodological challenges. Standard fine-tuning approaches\ncan be resource-intensive and often struggle with the dynamic nature of\nreal-world data distributions, which is common in the industry. In this paper,\nwe propose a comprehensive, semi-supervised framework that leverages the zero-\nand few-shot capabilities of LLMs for building hierarchical text classifiers as\na framework for a solution to these industry-wide challenges. Our methodology\nemphasizes an iterative, human-in-the-loop process that begins with domain\nknowledge elicitation and progresses through prompt refinement, hierarchical\nexpansion, and multi-faceted validation. We introduce techniques for assessing\nand mitigating sequence-based biases and outline a protocol for continuous\nmonitoring and adaptation. This framework is designed to bridge the gap between\nthe raw power of LLMs and the practical need for accurate, interpretable, and\nmaintainable classification systems in industry applications."}

Although sarcasm\nand hate speech are regarded as distinct expressions, our work explores whether\nintegrating sarcasm as a pre-training step improves implicit hate speech\ndetection and, by extension, explicit hate speech detection. Incorporating\nsamples from ETHOS, Sarcasm on Reddit, and Implicit Hate Corpus, we devised two\ntraining strategies to compare the effectiveness of sarcasm pre-training on a\nCNN+LSTM and BERT+BiLSTM model. The first strategy is a single-step training\napproach, where a model trained only on sarcasm is then tested on hate speech.\nThe second strategy uses sequential transfer learning to fine-tune models for\nsarcasm, implicit hate, and explicit hate. Our results show that sarcasm\npre-training improved the BERT+BiLSTM's recall by 9.7%, AUC by 7.8%, and\nF1-score by 6% on ETHOS.

By incorporating sarcasm into the\ntraining process, we show that models can more effectively detect both implicit\nand explicit hate."}

How are language and\nimages organized in this joint space, and how do the models encode meaning and\nmodality? To investigate this, we train and release sparse autoencoders (SAEs)\non the embedding spaces of four vision-language models (CLIP, SigLIP, SigLIP2,\nand AIMv2). SAEs approximate model embeddings as sparse linear combinations of\nlearned directions, or \"concepts\". We find that, compared to other methods of\nlinear feature learning, SAEs are better at reconstructing the real embeddings,\nwhile also able to retain the most sparsity. Retraining SAEs with different\nseeds or different data diet leads to two findings: the rare, specific concepts\ncaptured by the SAEs are liable to change drastically, but we also show that\ncommonly-activating concepts are remarkably stable across runs. Interestingly,\nwhile most concepts activate primarily for one modality, we find they are not\nmerely encoding modality per se. Many are almost orthogonal to the subspace\nthat defines modality, and the concept directions do not function as good\nmodality classifiers, suggesting that they encode cross-modal semantics. To\nquantify this bridging behavior, we introduce the Bridge Score, a metric that\nidentifies concept pairs which are both co-activated across aligned image-text\ninputs and geometrically aligned in the shared space. This reveals that even\nsingle-modality concepts can collaborate to support cross-modal integration. We\nrelease interactive demos of the SAEs for all models, allowing researchers to\nexplore the organization of the concept spaces. Overall, our findings uncover a\nsparse linear structure within VLM embedding spaces that is shaped by modality,\nyet stitched together through latent bridges, offering new insight into how\nmultimodal meaning is constructed."}

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled\nfoundation models that can learn from multiple data modalities and support\nclinical tasks. However, most current approaches simply serialize numeric EHR\ndata into text, which risks losing temporal and quantitative detail. We\nintroduce Generative Deep Patient (GDP), a multimodal foundation model that\nnatively encodes structured EHR time-series via a CNN-Transformer encoder and\nfuses it with unstructured EHRs through cross-modal attention into a\nLLaMA-based decoder. GDP is trained in two stages: (1) generative pretraining,\nwhere it learns to produce clinical narratives from raw patient timelines while\nalso performing masked feature prediction (MFP) and next time-step prediction\n(NTP) to capture temporal dynamics; and (2) multi-task fine-tuning for\nclinically meaningful predictions (e.g., heart failure, type 2 diabetes, 30-day\nreadmission). In clinical prediction, GDP demonstrated superior performance on\nMIMIC-IV: heart failure AUROC = 0.923, type 2 diabetes AUROC = 0.817, and\n30-day readmission AUROC = 0.627. For narrative generation, GDP achieved\nROUGE-L = 0.135 and BERTScore-F1 = 0.545. In a blinded human evaluation,\nGDP-Instruct scored highest on faithfulness, fluency, and overall clinical\nutility, suggesting reduced hospital documentation workload without sacrificing\naccuracy.
