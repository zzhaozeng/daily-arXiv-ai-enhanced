To address these challenges, we\nintroduce DreamGym, the first unified framework designed to synthesize diverse\nexperiences with scalability in mind to enable effective online RL training for\nautonomous agents. Rather than relying on expensive real-environment rollouts,\nDreamGym distills environment dynamics into a reasoning-based experience model\nthat derives consistent state transitions and feedback signals through\nstep-by-step reasoning, enabling scalable agent rollout collection for RL. To\nimprove the stability and quality of transitions, DreamGym leverages an\nexperience replay buffer initialized with offline real-world data and\ncontinuously enriched with fresh interactions to actively support agent\ntraining. To improve knowledge acquisition, DreamGym adaptively generates new\ntasks that challenge the current agent policy, enabling more effective online\ncurriculum learning. Experiments across diverse environments and agent\nbackbones demonstrate that DreamGym substantially improves RL training, both in\nfully synthetic settings and in sim-to-real transfer scenarios. On non-RL-ready\ntasks like WebArena, DreamGym outperforms all baselines by over 30%. And in\nRL-ready but costly settings, it matches GRPO and PPO performance using only\nsynthetic interactions. When transferring a policy trained purely on synthetic\nexperiences to real-environment RL, DreamGym yields significant additional\nperformance gains while requiring far fewer real-world interactions, providing\na scalable warm-start strategy for general-purpose RL."}

Despite its significance, tokenization in the\ncontext of assembly code remains an underexplored area. This study aims to\naddress this gap by evaluating the intrinsic properties of Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) tokenization models and parameter choices, such as vocabulary\nsize. We explore preprocessing customization options and pre-tokenization rules\ntailored to the unique characteristics of assembly code. Additionally, we\nassess their impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction -- a\ncritical problem in binary code analysis.\n  To this end, we conduct a thorough study on various tokenization models,\nsystematically analyzing their efficiency in encoding assembly instructions and\ncapturing semantic nuances. Through intrinsic evaluations, we compare\ntokenizers based on tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, and\nrepresentational fidelity for assembly code. Using state-of-the-art pre-trained\nmodels such as the decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) Llama 3.2, the\nencoder-only transformer BERT, and the encoder-decoder model BART, we evaluate\nthe effectiveness of these tokenizers across multiple performance metrics.\nPreliminary findings indicate that tokenizer choice significantly influences\ndownstream performance, with intrinsic metrics providing partial but incomplete\npredictability of extrinsic evaluation outcomes.

Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), which\nleverages a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict student knowledge and\nperformance on exercises, has been proposed as a major advancement over\ntraditional KT methods. Several studies suggest that its performance gains stem\nfrom its ability to model bidirectional relationships between different\nknowledge components (KCs) within a course, enabling the inference of a\nstudent's understanding of one KC from their performance on others. In this\npaper, we challenge this prevailing explanation and demonstrate that DKT's\nstrength lies in its implicit ability to model prerequisite relationships as a\ncausal structure, rather than bidirectional relationships. By pruning exercise\nrelation graphs into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and training DKT on causal\nsubsets of the Assistments dataset, we show that DKT's predictive capabilities\nalign strongly with these causal structures. Furthermore, we propose an\nalternative method for extracting exercise relation DAGs using DKT's learned\nrepresentations and provide empirical evidence supporting our claim. Our\nfindings suggest that DKT's effectiveness is largely driven by its capacity to\napproximate causal dependencies between KCs rather than simple relational\nmappings."}

At the same\ntime, there are well-documented imbalances in the training data and\noptimisation objectives of this technology, raising doubts as to whether LLMs\ncan represent the cultural diversity of their broad user base. In this study,\nwe look at LLMs and cultural values and examine how prompt language and\ncultural framing influence model responses and their alignment with human\nvalues in different countries. We probe 10 LLMs with 63 items from the Hofstede\nValues Survey Module and World Values Survey, translated into 11 languages, and\nformulated as prompts with and without different explicit cultural\nperspectives. Our study confirms that both prompt language and cultural\nperspective produce variation in LLM outputs, but with an important caveat:\nWhile targeted prompting can, to a certain extent, steer LLM responses in the\ndirection of the predominant values of the corresponding countries, it does not\novercome the models' systematic bias toward the values associated with a\nrestricted set of countries in our dataset: the Netherlands, Germany, the US,\nand Japan. All tested models, regardless of their origin, exhibit remarkably\nsimilar patterns: They produce fairly neutral responses on most topics, with\nselective progressive stances on issues such as social tolerance. Alignment\nwith cultural values of human respondents is improved more with an explicit\ncultural perspective than with a targeted prompt language. Unexpectedly,\ncombining both approaches is no more effective than cultural framing with an\nEnglish prompt. These findings reveal that LLMs occupy an uncomfortable middle\nground: They are responsive enough to changes in prompts to produce variation,\nbut too firmly anchored to specific cultural defaults to adequately represent\ncultural diversity."}

Materials and Methods: In this\nretrospective study, we built upon a state-of-the-art, transformer-based, PHI\nde-identification pipeline by fine-tuning on two large annotated radiology\ncorpora from Stanford University, encompassing chest X-ray, chest CT,\nabdomen/pelvis CT, and brain MR reports and introducing an additional PHI\ncategory (AGE) into the architecture. Model performance was evaluated on test\nsets from Stanford and the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) for token-level\nPHI detection. We further assessed (1) the stability of synthetic PHI\ngeneration using a \"hide-in-plain-sight\" method and (2) performance against\ncommercial systems. Precision, recall, and F1 scores were computed across all\nPHI categories. Results: Our model achieved overall F1 scores of 0.973 on the\nPenn dataset and 0.996 on the Stanford dataset, outperforming or maintaining\nthe previous state-of-the-art model performance. Synthetic PHI evaluation\nshowed consistent detectability (overall F1: 0.959 [0.958-0.960]) across 50\nindependently de-identified Penn datasets. Our model outperformed all vendor\nsystems on synthetic Penn reports (overall F1: 0.960 vs. 0.632-0.754).\nDiscussion: Large-scale, multimodal training improved cross-institutional\ngeneralization and robustness. Synthetic PHI generation preserved data utility\nwhile ensuring privacy.

Yet, since they\nwere not originally designed for DM, recent studies show that LLMs can struggle\neven in basic online DM problems, failing to achieve low regret or an effective\nexploration-exploitation tradeoff. To address this, we introduce Iterative\nRegret-Minimization Fine-Tuning (Iterative RMFT), a post-training procedure\nthat repeatedly distills low-regret decision trajectories back into the base\nmodel. At each iteration, the model rolls out multiple decision trajectories,\nselects the k-lowest regret ones, and fine-tunes itself on them. Unlike prior\nmethods that (a) distill action sequences from known DM algorithms or (b) rely\non manually crafted chain-of-thought templates, our approach leverages the\nregret metric to elicit the model's own DM ability and reasoning rationales.\nThis reliance on model-generated reasoning avoids rigid output engineering and\nprovides more flexible, natural-language training signals. Empirical results\nshow that Iterative RMFT improves LLMs' DM performance across diverse models -\nfrom Transformers with numerical input/output, to open-weight LLMs, and\nadvanced closed-weight models like GPT-4o mini. Its flexibility in output and\nreasoning formats enables generalization across tasks with varying horizons,\naction spaces, reward processes, and natural-language contexts.

Instead of treating ambiguity as a deficiency, we reframe it as a\nfeature of cooperative interaction, where the responsibility of query\nspecification is shared among the user and the system. We develop a principled\nframework distinguishing cooperative queries, i.e., queries that yield a\nresolvable interpretation, from uncooperative queries that cannot be resolved.\nApplying the framework to evaluations for tabular question answering and\nanalysis, we analyze the queries in 15 popular datasets, and observe an\nuncontrolled mixing of query types neither adequate for evaluating a system's\nexecution accuracy nor for evaluating interpretation capabilities. Our\nframework and analysis of queries shifts the perspective from fixing ambiguity\nto embracing cooperation in resolving queries. This reflection enables more\ninformed design and evaluation for natural language interfaces for tabular\ndata, for which we outline implications and directions for future research."}

LAAC (LLM as a Communicator)\nproposes a paradigm shift - positioning LLMs as intelligent communication\nintermediaries that capture the sender's intent through structured dialogue and\nfacilitate genuine knowledge exchange with recipients. Rather than perpetuating\ncycles of AI-generated inflation and compression, LAAC enables authentic\ncommunication across diverse contexts including academic papers, proposals,\nprofessional emails, and cross-platform content generation. However, deploying\nLLMs as trusted communication intermediaries raises critical questions about\ninformation fidelity, consistency, and reliability. This position paper\nsystematically evaluates the trustworthiness requirements for LAAC's deployment\nacross multiple communication domains. We investigate three fundamental\ndimensions: (1) Information Capture Fidelity - accuracy of intent extraction\nduring sender interviews across different communication types, (2)\nReproducibility - consistency of structured knowledge across multiple\ninteraction instances, and (3) Query Response Integrity - reliability of\nrecipient-facing responses without hallucination, source conflation, or\nfabrication. Through controlled experiments spanning multiple LAAC use cases,\nwe assess these trust dimensions using LAAC's multi-agent architecture.\nPreliminary findings reveal measurable trust gaps that must be addressed before\nLAAC can be reliably deployed in high-stakes communication scenarios."}

Despite its significance, tokenization in the\ncontext of assembly code remains an underexplored area. This study aims to\naddress this gap by evaluating the intrinsic properties of Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) tokenization models and parameter choices, such as vocabulary\nsize. We explore preprocessing customization options and pre-tokenization rules\ntailored to the unique characteristics of assembly code. Additionally, we\nassess their impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction -- a\ncritical problem in binary code analysis.\n  To this end, we conduct a thorough study on various tokenization models,\nsystematically analyzing their efficiency in encoding assembly instructions and\ncapturing semantic nuances. Through intrinsic evaluations, we compare\ntokenizers based on tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, and\nrepresentational fidelity for assembly code. Using state-of-the-art pre-trained\nmodels such as the decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) Llama 3.2, the\nencoder-only transformer BERT, and the encoder-decoder model BART, we evaluate\nthe effectiveness of these tokenizers across multiple performance metrics.\nPreliminary findings indicate that tokenizer choice significantly influences\ndownstream performance, with intrinsic metrics providing partial but incomplete\npredictability of extrinsic evaluation outcomes.

At the same\ntime, there are well-documented imbalances in the training data and\noptimisation objectives of this technology, raising doubts as to whether LLMs\ncan represent the cultural diversity of their broad user base. In this study,\nwe look at LLMs and cultural values and examine how prompt language and\ncultural framing influence model responses and their alignment with human\nvalues in different countries. We probe 10 LLMs with 63 items from the Hofstede\nValues Survey Module and World Values Survey, translated into 11 languages, and\nformulated as prompts with and without different explicit cultural\nperspectives. Our study confirms that both prompt language and cultural\nperspective produce variation in LLM outputs, but with an important caveat:\nWhile targeted prompting can, to a certain extent, steer LLM responses in the\ndirection of the predominant values of the corresponding countries, it does not\novercome the models' systematic bias toward the values associated with a\nrestricted set of countries in our dataset: the Netherlands, Germany, the US,\nand Japan. All tested models, regardless of their origin, exhibit remarkably\nsimilar patterns: They produce fairly neutral responses on most topics, with\nselective progressive stances on issues such as social tolerance. Alignment\nwith cultural values of human respondents is improved more with an explicit\ncultural perspective than with a targeted prompt language. Unexpectedly,\ncombining both approaches is no more effective than cultural framing with an\nEnglish prompt. These findings reveal that LLMs occupy an uncomfortable middle\nground: They are responsive enough to changes in prompts to produce variation,\nbut too firmly anchored to specific cultural defaults to adequately represent\ncultural diversity."}

Yet\nhow closely LLMs mirror actual human decision-making remains poorly understood.\nThis gap is critical: misalignment could produce harmful outcomes in practical\napplications, while failure to replicate human behavior renders LLMs\nineffective for social simulations. Here, we address this gap by developing a\ndigital twin of game-theoretic experiments and introducing a systematic\nprompting and probing framework for machine-behavioral evaluation. Testing\nthree open-source models (Llama, Mistral and Qwen), we find that Llama\nreproduces human cooperation patterns with high fidelity, capturing human\ndeviations from rational choice theory, while Qwen aligns closely with Nash\nequilibrium predictions. Notably, we achieved population-level behavioral\nreplication without persona-based prompting, simplifying the simulation\nprocess. Extending beyond the original human-tested games, we generate and\npreregister testable hypotheses for novel game configurations outside the\noriginal parameter grid. Our findings demonstrate that appropriately calibrated\nLLMs can replicate aggregate human behavioral patterns and enable systematic\nexploration of unexplored experimental spaces, offering a complementary\napproach to traditional research in the social and behavioral sciences that\ngenerates new empirical predictions about human social decision-making."}

To this end,\nwe develop Jr. AI Scientist, a state-of-the-art autonomous AI scientist system\nthat mimics the core research workflow of a novice student researcher: Given\nthe baseline paper from the human mentor, it analyzes its limitations,\nformulates novel hypotheses for improvement, validates them through rigorous\nexperimentation, and writes a paper with the results. Unlike previous\napproaches that assume full automation or operate on small-scale code, Jr. AI\nScientist follows a well-defined research workflow and leverages modern coding\nagents to handle complex, multi-file implementations, leading to scientifically\nvaluable contributions. For evaluation, we conducted automated assessments\nusing AI Reviewers, author-led evaluations, and submissions to Agents4Science,\na venue dedicated to AI-driven scientific contributions. The findings\ndemonstrate that Jr. AI Scientist generates papers receiving higher review\nscores than existing fully automated systems. Nevertheless, we identify\nimportant limitations from both the author evaluation and the Agents4Science\nreviews, indicating the potential risks of directly applying current AI\nScientist systems and key challenges for future research. Finally, we\ncomprehensively report various risks identified during development. We hope\nthese insights will deepen understanding of current progress and risks in AI\nScientist development."}

On Ambiguity in Natural Language Queries for Tabular Data Analysis", "comment": "Accepted to the AI for Tabular Data workshop at EurIPS 2025", "summary": "Natural language interfaces to tabular data must handle ambiguities inherent\nto queries. Instead of treating ambiguity as a deficiency, we reframe it as a\nfeature of cooperative interaction, where the responsibility of query\nspecification is shared among the user and the system. We develop a principled\nframework distinguishing cooperative queries, i.e., queries that yield a\nresolvable interpretation, from uncooperative queries that cannot be resolved.\nApplying the framework to evaluations for tabular question answering and\nanalysis, we analyze the queries in 15 popular datasets, and observe an\nuncontrolled mixing of query types neither adequate for evaluating a system's\nexecution accuracy nor for evaluating interpretation capabilities. Our\nframework and analysis of queries shifts the perspective from fixing ambiguity\nto embracing cooperation in resolving queries. This reflection enables more\ninformed design and evaluation for natural language interfaces for tabular\ndata, for which we outline implications and directions for future research."}

WELL: Dynamic Reasoning and Learning with Symbolic World Model for Embodied LLM-Based Multi-Agent Collaboration", "comment": null, "summary": "Cooperative multi-agent planning requires agents to make joint decisions with\npartial information and limited communication. Coordination at the trajectory\nlevel often fails, as small deviations in timing or movement cascade into\nconflicts. Symbolic planning mitigates this challenge by raising the level of\nabstraction and providing a minimal vocabulary of actions that enable\nsynchronization and collective progress. We present DR. WELL, a decentralized\nneurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning. Cooperation\nunfolds through a two-phase negotiation protocol: agents first propose\ncandidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under\nconsensus and environment constraints. After commitment, each agent\nindependently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without\nrevealing detailed trajectories. Plans are grounded in execution outcomes via a\nshared world model that encodes the current state and is updated as agents act.\nBy reasoning over symbolic plans rather than raw trajectories, DR. WELL avoids\nbrittle step-level alignment and enables higher-level operations that are\nreusable, synchronizable, and interpretable. Experiments on cooperative\nblock-push tasks show that agents adapt across episodes, with the dynamic world\nmodel capturing reusable patterns and improving task completion rates and\nefficiency. Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show that our dynamic\nworld model improves task completion and efficiency through negotiation and\nself-refinement, trading a time overhead for evolving, more efficient\ncollaboration strategies."}

Even when they reach correct\nanswers, the underlying reasoning may be flawed, undermining trust in\nhigh-stakes scenarios. To mitigate this issue, we introduce VeriCoT, a\nneuro-symbolic method that extracts and verifies formal logical arguments from\nCoT reasoning. VeriCoT formalizes each CoT reasoning step into first-order\nlogic and identifies premises that ground the argument in source context,\ncommonsense knowledge, or prior reasoning steps. The symbolic representation\nenables automated solvers to verify logical validity while the NL premises\nallow humans and systems to identify ungrounded or fallacious reasoning steps.\nExperiments on the ProofWriter, LegalBench, and BioASQ datasets show VeriCoT\neffectively identifies flawed reasoning, and serves as a strong predictor of\nfinal answer correctness. We also leverage VeriCoT's verification signal for\n(1) inference-time self-reflection, (2) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on\nVeriCoT-distilled datasets and (3) preference fine-tuning (PFT) with direct\npreference optimization (DPO) using verification-based pairwise rewards,\nfurther improving reasoning validity and accuracy."}
