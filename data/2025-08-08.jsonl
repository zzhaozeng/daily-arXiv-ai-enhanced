This phenomenon ultimately amplifies computational and\nfinancial inequalities between users from different language backgrounds. To\nremedy this, we introduce Parity-aware Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), a variant of\nthe widely-used BPE algorithm.

Methods: We present a\nmulti-stage large language model framework to enhance SDoH factor extraction\nfrom unstructured text. Our approach was compared to other state-of-the-art\nlanguage models (i.e., pre-trained BioBERT and GPT-3.5-turbo) and reasoning\nmodels (i.e., DeepSeek-R1). We also evaluated how the model's explanations help\npeople annotate SDoH factors more quickly and accurately. The analysis included\nboth automated comparisons and a pilot user study. Results: We show that our\nproposed framework demonstrated performance boosts in the overarching task of\nextracting SDoH factors and in the finer-grained tasks of retrieving relevant\ncontext. Additionally, we show that fine-tuning a smaller, task-specific model\nachieves comparable or better performance with reduced inference costs.

This representation allows\nusers to define their desired illumination configuration in 3D. The scene under\nthe new lighting can then be rendered using a path-tracing engine.

However, the\nrobustness of standard SSL methods to domain shift -- systematic differences\nacross data sources -- remains uncertain, posing an especially critical\nchallenge in biomedical imaging where batch effects can obscure true biological\nsignals. We present AdvDINO, a domain-adversarial self-supervised learning\nframework that integrates a gradient reversal layer into the DINOv2\narchitecture to promote domain-invariant feature learning. Applied to a\nreal-world cohort of six-channel multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) whole slide\nimages from non-small cell lung cancer patients, AdvDINO mitigates\nslide-specific biases to learn more robust and biologically meaningful\nrepresentations than non-adversarial baselines. Across $>5.46$ million mIF\nimage tiles, the model uncovers phenotype clusters with distinct proteomic\nprofiles and prognostic significance, and improves survival prediction in\nattention-based multiple instance learning. While demonstrated on mIF data,\nAdvDINO is broadly applicable to other imaging domains -- including radiology,\nremote sensing, and autonomous driving -- where domain shift and limited\nannotated data hinder model generalization and interpretability."}

Our findings reveal that direct UDA with the presence\nof modality gap only transfers modality-invariant knowledge, leading to\nsuboptimal target performance. To address this limitation, we propose a unified\nmodality separation framework that accommodates both modality-specific and\nmodality-invariant components. During training, different modality components\nare disentangled from VLM features then handled separately in a unified manner.\nAt test time, modality-adaptive ensemble weights are automatically determined\nto maximize the synergy of different components. To evaluate instance-level\nmodality characteristics, we design a modality discrepancy metric to categorize\nsamples into modality-invariant, modality-specific, and uncertain ones. The\nmodality-invariant samples are exploited to facilitate cross-modal alignment,\nwhile uncertain ones are annotated to enhance model capabilities. Building upon\nprompt tuning techniques, our methods achieve up to 9% performance gain with 9\ntimes of computational efficiencies. Extensive experiments and analysis across\nvarious backbones, baselines, datasets and adaptation settings demonstrate the\nefficacy of our design."}

This work is the first\nto perform online fault prediction with natural language and visual\nexplainability. The experiments were performed with the MetroPT data set from\nthe metro operator of Porto, Portugal. The results are above 98 % for F-measure\nand 99 % for accuracy. In the context of railway predictive maintenance,\nachieving these high values is crucial due to the practical and operational\nimplications of accurate failure prediction. In the specific case of a high\nF-measure, this ensures that the system maintains an optimal balance between\ndetecting the highest possible number of real faults and minimizing false\nalarms, which is crucial for maximizing service availability. Furthermore, the\naccuracy obtained enables reliability, directly impacting cost reduction and\nincreased safety. The analysis demonstrates that the pipeline maintains high\nperformance even in the presence of class imbalance and noise, and its\nexplanations effectively reflect the decision-making process.

In this study, we employ a Vision\nTransformer (ViT)-based autoencoder to investigate, from a functional\nperspective, how familiarity training can induce sensitivity to global context\nin the early layers of a deep neural network. We hypothesize that rapid\nlearning operates via fast weights, which encode transient or short-term memory\ntraces, and we explore the use of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to implement such\nfast weights within each Transformer layer. Our results show that (1) The\nproposed ViT-based autoencoder's self-attention circuit performs a manifold\ntransform similar to a neural circuit model of the familiarity effect.

To address these challenges, we\nintroduce LearnerAgent, a novel multi-agent framework based on Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to simulate a realistic teaching environment. To explore\nhuman-like learning dynamics, we construct learners with psychologically\ngrounded profiles-such as Deep, Surface, and Lazy-as well as a persona-free\nGeneral Learner to inspect the base LLM's default behavior. Through weekly\nknowledge acquisition, monthly strategic choices, periodic tests, and peer\ninteraction, we can track the dynamic learning progress of individual learners\nover a full-year journey. Our findings are fourfold: 1) Longitudinal analysis\nreveals that only Deep Learner achieves sustained cognitive growth. Our\nspecially designed \"trap questions\" effectively diagnose Surface Learner's\nshallow knowledge. 2) The behavioral and cognitive patterns of distinct\nlearners align closely with their psychological profiles. 3) Learners'\nself-concept scores evolve realistically, with the General Learner developing\nsurprisingly high self-efficacy despite its cognitive limitations. 4)\nCritically, the default profile of base LLM is a \"diligent but brittle Surface\nLearner\"-an agent that mimics the behaviors of a good student but lacks true,\ngeneralizable understanding.

To address these issues,\nwe propose Cooper(Co-optimizing Policy Model and Reward Model), a RL framework\nthat jointly optimizes both the policy model and the reward model. Cooper\nleverages the high precision of rule-based rewards when identifying correct\nresponses, and dynamically constructs and selects positive-negative sample\npairs for continued training the reward model.

Based on this design, we train a reward model named VerifyRM, which\nachieves higher accuracy on VerifyBench compared to other models of the same\nsize. We conduct reinforcement learning using both VerifyRM and Cooper.

Specifically, QA-Dragon introduces a domain router to\nidentify the query's subject domain for domain-specific reasoning, along with a\nsearch router that dynamically selects optimal retrieval strategies. By\norchestrating both text and image search agents in a hybrid setup, our system\nsupports multimodal, multi-turn, and multi-hop reasoning, enabling it to tackle\ncomplex VQA tasks effectively. We evaluate our QA-Dragon on the Meta CRAG-MM\nChallenge at KDD Cup 2025, where it significantly enhances the reasoning\nperformance of base models under challenging scenarios. Our framework achieves\nsubstantial improvements in both answer accuracy and knowledge overlap scores,\noutperforming baselines by 5.06% on the single-source task, 6.35% on the\nmulti-source task, and 5.03% on the multi-turn task."}

Achieving high-quality\nresults is challenging due to the large variability of clothed body especially\nin the generation of realistic wrinkles. 3D scan acquisitions provide more\naccuracy in the representation of real-world objects but lack semantic\ninformation that can be inferred with a reliable semantic reconstruction\npipeline. To this aim, shape segmentation plays a crucial role in identifying\nthe semantic shape parts. However, current 3D shape segmentation methods are\ndesigned for scene understanding and interpretation and only few work is\ndevoted to modeling. In the context of clothed body modeling the segmentation\nis a preliminary step for fully semantic shape parts reconstruction namely the\nunderlying body and the involved garments. These parts represent several layers\nwith strong overlap in contrast with standard segmentation methods that provide\ndisjoint sets. In this work we propose a new 3D point cloud segmentation\nparadigm where each 3D point can be simultaneously associated to different\nlayers. In this fashion we can estimate the underlying body parts and the\nunseen clothed regions, i.e., the part of a cloth occluded by the clothed-layer\nabove. We name this segmentation paradigm clothed human layering. We create a\nnew synthetic dataset that simulates very realistic 3D scans with the ground\ntruth of the involved clothing layers. We propose and evaluate different neural\nnetwork settings to deal with 3D clothing layering. We considered both coarse\nand fine grained per-layer garment identification. Our experiments demonstrates\nthe benefit in introducing proper strategies for the segmentation on the\ngarment domain on both the synthetic and real-world scan datasets."}

SIGGRAPH 2025, 10 pages, 9 figures", "summary": "We present a self-supervised approach to in-the-wild image relighting that\nenables fully controllable, physically based illumination editing. We achieve\nthis by combining the physical accuracy of traditional rendering with the\nphotorealistic appearance made possible by neural rendering. Our pipeline works\nby inferring a colored mesh representation of a given scene using monocular\nestimates of geometry and intrinsic components. This representation allows\nusers to define their desired illumination configuration in 3D. The scene under\nthe new lighting can then be rendered using a path-tracing engine. We send this\napproximate rendering of the scene through a feed-forward neural renderer to\npredict the final photorealistic relighting result. We develop a differentiable\nrendering process to reconstruct in-the-wild scene illumination, enabling\nself-supervised training of our neural renderer on raw image collections. Our\nmethod represents a significant step in bringing the explicit physical control\nover lights available in typical 3D computer graphics tools, such as Blender,\nto in-the-wild relighting."}
