### [1] [Lumina-mGPT 2.0: Stand-Alone AutoRegressive Image Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17801)
*Yi Xin,Juncheng Yan,Qi Qin,Zhen Li,Dongyang Liu,Shicheng Li,Victor Shea-Jay Huang,Yupeng Zhou,Renrui Zhang,Le Zhuo,Tiancheng Han,Xiaoqing Sun,Siqi Luo,Mengmeng Wang,Bin Fu,Yuewen Cao,Hongsheng Li,Guangtao Zhai,Xiaohong Liu,Yu Qiao,Peng Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lumina-mGPT 2.0是一个独立的解码器自回归模型，通过从头训练实现高质量图像生成，性能媲美扩散模型，支持多任务处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视并振兴自回归范式，以提供高质量图像生成，同时避免依赖预训练组件或混合架构。

Method: 采用统一的分词方案和高效解码策略（如推理时间缩放和推测性Jacobi采样），从头训练模型。

Result: 在标准文本到图像基准测试中表现优异，甚至超越扩散模型，同时在多任务基准测试中表现出色。

Conclusion: Lumina-mGPT 2.0是一个强大、灵活的统一多模态生成基础模型。

Abstract: We present Lumina-mGPT 2.0, a stand-alone, decoder-only autoregressive model
that revisits and revitalizes the autoregressive paradigm for high-quality
image generation and beyond. Unlike existing approaches that rely on pretrained
components or hybrid architectures, Lumina-mGPT 2.0 is trained entirely from
scratch, enabling unrestricted architectural design and licensing freedom. It
achieves generation quality on par with state-of-the-art diffusion models such
as DALL-E 3 and SANA, while preserving the inherent flexibility and
compositionality of autoregressive modeling. Our unified tokenization scheme
allows the model to seamlessly handle a wide spectrum of tasks-including
subject-driven generation, image editing, controllable synthesis, and dense
prediction-within a single generative framework. To further boost usability, we
incorporate efficient decoding strategies like inference-time scaling and
speculative Jacobi sampling to improve quality and speed, respectively.
Extensive evaluations on standard text-to-image benchmarks (e.g., GenEval, DPG)
demonstrate that Lumina-mGPT 2.0 not only matches but in some cases surpasses
diffusion-based models. Moreover, we confirm its multi-task capabilities on the
Graph200K benchmark, with the native Lumina-mGPT 2.0 performing exceptionally
well. These results position Lumina-mGPT 2.0 as a strong, flexible foundation
model for unified multimodal generation. We have released our training details,
code, and models at https://github.com/Alpha-VLLM/Lumina-mGPT-2.0.

### [2] [SV3.3B: A Sports Video Understanding Model for Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17844)
*Sai Varun Kodathala,Yashwanth Reddy Vutukoori,Rakesh Vunnam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SV3.3B是一个轻量级的3.3B参数视频理解模型，用于自动化体育视频分析，通过创新的时间运动差异采样和自监督学习实现高效设备端部署，性能优于GPT-4o。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统体育视频分析模型计算量大且缺乏对运动细节的理解，无法捕捉关键的运动阶段（如准备、执行和后续动作）。

Method: 采用DWT-VGG16-LDA关键帧提取机制和V-DWT-JEPA2编码器，结合LLM解码器生成体育动作描述。

Result: 在NSVA篮球数据集上，SV3.3B在文本生成和体育特定评估指标上表现优异，性能提升29.2%，信息密度和动作复杂性显著改进。

Conclusion: SV3.3B为体育视频分析提供了高效、技术细节丰富的解决方案，适合设备端部署。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of automated sports video analysis, which
has traditionally been limited by computationally intensive models requiring
server-side processing and lacking fine-grained understanding of athletic
movements. Current approaches struggle to capture the nuanced biomechanical
transitions essential for meaningful sports analysis, often missing critical
phases like preparation, execution, and follow-through that occur within
seconds. To address these limitations, we introduce SV3.3B, a lightweight 3.3B
parameter video understanding model that combines novel temporal motion
difference sampling with self-supervised learning for efficient on-device
deployment. Our approach employs a DWT-VGG16-LDA based keyframe extraction
mechanism that intelligently identifies the 16 most representative frames from
sports sequences, followed by a V-DWT-JEPA2 encoder pretrained through
mask-denoising objectives and an LLM decoder fine-tuned for sports action
description generation. Evaluated on a subset of the NSVA basketball dataset,
SV3.3B achieves superior performance across both traditional text generation
metrics and sports-specific evaluation criteria, outperforming larger
closed-source models including GPT-4o variants while maintaining significantly
lower computational requirements. Our model demonstrates exceptional capability
in generating technically detailed and analytically rich sports descriptions,
achieving 29.2% improvement over GPT-4o in ground truth validation metrics,
with substantial improvements in information density, action complexity, and
measurement precision metrics essential for comprehensive athletic analysis.

### [3] [Detail++: Training-Free Detail Enhancer for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17853)
*Lifeng Chen,Jiner Wang,Zihao Pan,Beier Zhu,Xiaofeng Yang,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Detail++是一个无需训练的框架，通过渐进式细节注入策略（PDI）解决复杂提示下多主体生成的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成模型在处理多主体复杂提示时表现不佳，受人类绘画过程启发，提出分阶段生成方法。

Method: 将复杂提示分解为简化子提示，利用自注意力机制分阶段生成，并通过交叉注意力机制和质心对齐损失优化属性绑定。

Result: 在T2I-CompBench和新构建的风格组合基准上，Detail++显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Detail++通过分阶段生成和优化机制，有效提升了复杂提示下的图像生成质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have led to impressive
visual results. However, these models still face significant challenges when
handling complex prompt, particularly those involving multiple subjects with
distinct attributes. Inspired by the human drawing process, which first
outlines the composition and then incrementally adds details, we propose
Detail++, a training-free framework that introduces a novel Progressive Detail
Injection (PDI) strategy to address this limitation. Specifically, we decompose
a complex prompt into a sequence of simplified sub-prompts, guiding the
generation process in stages. This staged generation leverages the inherent
layout-controlling capacity of self-attention to first ensure global
composition, followed by precise refinement. To achieve accurate binding
between attributes and corresponding subjects, we exploit cross-attention
mechanisms and further introduce a Centroid Alignment Loss at test time to
reduce binding noise and enhance attribute consistency. Extensive experiments
on T2I-CompBench and a newly constructed style composition benchmark
demonstrate that Detail++ significantly outperforms existing methods,
particularly in scenarios involving multiple objects and complex stylistic
conditions.

### [4] [FishDet-M: A Unified Large-Scale Benchmark for Robust Fish Detection and CLIP-Guided Model Selection in Diverse Aquatic Visual Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17859)
*Muayad Abujabal,Lyes Saad Saoud,Irfan Hussain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FishDet-M是一个统一的水下鱼类检测基准，整合了13个公开数据集，评估了28种目标检测模型，并提出了基于CLIP的模型选择框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决水下鱼类检测中数据集碎片化、成像条件异质性和评估协议不一致的问题。

Method: 整合13个数据集，使用COCO风格标注，评估28种模型，引入CLIP框架动态选择模型。

Result: 模型性能差异显著，CLIP框架实现了高效零-shot选择。

Conclusion: FishDet-M为水下计算机视觉提供了标准化评估平台，支持实时应用。

Abstract: Accurate fish detection in underwater imagery is essential for ecological
monitoring, aquaculture automation, and robotic perception. However, practical
deployment remains limited by fragmented datasets, heterogeneous imaging
conditions, and inconsistent evaluation protocols. To address these gaps, we
present \textit{FishDet-M}, the largest unified benchmark for fish detection,
comprising 13 publicly available datasets spanning diverse aquatic environments
including marine, brackish, occluded, and aquarium scenes. All data are
harmonized using COCO-style annotations with both bounding boxes and
segmentation masks, enabling consistent and scalable cross-domain evaluation.
We systematically benchmark 28 contemporary object detection models, covering
the YOLOv8 to YOLOv12 series, R-CNN based detectors, and DETR based models.
Evaluations are conducted using standard metrics including mAP, mAP@50, and
mAP@75, along with scale-specific analyses (AP$_S$, AP$_M$, AP$_L$) and
inference profiling in terms of latency and parameter count. The results
highlight the varying detection performance across models trained on FishDet-M,
as well as the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency across models of
different architectures. To support adaptive deployment, we introduce a
CLIP-based model selection framework that leverages vision-language alignment
to dynamically identify the most semantically appropriate detector for each
input image. This zero-shot selection strategy achieves high performance
without requiring ensemble computation, offering a scalable solution for
real-time applications. FishDet-M establishes a standardized and reproducible
platform for evaluating object detection in complex aquatic scenes. All
datasets, pretrained models, and evaluation tools are publicly available to
facilitate future research in underwater computer vision and intelligent marine
systems.

### [5] [Towards Facilitated Fairness Assessment of AI-based Skin Lesion Classifiers Through GenAI-based Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17860)
*Ko Watanabe. Stanislav Frolov. Adriano Lucieri. Andreas Dengel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究利用生成式AI模型评估皮肤癌分类器的公平性，发现合成数据在公平性评估中具有潜力，但数据差异可能影响结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在皮肤癌筛查中的应用存在潜在偏见，评估和改进公平性至关重要。

Method: 使用生成式AI模型（LightningDiT）生成合成数据，评估公开可用的黑色素瘤分类器的公平性。

Result: 合成数据在公平性评估中表现良好，但数据差异可能导致验证困难。

Conclusion: 合成数据为评估和改进医疗影像AI系统的公平性提供了新途径。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Deep Learning and its application on the edge hold
great potential for the revolution of routine screenings for skin cancers like
Melanoma. Along with the anticipated benefits of this technology, potential
dangers arise from unforseen and inherent biases. Thus, assessing and improving
the fairness of such systems is of utmost importance. A key challenge in
fairness assessment is to ensure that the evaluation dataset is sufficiently
representative of different Personal Identifiable Information (PII) (sex, age,
and race) and other minority groups. Against the backdrop of this challenge,
this study leverages the state-of-the-art Generative AI (GenAI) LightningDiT
model to assess the fairness of publicly available melanoma classifiers. The
results suggest that fairness assessment using highly realistic synthetic data
is a promising direction. Yet, our findings indicate that verifying fairness
becomes difficult when the melanoma-detection model used for evaluation is
trained on data that differ from the dataset underpinning the synthetic images.
Nonetheless, we propose that our approach offers a valuable new avenue for
employing synthetic data to gauge and enhance fairness in medical-imaging GenAI
systems.

### [6] [DiNAT-IR: Exploring Dilated Neighborhood Attention for High-Quality Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17892)
*Hanzhou Liu,Binghan Li,Chengkai Liu,Mi Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Transformer的图像修复方法DiNAT-IR，通过结合局部和全局注意力机制，解决了传统方法在高效性和质量上的平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的自注意力机制在高分辨率图像修复中计算成本高，而通道自注意力可能忽略局部细节。DiNAT-IR旨在平衡全局上下文和局部精度。

Method: 采用Dilated Neighborhood Attention (DiNA)结合滑动窗口注意力和混合膨胀因子，并引入通道感知模块以补充全局上下文。

Result: DiNAT-IR在多个基准测试中取得竞争性结果，为低层次计算机视觉问题提供了高质量解决方案。

Conclusion: DiNAT-IR通过结合局部和全局注意力机制，在图像修复任务中实现了高效性和质量的平衡。

Abstract: Transformers, with their self-attention mechanisms for modeling long-range
dependencies, have become a dominant paradigm in image restoration tasks.
However, the high computational cost of self-attention limits scalability to
high-resolution images, making efficiency-quality trade-offs a key research
focus. To address this, Restormer employs channel-wise self-attention, which
computes attention across channels instead of spatial dimensions. While
effective, this approach may overlook localized artifacts that are crucial for
high-quality image restoration. To bridge this gap, we explore Dilated
Neighborhood Attention (DiNA) as a promising alternative, inspired by its
success in high-level vision tasks. DiNA balances global context and local
precision by integrating sliding-window attention with mixed dilation factors,
effectively expanding the receptive field without excessive overhead. However,
our preliminary experiments indicate that directly applying this global-local
design to the classic deblurring task hinders accurate visual restoration,
primarily due to the constrained global context understanding within local
attention. To address this, we introduce a channel-aware module that
complements local attention, effectively integrating global context without
sacrificing pixel-level precision. The proposed DiNAT-IR, a Transformer-based
architecture specifically designed for image restoration, achieves competitive
results across multiple benchmarks, offering a high-quality solution for
diverse low-level computer vision problems.

### [7] [AFRDA: Attentive Feature Refinement for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17957)
*Md. Al-Masrur Khan,Durgakant Pushp,Lantao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自适应特征细化（AFR）模块，用于提升无监督域自适应语义分割（UDA-SS）的性能，通过结合高低分辨率特征和高频组件，优化局部与全局信息的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有UDA-SS方法在平衡局部细节与全局上下文信息时表现不佳，导致复杂区域的分割错误。

Method: 引入AFR模块，利用低分辨率语义先验细化高分辨率特征，并整合高频组件以捕捉细节和边界信息，同时通过不确定性驱动注意力自适应平衡信息。

Result: 在GTA V→Cityscapes和Synthia→Cityscapes数据集上分别提升了1.05%和1.04%的mIoU。

Conclusion: AFR模块轻量且高效，能无缝集成到HRDA方法中，显著提升分割性能。

Abstract: In Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation (UDA-SS), a model is
trained on labeled source domain data (e.g., synthetic images) and adapted to
an unlabeled target domain (e.g., real-world images) without access to target
annotations. Existing UDA-SS methods often struggle to balance fine-grained
local details with global contextual information, leading to segmentation
errors in complex regions. To address this, we introduce the Adaptive Feature
Refinement (AFR) module, which enhances segmentation accuracy by refining
highresolution features using semantic priors from low-resolution logits. AFR
also integrates high-frequency components, which capture fine-grained
structures and provide crucial boundary information, improving object
delineation. Additionally, AFR adaptively balances local and global information
through uncertaintydriven attention, reducing misclassifications. Its
lightweight design allows seamless integration into HRDA-based UDA methods,
leading to state-of-the-art segmentation performance. Our approach improves
existing UDA-SS methods by 1.05% mIoU on GTA V --> Cityscapes and 1.04% mIoU on
Synthia-->Cityscapes. The implementation of our framework is available at:

### [8] [OPEN: A Benchmark Dataset and Baseline for Older Adult Patient Engagement Recognition in Virtual Rehabilitation Learning Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17959)
*Ali Abedi,Sadaf Safa,Tracey J. F. Colella,Shehroz S. Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文介绍了OPEN数据集，用于AI驱动的老年人虚拟学习参与度识别，填补了现有研究的空白，并展示了81%的识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚拟学习中的参与度对满意度和效果至关重要，但现有研究缺乏针对老年人的数据集和方法，尤其是在虚拟康复领域。

Method: 通过收集11名老年人6周虚拟学习数据，提取面部、手部和身体关节特征，标注参与状态、情感行为标签和上下文类型。

Result: 训练多种机器学习模型，最高达到81%的参与度识别准确率。

Conclusion: OPEN数据集为老年人个性化参与度建模提供了基础，并推动了参与度识别研究的发展。

Abstract: Engagement in virtual learning is essential for participant satisfaction,
performance, and adherence, particularly in online education and virtual
rehabilitation, where interactive communication plays a key role. Yet,
accurately measuring engagement in virtual group settings remains a challenge.
There is increasing interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) for
large-scale, real-world, automated engagement recognition. While engagement has
been widely studied in younger academic populations, research and datasets
focused on older adults in virtual and telehealth learning settings remain
limited. Existing methods often neglect contextual relevance and the
longitudinal nature of engagement across sessions. This paper introduces OPEN
(Older adult Patient ENgagement), a novel dataset supporting AI-driven
engagement recognition. It was collected from eleven older adults participating
in weekly virtual group learning sessions over six weeks as part of cardiac
rehabilitation, producing over 35 hours of data, making it the largest dataset
of its kind. To protect privacy, raw video is withheld; instead, the released
data include facial, hand, and body joint landmarks, along with affective and
behavioral features extracted from video. Annotations include binary engagement
states, affective and behavioral labels, and context-type indicators, such as
whether the instructor addressed the group or an individual. The dataset offers
versions with 5-, 10-, 30-second, and variable-length samples. To demonstrate
utility, multiple machine learning and deep learning models were trained,
achieving engagement recognition accuracy of up to 81 percent. OPEN provides a
scalable foundation for personalized engagement modeling in aging populations
and contributes to broader engagement recognition research.

*Arsen Yermukan,Pedro Machado,Feliciano Domingos,Isibor Kennedy Ihianle,Jordan J. Bird,Stefano S. K. Kaburu,Samantha J. Ward*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于YOLO模型的自动化系统，用于实时监测鬃狮蜥的关键行为（晒太阳和捕食），并评估了不同YOLO版本的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统鬃狮蜥行为监测方法耗时且易出错，需要一种更高效、准确的自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用五种YOLO模型（v5-v12）在自定义数据集（1200张图像）上进行训练，选择最优模型（YOLOv8s）进行实时视频分析，结合时间插值和规则逻辑分类行为。

Result: YOLOv8s表现最佳（mAP@0.5:0.95=0.855），晒太阳检测可靠，但捕食检测因蟋蟀识别弱（mAP@0.5=0.392）而不够准确。

Conclusion: 该系统为可控环境下的爬行动物行为监测提供了可扩展方案，未来需优化蟋蟀检测以提高捕食行为识别精度。

Abstract: Traditional monitoring of bearded dragon (Pogona Viticeps) behaviour is
time-consuming and prone to errors. This project introduces an automated system
for real-time video analysis, using You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection
models to identify two key behaviours: basking and hunting. We trained five
YOLO variants (v5, v7, v8, v11, v12) on a custom, publicly available dataset of
1200 images, encompassing bearded dragons (600), heating lamps (500), and
crickets (100). YOLOv8s was selected as the optimal model due to its superior
balance of accuracy (mAP@0.5:0.95 = 0.855) and speed. The system processes
video footage by extracting per-frame object coordinates, applying temporal
interpolation for continuity, and using rule-based logic to classify specific
behaviours. Basking detection proved reliable. However, hunting detection was
less accurate, primarily due to weak cricket detection (mAP@0.5 = 0.392).
Future improvements will focus on enhancing cricket detection through expanded
datasets or specialised small-object detectors. This automated system offers a
scalable solution for monitoring reptile behaviour in controlled environments,
significantly improving research efficiency and data quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个空中-地面跨模态视频行人重识别数据集AG-VPReID.VIR，并设计了TCC-VPReID三流架构来解决跨平台和跨模态的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集主要关注地面视角，存在遮挡、覆盖范围有限等问题，空中视角能解决这些问题。

Method: 提出了TCC-VPReID三流架构，结合风格鲁棒特征学习、基于记忆的跨视角适应和中介引导的时间建模。

Result: 实验表明，AG-VPReID.VIR数据集具有独特挑战，TCC-VPReID框架在多个评估协议中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该研究为跨模态行人重识别提供了新数据集和方法，解决了空中-地面视角和RGB-IR模态的领域差距。

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) across visible and infrared modalities is
crucial for 24-hour surveillance systems, but existing datasets primarily focus
on ground-level perspectives. While ground-based IR systems offer nighttime
capabilities, they suffer from occlusions, limited coverage, and vulnerability
to obstructions--problems that aerial perspectives uniquely solve. To address
these limitations, we introduce AG-VPReID.VIR, the first aerial-ground
cross-modality video-based person Re-ID dataset. This dataset captures 1,837
identities across 4,861 tracklets (124,855 frames) using both UAV-mounted and
fixed CCTV cameras in RGB and infrared modalities. AG-VPReID.VIR presents
unique challenges including cross-viewpoint variations, modality discrepancies,
and temporal dynamics. Additionally, we propose TCC-VPReID, a novel
three-stream architecture designed to address the joint challenges of
cross-platform and cross-modality person Re-ID. Our approach bridges the domain
gaps between aerial-ground perspectives and RGB-IR modalities, through
style-robust feature learning, memory-based cross-view adaptation, and
intermediary-guided temporal modeling. Experiments show that AG-VPReID.VIR
presents distinctive challenges compared to existing datasets, with our
TCC-VPReID framework achieving significant performance gains across multiple
evaluation protocols. Dataset and code are available at

*Emma A. M. Stanley,Raghav Mehta,Mélanie Roschewitz,Nils D. Forkert,Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究了医学影像数据中标签偏差对深度学习模型特征学习和性能的影响，发现偏差大小和子群可分性对模型特征表示和性能有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨医学影像数据中标签偏差对特定子群（如基于成像制造商）的公平性影响，以及这种偏差如何影响AI系统的性能。

Method: 使用EMory BrEast imaging Dataset (EMBED)训练深度学习模型进行二元组织密度分类，模拟子群标签偏差并分析其对模型特征和性能的影响。

Result: 标签偏差导致模型特征表示显著变化，且这种变化依赖于受影响子群的相对大小和可分性。验证集标签是否干净对子群性能有显著影响。

Conclusion: 研究为理解医学影像AI中标签偏差对子群公平性的影响提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Systematic mislabelling affecting specific subgroups (i.e., label bias) in
medical imaging datasets represents an understudied issue concerning the
fairness of medical AI systems. In this work, we investigated how size and
separability of subgroups affected by label bias influence the learned features
and performance of a deep learning model. Therefore, we trained deep learning
models for binary tissue density classification using the EMory BrEast imaging
Dataset (EMBED), where label bias affected separable subgroups (based on
imaging manufacturer) or non-separable "pseudo-subgroups". We found that
simulated subgroup label bias led to prominent shifts in the learned feature
representations of the models. Importantly, these shifts within the feature
space were dependent on both the relative size and the separability of the
subgroup affected by label bias. We also observed notable differences in
subgroup performance depending on whether a validation set with clean labels
was used to define the classification threshold for the model. For instance,
with label bias affecting the majority separable subgroup, the true positive
rate for that subgroup fell from 0.898, when the validation set had clean
labels, to 0.518, when the validation set had biased labels. Our work
represents a key contribution toward understanding the consequences of label
bias on subgroup fairness in medical imaging AI.

### [12] [Registration beyond Points: General Affine Subspace Alignment via Geodesic Distance on Grassmann Manifold](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17998)
*Jaeho Shin,Hyeonjae Gil,Junwoo Jang,Maani Ghaffari,Ayoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文首次推导出基于刚性变换的可优化Grassmannian特征距离函数，解决了现有方法无法显式表示距离的问题，并应用于配准问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Grassmannian方法无法显式表示刚性变换下的距离，限制了其在配准问题中的应用。

Method: 通过数学证明，利用高维线性子空间的基作为显式表示，提出基于变换基的可优化成本函数。

Result: 提出的方法能够直接最小化测地距离，优于基于向量参数的方法，并在计算机视觉任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 论文成功推导出可优化成本函数，扩展了Grassmannian在配准问题中的应用，并提供了开源代码。

Abstract: Affine Grassmannian has been favored for expressing proximity between lines
and planes due to its theoretical exactness in measuring distances among
features. Despite this advantage, the existing method can only measure the
proximity without yielding the distance as an explicit function of rigid body
transformation. Thus, an optimizable distance function on the manifold has
remained underdeveloped, stifling its application in registration problems.
This paper is the first to explicitly derive an optimizable cost function
between two Grassmannian features with respect to rigid body transformation
($\mathbf{R}$ and $\mathbf{t}$). Specifically, we present a rigorous
mathematical proof demonstrating that the bases of high-dimensional linear
subspaces can serve as an explicit representation of the cost. Finally, we
propose an optimizable cost function based on the transformed bases that can be
applied to the registration problem of any affine subspace. Compared to vector
parameter-based approaches, our method is able to find a globally optimal
solution by directly minimizing the geodesic distance which is agnostic to
representation ambiguity. The resulting cost function and its extension to the
inlier-set maximizing \ac{BnB} solver have been demonstrated to improve the
convergence of existing solutions or outperform them in various computer vision
tasks. The code is available on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRR-CoCa是一种改进的多模态模型，通过引入高斯误差门控线性单元、均方根归一化和旋转位置嵌入，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前领先的多模态模型架构在复杂性上落后于大型语言模型（LLMs），需要改进。

Method: 在CoCa模型中引入高斯误差门控线性单元、均方根归一化和旋转位置嵌入，优化文本解码器和视觉变换器编码器。

Result: GRR-CoCa在预训练和微调任务中显著优于基线模型，性能提升显著。

Conclusion: GRR-CoCa的改进架构在多模态任务中表现出更好的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) image and text generation models are multimodal
models that have many similarities to large language models (LLMs). Despite
achieving strong performances, leading foundational multimodal model
architectures frequently lag behind the architectural sophistication of
contemporary LLMs. We propose GRR-CoCa, an improved SOTA Contrastive Captioner
(CoCa) model that incorporates Gaussian error gated linear units, root mean
squared normalization, and rotary positional embedding into the textual
decoders and the vision transformer (ViT) encoder. Each architectural
modification has been shown to improve model performance in LLMs, but has yet
to be adopted in CoCa. We benchmarked GRR-CoCa against Baseline CoCa, a model
with the same modified textual decoders but with CoCa's original ViT encoder.
We used standard pretraining and fine-tuning workflows to benchmark the models
on contrastive and generative tasks. Our GRR-CoCa significantly outperformed
Baseline CoCa on the pretraining dataset and three diverse fine-tuning
datasets. Pretraining improvements were 27.25% in contrastive loss, 3.71% in
perplexity, and 7.15% in CoCa loss. The average fine-tuning improvements were
13.66% in contrastive loss, 5.18% in perplexity, and 5.55% in CoCa loss. We
show that GRR-CoCa's modified architecture improves performance and
generalization across vision-language domains.

Conclusion: Celeb-DF++为通用DeepFake检测提供了更具挑战性的基准，推动了相关研究的发展。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI technologies has significantly increased the
diversity of DeepFake videos circulating online, posing a pressing challenge
for \textit{generalizable forensics}, \ie, detecting a wide range of unseen
DeepFake types using a single model. Addressing this challenge requires
datasets that are not only large-scale but also rich in forgery diversity.
However, most existing datasets, despite their scale, include only a limited
variety of forgery types, making them insufficient for developing generalizable
detection methods. Therefore, we build upon our earlier Celeb-DF dataset and
introduce {Celeb-DF++}, a new large-scale and challenging video DeepFake
benchmark dedicated to the generalizable forensics challenge. Celeb-DF++ covers
three commonly encountered forgery scenarios: Face-swap (FS), Face-reenactment
(FR), and Talking-face (TF). Each scenario contains a substantial number of
high-quality forged videos, generated using a total of 22 various recent
DeepFake methods. These methods differ in terms of architectures, generation
pipelines, and targeted facial regions, covering the most prevalent DeepFake
cases witnessed in the wild. We also introduce evaluation protocols for
measuring the generalizability of 24 recent detection methods, highlighting the
limitations of existing detection methods and the difficulty of our new
dataset.

*Jun Zhou,Dinghao Li,Nannan Li,Mingjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D高斯溅射的新型3D场景修复框架，通过自动掩模优化和不确定性引导优化，显著提升了修复效果的多视角一致性和细节保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D场景修复面临多视角一致性不足和结构不规则的挑战，需要更高效的修复方法。

Method: 结合自动掩模优化（高斯场景过滤和反向投影）和不确定性引导的细粒度优化策略。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，该方法在视觉质量和多视角一致性上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该框架为3D场景修复提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-view 3D reconstruction and novel-view synthesis,
particularly through Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS), have greatly enhanced the fidelity and efficiency of 3D content
creation. However, inpainting 3D scenes remains a challenging task due to the
inherent irregularity of 3D structures and the critical need for maintaining
multi-view consistency. In this work, we propose a novel 3D Gaussian inpainting
framework that reconstructs complete 3D scenes by leveraging sparse inpainted
views. Our framework incorporates an automatic Mask Refinement Process and
region-wise Uncertainty-guided Optimization. Specifically, we refine the
inpainting mask using a series of operations, including Gaussian scene
filtering and back-projection, enabling more accurate localization of occluded
regions and realistic boundary restoration. Furthermore, our Uncertainty-guided
Fine-grained Optimization strategy, which estimates the importance of each
region across multi-view images during training, alleviates multi-view
inconsistencies and enhances the fidelity of fine details in the inpainted
results. Comprehensive experiments conducted on diverse datasets demonstrate
that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual
quality and view consistency.

Conclusion: 该领域发展迅速，但仍面临挑战，未来研究方向包括技术改进和扩展应用。

Abstract: Emotion recognition through body movements has emerged as a compelling and
privacy-preserving alternative to traditional methods that rely on facial
expressions or physiological signals. Recent advancements in 3D skeleton
acquisition technologies and pose estimation algorithms have significantly
enhanced the feasibility of emotion recognition based on full-body motion. This
survey provides a comprehensive and systematic review of skeleton-based emotion
recognition techniques. First, we introduce psychological models of emotion and
examine the relationship between bodily movements and emotional expression.
Next, we summarize publicly available datasets, highlighting the differences in
data acquisition methods and emotion labeling strategies. We then categorize
existing methods into posture-based and gait-based approaches, analyzing them
from both data-driven and technical perspectives. In particular, we propose a
unified taxonomy that encompasses four primary technical paradigms: Traditional
approaches, Feat2Net, FeatFusionNet, and End2EndNet. Representative works
within each category are reviewed and compared, with benchmarking results
across commonly used datasets. Finally, we explore the extended applications of
emotion recognition in mental health assessment, such as detecting depression
and autism, and discuss the open challenges and future research directions in
this rapidly evolving field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造技术威胁媒体真实性，传统检测方法对复杂定制伪造内容泛化性和鲁棒性不足。

Method: ViGText通过图像分块、构建图像与文本图，并利用图神经网络整合分析，结合空间与频域多级特征提取。

Result: 实验显示ViGText显著提升泛化性（F1分数从72.45%升至98.32%）和鲁棒性（召回率提高11.1%），对抗攻击性能下降小于4%。

Conclusion: ViGText通过视觉与文本的详细分析，为深度伪造检测设定了新标准，保障媒体真实性与信息完整性。

Abstract: The rapid rise of deepfake technology, which produces realistic but
fraudulent digital content, threatens the authenticity of media. Traditional
deepfake detection approaches often struggle with sophisticated, customized
deepfakes, especially in terms of generalization and robustness against
malicious attacks. This paper introduces ViGText, a novel approach that
integrates images with Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) Text explanations
within a Graph-based framework to improve deepfake detection. The novelty of
ViGText lies in its integration of detailed explanations with visual data, as
it provides a more context-aware analysis than captions, which often lack
specificity and fail to reveal subtle inconsistencies. ViGText systematically
divides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates
them for analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify deepfakes.
Through the use of multi-level feature extraction across spatial and frequency
domains, ViGText captures details that enhance its robustness and accuracy to
detect sophisticated deepfakes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViGText
significantly enhances generalization and achieves a notable performance boost
when it detects user-customized deepfakes. Specifically, average F1 scores rise
from 72.45% to 98.32% under generalization evaluation, and reflects the model's
superior ability to generalize to unseen, fine-tuned variations of stable
diffusion models. As for robustness, ViGText achieves an increase of 11.1% in
recall compared to other deepfake detection approaches. When facing targeted
attacks that exploit its graph-based architecture, ViGText limits
classification performance degradation to less than 4%. ViGText uses detailed
visual and textual analysis to set a new standard for detecting deepfakes,
helping ensure media authenticity and information integrity.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TAV的数据集，用于解决AI生成视频中多场景过渡不连贯的问题，通过训练提升了模型对场景转换的理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI生成视频模型在短片段单场景表现良好，但在长视频多场景过渡时表现不佳，主要原因是缺乏对场景转换的识别能力。

Method: 提出了Transition-Aware Video (TAV)数据集，包含多场景过渡的视频片段，并通过后训练提升模型性能。

Result: 实验表明，使用TAV数据集训练后，模型对场景转换的理解能力提升，生成的多场景视频更连贯，且图像质量保持。

Conclusion: TAV数据集有效解决了多场景视频生成中的过渡问题，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated video have shown strong performance on
\emph{text-to-video} tasks, particularly for short clips depicting a single
scene. However, current models struggle to generate longer videos with coherent
scene transitions, primarily because they cannot infer when a transition is
needed from the prompt. Most open-source models are trained on datasets
consisting of single-scene video clips, which limits their capacity to learn
and respond to prompts requiring multiple scenes. Developing scene transition
awareness is essential for multi-scene generation, as it allows models to
identify and segment videos into distinct clips by accurately detecting
transitions.
  To address this, we propose the \textbf{Transition-Aware Video} (TAV)
dataset, which consists of preprocessed video clips with multiple scene
transitions. Our experiment shows that post-training on the \textbf{TAV}
dataset improves prompt-based scene transition understanding, narrows the gap
between required and generated scenes, and maintains image quality.

Conclusion: 通过合成具有透明度的真实前景，解决了可扩展配对数据不足的问题。

Abstract: We introduce BokehDiff, a novel lens blur rendering method that achieves
physically accurate and visually appealing outcomes, with the help of
generative diffusion prior. Previous methods are bounded by the accuracy of
depth estimation, generating artifacts in depth discontinuities. Our method
employs a physics-inspired self-attention module that aligns with the image
formation process, incorporating depth-dependent circle of confusion constraint
and self-occlusion effects. We adapt the diffusion model to the one-step
inference scheme without introducing additional noise, and achieve results of
high quality and fidelity. To address the lack of scalable paired data, we
propose to synthesize photorealistic foregrounds with transparency with
diffusion models, balancing authenticity and scene diversity.

Result: 在多样场景中，VLM-IMI在定量指标和感知质量上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VLM-IMI通过语义指导显著提升了低光图像增强的效果，尤其在复杂光照条件下表现优异。

Abstract: Most existing low-light image enhancement (LLIE) methods rely on pre-trained
model priors, low-light inputs, or both, while neglecting the semantic guidance
available from normal-light images. This limitation hinders their effectiveness
in complex lighting conditions. In this paper, we propose VLM-IMI, a novel
framework that leverages large vision-language models (VLMs) with iterative and
manual instructions (IMIs) for LLIE. VLM-IMI incorporates textual descriptions
of the desired normal-light content as enhancement cues, enabling semantically
informed restoration. To effectively integrate cross-modal priors, we introduce
an instruction prior fusion module, which dynamically aligns and fuses image
and text features, promoting the generation of detailed and semantically
coherent outputs. During inference, we adopt an iterative and manual
instruction strategy to refine textual instructions, progressively improving
visual quality. This refinement enhances structural fidelity, semantic
alignment, and the recovery of fine details under extremely low-light
conditions. Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate that
VLM-IMI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and
perceptual quality. The source code is available at

Motivation: 胰腺癌预后差，EUS图像分割因噪声和低对比度而困难，现有方法依赖大量标注数据和手动提示。

Method: 结合BiomedCLIP文本编码器和LoRA架构改进SAM，仅调整0.86%参数，实现自动分割。

Result: 在公开数据集上，TextSAM-EUS的Dice和NSD分别达到82.69%和85.28%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TextSAM-EUS为EUS图像分割提供了高效、鲁棒的解决方案，是首个将提示学习引入医学图像分割的SAM改进方法。

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer carries a poor prognosis and relies on endoscopic
ultrasound (EUS) for targeted biopsy and radiotherapy. However, the speckle
noise, low contrast, and unintuitive appearance of EUS make segmentation of
pancreatic tumors with fully supervised deep learning (DL) models both
error-prone and dependent on large, expert-curated annotation datasets. To
address these challenges, we present TextSAM-EUS, a novel, lightweight,
text-driven adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) that requires no
manual geometric prompts at inference. Our approach leverages text prompt
learning (context optimization) through the BiomedCLIP text encoder in
conjunction with a LoRA-based adaptation of SAM's architecture to enable
automatic pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS, tuning only 0.86% of the total
parameters. On the public Endoscopic Ultrasound Database of the Pancreas,
TextSAM-EUS with automatic prompts attains 82.69% Dice and 85.28% normalized
surface distance (NSD), and with manual geometric prompts reaches 83.10% Dice
and 85.70% NSD, outperforming both existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) supervised
DL models and foundation models (e.g., SAM and its variants). As the first
attempt to incorporate prompt learning in SAM-based medical image segmentation,
TextSAM-EUS offers a practical option for efficient and robust automatic EUS
segmentation. Our code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize relevant temporal segments in

cold start data for SFT initialization, followed by difficulty-controlled RL to
further enhance temporal localization and reasoning abilities. Comprehensive

Abstract: The Algonauts 2025 Challenge called on the community to develop encoding
models that predict whole-brain fMRI responses to naturalistic multimodal
movies. In this submission, we propose a sequence-to-sequence Transformer that
autoregressively predicts fMRI activity from visual, auditory, and language
inputs. Stimulus features were extracted using pretrained models including
VideoMAE, HuBERT, Qwen, and BridgeTower. The decoder integrates information
from prior brain states, current stimuli, and episode-level summaries via dual
cross-attention mechanisms that attend to both perceptual information extracted
from the stimulus as well as narrative information provided by high-level
summaries of narrative content. One core innovation of our approach is the use
of sequences of multimodal context to predict sequences of brain activity,
enabling the model to capture long-range temporal structure in both stimuli and
neural responses. Another is the combination of a shared encoder with partial
subject-specific decoder, which leverages common structure across subjects
while accounting for individual variability. Our model achieves strong
performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, demonstrating
the effectiveness of temporally-aware, multimodal sequence modeling for brain
activity prediction. The code is available at

Result: 在Fishyscapes等真实基准测试中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了语义上有意义且计算高效的解决方案，适用于不确定性感知分割。

Abstract: Estimating uncertainty from deep neural networks is a widely used approach
for detecting out-of-distribution (OoD) samples, which typically exhibit high
predictive uncertainty. However, conventional methods such as Monte Carlo (MC)
Dropout often focus solely on either model or data uncertainty, failing to
align with the semantic objective of OoD detection. To address this, we propose
the Free-Energy Posterior Network, a novel framework that jointly models
distributional uncertainty and identifying OoD and misclassified regions using
free energy. Our method introduces two key contributions: (1) a
free-energy-based density estimator parameterized by a Beta distribution, which
enables fine-grained uncertainty estimation near ambiguous or unseen regions;
and (2) a loss integrated within a posterior network, allowing direct
uncertainty estimation from learned parameters without requiring stochastic
sampling. By integrating our approach with the residual prediction branch (RPL)
framework, the proposed method goes beyond post-hoc energy thresholding and
enables the network to learn OoD regions by leveraging the variance of the Beta
distribution, resulting in a semantically meaningful and computationally
efficient solution for uncertainty-aware segmentation. We validate the
effectiveness of our method on challenging real-world benchmarks, including
Fishyscapes, RoadAnomaly, and Segment-Me-If-You-Can.

evaluated the 10 most advanced text-to-video models currently available,
ranging from open source to commercial models, and found that most models are

Abstract: In the medical image analysis field, precise quantification of curve
tortuosity plays a critical role in the auxiliary diagnosis and pathological
assessment of various diseases. In this study, we propose a novel framework for
tortuosity quantification and demonstrate its effectiveness through the
evaluation of meibomian gland atrophy uniformity,serving as a representative
application scenario.
  We introduce an information entropy-based tortuosity quantification framework
that integrates probability modeling with entropy theory and incorporates
domain transformation of curve data. Unlike traditional methods such as
curvature or arc-chord ratio, this approach evaluates the tortuosity of a
target curve by comparing it to a designated reference curve. Consequently, it
is more suitable for tortuosity assessment tasks in medical data where
biologically plausible reference curves are available, providing a more robust
and objective evaluation metric without relying on idealized straight-line
comparisons.
  First, we conducted numerical simulation experiments to preliminarily assess
the stability and validity of the method. Subsequently, the framework was
applied to quantify the spatial uniformity of meibomian gland atrophy and to
analyze the difference in this uniformity between \textit{Demodex}-negative and
\textit{Demodex}-positive patient groups. The results demonstrated a
significant difference in tortuosity-based uniformity between the two groups,
with an area under the curve of 0.8768, sensitivity of 0.75, and specificity of
0.93. These findings highlight the clinical utility of the proposed framework
in curve tortuosity analysis and its potential as a generalizable tool for
quantitative morphological evaluation in medical diagnostics.

Conclusion: 双向扩散机制和模块设计有效提升了低光图像增强的质量和一致性。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement aims to improve the visibility of degraded images
to better align with human visual perception. While diffusion-based methods
have shown promising performance due to their strong generative capabilities.
However, their unidirectional modelling of degradation often struggles to
capture the complexity of real-world degradation patterns, leading to
structural inconsistencies and pixel misalignments. To address these
challenges, we propose a bidirectional diffusion optimization mechanism that
jointly models the degradation processes of both low-light and normal-light
images, enabling more precise degradation parameter matching and enhancing
generation quality. Specifically, we perform bidirectional diffusion-from
low-to-normal light and from normal-to-low light during training and introduce
an adaptive feature interaction block (AFI) to refine feature representation.
By leveraging the complementarity between these two paths, our approach imposes
an implicit symmetry constraint on illumination attenuation and noise
distribution, facilitating consistent degradation learning and improving the
models ability to perceive illumination and detail degradation. Additionally,
we design a reflection-aware correction module (RACM) to guide color
restoration post-denoising and suppress overexposed regions, ensuring content
consistency and generating high-quality images that align with human visual
perception. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and
qualitative evaluations while generalizing effectively to diverse degradation

*Haodong Zhu,Wenhao Dong,Linlin Yang,Hong Li,Yuguang Yang,Yangyang Ren,Qingcheng Zhu,Zichao Feng,Changbai Li,Shaohui Lin,Runqi Wang,Xiaoyan Luo,Baochang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaveMamba是一种跨模态融合方法，通过离散小波变换（DWT）分解RGB和红外（IR）图像的互补频率特征，并结合改进的检测头和逆离散小波变换（IDWT）减少信息损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用RGB和红外图像的互补特性提升目标检测性能。

Method: 提出WaveMamba Fusion Block（WMFB），结合低/高频子带融合，使用Mamba框架进行低频特征融合，并通过门控注意力机制增强高频特征。

Result: 在四个基准测试中平均mAP提升4.5%，超越现有方法。

Conclusion: WaveMamba通过高效融合RGB和IR图像的频率特征，显著提升了目标检测性能。

Abstract: Leveraging the complementary characteristics of visible (RGB) and infrared
(IR) imagery offers significant potential for improving object detection. In
this paper, we propose WaveMamba, a cross-modality fusion method that
efficiently integrates the unique and complementary frequency features of RGB
and IR decomposed by Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). An improved detection
head incorporating the Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transform (IDWT) is also
proposed to reduce information loss and produce the final detection results.
The core of our approach is the introduction of WaveMamba Fusion Block (WMFB),
which facilitates comprehensive fusion across low-/high-frequency sub-bands.
Within WMFB, the Low-frequency Mamba Fusion Block (LMFB), built upon the Mamba
framework, first performs initial low-frequency feature fusion with channel
swapping, followed by deep fusion with an advanced gated attention mechanism
for enhanced integration. High-frequency features are enhanced using a strategy
that applies an ``absolute maximum" fusion approach. These advancements lead to
significant performance gains, with our method surpassing state-of-the-art
approaches and achieving average mAP improvements of 4.5% on four benchmarks.

Abstract: Object detection and classification are crucial tasks across various
application domains, particularly in the development of safe and reliable
Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Existing deep learning-based methods
such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Single Shot Detectors (SSDs), and
You Only Look Once (YOLO) have demonstrated high performance in terms of

limitation, this paper presents a resource-efficient real-time object detection
and classification system based on YOLOv5 optimized for FPGA deployment. The
proposed system is trained on the COCO and GTSRD datasets and implemented on
the Xilinx Kria KV260 FPGA board. Experimental results demonstrate a
classification accuracy of 99%, with a power consumption of 3.5W and a
processing speed of 9 frames per second (FPS). These findings highlight the
effectiveness of the proposed approach in enabling real-time,
resource-efficient object detection and classification for edge computing

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段无监督域适应框架，结合对比学习和多模型伪标签策略，显著提升了3D LiDAR语义分割的跨域性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D LiDAR语义分割中因域偏移（如传感器类型、地理位置）导致的性能下降问题，同时避免手动标注目标数据的高成本。

Method: 1. 使用无监督对比学习预训练骨干网络；2. 引入多模型伪标签策略，通过硬投票生成高质量伪标签；3. 利用伪标签微调网络。

Result: 在从SemanticKITTI到SemanticPOSS和SemanticSlamantic的实验中，分割精度显著优于直接迁移和单模型UDA方法。

Conclusion: 结合对比预训练和集成伪标签策略，无需目标域标注即可有效缩小复杂域差距。

Abstract: Addressing performance degradation in 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation due to
domain shifts (e.g., sensor type, geographical location) is crucial for
autonomous systems, yet manual annotation of target data is prohibitive. This
study addresses the challenge using Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) and
introduces a novel two-stage framework to tackle it. Initially, unsupervised
contrastive learning at the segment level is used to pre-train a backbone
network, enabling it to learn robust, domain-invariant features without labels.
Subsequently, a multi-model pseudo-labeling strategy is introduced, utilizing
an ensemble of diverse state-of-the-art architectures (including projection,
voxel, hybrid, and cylinder-based methods). Predictions from these models are
aggregated via hard voting to generate high-quality, refined pseudo-labels for
the unlabeled target domain, mitigating single-model biases. The contrastively
pre-trained network is then fine-tuned using these robust pseudo-labels.
Experiments adapting from SemanticKITTI to unlabeled target datasets
(SemanticPOSS, SemanticSlamantic) demonstrate significant improvements in
segmentation accuracy compared to direct transfer and single-model UDA
approaches. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining contrastive
pre-training with refined ensemble pseudo-labeling for bridging complex domain
gaps without requiring target domain annotations.

TL;DR: Diff-UMamba结合UNet和mamba机制，通过噪声抑制模块提升医学图像分割的泛化能力，在低数据场景下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在数据稀缺时过拟合噪声和无关模式的问题，提升医学图像分割的泛化性能。

Method: 提出Diff-UMamba架构，结合UNet和mamba机制，引入噪声抑制模块（NRM）过滤无关激活。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上表现优于基线方法1-3%，在低数据条件下提升4-5%。

Conclusion: Diff-UMamba在医学图像分割中有效提升泛化能力和准确性，尤其在数据稀缺时表现突出。

Abstract: In data-scarce scenarios, deep learning models often overfit to noise and
irrelevant patterns, which limits their ability to generalize to unseen
samples. To address these challenges in medical image segmentation, we
introduce Diff-UMamba, a novel architecture that combines the UNet framework
with the mamba mechanism for modeling long-range dependencies. At the heart of
Diff-UMamba is a Noise Reduction Module (NRM), which employs a signal
differencing strategy to suppress noisy or irrelevant activations within the
encoder. This encourages the model to filter out spurious features and enhance
task-relevant representations, thereby improving its focus on clinically
meaningful regions. As a result, the architecture achieves improved
segmentation accuracy and robustness, particularly in low-data settings.
Diff-UMamba is evaluated on multiple public datasets, including MSD (lung and
pancreas) and AIIB23, demonstrating consistent performance gains of 1-3% over
baseline methods across diverse segmentation tasks. To further assess
performance under limited-data conditions, additional experiments are conducted
on the BraTS-21 dataset by varying the proportion of available training
samples. The approach is also validated on a small internal non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) dataset for gross tumor volume (GTV) segmentation in cone beam
CT (CBCT), where it achieves a 4-5% improvement over the baseline.

TL;DR: MatSSL是一种简化的自监督学习架构，通过门控特征融合有效整合多级表示，解决了金属材料显微图像分析中监督方法依赖标注数据的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前金属材料显微图像分析依赖监督方法，需为每个新数据集重新训练且在小样本下表现不稳定。自监督学习虽有望利用未标注数据，但多数方法仍需大规模数据集。MatSSL旨在克服这一限制。

Method: MatSSL采用自监督预训练于小规模未标注数据集，随后在多个基准数据集上微调模型，结合门控特征融合整合多级表示。

Result: 在MetalDAM上达到69.13% mIoU，优于ImageNet预训练编码器的66.73%；在EBC数据集上平均mIoU提升近40%。

Conclusion: MatSSL仅需少量未标注数据即可有效适应金相领域，同时保留从自然图像大规模预训练中学到的丰富可迁移特征。

Abstract: MatSSL is a streamlined self-supervised learning (SSL) architecture that
employs Gated Feature Fusion at each stage of the backbone to integrate
multi-level representations effectively. Current micrograph analysis of
metallic materials relies on supervised methods, which require retraining for
each new dataset and often perform inconsistently with only a few labeled
samples. While SSL offers a promising alternative by leveraging unlabeled data,
most existing methods still depend on large-scale datasets to be effective.
MatSSL is designed to overcome this limitation. We first perform
self-supervised pretraining on a small-scale, unlabeled dataset and then
fine-tune the model on multiple benchmark datasets. The resulting segmentation
models achieve 69.13% mIoU on MetalDAM, outperforming the 66.73% achieved by an
ImageNet-pretrained encoder, and delivers consistently up to nearly 40%
improvement in average mIoU on the Environmental Barrier Coating benchmark
dataset (EBC) compared to models pretrained with MicroNet. This suggests that
MatSSL enables effective adaptation to the metallographic domain using only a
small amount of unlabeled data, while preserving the rich and transferable
features learned from large-scale pretraining on natural images.

Motivation: 解决现有文本到图像合成方法中因复杂采样策略和分类器无关引导（CFG）导致的高推理成本问题。

Method: 提出TeEFusion方法，通过线性操作融合条件和非条件文本嵌入，无需额外参数，同时让学生模型学习教师模型的复杂采样输出。

Result: 实验表明，学生模型推理速度提升6倍，同时保持与教师模型相当的图像质量。

Conclusion: TeEFusion是一种高效且轻量化的解决方案，显著降低了推理成本，同时保持了生成质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image synthesis largely benefit from sophisticated
sampling strategies and classifier-free guidance (CFG) to ensure high-quality
generation. However, CFG's reliance on two forward passes, especially when
combined with intricate sampling algorithms, results in prohibitively high
inference costs. To address this, we introduce TeEFusion (\textbf{Te}xt
\textbf{E}mbeddings \textbf{Fusion}), a novel and efficient distillation method
that directly incorporates the guidance magnitude into the text embeddings and
distills the teacher model's complex sampling strategy. By simply fusing
conditional and unconditional text embeddings using linear operations,
TeEFusion reconstructs the desired guidance without adding extra parameters,
simultaneously enabling the student model to learn from the teacher's output
produced via its sophisticated sampling approach. Extensive experiments on
state-of-the-art models such as SD3 demonstrate that our method allows the
student to closely mimic the teacher's performance with a far simpler and more
efficient sampling strategy. Consequently, the student model achieves inference
speeds up to 6$\times$ faster than the teacher model, while maintaining image
quality at levels comparable to those obtained through the teacher's complex
sampling approach. The code is publicly available at

Method: 提出LEAF模型，替换噪声预测为直接分割图预测，采用特征蒸馏对齐卷积层与视觉编码器特征。

Result: 实验显示LEAF在多疾病分割数据集中提升性能，且不增加推理成本。

Conclusion: LEAF高效且无需修改模型架构或增加参数，适用于医学图像分割。

Abstract: Leveraging the powerful capabilities of diffusion models has yielded quite
effective results in medical image segmentation tasks. However, existing
methods typically transfer the original training process directly without
specific adjustments for segmentation tasks. Furthermore, the commonly used
pre-trained diffusion models still have deficiencies in feature extraction.
Based on these considerations, we propose LEAF, a medical image segmentation
model grounded in latent diffusion models. During the fine-tuning process, we
replace the original noise prediction pattern with a direct prediction of the
segmentation map, thereby reducing the variance of segmentation results. We
also employ a feature distillation method to align the hidden states of the
convolutional layers with the features from a transformer-based vision encoder.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances the performance of
the original diffusion model across multiple segmentation datasets for
different disease types. Notably, our approach does not alter the model
architecture, nor does it increase the number of parameters or computation
during the inference phase, making it highly efficient.

TL;DR: GSDTTA是一种新的3D点云分类方法，通过将适应过程转移到图谱域，提高了效率并减少了参数需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有3D测试时适应方法在点云数据上计算成本高且需要额外训练数据的问题。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GSDTTA为3D点云分类提供了一种高效的测试时适应方法。

Abstract: While test-time adaptation (TTA) methods effectively address domain shifts by
dynamically adapting pre-trained models to target domain data during online
inference, their application to 3D point clouds is hindered by their irregular
and unordered structure. Current 3D TTA methods often rely on computationally
expensive spatial-domain optimizations and may require additional training
data. In contrast, we propose Graph Spectral Domain Test-Time Adaptation
(GSDTTA), a novel approach for 3D point cloud classification that shifts
adaptation to the graph spectral domain, enabling more efficient adaptation by
capturing global structural properties with fewer parameters. Point clouds in
target domain are represented as outlier-aware graphs and transformed into
graph spectral domain by Graph Fourier Transform (GFT). For efficiency,
adaptation is performed by optimizing only the lowest 10% of frequency
components, which capture the majority of the point cloud's energy. An inverse
GFT (IGFT) is then applied to reconstruct the adapted point cloud with the
graph spectral-driven point shift. This process is enhanced by an
eigenmap-guided self-training strategy that iteratively refines both the
spectral adjustments and the model parameters. Experimental results and
ablation studies on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GSDTTA,
outperforming existing TTA methods for 3D point cloud classification.

Conclusion: DATA网络通过系统对齐特征并最大化语义表示，显著提升了协作感知的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Feature-level fusion shows promise in collaborative perception (CP) through
balanced performance and communication bandwidth trade-off. However, its
effectiveness critically relies on input feature quality. The acquisition of
high-quality features faces domain gaps from hardware diversity and deployment
conditions, alongside temporal misalignment from transmission delays. These
challenges degrade feature quality with cumulative effects throughout the
collaborative network. In this paper, we present the Domain-And-Time Alignment
(DATA) network, designed to systematically align features while maximizing
their semantic representations for fusion. Specifically, we propose a
Consistency-preserving Domain Alignment Module (CDAM) that reduces domain gaps
through proximal-region hierarchical downsampling and observability-constrained
discriminator. We further propose a Progressive Temporal Alignment Module
(PTAM) to handle transmission delays via multi-scale motion modeling and
two-stage compensation. Building upon the aligned features, an Instance-focused
Feature Aggregation Module (IFAM) is developed to enhance semantic
representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DATA achieves
state-of-the-art performance on three typical datasets, maintaining robustness
with severe communication delays and pose errors. The code will be released at

Result: 在nuScenes-Night和RobotCar-Night数据集上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: DepthDark在低光环境下表现出色，验证了其高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In recent years, foundation models for monocular depth estimation have
received increasing attention. Current methods mainly address typical daylight
conditions, but their effectiveness notably decreases in low-light
environments. There is a lack of robust foundational models for monocular depth
estimation specifically designed for low-light scenarios. This largely stems
from the absence of large-scale, high-quality paired depth datasets for
low-light conditions and the effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
strategy. To address these challenges, we propose DepthDark, a robust
foundation model for low-light monocular depth estimation. We first introduce a
flare-simulation module and a noise-simulation module to accurately simulate
the imaging process under nighttime conditions, producing high-quality paired
depth datasets for low-light conditions. Additionally, we present an effective
low-light PEFT strategy that utilizes illumination guidance and multiscale
feature fusion to enhance the model's capability in low-light environments. Our
method achieves state-of-the-art depth estimation performance on the
challenging nuScenes-Night and RobotCar-Night datasets, validating its
effectiveness using limited training data and computing resources.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-view scene reconstruction have been significant,
yet existing methods face limitations when processing streams of input images.
These methods either rely on time-consuming offline optimization or are
restricted to shorter sequences, hindering their applicability in real-time
scenarios. In this work, we propose LONG3R (LOng sequence streaming 3D
Reconstruction), a novel model designed for streaming multi-view 3D scene
reconstruction over longer sequences. Our model achieves real-time processing
by operating recurrently, maintaining and updating memory with each new
observation. We first employ a memory gating mechanism to filter relevant
memory, which, together with a new observation, is fed into a dual-source
refined decoder for coarse-to-fine interaction. To effectively capture
long-sequence memory, we propose a 3D spatio-temporal memory that dynamically
prunes redundant spatial information while adaptively adjusting resolution
along the scene. To enhance our model's performance on long sequences while
maintaining training efficiency, we employ a two-stage curriculum training
strategy, each stage targeting specific capabilities. Experiments demonstrate
that LONG3R outperforms state-of-the-art streaming methods, particularly for
longer sequences, while maintaining real-time inference speed. Project page:

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) plays a vital role in numerous
practical applications. In pursuit of determining the performance boundaries,
researchers employ large and expensive manual-labeling data for representation
learning. Nevertheless, this approach renders the state-of-the-art ISTD methods
highly fragile in real-world challenges. In this paper, we first study the
variation in detection performance across several mainstream methods under
various scarcity -- namely, the absence of high-quality infrared data -- that
challenge the prevailing theories about practical ISTD. To address this
concern, we introduce the Gaussian Agnostic Representation Learning.
Specifically, we propose the Gaussian Group Squeezer, leveraging Gaussian
sampling and compression for non-uniform quantization. By exploiting a diverse
array of training samples, we enhance the resilience of ISTD models against
various challenges. Then, we introduce two-stage diffusion models for
real-world reconstruction. By aligning quantized signals closely with
real-world distributions, we significantly elevate the quality and fidelity of
the synthetic samples. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art
detection methods in various scarcity scenarios demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed approach.

Abstract: Periodontitis and dental caries are common oral diseases affecting billions
globally. While observational studies suggest links between these conditions
and lung cancer, causality remains uncertain. This study used two sample
Mendelian randomization (MR) to explore causal relationships between dental
traits (periodontitis, dental caries) and lung cancer subtypes, and to assess
mediation by pulmonary function. Genetic instruments were derived from the
largest available genome wide association studies, including data from 487,823
dental caries and 506,594 periodontitis cases, as well as lung cancer data from
the Transdisciplinary Research of Cancer in Lung consortium. Inverse variance
weighting was the main analytical method; lung function mediation was assessed
using the delta method. The results showed a significant positive causal effect
of dental caries on overall lung cancer and its subtypes. Specifically, a one
standard deviation increase in dental caries incidence was associated with a
188.0% higher risk of squamous cell lung carcinoma (OR = 2.880, 95% CI =
1.236--6.713, p = 0.014), partially mediated by declines in forced vital
capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), accounting
for 5.124% and 5.890% of the total effect. No causal effect was found for
periodontitis. These findings highlight a causal role of dental caries in lung
cancer risk and support integrating dental care and pulmonary function
monitoring into cancer prevention strategies.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have garnered wide-spread attention and
interest within the artificial intelligence research and industrial
communities, owing to their remarkable capability in multimodal understanding,
reasoning, and in-context learning, among others. While LMMs have demonstrated
promising results in tackling multimodal tasks like image captioning, visual
question answering, and visual grounding, the object detection capabilities of
LMMs exhibit a significant gap compared to specialist detectors. To bridge the
gap, we depart from the conventional methods of integrating heavy detectors
with LMMs and propose LMM-Det, a simple yet effective approach that leverages a
Large Multimodal Model for vanilla object Detection without relying on
specialized detection modules. Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive
exploratory analysis when a large multimodal model meets with object detection,
revealing that the recall rate degrades significantly compared with specialist
detection models. To mitigate this, we propose to increase the recall rate by
introducing data distribution adjustment and inference optimization tailored
for object detection. We re-organize the instruction conversations to enhance
the object detection capabilities of large multimodal models. We claim that a
large multimodal model possesses detection capability without any extra
detection modules. Extensive experiments support our claim and show the
effectiveness of the versatile LMM-Det. The datasets, models, and codes are

large-scale image and video datasets paired with text, enabling them to bridge
visual perception and natural language processing. However, their application
to scientific domains, especially in interpreting complex field data commonly
used in the natural sciences, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce
FieldLVLM, a novel framework designed to improve large vision-language models'
understanding of field data. FieldLVLM consists of two main components: a
field-aware language generation strategy and a data-compressed multimodal model
tuning. The field-aware language generation strategy leverages a
special-purpose machine learning pipeline to extract key physical features from
field data, such as flow classification, Reynolds number, and vortex patterns.
This information is then converted into structured textual descriptions that
serve as a dataset. The data-compressed multimodal model tuning focuses on
LVLMs with these generated datasets, using a data compression strategy to
reduce the complexity of field inputs and retain only the most informative
values. This ensures compatibility with the models language decoder and guides
its learning more effectively. Experimental results on newly proposed benchmark
datasets demonstrate that FieldLVLM significantly outperforms existing methods
in tasks involving scientific field data. Our findings suggest that this
approach opens up new possibilities for applying large vision-language models
to scientific research, helping bridge the gap between large models and
domain-specific discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG分割对临床诊断至关重要，但公开标注数据稀缺，半监督学习可利用大量未标注数据。

Method: 整合多个公共数据集，评估五种半监督分割算法，采用卷积网络和Transformer架构，并提出ECG专用训练配置和增强策略。

Result: Transformer在半监督ECG分割中表现优于卷积网络。

Conclusion: 该基准为半监督ECG分割方法的发展奠定了基础，并促进该领域进一步研究。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) delineation, the segmentation of meaningful waveform
features, is critical for clinical diagnosis. Despite recent advances using
deep learning, progress has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available
annotated datasets. Semi-supervised learning presents a promising solution by
leveraging abundant unlabeled ECG data. In this study, we present the first
systematic benchmark for semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SemiSeg) in ECG
delineation. We curated and unified multiple public datasets, including
previously underused sources, to support robust and diverse evaluation. We
adopted five representative SemiSeg algorithms from computer vision,
implemented them on two different architectures: the convolutional network and
the transformer, and evaluated them in two different settings: in-domain and
cross-domain. Additionally, we propose ECG-specific training configurations and
augmentation strategies and introduce a standardized evaluation framework. Our
results show that the transformer outperforms the convolutional network in
semi-supervised ECG delineation. We anticipate that our benchmark will serve as
a foundation for advancing semi-supervised ECG delineation methods and will
facilitate further research in this domain.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的核范数（MNN）框架，通过变换矩阵并应用核范数，同时捕获局部信息和全局低秩性，无需调参，并提供理论恢复保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统核范数在矩阵恢复问题中仅利用全局低秩结构，忽略了局部信息。MNN旨在结合局部和全局信息，提升恢复效果。

Method: 定义MNN族范数，通过变换矩阵后应用核范数，无需调参，并在理论上证明其恢复能力。

Result: MNN在Robust PCA和矩阵补全任务中表现优异，实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: MNN框架灵活且高效，适用于多种结构化低秩恢复任务，优于现有方法。

Abstract: The nuclear norm (NN) has been widely explored in matrix recovery problems,
such as Robust PCA and matrix completion, leveraging the inherent global
low-rank structure of the data. In this study, we introduce a new modified
nuclear norm (MNN) framework, where the MNN family norms are defined by
adopting suitable transformations and performing the NN on the transformed
matrix. The MNN framework offers two main advantages: (1) it jointly captures
both local information and global low-rankness without requiring trade-off
parameter tuning; (2) Under mild assumptions on the transformation, we provided
exact theoretical recovery guarantees for both Robust PCA and MC tasks-an
achievement not shared by existing methods that combine local and global
information. Thanks to its general and flexible design, MNN can accommodate
various proven transformations, enabling a unified and effective approach to
structured low-rank recovery. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. Code and supplementary material are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 航空业的非CO2效应（如尾迹）对气候的影响可能与CO2相当，但现有模型和数据集的局限性阻碍了准确评估。

Method: 使用地面全天空相机记录尾迹，构建GVCCS数据集，并提出基于全景分割的深度学习框架进行尾迹分析。

Result: GVCCS包含122个视频序列（24,228帧），提供尾迹的个体标记和时间追踪，支持模型校准。

Conclusion: 该工作为更准确的气候影响评估奠定了基础，改进了尾迹监测和物理模型校准。

Abstract: Aviation's climate impact includes not only CO2 emissions but also
significant non-CO2 effects, especially from contrails. These ice clouds can
alter Earth's radiative balance, potentially rivaling the warming effect of
aviation CO2. Physics-based models provide useful estimates of contrail
formation and climate impact, but their accuracy depends heavily on the quality
of atmospheric input data and on assumptions used to represent complex
processes like ice particle formation and humidity-driven persistence.
Observational data from remote sensors, such as satellites and ground cameras,
could be used to validate and calibrate these models. However, existing
datasets don't explore all aspect of contrail dynamics and formation: they
typically lack temporal tracking, and do not attribute contrails to their
source flights. To address these limitations, we present the Ground Visible
Camera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS), a new open data set of contrails recorded
with a ground-based all-sky camera in the visible range. Each contrail is
individually labeled and tracked over time, allowing a detailed analysis of its
lifecycle. The dataset contains 122 video sequences (24,228 frames) and
includes flight identifiers for contrails that form above the camera. As
reference, we also propose a unified deep learning framework for contrail
analysis using a panoptic segmentation model that performs semantic
segmentation (contrail pixel identification), instance segmentation (individual
contrail separation), and temporal tracking in a single architecture. By
providing high-quality, temporally resolved annotations and a benchmark for
model evaluation, our work supports improved contrail monitoring and will
facilitate better calibration of physical models. This sets the groundwork for
more accurate climate impact understanding and assessments.

Result: 在ScanNet、ScanNet200和ARKitScenes数据集上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SGCDet通过自适应体积构建和稀疏优化，实现了高效且准确的3D物体检测，且仅需3D边界框监督。

Abstract: This work presents SGCDet, a novel multi-view indoor 3D object detection
framework based on adaptive 3D volume construction. Unlike previous approaches
that restrict the receptive field of voxels to fixed locations on images, we
introduce a geometry and context aware aggregation module to integrate
geometric and contextual information within adaptive regions in each image and
dynamically adjust the contributions from different views, enhancing the
representation capability of voxel features. Furthermore, we propose a sparse
volume construction strategy that adaptively identifies and selects voxels with
high occupancy probabilities for feature refinement, minimizing redundant
computation in free space. Benefiting from the above designs, our framework
achieves effective and efficient volume construction in an adaptive way. Better
still, our network can be supervised using only 3D bounding boxes, eliminating
the dependence on ground-truth scene geometry. Experimental results demonstrate
that SGCDet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet, ScanNet200
and ARKitScenes datasets. The source code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过颜色化增强频谱图的方法，以提高鸟类鸣声分类的准确性，显著优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决鸟类鸣声分类中因环境噪声、重叠鸣叫和缺失标签导致的挑战，尤其是低信噪比和多物种录音的分类问题。

Method: 通过将频率信息嵌入频谱图（使用原色添加剂）来增强物种区分，并应用深度学习模型进行分类。

Result: 实验显示，该方法在F1、ROC-AUC和CMAP指标上分别提升了7.3%、6.2%和6.6%，超越了BirdCLEF 2024的冠军模型。

Conclusion: 通过颜色化频谱图嵌入频率信息，显著提高了鸟类鸣声分类的准确性。

Abstract: We address the problem of classifying bird species using their song
recordings, a challenging task due to environmental noise, overlapping
vocalizations, and missing labels. Existing models struggle with low-SNR or
multi-species recordings. We hypothesize that birds can be classified by
visualizing their pitch pattern, speed, and repetition, collectively called
motifs. Deep learning models applied to spectrogram images help, but similar
motifs across species cause confusion. To mitigate this, we embed frequency
information into spectrograms using primary color additives. This enhances
species distinction and improves classification accuracy. Our experiments show
that the proposed approach achieves statistically significant gains over models
without colorization and surpasses the BirdCLEF 2024 winner, improving F1 by
7.3%, ROC-AUC by 6.2%, and CMAP by 6.6%. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of incorporating frequency information via colorization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够通过跨视角学习传递知识，但多模态大语言模型在这方面的能力尚未被探索。

Method: 构建EgoExoBench基准测试，包含11个子任务，分为语义对齐、视角关联和时序推理三大挑战，评估13种先进模型。

Result: 现有模型在单视角任务中表现良好，但在跨视角任务中表现较差。

Conclusion: EgoExoBench为研究跨视角智能提供了重要资源，有助于开发更接近人类智能的模型。

Abstract: Transferring and integrating knowledge across first-person (egocentric) and
third-person (exocentric) viewpoints is intrinsic to human intelligence,
enabling humans to learn from others and convey insights from their own
experiences. Despite rapid progress in multimodal large language models
(MLLMs), their ability to perform such cross-view reasoning remains unexplored.
To address this, we introduce EgoExoBench, the first benchmark for
egocentric-exocentric video understanding and reasoning. Built from publicly
available datasets, EgoExoBench comprises over 7,300 question-answer pairs
spanning eleven sub-tasks organized into three core challenges: semantic
alignment, viewpoint association, and temporal reasoning. We evaluate 13
state-of-the-art MLLMs and find that while these models excel on single-view
tasks, they struggle to align semantics across perspectives, accurately
associate views, and infer temporal dynamics in the ego-exo context. We hope
EgoExoBench can serve as a valuable resource for research on embodied agents
and intelligent assistants seeking human-like cross-view intelligence.

Abstract: Bias in computer vision models remains a significant challenge, often
resulting in unfair, unreliable, and non-generalizable AI systems. Although
research into bias mitigation has intensified, progress continues to be
hindered by fragmented implementations and inconsistent evaluation practices.
Disparate datasets and metrics used across studies complicate reproducibility,
making it difficult to fairly assess and compare the effectiveness of various
approaches. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Visual Bias
Mitigator (VB-Mitigator), an open-source framework designed to streamline the
development, evaluation, and comparative analysis of visual bias mitigation
techniques. VB-Mitigator offers a unified research environment encompassing 12
established mitigation methods, 7 diverse benchmark datasets. A key strength of
VB-Mitigator is its extensibility, allowing for seamless integration of
additional methods, datasets, metrics, and models. VB-Mitigator aims to
accelerate research toward fairness-aware computer vision models by serving as
a foundational codebase for the research community to develop and assess their
approaches. To this end, we also recommend best evaluation practices and
provide a comprehensive performance comparison among state-of-the-art
methodologies.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型可变形卷积模块，通过注意力机制和前馈网络学习偏移量，实现全局特征变形，并在眼底血管分割任务中取得最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统可变形卷积难以捕捉长距离全局特征，且卷积核大小与学习网络耦合，限制了其应用。

Method: 使用注意力机制和前馈网络学习子像素位移场，自适应变形特征图，实现全局特征变形和解耦。

Result: 在眼底血管分割任务中，提出的GDCUnet模型在公开数据集上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 该模块适用于具有复杂全局自相似特征的机器视觉任务。

Abstract: Deformable convolution can adaptively change the shape of convolution kernel
by learning offsets to deal with complex shape features. We propose a novel
plug and play deformable convolutional module that uses attention and
feedforward networks to learn offsets, so that the deformable patterns can
capture long-distance global features. Compared with previously existing
deformable convolutions, the proposed module learns the sub pixel displacement
field and adaptively warps the feature maps across all channels rather than
directly deforms the convolution kernel , which is equivalent to a relative
deformation of the kernel sampling grids, achieving global feature deformation
and the decoupling of kernel size and learning network. Considering that the
fundus blood vessels have globally self similar complex edges, we design a deep
learning model for fundus blood vessel segmentation, GDCUnet, based on the
proposed convolutional module. Empirical evaluations under the same
configuration and unified framework show that GDCUnet has achieved state of the
art performance on public datasets. Further ablation experiments demonstrated
that the proposed deformable convolutional module could more significantly
learn the complex features of fundus blood vessels, enhancing the model
representation and generalization capabilities.The proposed module is similar
to the interface of conventional convolution, we suggest applying it to more
machine vision tasks with complex global self similar features.

Motivation: 尽管生成模型在数字内容创作方面取得了进展，但生成高保真且时间一致的动态4D内容仍具挑战性。

Method: MVG4D通过图像矩阵模块合成时间相干且空间多样的多视角图像，优化3D高斯点云，并通过轻量变形网络扩展到时间域。

Result: 在Objaverse数据集上的实验表明，MVG4D在CLIP-I、PSNR、FVD和时间效率上优于现有方法，减少了闪烁伪影并提升了结构细节。

Conclusion: MVG4D为从最小输入高效可控地生成4D内容开辟了新方向，提升了AR/VR体验。

Abstract: Advances in generative modeling have significantly enhanced digital content
creation, extending from 2D images to complex 3D and 4D scenes. Despite
substantial progress, producing high-fidelity and temporally consistent dynamic
4D content remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose MVG4D, a novel
framework that generates dynamic 4D content from a single still image by
combining multi-view synthesis with 4D Gaussian Splatting (4D GS). At its core,
MVG4D employs an image matrix module that synthesizes temporally coherent and
spatially diverse multi-view images, providing rich supervisory signals for
downstream 3D and 4D reconstruction. These multi-view images are used to
optimize a 3D Gaussian point cloud, which is further extended into the temporal
domain via a lightweight deformation network. Our method effectively enhances
temporal consistency, geometric fidelity, and visual realism, addressing key
challenges in motion discontinuity and background degradation that affect prior
4D GS-based methods. Extensive experiments on the Objaverse dataset demonstrate
that MVG4D outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in CLIP-I, PSNR, FVD, and
time efficiency. Notably, it reduces flickering artifacts and sharpens
structural details across views and time, enabling more immersive AR/VR
experiences. MVG4D sets a new direction for efficient and controllable 4D
generation from minimal inputs.

TL;DR: SynC是一个新框架，通过重新分配语义对齐的图片-标题对来优化合成数据集，提升零样本图像描述（ZIC）性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像（T2I）模型生成的合成数据中图片与标题语义不对齐的问题，现有方法不适用于合成数据的噪声处理。

Method: 采用一对多映射策略，通过检索候选图片并使用循环一致性对齐评分器选择最佳匹配。

Result: 在多个标准基准测试中显著提升ZIC模型性能，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: SynC为优化合成数据提供了一种有效策略，可显著提升ZIC任务的表现。

Abstract: Zero-shot Image Captioning (ZIC) increasingly utilizes synthetic datasets
generated by text-to-image (T2I) models to mitigate the need for costly manual
annotation. However, these T2I models often produce images that exhibit
semantic misalignments with their corresponding input captions (e.g., missing
objects, incorrect attributes), resulting in noisy synthetic image-caption
pairs that can hinder model training. Existing dataset pruning techniques are
largely designed for removing noisy text in web-crawled data. However, these
methods are ill-suited for the distinct challenges of synthetic data, where
captions are typically well-formed, but images may be inaccurate
representations. To address this gap, we introduce SynC, a novel framework
specifically designed to refine synthetic image-caption datasets for ZIC.
Instead of conventional filtering or regeneration, SynC focuses on reassigning
captions to the most semantically aligned images already present within the
synthetic image pool. Our approach employs a one-to-many mapping strategy by
initially retrieving multiple relevant candidate images for each caption. We
then apply a cycle-consistency-inspired alignment scorer that selects the best
image by verifying its ability to retrieve the original caption via
image-to-text retrieval. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SynC
consistently and significantly improves performance across various ZIC models
on standard benchmarks (MS-COCO, Flickr30k, NoCaps), achieving state-of-the-art
results in several scenarios. SynC offers an effective strategy for curating
refined synthetic data to enhance ZIC.

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过消除中间表示，实现了更高效和一致的姿态生成，尤其在长期场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Current approaches to pose generation rely heavily on intermediate
representations, either through two-stage pipelines with quantization or
autoregressive models that accumulate errors during inference. This fundamental
limitation leads to degraded performance, particularly in long-term pose
generation where maintaining temporal coherence is crucial. We propose a novel
one-stage architecture that directly generates poses in continuous coordinate
space from minimal context - a single RGB image and text description - while
maintaining consistent distributions between training and inference. Our key
innovation is eliminating the need for intermediate representations or
token-based generation by operating directly on pose coordinates through a
relative movement prediction mechanism that preserves spatial relationships,
and a unified placeholder token approach that enables single-forward generation
with identical behavior during training and inference. Through extensive
experiments on Penn Action and First-Person Hand Action Benchmark (F-PHAB)
datasets, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
quantization-based and autoregressive methods, especially in long-term
generation scenarios.

Result: 在OpenHumanBRDF数据集和真实数据上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过高质量数据集和渐进式训练策略，显著提升了材料估计和渲染的真实感。

Abstract: Full-body Human inverse rendering based on physically-based rendering aims to
acquire high-quality materials, which helps achieve photo-realistic rendering
under arbitrary illuminations. This task requires estimating multiple material
maps and usually relies on the constraint of rendering result. The absence of
constraints on the material maps makes inverse rendering an ill-posed task.
Previous works alleviated this problem by building material dataset for
training, but their simplified material data and rendering equation lead to
rendering results with limited realism, especially that of skin. To further
alleviate this problem, we construct a higher-quality dataset (OpenHumanBRDF)
based on scanned real data and statistical material data. In addition to the
normal, diffuse albedo, roughness, specular albedo, we produce displacement and
subsurface scattering to enhance the realism of rendering results, especially
for the skin. With the increase in prediction tasks for more materials, using
an end-to-end model as in the previous work struggles to balance the importance
among various material maps, and leads to model underfitting. Therefore, we
design a model (HumanMaterial) with progressive training strategy to make full
use of the supervision information of the material maps and improve the
performance of material estimation. HumanMaterial first obtain the initial
material results via three prior models, and then refine the results by a
finetuning model. Prior models estimate different material maps, and each map
has different significance for rendering results. Thus, we design a Controlled
PBR Rendering (CPR) loss, which enhances the importance of the materials to be
optimized during the training of prior models. Extensive experiments on
OpenHumanBRDF dataset and real data demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: 该框架促进了公平比较和加速研究，同时增进了对真实世界LiDAR感知对抗鲁棒性的理解。

Abstract: Adversarial robustness in LiDAR-based 3D object detection is a critical
research area due to its widespread application in real-world scenarios. While
many digital attacks manipulate point clouds or meshes, they often lack
physical realizability, limiting their practical impact. Physical adversarial
object attacks remain underexplored and suffer from poor reproducibility due to
inconsistent setups and hardware differences. To address this, we propose a
device-agnostic, standardized framework that abstracts key elements of physical
adversarial object attacks, supports diverse methods, and provides open-source
code with benchmarking protocols in simulation and real-world settings. Our
framework enables fair comparison, accelerates research, and is validated by
successfully transferring simulated attacks to a physical LiDAR system. Beyond
the framework, we offer insights into factors influencing attack success and
advance understanding of adversarial robustness in real-world LiDAR perception.

global attention. Extensive experiments on visual benchmarks demonstrate that
Iwin Transformer exhibits strong competitiveness in tasks such as image
classification (87.4 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K), semantic segmentation and
video action recognition. We also validate the effectiveness of the core
component in Iwin as a standalone module that can seamlessly replace the
self-attention module in class-conditional image generation. The concepts and
methods introduced by the Iwin Transformer have the potential to inspire future
research, like Iwin 3D Attention in video generation. The code and models are

*Xiao Yang,Lingxuan Wu,Lizhong Wang,Chengyang Ying,Hang Su,Jun Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Rein-EAD的主动防御框架，通过自适应探索与环境交互来提升3D对抗场景中的感知鲁棒性，显著降低了攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D环境中的对抗攻击对视觉感知系统的可靠性构成威胁，现有防御机制依赖静态假设，适应性不足。

Method: 采用多步目标平衡即时预测准确性和预测熵最小化，结合不确定性导向的奖励机制优化策略。

Result: 实验表明Rein-EAD显著降低攻击成功率，同时保持标准准确性，并能泛化到未见过的攻击。

Conclusion: Rein-EAD是一种适用于复杂3D任务的主动防御框架，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks in 3D environments have emerged as a critical threat to
the reliability of visual perception systems, particularly in safety-sensitive
applications such as identity verification and autonomous driving. These
attacks employ adversarial patches and 3D objects to manipulate deep neural
network (DNN) predictions by exploiting vulnerabilities within complex scenes.
Existing defense mechanisms, such as adversarial training and purification,
primarily employ passive strategies to enhance robustness. However, these
approaches often rely on pre-defined assumptions about adversarial tactics,
limiting their adaptability in dynamic 3D settings. To address these
challenges, we introduce Reinforced Embodied Active Defense (Rein-EAD), a
proactive defense framework that leverages adaptive exploration and interaction
with the environment to improve perception robustness in 3D adversarial
contexts. By implementing a multi-step objective that balances immediate
prediction accuracy with predictive entropy minimization, Rein-EAD optimizes
defense strategies over a multi-step horizon. Additionally, Rein-EAD involves
an uncertainty-oriented reward-shaping mechanism that facilitates efficient
policy updates, thereby reducing computational overhead and supporting
real-world applicability without the need for differentiable environments.
Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Rein-EAD, demonstrating
a substantial reduction in attack success rates while preserving standard
accuracy across diverse tasks. Notably, Rein-EAD exhibits robust generalization
to unseen and adaptive attacks, making it suitable for real-world complex
tasks, including 3D object classification, face recognition and autonomous
driving.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCFFSNet提出了一种新的特征空间解耦策略，动态平衡多尺度特征表达，显著提升了医学图像分割的精度和边缘一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将拓扑连通性强制注入为额外特征模块，导致特征空间耦合且缺乏标准化机制量化特征强度。

Method: 提出DCFFSNet，采用特征空间解耦策略，量化连通性特征与其他特征的相对强度，并构建动态平衡的多尺度特征融合-分离架构。

Result: 在ISIC2018、DSB2018和MoNuSeg数据集上，DCFFSNet在所有指标上均优于现有主流方法，如Dice和IoU提升显著。

Conclusion: DCFFSNet有效解决了分割碎片化问题，实现了平滑边缘过渡，显著提升了临床实用性。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation leverages topological connectivity theory to
enhance edge precision and regional consistency. However, existing deep
networks integrating connectivity often forcibly inject it as an additional
feature module, resulting in coupled feature spaces with no standardized
mechanism to quantify different feature strengths. To address these issues, we
propose DCFFSNet (Dual-Connectivity Feature Fusion-Separation Network). It
introduces an innovative feature space decoupling strategy. This strategy
quantifies the relative strength between connectivity features and other
features. It then builds a deep connectivity feature fusion-separation
architecture. This architecture dynamically balances multi-scale feature
expression. Experiments were conducted on the ISIC2018, DSB2018, and MoNuSeg
datasets. On ISIC2018, DCFFSNet outperformed the next best model (CMUNet) by
1.3% (Dice) and 1.2% (IoU). On DSB2018, it surpassed TransUNet by 0.7% (Dice)
and 0.9% (IoU). On MoNuSeg, it exceeded CSCAUNet by 0.8% (Dice) and 0.9% (IoU).
The results demonstrate that DCFFSNet exceeds existing mainstream methods
across all metrics. It effectively resolves segmentation fragmentation and
achieves smooth edge transitions. This significantly enhances clinical
usability.

Motivation: 现有研究局限于同模态模型的SAE特征比较，缺乏跨模态的定量分析工具。

Conclusion: 跨模态特征共享性研究为理解模型表示提供了新视角。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful technique for
extracting human-interpretable features from neural networks activations.
Previous works compared different models based on SAE-derived features but
those comparisons have been restricted to models within the same modality. We
propose a novel indicator allowing quantitative comparison of models across SAE
features, and use it to conduct a comparative study of visual, textual and
multimodal encoders. We also propose to quantify the Comparative Sharedness of
individual features between different classes of models. With these two new
tools, we conduct several studies on 21 encoders of the three types, with two
significantly different sizes, and considering generalist and domain specific
datasets. The results allow to revisit previous studies at the light of
encoders trained in a multimodal context and to quantify to which extent all
these models share some representations or features. They also suggest that
visual features that are specific to VLMs among vision encoders are shared with
text encoders, highlighting the impact of text pretraining. The code is

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于V-JEPA的自监督学习方法，结合3D定位辅助任务，显著提升了超声视频数据的分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声成像数据获取和标注困难，自监督学习可以利用未标注数据学习有用表示，提升有限标注数据下的分割性能。

Method: 采用V-JEPA框架，避免像素级重建或负样本，并提出3D定位辅助任务以增强ViT模型的空间局部性。

Result: 在多种冻结编码器配置下，分割性能显著提升，使用100%训练数据时提升3.4%，仅用10%时提升8.35%。

Conclusion: V-JEPA结合3D定位辅助任务在超声视频数据中表现优异，为小规模医学数据集提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Acquiring and annotating large datasets in ultrasound imaging is challenging
due to low contrast, high noise, and susceptibility to artefacts. This process
requires significant time and clinical expertise. Self-supervised learning
(SSL) offers a promising solution by leveraging unlabelled data to learn useful
representations, enabling improved segmentation performance when annotated data
is limited. Recent state-of-the-art developments in SSL for video data include
V-JEPA, a framework solely based on feature prediction, avoiding pixel level
reconstruction or negative samples. We hypothesise that V-JEPA is well-suited
to ultrasound imaging, as it is less sensitive to noisy pixel-level detail
while effectively leveraging temporal information. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to adopt V-JEPA for ultrasound video data.
Similar to other patch-based masking SSL techniques such as VideoMAE, V-JEPA is
well-suited to ViT-based models. However, ViTs can underperform on small
medical datasets due to lack of inductive biases, limited spatial locality and
absence of hierarchical feature learning. To improve locality understanding, we
propose a novel 3D localisation auxiliary task to improve locality in ViT
representations during V-JEPA pre-training. Our results show V-JEPA with our
auxiliary task improves segmentation performance significantly across various
frozen encoder configurations, with gains up to 3.4\% using 100\% and up to
8.35\% using only 10\% of the training data.

Motivation: 头部姿态估计在计算机视觉应用中至关重要，但现有数据集标注不准确且训练数据有限。

Conclusion: NLML-HPE在有限数据下高效且准确，适用于实时头部姿态估计。

Abstract: Head pose estimation (HPE) plays a critical role in various computer vision
applications such as human-computer interaction and facial recognition. In this
paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach for head pose estimation with
limited training data via non-linear manifold learning called NLML-HPE. This
method is based on the combination of tensor decomposition (i.e., Tucker
decomposition) and feed forward neural networks. Unlike traditional
classification-based approaches, our method formulates head pose estimation as
a regression problem, mapping input landmarks into a continuous representation
of pose angles. To this end, our method uses tensor decomposition to split each
Euler angle (yaw, pitch, roll) to separate subspaces and models each dimension
of the underlying manifold as a cosine curve. We address two key challenges: 1.
Almost all HPE datasets suffer from incorrect and inaccurate pose annotations.
Hence, we generated a precise and consistent 2D head pose dataset for our
training set by rotating 3D head models for a fixed set of poses and rendering
the corresponding 2D images. 2. We achieved real-time performance with limited
training data as our method accurately captures the nature of rotation of an
object from facial landmarks. Once the underlying manifold for rotation around
each axis is learned, the model is very fast in predicting unseen data. Our
training and testing code is available online along with our trained models:

Motivation: 现有数据集缺乏深度认知表达（如意图），VideoMind旨在填补这一空白，支持细粒度跨模态对齐和深度视频理解任务。

Method: 数据集通过Chain-of-Thought（COT）方法生成分层描述（事实、抽象、意图），并设计混合认知检索实验评估模型性能。

Result: 提供了3,000个手动验证样本作为基准，评估了InternVideo、VAST等模型的性能，结果公开。

Conclusion: VideoMind为深度视频理解任务（如情感和意图识别）提供了强大基准，数据已公开。

Abstract: This paper introduces VideoMind, a video-centric omni-modal dataset designed
for deep video content cognition and enhanced multi-modal feature
representation. The dataset comprises 103K video samples (3K reserved for
testing), each paired with audio and systematically detailed textual
descriptions. Specifically, every video and its audio is described across three
hierarchical layers (factual, abstract, and intent), progressing from surface
to depth. It contains over 22 million words, averaging ~225 words per sample.
VideoMind's key distinction from existing datasets is its provision of intent
expressions, which require contextual integration across the entire video and
are not directly observable. These deep-cognitive expressions are generated
using a Chain-of-Thought (COT) approach, prompting the mLLM through
step-by-step reasoning. Each description includes annotations for subject,
place, time, event, action, and intent, supporting downstream recognition
tasks. Crucially, we establish a gold-standard benchmark with 3,000 manually
validated samples for evaluating deep-cognitive video understanding. We design
hybrid-cognitive retrieval experiments, scored by multi-level retrieval
metrics, to appropriately assess deep video comprehension. Evaluation results
for models (e.g., InternVideo, VAST, UMT-L) are released. VideoMind serves as a
powerful benchmark for fine-grained cross-modal alignment and advances fields
requiring in-depth video understanding, such as emotion and intent recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉地点识别在多变环境和视角下性能不稳定，需要更鲁棒和高效的解决方案。

Result: 在多数基准数据集上达到最优性能，减少30%训练数据需求，显著提升计算效率。

Conclusion: 该框架在视觉地点识别任务中表现出色，兼具鲁棒性和高效性。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is crucial for robust mobile robot
localization, yet it faces significant challenges in maintaining reliable
performance under varying environmental conditions and viewpoints. To address
this, we propose a novel framework that integrates Dual-Scale-Former
(DSFormer), a Transformer-based cross-learning module, with an innovative block
clustering strategy. DSFormer enhances feature representation by enabling
bidirectional information transfer between dual-scale features extracted from
the final two CNN layers, capturing both semantic richness and spatial details
through self-attention for long-range dependencies within each scale and shared
cross-attention for cross-scale learning. Complementing this, our block
clustering strategy repartitions the widely used San Francisco eXtra Large
(SF-XL) training dataset from multiple distinct perspectives, optimizing data
organization to further bolster robustness against viewpoint variations.
Together, these innovations not only yield a robust global embedding adaptable
to environmental changes but also reduce the required training data volume by
approximately 30\% compared to previous partitioning methods. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
across most benchmark datasets, surpassing advanced reranking methods like
DELG, Patch-NetVLAD, TransVPR, and R2Former as a global retrieval solution
using 512-dim global descriptors, while significantly improving computational
efficiency.

Result: 微调后的MLLMs在问答任务中零样本性能提升73.2%，在意图预测和识别任务中性能提升最高达12.5%。

Conclusion: PDB-Eval能有效弥合MLLMs与驾驶领域的差距，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Understanding a driver's behavior and intentions is important for potential
risk assessment and early accident prevention. Safety and driver assistance
systems can be tailored to individual drivers' behavior, significantly
enhancing their effectiveness. However, existing datasets are limited in
describing and explaining general vehicle movements based on external visual
evidence. This paper introduces a benchmark, PDB-Eval, for a detailed
understanding of Personalized Driver Behavior, and aligning Large Multimodal
Models (MLLMs) with driving comprehension and reasoning. Our benchmark consists
of two main components, PDB-X and PDB-QA. PDB-X can evaluate MLLMs'
understanding of temporal driving scenes. Our dataset is designed to find valid
visual evidence from the external view to explain the driver's behavior from
the internal view. To align MLLMs' reasoning abilities with driving tasks, we
propose PDB-QA as a visual explanation question-answering task for MLLM
instruction fine-tuning. As a generic learning task for generative models like
MLLMs, PDB-QA can bridge the domain gap without harming MLLMs'
generalizability. Our evaluation indicates that fine-tuning MLLMs on
fine-grained descriptions and explanations can effectively bridge the gap
between MLLMs and the driving domain, which improves zero-shot performance on
question-answering tasks by up to 73.2%. We further evaluate the MLLMs
fine-tuned on PDB-X in Brain4Cars' intention prediction and AIDE's recognition
tasks. We observe up to 12.5% performance improvements on the turn intention
prediction task in Brain4Cars, and consistent performance improvements up to
11.0% on all tasks in AIDE.

Conclusion: DRWKV在低光图像增强和多目标跟踪任务中表现出色，具有泛化能力。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement remains a challenging task, particularly in
preserving object edge continuity and fine structural details under extreme
illumination degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel model, DRWKV
(Detailed Receptance Weighted Key Value), which integrates our proposed Global
Edge Retinex (GER) theory, enabling effective decoupling of illumination and
edge structures for enhanced edge fidelity. Secondly, we introduce Evolving WKV
Attention, a spiral-scanning mechanism that captures spatial edge continuity
and models irregular structures more effectively. Thirdly, we design the
Bilateral Spectrum Aligner (Bi-SAB) and a tailored MS2-Loss to jointly align
luminance and chrominance features, improving visual naturalness and mitigating
artifacts. Extensive experiments on five LLIE benchmarks demonstrate that DRWKV
achieves leading performance in PSNR, SSIM, and NIQE while maintaining low
computational complexity. Furthermore, DRWKV enhances downstream performance in
low-light multi-object tracking tasks, validating its generalization
capabilities.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication plays a crucial role in autonomous
driving, enabling cooperation between vehicles and infrastructure. While
simulation has significantly contributed to various autonomous driving tasks,
its potential for data generation and augmentation in V2X scenarios remains
underexplored. In this paper, we introduce CRUISE, a comprehensive
reconstruction-and-synthesis framework designed for V2X driving environments.
CRUISE employs decomposed Gaussian Splatting to accurately reconstruct
real-world scenes while supporting flexible editing. By decomposing dynamic
traffic participants into editable Gaussian representations, CRUISE allows for
seamless modification and augmentation of driving scenes. Furthermore, the
framework renders images from both ego-vehicle and infrastructure views,
enabling large-scale V2X dataset augmentation for training and evaluation. Our
experimental results demonstrate that: 1) CRUISE reconstructs real-world V2X
driving scenes with high fidelity; 2) using CRUISE improves 3D detection across
ego-vehicle, infrastructure, and cooperative views, as well as cooperative 3D
tracking on the V2X-Seq benchmark; and 3) CRUISE effectively generates
challenging corner cases.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in medical images is an important yet challenging task due
to the diversity of possible anomalies and the practical impossibility of
collecting comprehensively annotated data sets. In this work, we tackle
unsupervised medical anomaly detection proposing a modernized autoencoder-based
framework, the Q-Former Autoencoder, that leverages state-of-the-art pretrained
vision foundation models, such as DINO, DINOv2 and Masked Autoencoder. Instead
of training encoders from scratch, we directly utilize frozen vision foundation
models as feature extractors, enabling rich, multi-stage, high-level
representations without domain-specific fine-tuning. We propose the usage of
the Q-Former architecture as the bottleneck, which enables the control of the
length of the reconstruction sequence, while efficiently aggregating multiscale
features. Additionally, we incorporate a perceptual loss computed using
features from a pretrained Masked Autoencoder, guiding the reconstruction
towards semantically meaningful structures. Our framework is evaluated on four
diverse medical anomaly detection benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art
results on BraTS2021, RESC, and RSNA. Our results highlight the potential of
vision foundation model encoders, pretrained on natural images, to generalize
effectively to medical image analysis tasks without further fine-tuning. We

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D软件生成方法无法修改特定元素或处理复杂空间语义约束，Scenethesis旨在解决这些问题。

Result: Scenethesis能准确捕获80%以上用户需求，满足90%以上硬约束，并在视觉评估中提升42.8%。

Conclusion: Scenethesis为3D软件生成提供了高效、可验证的解决方案。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (UI) software has undergone a fundamental
transformation from traditional two-dimensional (2D) desktop/web/mobile
interfaces to spatial three-dimensional (3D) environments. While existing work
has made remarkable success in automated 2D software generation, such as
HTML/CSS and mobile app interface code synthesis, the generation of 3D software
still remains under-explored. Current methods for 3D software generation
usually generate the 3D environments as a whole and cannot modify or control
specific elements in the software. Furthermore, these methods struggle to
handle the complex spatial and semantic constraints inherent in the real world.
To address the challenges, we present Scenethesis, a novel
requirement-sensitive 3D software synthesis approach that maintains formal
traceability between user specifications and generated 3D software. Scenethesis
is built upon ScenethesisLang, a domain-specific language that serves as a
granular constraint-aware intermediate representation (IR) to bridge natural
language requirements and executable 3D software. It serves both as a
comprehensive scene description language enabling fine-grained modification of
3D software elements and as a formal constraint-expressive specification
language capable of expressing complex spatial constraints. By decomposing 3D
software synthesis into stages operating on ScenethesisLang, Scenethesis
enables independent verification, targeted modification, and systematic
constraint satisfaction. Our evaluation demonstrates that Scenethesis
accurately captures over 80% of user requirements and satisfies more than 90%
of hard constraints while handling over 100 constraints simultaneously.
Furthermore, Scenethesis achieves a 42.8% improvement in BLIP-2 visual
evaluation scores compared to the state-of-the-art method.

Abstract: Accurate detection of Plasmodium falciparum in Giemsa-stained blood smears is
an essential component of reliable malaria diagnosis, especially in developing
countries. Deep learning-based object detection methods have demonstrated
strong potential for automated Malaria diagnosis, but their adoption is limited
by the scarcity of datasets with detailed instance-level annotations. In this
work, we present an enhanced version of the publicly available NIH malaria
dataset, with detailed bounding box annotations in COCO format to support
object detection training. We validated the revised annotations by training a
Faster R-CNN model to detect infected and non-infected red blood cells, as well
as white blood cells. Cross-validation on the original dataset yielded F1
scores of up to 0.88 for infected cell detection. These results underscore the
importance of annotation volume and consistency, and demonstrate that automated
annotation refinement combined with targeted manual correction can produce
training data of sufficient quality for robust detection performance. The

Result: 在多种零样本适应场景中表现优异，尤其在挑战性领域，同时显著减少适应时间。

Conclusion: SIDA通过合成图像和高效模块设计，实现了零样本域适应的高效和性能提升。

Abstract: Zero-shot domain adaptation is a method for adapting a model to a target
domain without utilizing target domain image data. To enable adaptation without
target images, existing studies utilize CLIP's embedding space and text
description to simulate target-like style features. Despite the previous
achievements in zero-shot domain adaptation, we observe that these text-driven
methods struggle to capture complex real-world variations and significantly
increase adaptation time due to their alignment process. Instead of relying on
text descriptions, we explore solutions leveraging image data, which provides
diverse and more fine-grained style cues. In this work, we propose SIDA, a
novel and efficient zero-shot domain adaptation method leveraging synthetic
images. To generate synthetic images, we first create detailed, source-like
images and apply image translation to reflect the style of the target domain.
We then utilize the style features of these synthetic images as a proxy for the
target domain. Based on these features, we introduce Domain Mix and Patch Style
Transfer modules, which enable effective modeling of real-world variations. In
particular, Domain Mix blends multiple styles to expand the intra-domain
representations, and Patch Style Transfer assigns different styles to
individual patches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by showing
state-of-the-art performance in diverse zero-shot adaptation scenarios,
particularly in challenging domains. Moreover, our approach achieves high
efficiency by significantly reducing the overall adaptation time.

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving are moving towards mapless approaches,
where High-Definition (HD) maps are generated online directly from sensor data,
reducing the need for expensive labeling and maintenance. However, the
reliability of these online-generated maps remains uncertain. While
incorporating map uncertainty into downstream trajectory prediction tasks has
shown potential for performance improvements, current strategies provide
limited insights into the specific scenarios where this uncertainty is
beneficial. In this work, we first analyze the driving scenarios in which
mapping uncertainty has the greatest positive impact on trajectory prediction
and identify a critical, previously overlooked factor: the agent's kinematic
state. Building on these insights, we propose a novel Proprioceptive Scenario
Gating that adaptively integrates map uncertainty into trajectory prediction
based on forecasts of the ego vehicle's future kinematics. This lightweight,
self-supervised approach enhances the synergy between online mapping and
trajectory prediction, providing interpretability around where uncertainty is
advantageous and outperforming previous integration methods. Additionally, we
introduce a Covariance-based Map Uncertainty approach that better aligns with
map geometry, further improving trajectory prediction. Extensive ablation
studies confirm the effectiveness of our approach, achieving up to 23.6%
improvement in mapless trajectory prediction performance over the
state-of-the-art method using the real-world nuScenes driving dataset. Our
code, data, and models are publicly available at

Abstract: In goal-directed visual tasks, human perception is guided by both top-down
and bottom-up cues. At the same time, foveal vision plays a crucial role in
directing attention efficiently. Modern research on bio-inspired computational
attention models has taken advantage of advancements in deep learning by
utilizing human scanpath data to achieve new state-of-the-art performance. In
this work, we assess the performance of SemBA-FAST, i.e. Semantic-based
Bayesian Attention for Foveal Active visual Search Tasks, a top-down framework
designed for predicting human visual attention in target-present visual search.
SemBA-FAST integrates deep object detection with a probabilistic semantic
fusion mechanism to generate attention maps dynamically, leveraging pre-trained
detectors and artificial foveation to update top-down knowledge and improve
fixation prediction sequentially. We evaluate SemBA-FAST on the COCO-Search18
benchmark dataset, comparing its performance against other scanpath prediction
models. Our methodology achieves fixation sequences that closely match human
ground-truth scanpaths. Notably, it surpasses baseline and other top-down
approaches and competes, in some cases, with scanpath-informed models. These
findings provide valuable insights into the capabilities of semantic-foveal
probabilistic frameworks for human-like attention modelling, with implications
for real-time cognitive computing and robotics.

Abstract: Object detection is one of the main applications of computer vision in remote
sensing imagery. Despite its increasing availability, the sheer volume of
remote sensing data poses a challenge when detecting rare objects across large
geographic areas. Paradoxically, this common challenge is crucial to many
applications, such as estimating environmental impact of certain human
activities at scale. In this paper, we propose to address the problem by
investigating the methane production and emissions of bio-digesters in France.
We first introduce a novel dataset containing bio-digesters, with small
training and validation sets, and a large test set with a high imbalance
towards observations without objects since such sites are rare. We develop a
part-based method that considers essential bio-digester sub-elements to boost
initial detections. To this end, we apply our method to new, unseen regions to
build an inventory of bio-digesters. We then compute geostatistical estimates
of the quantity of methane produced that can be attributed to these
infrastructures in a given area at a given time.

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of semantic object segmentation using
foundation models. We investigate whether foundation models, trained on a large
number and variety of objects, can perform object segmentation without
fine-tuning on specific images containing everyday objects, but in highly

application of vision guided upper limb neuroprostheses. We propose a method
for generating prompts based on gaze fixations to guide the Segment Anything

data. Evaluation results of our approach show an improvement of the IoU
segmentation quality metric by up to 0.51 points on real-world challenging data

Result: 在多种传感器组合测试中表现优异，优于现有方法，提升了内存效率和推理速度。

Conclusion: GaussianFusionOcc通过多模态融合和高斯表示，实现了更精确、高效的3D语义占用预测。

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is one of the crucial tasks of autonomous
driving. It enables precise and safe interpretation and navigation in complex
environments. Reliable predictions rely on effective sensor fusion, as
different modalities can contain complementary information. Unlike conventional
methods that depend on dense grid representations, our approach,
GaussianFusionOcc, uses semantic 3D Gaussians alongside an innovative sensor
fusion mechanism. Seamless integration of data from camera, LiDAR, and radar
sensors enables more precise and scalable occupancy prediction, while 3D
Gaussian representation significantly improves memory efficiency and inference
speed. GaussianFusionOcc employs modality-agnostic deformable attention to
extract essential features from each sensor type, which are then used to refine
Gaussian properties, resulting in a more accurate representation of the
environment. Extensive testing with various sensor combinations demonstrates
the versatility of our approach. By leveraging the robustness of multi-modal
fusion and the efficiency of Gaussian representation, GaussianFusionOcc
outperforms current state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: IntentVCNet有效提升模型在视频序列中建模空间细节的能力，实现精准意图导向描述。

Abstract: Intent-oriented controlled video captioning aims to generate targeted
descriptions for specific targets in a video based on customized user intent.
Current Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have gained strong instruction
following and visual comprehension capabilities. Although the LVLMs
demonstrated proficiency in spatial and temporal understanding respectively, it
was not able to perform fine-grained spatial control in time sequences in
direct response to instructions. This substantial spatio-temporal gap
complicates efforts to achieve fine-grained intention-oriented control in
video. Towards this end, we propose a novel IntentVCNet that unifies the
temporal and spatial understanding knowledge inherent in LVLMs to bridge the
spatio-temporal gap from both prompting and model perspectives. Specifically,
we first propose a prompt combination strategy designed to enable LLM to model
the implicit relationship between prompts that characterize user intent and
video sequences. We then propose a parameter efficient box adapter that
augments the object semantic information in the global visual context so that
the visual token has a priori information about the user intent. The final
experiment proves that the combination of the two strategies can further
enhance the LVLM's ability to model spatial details in video sequences, and
facilitate the LVLMs to accurately generate controlled intent-oriented
captions. Our proposed method achieved state-of-the-art results in several open
source LVLMs and was the runner-up in the IntentVC challenge. Our code is

Method: 提出EDA，支持任意噪声模式，保持EDM模块灵活性，并证明噪声复杂度增加不会带来额外计算开销。

Result: EDA在MRI偏置场校正、CT金属伪影减少和自然图像阴影去除任务中表现优异，仅需5步采样即超越多数任务专用方法。

Conclusion: EDA通过扩展噪声设计空间，显著提升了扩散模型在图像恢复任务中的性能，且计算高效。

Abstract: EDM elucidates the unified design space of diffusion models, yet its fixed
noise patterns restricted to pure Gaussian noise, limit advancements in image
restoration. Our study indicates that forcibly injecting Gaussian noise
corrupts the degraded images, overextends the image transformation distance,
and increases restoration complexity. To address this problem, our proposed EDA
Elucidates the Design space of Arbitrary-noise-based diffusion models.
Theoretically, EDA expands the freedom of noise pattern while preserving the
original module flexibility of EDM, with rigorous proof that increased noise
complexity incurs no additional computational overhead during restoration. EDA
is validated on three typical tasks: MRI bias field correction (global smooth
noise), CT metal artifact reduction (global sharp noise), and natural image
shadow removal (local boundary-aware noise). With only 5 sampling steps, EDA
outperforms most task-specific methods and achieves state-of-the-art
performance in bias field correction and shadow removal.

Conclusion: TTS-VAR通过动态平衡计算效率和探索能力，验证了早期结构特征对最终质量的影响，并展示了多尺度生成的有效性。

Abstract: Scaling visual generation models is essential for real-world content
creation, yet requires substantial training and computational expenses.
Alternatively, test-time scaling has garnered growing attention due to resource
efficiency and promising performance. In this work, we present TTS-VAR, the
first general test-time scaling framework for visual auto-regressive (VAR)
models, modeling the generation process as a path searching problem. To
dynamically balance computational efficiency with exploration capacity, we
first introduce an adaptive descending batch size schedule throughout the
causal generation process. Besides, inspired by VAR's hierarchical
coarse-to-fine multi-scale generation, our framework integrates two key
components: (i) At coarse scales, we observe that generated tokens are hard for
evaluation, possibly leading to erroneous acceptance of inferior samples or
rejection of superior samples. Noticing that the coarse scales contain
sufficient structural information, we propose clustering-based diversity
search. It preserves structural variety through semantic feature clustering,
enabling later selection on samples with higher potential. (ii) In fine scales,
resampling-based potential selection prioritizes promising candidates using
potential scores, which are defined as reward functions incorporating
multi-scale generation history. Experiments on the powerful VAR model Infinity
show a notable 8.7% GenEval score improvement (from 0.69 to 0.75). Key insights
reveal that early-stage structural features effectively influence final
quality, and resampling efficacy varies across generation scales. Code is

Result: 在Waymo和KITTI数据集上实现了高精度的无位姿重建，达到了新的技术水平。

Conclusion: 该方法通过全局对齐和联合优化，显著提升了无位姿3DGS重建的效率和精度。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a core technique for 3D
representation. Its effectiveness largely depends on precise camera poses and
accurate point cloud initialization, which are often derived from pretrained
Multi-View Stereo (MVS) models. However, in unposed reconstruction task from
hundreds of outdoor images, existing MVS models may struggle with memory limits
and lose accuracy as the number of input images grows. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel unposed 3DGS reconstruction framework that
integrates pretrained MVS priors with the probabilistic Procrustes mapping
strategy. The method partitions input images into subsets, maps submaps into a
global space, and jointly optimizes geometry and poses with 3DGS. Technically,
we formulate the mapping of tens of millions of point clouds as a probabilistic
Procrustes problem and solve a closed-form alignment. By employing
probabilistic coupling along with a soft dustbin mechanism to reject uncertain
correspondences, our method globally aligns point clouds and poses within
minutes across hundreds of images. Moreover, we propose a joint optimization
framework for 3DGS and camera poses. It constructs Gaussians from
confidence-aware anchor points and integrates 3DGS differentiable rendering
with an analytical Jacobian to jointly refine scene and poses, enabling
accurate reconstruction and pose estimation. Experiments on Waymo and KITTI
datasets show that our method achieves accurate reconstruction from unposed
image sequences, setting a new state of the art for unposed 3DGS
reconstruction.

Abstract: Intraoperative registration of real-time ultrasound (iUS) to preoperative
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains an unsolved problem due to severe
modality-specific differences in appearance, resolution, and field-of-view. To
address this, we propose a novel 3D cross-modal keypoint descriptor for MRI-iUS
matching and registration. Our approach employs a patient-specific
matching-by-synthesis approach, generating synthetic iUS volumes from
preoperative MRI. This enables supervised contrastive training to learn a
shared descriptor space.
  A probabilistic keypoint detection strategy is then employed to identify
anatomically salient and modality-consistent locations. During training, a
curriculum-based triplet loss with dynamic hard negative mining is used to
learn descriptors that are i) robust to iUS artifacts such as speckle noise and
limited coverage, and ii) rotation-invariant . At inference, the method detects
keypoints in MR and real iUS images and identifies sparse matches, which are
then used to perform rigid registration. Our approach is evaluated using 3D
MRI-iUS pairs from the ReMIND dataset. Experiments show that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art keypoint matching methods across 11 patients, with
an average precision of $69.8\%$. For image registration, our method achieves a
competitive mean Target Registration Error of 2.39 mm on the ReMIND2Reg
benchmark.
  Compared to existing iUS-MR registration approach, our framework is
interpretable, requires no manual initialization, and shows robustness to iUS
field-of-view variation. Code is available at

Abstract: The poultry industry has been driven by broiler chicken production and has
grown into the world's largest animal protein sector. Automated detection of
chicken carcasses on processing lines is vital for quality control, food
safety, and operational efficiency in slaughterhouses and poultry processing
plants. However, developing robust deep learning models for tasks like instance
segmentation in these fast-paced industrial environments is often hampered by
the need for laborious acquisition and annotation of large-scale real-world
image datasets. We present the first pipeline generating photo-realistic,
automatically labeled synthetic images of chicken carcasses. We also introduce
a new benchmark dataset containing 300 annotated real-world images, curated
specifically for poultry segmentation research. Using these datasets, this
study investigates the efficacy of synthetic data and automatic data annotation
to enhance the instance segmentation of chicken carcasses, particularly when
real annotated data from the processing line is scarce. A small real dataset
with varying proportions of synthetic images was evaluated in prominent
instance segmentation models. Results show that synthetic data significantly
boosts segmentation performance for chicken carcasses across all models. This
research underscores the value of synthetic data augmentation as a viable and
effective strategy to mitigate data scarcity, reduce manual annotation efforts,
and advance the development of robust AI-driven automated detection systems for
chicken carcasses in the poultry processing industry.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel deep learning-based approach for simultaneous age
and gender classification from facial images, designed to enhance the
effectiveness of targeted advertising campaigns. We propose a custom
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, optimized for both tasks,
which leverages the inherent correlation between age and gender information
present in facial features. Unlike existing methods that often treat these
tasks independently, our model learns shared representations, leading to
improved performance. The network is trained on a large, diverse dataset of
facial images, carefully pre-processed to ensure robustness against variations
in lighting, pose, and image quality. Our experimental results demonstrate a
significant improvement in gender classification accuracy, achieving 95%, and a
competitive mean absolute error of 5.77 years for age estimation. Critically,
we analyze the performance across different age groups, identifying specific
challenges in accurately estimating the age of younger individuals. This
analysis reveals the need for targeted data augmentation and model refinement
to address these biases. Furthermore, we explore the impact of different CNN
architectures and hyperparameter settings on the overall performance, providing
valuable insights for future research.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了合成复制问题，扩展了去合成技术的适用性。

Abstract: A morph is created by combining two (or more) face images from two (or more)
identities to create a composite image that is highly similar to both
constituent identities, allowing the forged morph to be biometrically
associated with more than one individual. Morph Attack Detection (MAD) can be
used to detect a morph, but does not reveal the constituent images. Demorphing
- the process of deducing the constituent images - is thus vital to provide
additional evidence about a morph. Existing demorphing methods suffer from the
morph replication problem, where the outputs tend to look very similar to the
morph itself, or assume that train and test morphs are generated using the same
morph technique. The proposed method overcomes these issues. The method
decomposes a morph in latent space allowing it to demorph images created from
unseen morph techniques and face styles. We train our method on morphs created
from synthetic faces and test on morphs created from real faces using arbitrary
morph techniques. Our method outperforms existing methods by a considerable
margin and produces high fidelity demorphed face images.

Conclusion: ADM和DMDX为高效图像和视频合成提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) is a promising score distillation
technique that compresses pre-trained teacher diffusion models into efficient
one-step or multi-step student generators. Nevertheless, its reliance on the
reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence minimization potentially induces mode
collapse (or mode-seeking) in certain applications. To circumvent this inherent
drawback, we propose Adversarial Distribution Matching (ADM), a novel framework
that leverages diffusion-based discriminators to align the latent predictions
between real and fake score estimators for score distillation in an adversarial
manner. In the context of extremely challenging one-step distillation, we
further improve the pre-trained generator by adversarial distillation with
hybrid discriminators in both latent and pixel spaces. Different from the mean
squared error used in DMD2 pre-training, our method incorporates the
distributional loss on ODE pairs collected from the teacher model, and thus
providing a better initialization for score distillation fine-tuning in the
next stage. By combining the adversarial distillation pre-training with ADM
fine-tuning into a unified pipeline termed DMDX, our proposed method achieves
superior one-step performance on SDXL compared to DMD2 while consuming less GPU
time. Additional experiments that apply multi-step ADM distillation on
SD3-Medium, SD3.5-Large, and CogVideoX set a new benchmark towards efficient
image and video synthesis.

*Xinyu Wang,Jinghua Hou,Zhe Liu,Yingying Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HybridTM结合Transformer和Mamba，提出了一种新的3D语义分割架构，通过Inner Layer Hybrid Strategy同时捕捉长距离依赖和局部特征，在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在3D语义分割中表现优异但计算复杂度高，Mamba计算高效但特征提取能力不足，如何结合两者优势成为挑战。

Method: 提出HybridTM架构，结合Transformer和Mamba，并引入Inner Layer Hybrid Strategy，在更细粒度上整合注意力机制和Mamba。

Result: 在ScanNet、ScanNet200和nuScenes等数据集上实现SOTA性能。

Conclusion: HybridTM有效结合了Transformer和Mamba的优势，提升了3D语义分割的性能和效率。

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in 3D
semantic segmentation through their powerful attention mechanisms, but the
quadratic complexity limits their modeling of long-range dependencies in
large-scale point clouds. While recent Mamba-based approaches offer efficient
processing with linear complexity, they struggle with feature representation
when extracting 3D features. However, effectively combining these complementary
strengths remains an open challenge in this field. In this paper, we propose
HybridTM, the first hybrid architecture that integrates Transformer and Mamba
for 3D semantic segmentation. In addition, we propose the Inner Layer Hybrid
Strategy, which combines attention and Mamba at a finer granularity, enabling
simultaneous capture of long-range dependencies and fine-grained local
features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization of our HybridTM on diverse indoor and outdoor datasets.
Furthermore, our HybridTM achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet,
ScanNet200, and nuScenes benchmarks. The code will be made available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个基准测试，用于通过图像识别文本到图像模型中调用的艺术家名称，并评估了多种方法在不同设置下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究文本到图像模型中明确命名艺术家的使用，并开发一个基准测试来识别这些艺术家名称，以促进负责任的模型管理。

Method: 构建了一个包含1.95M图像的数据集，覆盖110位艺术家，并在四种泛化设置下评估了多种方法，包括特征相似性基线、对比风格描述符、数据归因方法、监督分类器和少样本原型网络。

Result: 监督和少样本模型在已知艺术家和复杂提示下表现优异，而风格描述符在艺术家风格明显时泛化能力更强；多艺术家提示最具挑战性。

Conclusion: 基准测试揭示了改进空间，并提供了公开数据集和测试平台，以推动文本到图像模型的负责任管理。

Abstract: A common and controversial use of text-to-image models is to generate
pictures by explicitly naming artists, such as "in the style of Greg
Rutkowski". We introduce a benchmark for prompted-artist recognition:
predicting which artist names were invoked in the prompt from the image alone.
The dataset contains 1.95M images covering 110 artists and spans four
generalization settings: held-out artists, increasing prompt complexity,
multiple-artist prompts, and different text-to-image models. We evaluate
feature similarity baselines, contrastive style descriptors, data attribution
methods, supervised classifiers, and few-shot prototypical networks.
Generalization patterns vary: supervised and few-shot models excel on seen
artists and complex prompts, whereas style descriptors transfer better when the
artist's style is pronounced; multi-artist prompts remain the most challenging.
Our benchmark reveals substantial headroom and provides a public testbed to
advance the responsible moderation of text-to-image models. We release the
dataset and benchmark to foster further research:

Motivation: 解决短电影生成中故事线和视觉一致性的挑战。

Method: 采用自上而下的关键帧规划和自下而上的视频合成，结合多模态扩散变换器（MM-DiT）训练策略。

Result: 实验表明，Captain Cinema能高效生成视觉连贯且叙事一致的短电影。

Conclusion: 该框架为高质量短电影自动生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present Captain Cinema, a generation framework for short movie generation.
Given a detailed textual description of a movie storyline, our approach firstly
generates a sequence of keyframes that outline the entire narrative, which
ensures long-range coherence in both the storyline and visual appearance (e.g.,
scenes and characters). We refer to this step as top-down keyframe planning.
These keyframes then serve as conditioning signals for a video synthesis model,
which supports long context learning, to produce the spatio-temporal dynamics
between them. This step is referred to as bottom-up video synthesis. To support
stable and efficient generation of multi-scene long narrative cinematic works,
we introduce an interleaved training strategy for Multimodal Diffusion
Transformers (MM-DiT), specifically adapted for long-context video data. Our
model is trained on a specially curated cinematic dataset consisting of
interleaved data pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that Captain Cinema
performs favorably in the automated creation of visually coherent and narrative
consistent short movies in high quality and efficiency. Project page:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Shop-R1是一个基于强化学习的框架，通过分解人类行为模拟任务为两个阶段（理由生成和动作预测），并利用自监督和分层奖励结构，显著提升了大型语言模型在在线购物环境中模拟人类行为的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法依赖于监督微调，但其性能受限于生成理由的模型的推理能力。因此，需要一种新方法来增强模型的推理能力，以更真实地模拟人类行为。

Method: Shop-R1将任务分解为理由生成和动作预测两个阶段，分别使用自监督信号和分层奖励结构进行优化。理由生成利用内部模型信号，动作预测采用难度感知的分层奖励。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法相比基线有超过65%的相对提升。

Conclusion: Shop-R1通过强化学习和分层奖励设计，显著提升了模型在模拟人类行为任务中的表现，为类似任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong potential in
generating 'believable human-like' behavior in web environments. Prior work has
explored augmenting training data with LLM-synthesized rationales and applying
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance reasoning ability, which in turn can
improve downstream action prediction. However, the performance of such
approaches remains inherently bounded by the reasoning capabilities of the
model used to generate the rationales. In this paper, we introduce Shop-R1, a
novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework aimed at enhancing the reasoning
ability of LLMs for simulation of real human behavior in online shopping
environments Specifically, Shop-R1 decomposes the human behavior simulation
task into two stages: rationale generation and action prediction, each guided
by distinct reward signals. For rationale generation, we leverage internal
model signals (e.g., logit distributions) to guide the reasoning process in a
self-supervised manner. For action prediction, we propose a hierarchical reward
structure with difficulty-aware scaling to prevent reward hacking and enable
fine-grained reward assignment. This design evaluates both high-level action
types and the correctness of fine-grained sub-action details (attributes and
values), rewarding outputs proportionally to their difficulty. Experimental
results show that our method achieves a relative improvement of over 65%
compared to the baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PRM依赖启发式方法，跨域泛化能力不足，且静态评估标准难以适应复杂过程监督。

Method: DG-PRM采用奖励树存储细粒度奖励标准，动态选择奖励信号，并利用Pareto优势估计处理多维信号。

Result: 实验显示DG-PRM在基准测试中表现优异，显著提升模型性能，且适应分布外场景。

Conclusion: DG-PRM在动态性和泛化性上表现突出，为复杂任务中的过程奖励建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) are crucial for guiding Large Language Models
(LLMs) in complex scenarios by providing dense reward signals. However,
existing PRMs primarily rely on heuristic approaches, which struggle with
cross-domain generalization. While LLM-as-judge has been proposed to provide
generalized rewards, current research has focused mainly on feedback results,
overlooking the meaningful guidance embedded within the text. Additionally,
static and coarse-grained evaluation criteria struggle to adapt to complex
process supervision. To tackle these challenges, we propose Dynamic and
Generalizable Process Reward Modeling (DG-PRM), which features a reward tree to
capture and store fine-grained, multi-dimensional reward criteria. DG-PRM
dynamically selects reward signals for step-wise reward scoring. To handle
multifaceted reward signals, we pioneeringly adopt Pareto dominance estimation
to identify discriminative positive and negative pairs. Experimental results
show that DG-PRM achieves stunning performance on prevailing benchmarks,
significantly boosting model performance across tasks with dense rewards.
Further analysis reveals that DG-PRM adapts well to out-of-distribution
scenarios, demonstrating exceptional generalizability.

Conclusion: VeriMinder有效解决了数据分析中的“错误提问”问题，其开源代码和框架为社区研究和应用提供了支持。

Abstract: Application systems using natural language interfaces to databases (NLIDBs)
have democratized data analysis. This positive development has also brought
forth an urgent challenge to help users who might use these systems without a
background in statistical analysis to formulate bias-free analytical questions.
Although significant research has focused on text-to-SQL generation accuracy,
addressing cognitive biases in analytical questions remains underexplored. We
present VeriMinder, https://veriminder.ai, an interactive system for detecting
and mitigating such analytical vulnerabilities. Our approach introduces three
key innovations: (1) a contextual semantic mapping framework for biases
relevant to specific analysis contexts (2) an analytical framework that
operationalizes the Hard-to-Vary principle and guides users in systematic data
analysis (3) an optimized LLM-powered system that generates high-quality,
task-specific prompts using a structured process involving multiple candidates,
critic feedback, and self-reflection.
  User testing confirms the merits of our approach. In direct user experience
evaluation, 82.5% participants reported positively impacting the quality of the
analysis. In comparative evaluation, VeriMinder scored significantly higher
than alternative approaches, at least 20% better when considered for metrics of
the analysis's concreteness, comprehensiveness, and accuracy. Our system,
implemented as a web application, is set to help users avoid "wrong question"

Abstract: We present an efficient end-to-end approach for holistic Automatic Speaking
Assessment (ASA) of multi-part second-language tests, developed for the 2025
Speak & Improve Challenge. Our system's main novelty is the ability to process
all four spoken responses with a single Whisper-small encoder, combine all
information via a lightweight aggregator, and predict the final score. This
architecture removes the need for transcription and per-part models, cuts
inference time, and makes ASA practical for large-scale Computer-Assisted
Language Learning systems.
  Our system achieved a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.384, outperforming
the text-based baseline (0.44) while using at most 168M parameters (about 70%
of Whisper-small). Furthermore, we propose a data sampling strategy, allowing
the model to train on only 44.8% of the speakers in the corpus and still reach
0.383 RMSE, demonstrating improved performance on imbalanced classes and strong
data efficiency.

Motivation: 填补文献中关于DeepSeek这一新发布的大型语言模型（LLM）在AI检测领域的空白，评估现有检测工具对其生成文本的识别能力。

Method: 使用六种AI检测工具测试DeepSeek生成的文本，并应用改写和人化等对抗攻击技术。同时，采用Few-shot和CoT提示方法评估DeepSeek作为检测器的性能。

Result: QuillBot和Copyleaks在原始和改写文本上表现优异，而其他工具（如AI Text Classifier和GPT-2）结果不一致。人化攻击显著降低检测准确率。Few-shot和CoT提示方法准确率高。

Conclusion: 对抗攻击（尤其是人化）对AI检测工具的准确性有显著影响，而Few-shot和CoT提示方法为检测AI生成文本提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly transformed the creation of written
materials. LLMs have led to questions about writing integrity, thereby driving
the creation of artificial intelligence (AI) detection technologies.
Adversarial attacks, such as standard and humanized paraphrasing, inhibit
detectors' ability to detect machine-generated text. Previous studies have
mainly focused on ChatGPT and other well-known LLMs and have shown varying
accuracy across detectors. However, there is a clear gap in the literature
about DeepSeek, a recently published LLM. Therefore, in this work, we
investigate whether six generally accessible AI detection tools -- AI Text
Classifier, Content Detector AI, Copyleaks, QuillBot, GPT-2, and GPTZero -- can
consistently recognize text generated by DeepSeek. The detectors were exposed
to the aforementioned adversarial attacks. We also considered DeepSeek as a
detector by performing few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT)
for classifying AI and human-written text. We collected 49 human-authored
question-answer pairs from before the LLM era and generated matching responses
using DeepSeek-v3, producing 49 AI-generated samples. Then, we applied
adversarial techniques such as paraphrasing and humanizing to add 196 more
samples. These were used to challenge detector robustness and assess accuracy
impact. While QuillBot and Copyleaks showed near-perfect performance on
original and paraphrased DeepSeek text, others -- particularly AI Text
Classifier and GPT-2 -- showed inconsistent results. The most effective attack
was humanization, reducing accuracy to 71% for Copyleaks, 58% for QuillBot, and
52% for GPTZero. Few-shot and CoT prompting showed high accuracy, with the best
five-shot result misclassifying only one of 49 samples (AI recall 96%, human
recall 100%).

Abstract: Do larger and more capable language models learn to update their "beliefs"
about propositions more consistently with Bayes' theorem when presented with
evidence in-context? To test this, we formulate a Bayesian Coherence
Coefficient (BCC) metric and generate a dataset with which to measure the BCC.
We measure BCC for multiple pre-trained-only language models across five model
families, comparing against the number of model parameters, the amount of
training data, and model scores on common benchmarks. Our results provide
evidence for our hypothesis that larger and more capable pre-trained language
models assign credences that are more coherent with Bayes' theorem. These

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有线性L&E方法在编辑大量事实时可能损害模型通用能力或导致遗忘的问题。

Method: 将线性L&E方法建模为KV数据库查询，提出NeuralDB框架，采用非线性门控检索模块，仅在涉及编辑事实时激活。

Result: 在10,000事实编辑实验中，NeuralDB在编辑效果、通用性、特异性、流畅性和一致性上表现优异，且不影响模型在六项任务中的整体性能。

Conclusion: NeuralDB在扩展到100,000事实时仍保持高效，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Efficiently editing knowledge stored in large language models (LLMs) enables
model updates without large-scale training. One possible solution is
Locate-and-Edit (L\&E), allowing simultaneous modifications of a massive number
of facts. However, such editing may compromise the general abilities of LLMs
and even result in forgetting edited facts when scaling up to thousands of
edits. In this paper, we model existing linear L\&E methods as querying a
Key-Value (KV) database. From this perspective, we then propose NeuralDB, an
editing framework that explicitly represents the edited facts as a neural KV
database equipped with a non-linear gated retrieval module, % In particular,
our gated module only operates when inference involves the edited facts,
effectively preserving the general abilities of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments
involving the editing of 10,000 facts were conducted on the ZsRE and
CounterFacts datasets, using GPT2-XL, GPT-J (6B) and Llama-3 (8B). The results
demonstrate that NeuralDB not only excels in editing efficacy, generalization,
specificity, fluency, and consistency, but also preserves overall performance
across six representative text understanding and generation tasks. Further
experiments indicate that NeuralDB maintains its effectiveness even when scaled
to 100,000 facts (\textbf{50x} more than in prior work).

TL;DR: GrAInS是一种基于梯度的推理时引导方法，通过识别关键令牌并调整隐藏激活，无需微调即可优化模型行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖固定干预向量，忽视输入令牌的因果影响和梯度信息，尤其在多模态任务中表现不足。

Method: GrAInS使用对比梯度归因识别关键令牌，构建方向性引导向量，并在推理时调整隐藏激活。

Result: GrAInS在TruthfulQA、MMHal-Bench和SPA-VL任务中表现优于微调和现有基线方法。

Conclusion: GrAInS提供了一种细粒度、可解释且模块化的模型行为控制方法，无需额外训练。

Abstract: Inference-time steering methods offer a lightweight alternative to
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) by
modifying internal activations at test time without updating model weights.
However, most existing approaches rely on fixed, global intervention vectors,
overlook the causal influence of individual input tokens, and fail to leverage
informative gradients from the model's logits, particularly in multimodal
settings where visual and textual inputs contribute unevenly. To address these
limitations, we introduce GrAInS, an inference-time steering approach that
operates across both language-only and vision-language models and tasks. GrAInS
uses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to
identify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively
attributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred
outputs. These tokens are then used to construct directional steering vectors
that capture semantic shifts from undesirable to desirable behavior. During
inference, GrAInS adjusts hidden activations at transformer layers guided by
token-level attribution signals, and normalizes activations to preserve
representational scale. This enables fine-grained, interpretable, and modular
control over model behavior, without retraining or auxiliary supervision.
Empirically, GrAInS consistently outperforms both fine-tuning and existing
steering baselines: it achieves a 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA using
Llama-3.1-8B, reduces hallucination rates on MMHal-Bench from 0.624 to 0.514
with LLaVA-1.6-7B, and improves alignment win rates on SPA-VL by 8.11%, all

TL;DR: 利用大型语言模型（LLM）生成合成短语断句标注，减少人工标注需求，并在多语言中验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前短语断句预测方法依赖大量人工标注，成本高且数据一致性差。LLM在NLP中成功解决数据问题，启发我们探索其在语音领域的应用。

Method: 利用LLM生成合成短语断句标注，并与传统标注方法对比，评估其在多语言中的效果。

Result: LLM生成的合成数据有效缓解了短语断句预测的数据挑战，展示了LLM在语音领域的潜力。

Conclusion: LLM为语音领域的数据标注提供了一种可行的解决方案，减少了人工依赖并提高了数据质量。

Abstract: Current approaches to phrase break prediction address crucial prosodic
aspects of text-to-speech systems but heavily rely on vast human annotations
from audio or text, incurring significant manual effort and cost. Inherent
variability in the speech domain, driven by phonetic factors, further
complicates acquiring consistent, high-quality data. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) have shown success in addressing data challenges in NLP by
generating tailored synthetic data while reducing manual annotation needs.
Motivated by this, we explore leveraging LLM to generate synthetic phrase break
annotations, addressing the challenges of both manual annotation and
speech-related tasks by comparing with traditional annotations and assessing
effectiveness across multiple languages. Our findings suggest that LLM-based
synthetic data generation effectively mitigates data challenges in phrase break
prediction and highlights the potential of LLMs as a viable solution for the
speech domain.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了LLM生成合成数据的多样性和隐私问题，提出了评估指标和改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成数据虽成本低、可扩展，但其多样性和隐私风险尚未充分研究。

Result: 实验显示LLM生成的数据在多样性和隐私保护方面存在显著不足。

Conclusion: 基于提示的方法能有效提升合成数据的多样性，同时保护隐私。

Abstract: The increasing use of synthetic data generated by Large Language Models
(LLMs) presents both opportunities and challenges in data-driven applications.
While synthetic data provides a cost-effective, scalable alternative to
real-world data to facilitate model training, its diversity and privacy risks
remain underexplored. Focusing on text-based synthetic data, we propose a
comprehensive set of metrics to quantitatively assess the diversity (i.e.,
linguistic expression, sentiment, and user perspective), and privacy (i.e.,
re-identification risk and stylistic outliers) of synthetic datasets generated
by several state-of-the-art LLMs. Experiment results reveal significant
limitations in LLMs' capabilities in generating diverse and privacy-preserving
synthetic data. Guided by the evaluation results, a prompt-based approach is
proposed to enhance the diversity of synthetic reviews while preserving
reviewer privacy.

*Zehan Li,Hongjie Chen,Yuxin Zhang,Jing Zhou,Xuening Wang,Hang Lv,Mengjie Du,Yaodong Song,Jie Lian,Jian Kang,Jie Li,Yongxiang Li,Zhongjiang He,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TELEVAL是一个动态基准测试，专门用于评估口语模型（SLMs）在真实中文交互场景中作为对话代理的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注SLMs是否能完成与大型语言模型（LLMs）相当的复杂任务，而忽略了用户在实际对话中的自然交互方式。

Method: TELEVAL定义了三个评估维度：显式语义、副语言和隐式语义以及系统能力，采用与真实使用一致的对话格式，并分别评估文本和音频输出。

Result: 实验表明，尽管SLMs近期有所进步，但在自然对话任务中仍有较大改进空间。

Conclusion: TELEVAL旨在作为以用户为中心的评估框架，直接反映用户体验，推动开发更强大的对话导向SLMs。

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) have seen rapid progress in recent years, along
with the development of numerous benchmarks for evaluating their performance.
However, most existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating whether SLMs
can perform complex tasks comparable to those tackled by large language models
(LLMs), often failing to align with how users naturally interact in real-world
conversational scenarios. In this paper, we propose TELEVAL, a dynamic
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate SLMs' effectiveness as
conversational agents in realistic Chinese interactive settings. TELEVAL
defines three evaluation dimensions: Explicit Semantics, Paralinguistic and
Implicit Semantics, and System Abilities. It adopts a dialogue format
consistent with real-world usage and evaluates text and audio outputs
separately. TELEVAL particularly focuses on the model's ability to extract
implicit cues from user speech and respond appropriately without additional
instructions. Our experiments demonstrate that despite recent progress,
existing SLMs still have considerable room for improvement in natural
conversational tasks. We hope that TELEVAL can serve as a user-centered
evaluation framework that directly reflects the user experience and contributes
to the development of more capable dialogue-oriented SLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态结合BOFT正交稳定性和LoRA-GA梯度对齐快速收敛的混合参数高效微调方法，显著提升了收敛效率和泛化能力，并在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的微调存在计算和内存需求高的瓶颈，需要更高效的参数微调技术。

Method: 提出了一种混合策略，结合BOFT和LoRA-GA的优势，并首次将uRNN原理应用于基于Transformer的LLM，通过梯度规范和结构化酉约束优化微调。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，混合方法在收敛效率和泛化能力上优于现有方法，接近全微调精度，同时减少训练时间和内存消耗。

Conclusion: 混合方法为资源受限环境下LLM的实际部署提供了实用且可扩展的微调解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) remains a computational bottleneck
due to their scale and memory demands. This paper presents a comprehensive
evaluation of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, including
LoRA, BOFT, LoRA-GA, and uRNN, and introduces a novel hybrid strategy that
dynamically integrates BOFT's orthogonal stability with LoRA-GA's
gradient-aligned rapid convergence. By computing per-layer adaptive updates
guided by gradient norms, the hybrid method achieves superior convergence
efficiency and generalization across diverse tasks. We also explore, for the
first time, the adaptation of unitary RNN (uRNN) principles to
transformer-based LLMs, enhancing gradient stability through structured unitary
constraints. Empirical evaluations on four benchmarks -- GLUE, GSM8K, MT-Bench,
and HumanEval -- using models ranging from 7B to 405B parameters demonstrate
that our hybrid method consistently outperforms individual PEFT baselines,
approaching full fine-tuning accuracy while reducing resource consumption by up
to 2.1 times in training time and 50 percent in memory usage. These findings
establish the hybrid approach as a practical and scalable fine-tuning solution
for real-world deployment of LLMs under resource constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2014年的GloVe模型虽广泛使用，但语料和预处理细节未充分记录，且语言和世界在变化，需要更新模型以适应新需求。

Method: 使用Wikipedia、Gigaword和Dolma子集训练两组词嵌入，并通过词汇对比、直接测试和NER任务进行评估。

Result: 新模型包含更多文化和语言相关词汇，在类比和相似性任务上表现相当，在非西方新闻数据等时效性NER任务上表现更优。

Conclusion: 2024年GloVe模型通过更新语料和文档记录，显著提升了实用性和性能。

Abstract: This report documents, describes, and evaluates new 2024 English GloVe
(Global Vectors for Word Representation) models. While the original GloVe
models built in 2014 have been widely used and found useful, languages and the
world continue to evolve and we thought that current usage could benefit from
updated models. Moreover, the 2014 models were not carefully documented as to
the exact data versions and preprocessing that were used, and we rectify this
by documenting these new models. We trained two sets of word embeddings using
Wikipedia, Gigaword, and a subset of Dolma. Evaluation through vocabulary
comparison, direct testing, and NER tasks shows that the 2024 vectors
incorporate new culturally and linguistically relevant words, perform
comparably on structural tasks like analogy and similarity, and demonstrate
improved performance on recent, temporally dependent NER datasets such as
non-Western newswire data.

TL;DR: GOAT-SLM是一种新型的端到端口语语言模型，专注于捕捉语音中的副语言和说话者特征，通过双模态头部架构和分阶段训练策略，实现了语义与非语义任务的平衡表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有口语语言模型主要关注语言内容，忽略了语音中的副语言和说话者特征（如方言、年龄、情感等），限制了模型的自然交互能力。

Method: 采用双模态头部架构分离语言建模与声学实现，提出模块化分阶段训练策略，逐步对齐语言、副语言和说话者特征信息。

Result: 在TELEVAL基准测试中，GOAT-SLM在语义和非语义任务上表现均衡，尤其在情感、方言和年龄敏感交互方面优于现有开源模型。

Conclusion: GOAT-SLM强调了超越语言内容建模的重要性，推动了更自然、自适应和社交意识的口语语言系统的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end spoken language models (SLMs) have
significantly improved the ability of AI systems to engage in natural spoken
interactions. However, most existing models treat speech merely as a vehicle
for linguistic content, often overlooking the rich paralinguistic and speaker
characteristic cues embedded in human speech, such as dialect, age, emotion,
and non-speech vocalizations. In this work, we introduce GOAT-SLM, a novel
spoken language model with paralinguistic and speaker characteristic awareness,
designed to extend spoken language modeling beyond text semantics. GOAT-SLM
adopts a dual-modality head architecture that decouples linguistic modeling
from acoustic realization, enabling robust language understanding while
supporting expressive and adaptive speech generation. To enhance model
efficiency and versatility, we propose a modular, staged training strategy that
progressively aligns linguistic, paralinguistic, and speaker characteristic
information using large-scale speech-text corpora. Experimental results on
TELEVAL, a multi-dimensional evaluation benchmark, demonstrate that GOAT-SLM
achieves well-balanced performance across both semantic and non-semantic tasks,
and outperforms existing open-source models in handling emotion, dialectal
variation, and age-sensitive interactions. This work highlights the importance
of modeling beyond linguistic content and advances the development of more
natural, adaptive, and socially aware spoken language systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文评估了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在基于代码的多模态数学推理中的能力，重点关注代码生成和编辑任务，发现现有模型在细粒度视觉操作上仍远落后于人类表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注纯文本推理输出，而忽略了MLLMs通过代码执行准确视觉操作的能力，因此需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 提出一个评估框架，包括多模态代码生成（MCG）和多模态代码编辑（MCE）任务，涵盖五种常见数学图形，并测试九种主流MLLMs。

Result: 实验结果表明，现有模型在细粒度视觉操作（如删除、修改和标注）上表现显著低于人类水平。

Conclusion: 该研究为评估MLLMs在多模态数学推理中的代码能力提供了初步框架，揭示了现有模型的局限性，为未来改进指明了方向。

Abstract: Recent progress in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has enabled
step-by-step multi-modal mathematical reasoning by performing visual operations
based on the textual instructions. A promising approach uses code as an
intermediate representation to precisely express and manipulate the images in
the reasoning steps. However, existing evaluations focus mainly on text-only
reasoning outputs, leaving the MLLM's ability to perform accurate visual
operations via code largely unexplored. This work takes a first step toward
addressing that gap by evaluating MLLM's code-based capabilities in multi-modal
mathematical reasoning.Specifically, our framework focuses on two key
evaluation aspects: (1) Multi-modal Code Generation (MCG) evaluates the model's
ability to accurately understand and construct visualizations from scratch. (2)
Multi-modal Code Editing (MCE) assesses the model's capacity for fine-grained
operations, which include three types: Deletion, Modification and Annotation.
To evaluate the above tasks, we incorporate a dataset that covers the five most
popular types of mathematical figures, including geometric diagrams, function
plots, and three types of statistical charts, to provide a comprehensive and
effective measurement of existing MLLMs. Our experimental evaluation involves
nine mainstream MLLMs, and the results reveal that existing models still lag
significantly behind human performance in performing fine-grained visual
operations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）在HIV管理中的能力，提出了HIVMedQA基准，并发现Gemini 2.5 Pro表现最佳，但复杂问题和认知偏差仍是挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HIV管理的复杂性需要工具支持临床决策，但LLMs在临床实践中的准确性和接受度尚不明确。

Method: 研究开发了HIVMedQA基准，评估了10个LLMs，结合词相似性和LLM作为评判的方法。

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro表现最佳，但性能随问题复杂性下降，且医学微调模型不一定优于通用模型。

Conclusion: 需针对性开发和评估，以确保LLMs在临床中的安全有效应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as valuable tools to support
clinicians in routine decision-making. HIV management is a compelling use case
due to its complexity, including diverse treatment options, comorbidities, and
adherence challenges. However, integrating LLMs into clinical practice raises
concerns about accuracy, potential harm, and clinician acceptance. Despite
their promise, AI applications in HIV care remain underexplored, and LLM
benchmarking studies are scarce. This study evaluates the current capabilities
of LLMs in HIV management, highlighting their strengths and limitations. We
introduce HIVMedQA, a benchmark designed to assess open-ended medical question
answering in HIV care. The dataset consists of curated, clinically relevant
questions developed with input from an infectious disease physician. We
evaluated seven general-purpose and three medically specialized LLMs, applying
prompt engineering to enhance performance. Our evaluation framework
incorporates both lexical similarity and an LLM-as-a-judge approach, extended
to better reflect clinical relevance. We assessed performance across key
dimensions: question comprehension, reasoning, knowledge recall, bias,
potential harm, and factual accuracy. Results show that Gemini 2.5 Pro
consistently outperformed other models across most dimensions. Notably, two of
the top three models were proprietary. Performance declined as question
complexity increased. Medically fine-tuned models did not always outperform
general-purpose ones, and larger model size was not a reliable predictor of
performance. Reasoning and comprehension were more challenging than factual
recall, and cognitive biases such as recency and status quo were observed.
These findings underscore the need for targeted development and evaluation to
ensure safe, effective LLM integration in clinical care.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现Transformer文本嵌入模型中的'粘性令牌'会破坏嵌入可靠性，提出检测方法STD并分析其影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 粘性令牌的存在会干扰句子相似性分布，降低下游任务性能，因此需要系统研究其成因和影响。

Method: 提出Sticky Token Detector (STD)方法，通过句子和令牌过滤检测异常令牌，并在40个模型检查点中验证。

Result: 发现868个粘性令牌，其来源多为特殊词汇或碎片化子词，且与模型规模无关；下游任务性能下降高达50%。

Conclusion: 需改进令牌化和模型设计以减少粘性令牌对文本嵌入的影响。

Abstract: Despite the widespread use of Transformer-based text embedding models in NLP
tasks, surprising 'sticky tokens' can undermine the reliability of embeddings.
These tokens, when repeatedly inserted into sentences, pull sentence similarity
toward a certain value, disrupting the normal distribution of embedding
distances and degrading downstream performance. In this paper, we
systematically investigate such anomalous tokens, formally defining them and
introducing an efficient detection method, Sticky Token Detector (STD), based
on sentence and token filtering. Applying STD to 40 checkpoints across 14 model
families, we discover a total of 868 sticky tokens. Our analysis reveals that
these tokens often originate from special or unused entries in the vocabulary,
as well as fragmented subwords from multilingual corpora. Notably, their
presence does not strictly correlate with model size or vocabulary size. We
further evaluate how sticky tokens affect downstream tasks like clustering and
retrieval, observing significant performance drops of up to 50%. Through
attention-layer analysis, we show that sticky tokens disproportionately
dominate the model's internal representations, raising concerns about
tokenization robustness. Our findings show the need for better tokenization
strategies and model design to mitigate the impact of sticky tokens in future
text embedding applications.

TL;DR: SCOPE框架通过消除选项位置偏见和语义邻近干扰，提升大语言模型评估的公平性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）在多选题任务中可能利用选项位置或标签的偏见获得高分，而非真正理解内容。

Method: SCOPE通过无语义内容的空提示估计模型的偏见分布，并重新分配答案位置以消除偏见，同时避免语义相似干扰。

Result: SCOPE在多个基准测试中表现优于现有去偏方法，提升了性能稳定性和置信度分布。

Conclusion: SCOPE为LLM评估提供了更公平和可靠的新标准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve inflated scores on multiple-choice
tasks by exploiting inherent biases in option positions or labels, rather than
demonstrating genuine understanding. This study introduces SCOPE, an evaluation
framework designed to measure and mitigate such selection bias in a
dataset-independent manner. By repeatedly invoking a null prompt that lacks
semantic content, SCOPE estimates each model's unique position-bias
distribution. It then redistributes the answer slot according to the
inverse-bias distribution, thereby equalizing the lucky-rate, the probability
of selecting the correct answer by chance. Furthermore, it prevents
semantically similar distractors from being placed adjacent to the answer,
thereby blocking near-miss guesses based on superficial proximity cues. Across
multiple benchmark experiments, SCOPE consistently outperformed existing
debiasing methods in terms of stable performance improvements and showed
clearer confidence distributions over correct options. This framework thus
offers a new standard for enhancing the fairness and reliability of LLM
evaluations.

Abstract: Business process modeling is used by most organizations as an essential
framework for ensuring efficiency and effectiveness of the work and workflow
performed by its employees and for ensuring the alignment of such work with its
strategic goals. For organizations that are compliant or near-compliant with
ISO 9001, this approach involves the detailed mapping of processes,

regularly face the challenge of explaining our clients how the knowledge
development, transformation and conveyances activities depicted in ISO30401 do
integrate with existing operational processes. This article recaps process
modelling principles in the context of ISO9001 and explores, based on our
experience, how an ISO30401-compliant Knowledge Management System (KMS)
entwines with all other processes of an Integrated Management System and in
particular how it can be implemented by deploying the mechanisms of the SECI

Motivation: RAG依赖外部知识库，但可能被攻击者注入有害文档，导致误导性输出，需有效防御方法。

Method: GMTP利用检索器相似度函数的梯度识别关键令牌，通过掩码语言模型检查其概率，过滤低概率恶意文档。

Result: 实验显示GMTP能过滤90%以上有害内容，同时保留相关文档，保持检索和生成性能。

Conclusion: GMTP高效防御对抗性攻击，确保RAG系统的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by
providing external knowledge for accurate and up-to-date responses. However,
this reliance on external sources exposes a security risk, attackers can inject
poisoned documents into the knowledge base to steer the generation process
toward harmful or misleading outputs. In this paper, we propose Gradient-based
Masked Token Probability (GMTP), a novel defense method to detect and filter
out adversarially crafted documents. Specifically, GMTP identifies high-impact
tokens by examining gradients of the retriever's similarity function. These key
tokens are then masked, and their probabilities are checked via a Masked
Language Model (MLM). Since injected tokens typically exhibit markedly low
masked-token probabilities, this enables GMTP to easily detect malicious
documents and achieve high-precision filtering. Experiments demonstrate that
GMTP is able to eliminate over 90% of poisoned content while retaining relevant
documents, thus maintaining robust retrieval and generation performance across
diverse datasets and adversarial settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 指令调优虽提升大语言模型（LLM）的指令遵循能力，但也增加其对用户输入的依赖，导致更容易接受错误信息。研究发现，指令调优后的LLM更易受用户提供的错误信息影响，需系统性方法减少其负面影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究指令调优对LLM接受错误信息倾向的影响，填补现有研究空白。

Method: 比较指令调优模型与基础模型对错误信息的接受程度，并分析用户角色、提示结构等因素的影响。

Result: 指令调优显著增加LLM对用户提供错误信息的接受度，且用户角色和提示结构等因素进一步影响其倾向。

Conclusion: 需系统性方法优化指令调优，以减少其对LLM可靠性的负面影响。

Abstract: Instruction-tuning enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
follow user instructions more accurately, improving usability while reducing
harmful outputs. However, this process may increase the model's dependence on
user input, potentially leading to the unfiltered acceptance of misinformation
and the generation of hallucinations. Existing studies primarily highlight that
LLMs are receptive to external information that contradict their parametric
knowledge, but little research has been conducted on the direct impact of
instruction-tuning on this phenomenon. In our study, we investigate the impact
of instruction-tuning on LLM's susceptibility to misinformation. Our analysis
reveals that instruction-tuned LLMs are significantly more likely to accept
misinformation when it is presented by the user. A comparison with base models
shows that instruction-tuning increases reliance on user-provided information,
shifting susceptibility from the assistant role to the user role. Furthermore,
we explore additional factors influencing misinformation susceptibility, such
as the role of the user in prompt structure, misinformation length, and the
presence of warnings in the system prompt. Our findings underscore the need for
systematic approaches to mitigate unintended consequences of instruction-tuning
and enhance the reliability of LLMs in real-world applications.

TL;DR: Prune&Comp是一种无需训练的层剪枝方法，通过幅度补偿解决层移除导致的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移除层会导致隐藏状态幅度差距，显著降低模型性能。

Method: 估计层移除引起的幅度差距，通过离线重新缩放剩余权重进行补偿。

Result: 在LLaMA-3-8B上剪枝5层时，困惑度降低近一半，保留93.19%的问答性能。

Conclusion: Prune&Comp通过迭代剪枝和补偿，显著提升了现有层剪枝方法的性能。

Abstract: Layer pruning has emerged as a promising technique for compressing large
language models (LLMs) while achieving acceleration proportional to the pruning
ratio. In this work, we identify that removing any layer induces a significant
magnitude gap in hidden states, resulting in substantial performance
degradation. To address this issue, we propose Prune&Comp, a novel
plug-and-play layer pruning scheme that leverages magnitude compensation to
mitigate such gaps in a training-free manner. Specifically, we first estimate
the magnitude gap caused by layer removal and then eliminate this gap by
rescaling the remaining weights offline, with zero runtime overhead incurred.
We further demonstrate the advantages of Prune&Comp through an iterative
pruning strategy. When integrated with an iterative prune-and-compensate loop,
Prune&Comp consistently enhances existing layer pruning metrics. For instance,
when 5 layers of LLaMA-3-8B are pruned using the prevalent block influence
metric, Prune&Comp nearly halves the perplexity and retains 93.19\% of the
original model's question-answering performance, outperforming the baseline by
4.01%.

Abstract: Direct speech translation (ST) has garnered increasing attention nowadays,
yet the accurate translation of terminology within utterances remains a great
challenge. In this regard, current studies mainly concentrate on leveraging
various translation knowledge into ST models. However, these methods often
struggle with interference from irrelevant noise and can not fully utilize the
translation knowledge. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a
novel Locate-and-Focus method for terminology translation. It first effectively
locates the speech clips containing terminologies within the utterance to
construct translation knowledge, minimizing irrelevant information for the ST
model. Subsequently, it associates the translation knowledge with the utterance
and hypothesis from both audio and textual modalities, allowing the ST model to
better focus on translation knowledge during translation. Experimental results
across various datasets demonstrate that our method effectively locates
terminologies within utterances and enhances the success rate of terminology
translation, while maintaining robust general translation performance.

*Nevidu Jayatilleke,Nisansa de Silva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 比较了六种OCR引擎在低资源语言（Sinhala和Tamil）上的零样本性能，发现Surya在Sinhala表现最佳，Document AI在Tamil表现最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言（LRL）OCR问题，填补现有研究空白。

Method: 使用五种测量技术评估六种OCR引擎在字符和单词级别的准确性。

Result: Surya在Sinhala上WER为2.61%，Document AI在Tamil上CER为0.78%。

Conclusion: 不同引擎在不同语言上表现各异，需针对性选择；同时提出了新的Tamil OCR基准数据集。

Abstract: Solving the problem of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on printed text
for Latin and its derivative scripts can now be considered settled due to the
volumes of research done on English and other High-Resourced Languages (HRL).
However, for Low-Resourced Languages (LRL) that use unique scripts, it remains
an open problem. This study presents a comparative analysis of the zero-shot
performance of six distinct OCR engines on two LRLs: Sinhala and Tamil. The
selected engines include both commercial and open-source systems, aiming to
evaluate the strengths of each category. The Cloud Vision API, Surya, Document
AI, and Tesseract were evaluated for both Sinhala and Tamil, while Subasa OCR
and EasyOCR were examined for only one language due to their limitations. The
performance of these systems was rigorously analysed using five measurement
techniques to assess accuracy at both the character and word levels. According
to the findings, Surya delivered the best performance for Sinhala across all
metrics, with a WER of 2.61%. Conversely, Document AI excelled across all
metrics for Tamil, highlighted by a very low CER of 0.78%. In addition to the
above analysis, we also introduce a novel synthetic Tamil OCR benchmarking
dataset.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StyleAdaptedLM框架通过LoRA技术，实现LLMs的风格适配，无需配对数据且不牺牲任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业通信需要LLMs适应特定风格（如品牌声音或作者语调），但传统方法难以在不影响指令遵循的情况下实现。

Method: 使用LoRA适配器，先在基础模型上训练多样化的非结构化风格语料，再与指令遵循模型合并。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持指令遵循的同时提升了风格一致性，人类评估确认了品牌特定惯例的采纳。

Conclusion: StyleAdaptedLM为LLMs的风格个性化提供了一条高效路径。

Abstract: Adapting LLMs to specific stylistic characteristics, like brand voice or
authorial tones, is crucial for enterprise communication but challenging to
achieve from corpora which lacks instruction-response formatting without
compromising instruction adherence. We introduce StyleAdaptedLM, a framework
that efficiently transfers stylistic traits to instruction-following models
using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). LoRA adapters are first trained on a base
model with diverse unstructured stylistic corpora, then merged with a separate
instruction-following model. This enables robust stylistic customization
without paired data or sacrificing task performance. Experiments across
multiple datasets and models demonstrate improved stylistic consistency while
preserving instruction adherence, with human evaluations confirming
brand-specific convention uptake. StyleAdaptedLM offers an efficient path for
stylistic personalization in LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对大型推理模型（LRMs）的新型攻击方法，称为“过度思考后门”，通过数据污染控制模型推理的冗余程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LRMs的安全漏洞，特别是其链式推理（CoT）能力可能被滥用的方式。

Method: 提出可调谐的后门攻击，通过数据污染和程序化生成的冗余推理步骤实现。

Result: 攻击能可靠地增加推理过程的长度，但不影响最终答案的正确性。

Conclusion: 该方法揭示了LRMs的安全隐患，为未来防御提供了方向。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have emerged as a significant advancement in
artificial intelligence, representing a specialized class of large language
models (LLMs) designed to tackle complex reasoning tasks. The defining
characteristic of LRMs lies in their extensive chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
capabilities. In this paper, we identify a previously unexplored attack vector
against LRMs, which we term "overthinking backdoors". We advance this concept
by proposing a novel tunable backdoor, which moves beyond simple on/off attacks
to one where an attacker can precisely control the extent of the model's
reasoning verbosity. Our attack is implemented through a novel data poisoning
methodology. It pairs a tunable trigger-where the number of repetitions signals
the desired intensity-with a correspondingly verbose CoT response. These
responses are programmatically generated by instructing a teacher LLM to inject
a controlled number of redundant refinement steps into a correct reasoning
process. The approach preserves output correctness, which ensures stealth and
establishes the attack as a pure resource-consumption vector. Extensive
empirical results on various LRMs demonstrate that our method can reliably
trigger a controllable, multi-fold increase in the length of the reasoning
process, without degrading the final answer's correctness. Our source code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器翻译中因性别标记不明确导致的翻译偏差问题，并探讨模型在性别模糊时的表现。

Method: 使用语义不确定性度量方法，分析模型在性别明确和模糊情况下的翻译表现。

Result: 高翻译和性别准确率的模型在性别模糊时未表现出预期的不确定性；去偏方法对模糊和非模糊实例的影响独立。

Conclusion: 模型需在性别明确时准确翻译，模糊时保持不确定性；去偏方法需针对不同情况分别优化。

Abstract: In machine translation (MT), when the source sentence includes a lexeme whose
gender is not overtly marked, but whose target-language equivalent requires
gender specification, the model must infer the appropriate gender from the
context and/or external knowledge. Studies have shown that MT models exhibit
biased behaviour, relying on stereotypes even when they clash with contextual
information. We posit that apart from confidently translating using the correct
gender when it is evident from the input, models should also maintain
uncertainty about the gender when it is ambiguous. Using recently proposed
metrics of semantic uncertainty, we find that models with high translation and
gender accuracy on unambiguous instances do not necessarily exhibit the
expected level of uncertainty in ambiguous ones. Similarly, debiasing has
independent effects on ambiguous and unambiguous translation instances.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TDR的新框架，用于改进上下文学习（ICL）中的示例检索能力，解决了跨任务数据分布区分和细粒度反馈连接的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICL的效果高度依赖示例质量，但现有方法在区分跨任务数据分布和连接检索器输出与LLM反馈方面存在困难。

Method: TDR框架将不同任务的ICL示例解耦，并利用LLM的细粒度反馈指导检索模块的训练。

Result: 在30个NLP任务上的实验表明，TDR在所有数据集上均提升了性能，并达到了最先进水平。

Conclusion: TDR是一种即插即用的方法，可轻松与各种LLM结合，提升ICL的示例检索能力。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has become a classic approach for enabling LLMs to
handle various tasks based on a few input-output examples. The effectiveness of
ICL heavily relies on the quality of these examples, and previous works which
focused on enhancing example retrieval capabilities have achieved impressive
performances. However, two challenges remain in retrieving high-quality
examples: (1) Difficulty in distinguishing cross-task data distributions, (2)
Difficulty in making the fine-grained connection between retriever output and
feedback from LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called TDR. TDR
decouples the ICL examples from different tasks, which enables the retrieval
module to retrieve examples specific to the target task within a multi-task
dataset. Furthermore, TDR models fine-grained feedback from LLMs to supervise
and guide the training of the retrieval module, which helps to retrieve
high-quality examples. We conducted extensive experiments on a suite of 30 NLP
tasks, the results demonstrate that TDR consistently improved results across
all datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Meanwhile, our approach
is a plug-and-play method, which can be easily combined with various LLMs to
improve example retrieval abilities for ICL. The code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合人类专家与大语言模型（LLM）的新框架，用于改进社交媒体上的宣传检测任务，通过分层分类法和LLM辅助预标注提升标注一致性和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上的宣传检测任务复杂且缺乏高质量标注数据，需要一种既能保证标注一致性又能提高效率的方法。

Method: 提出分层分类法组织14种细粒度宣传技术；实施LLM辅助预标注流程提取宣传内容并生成解释；通过知识蒸馏训练小型语言模型（SLM）。

Result: LLM辅助预标注显著提高了标注一致性和时间效率；基于LLM生成数据训练的SLM表现良好。

Conclusion: 该框架为开发可扩展且鲁棒的宣传检测系统提供了支持，符合SDG 16的目标，代码已开源。

Abstract: Propaganda detection on social media remains challenging due to task
complexity and limited high-quality labeled data. This paper introduces a novel
framework that combines human expertise with Large Language Model (LLM)
assistance to improve both annotation consistency and scalability. We propose a
hierarchical taxonomy that organizes 14 fine-grained propaganda techniques into
three broader categories, conduct a human annotation study on the HQP dataset
that reveals low inter-annotator agreement for fine-grained labels, and
implement an LLM-assisted pre-annotation pipeline that extracts propagandistic
spans, generates concise explanations, and assigns local labels as well as a
global label. A secondary human verification study shows significant
improvements in both agreement and time-efficiency. Building on this, we
fine-tune smaller language models (SLMs) to perform structured annotation.
Instead of fine-tuning on human annotations, we train on high-quality
LLM-generated data, allowing a large model to produce these annotations and a
smaller model to learn to generate them via knowledge distillation. Our work
contributes towards the development of scalable and robust propaganda detection
systems, supporting the idea of transparent and accountable media ecosystems in
line with SDG 16. The code is publicly available at our GitHub repository.

TL;DR: CLEAR是一个交互式开源工具，用于分析LLM的错误，提供详细反馈和可视化分析，帮助理解模型性能的具体原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM评估方法仅提供单一评分或排名，无法揭示具体性能原因，CLEAR旨在填补这一空白。

Method: CLEAR生成实例级反馈，识别系统级错误，量化问题频率，并提供交互式仪表盘进行深入分析。

Result: CLEAR在RAG和数学基准测试中展示了其有效性，并通过用户案例研究验证了其实用性。

Conclusion: CLEAR为LLM评估提供了更细致和可操作的分析工具，帮助用户理解模型行为的具体问题。

Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly relies on other
LLMs acting as judges. However, current evaluation paradigms typically yield a
single score or ranking, answering which model is better but not why. While
essential for benchmarking, these top-level scores obscure the specific,
actionable reasons behind a model's performance. To bridge this gap, we
introduce CLEAR, an interactive, open-source package for LLM-based error
analysis. CLEAR first generates per-instance textual feedback, then it creates
a set of system-level error issues, and quantifies the prevalence of each
identified issue. Our package also provides users with an interactive dashboard
that allows for a comprehensive error analysis through aggregate
visualizations, applies interactive filters to isolate specific issues or score
ranges, and drills down to the individual instances that exemplify a particular
behavioral pattern. We demonstrate CLEAR analysis for RAG and Math benchmarks,
and showcase its utility through a user case study.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 维基百科多语言版本的内容独立编写和更新导致事实不一致，影响其中立性和可靠性，尤其是作为AI系统的主要训练数据源时。

Method: 开发了一种方法，用于收集、对齐和分析维基百科多语言文章中的表格数据，并定义了不一致的类别。

Result: 通过定量和定性指标评估了多语言对齐情况，揭示了不一致性的具体表现。

Conclusion: 研究结果对事实核查、多语言知识交互以及依赖维基百科内容的可靠AI系统设计具有重要意义。

Abstract: Wikipedia serves as a globally accessible knowledge source with content in
over 300 languages. Despite covering the same topics, the different versions of
Wikipedia are written and updated independently. This leads to factual
inconsistencies that can impact the neutrality and reliability of the
encyclopedia and AI systems, which often rely on Wikipedia as a main training
source. This study investigates cross-lingual inconsistencies in Wikipedia's
structured content, with a focus on tabular data. We developed a methodology to
collect, align, and analyze tables from Wikipedia multilingual articles,
defining categories of inconsistency. We apply various quantitative and
qualitative metrics to assess multilingual alignment using a sample dataset.
These insights have implications for factual verification, multilingual
knowledge interaction, and design for reliable AI systems leveraging Wikipedia
content.

Motivation: 在线金融文本数据的情感分析对交易决策和市场动态影响深远，但传统监督微调方法存在泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 通过DPO进行后训练人类偏好对齐，构建FinDPO框架，并结合‘logit-to-score’转换生成连续可排序的情感分数。

Result: FinDPO在情感分类基准上平均提升11%，模拟投资策略中实现67%年化收益和2.0的夏普比率。

Conclusion: FinDPO是首个在金融领域结合情感分析和实际投资策略的框架，表现出卓越的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Opinions expressed in online finance-related textual data are having an
increasingly profound impact on trading decisions and market movements. This
trend highlights the vital role of sentiment analysis as a tool for quantifying
the nature and strength of such opinions. With the rapid development of
Generative AI (GenAI), supervised fine-tuned (SFT) large language models (LLMs)
have become the de facto standard for financial sentiment analysis. However,
the SFT paradigm can lead to memorization of the training data and often fails
to generalize to unseen samples. This is a critical limitation in financial
domains, where models must adapt to previously unobserved events and the
nuanced, domain-specific language of finance. To this end, we introduce FinDPO,
the first finance-specific LLM framework based on post-training human
preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The proposed
FinDPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard sentiment
classification benchmarks, outperforming existing supervised fine-tuned models
by 11% on the average. Uniquely, the FinDPO framework enables the integration
of a fine-tuned causal LLM into realistic portfolio strategies through a novel
'logit-to-score' conversion, which transforms discrete sentiment predictions
into continuous, rankable sentiment scores (probabilities). In this way,
simulations demonstrate that FinDPO is the first sentiment-based approach to
maintain substantial positive returns of 67% annually and strong risk-adjusted
performance, as indicated by a Sharpe ratio of 2.0, even under realistic
transaction costs of 5 basis points (bps).

TL;DR: AraTable是一个新的阿拉伯语表格数据基准，用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）的理解和推理能力，填补了阿拉伯语资源的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于阿拉伯语表格数据的公开资源有限且语言特性独特，现有LLMs在处理此类数据时表现不足，需要专门的评估工具。

Method: 采用混合方法，先由LLMs生成内容，再由人类专家过滤和验证，确保数据集质量。同时提出自动化评估框架。

Result: LLMs在简单任务（如直接问答）上表现尚可，但在复杂推理和事实验证任务中仍有显著挑战。自动化评估框架性能接近人类评判。

Conclusion: AraTable为阿拉伯语结构化数据的处理提供了宝贵资源和评估框架，未来需进一步改进复杂推理任务的表现。

Abstract: The cognitive and reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) have
enabled remarkable progress in natural language processing. However, their
performance in interpreting structured data, especially in tabular formats,
remains limited. Although benchmarks for English tabular data are widely
available, Arabic is still underrepresented because of the limited availability
of public resources and its unique language features. To address this gap, we
present AraTable, a novel and comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
reasoning and understanding capabilities of LLMs when applied to Arabic tabular
data. AraTable consists of various evaluation tasks, such as direct question
answering, fact verification, and complex reasoning, involving a wide range of
Arabic tabular sources. Our methodology follows a hybrid pipeline, where
initial content is generated by LLMs and subsequently filtered and verified by
human experts to ensure high dataset quality. Initial analyses using AraTable
show that, while LLMs perform adequately on simpler tabular tasks such as
direct question answering, they continue to face significant cognitive
challenges when tasks require deeper reasoning and fact verification. This
indicates that there are substantial opportunities for future work to improve
performance on complex tabular reasoning tasks. We also propose a fully
automated evaluation framework that uses a self-deliberation mechanism and
achieves performance nearly identical to that of human judges. This research
provides a valuable, publicly available resource and evaluation framework that
can help accelerate the development of foundational models for processing and
analysing Arabic structured data.

Conclusion: 该研究为孟加拉语标点恢复建立了强基线，并公开了数据集和代码，支持低资源NLP的未来研究。

Abstract: Punctuation restoration enhances the readability of text and is critical for
post-processing tasks in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), especially for
low-resource languages like Bangla. In this study, we explore the application
of transformer-based models, specifically XLM-RoBERTa-large, to automatically
restore punctuation in unpunctuated Bangla text. We focus on predicting four
punctuation marks: period, comma, question mark, and exclamation mark across
diverse text domains. To address the scarcity of annotated resources, we
constructed a large, varied training corpus and applied data augmentation
techniques. Our best-performing model, trained with an augmentation factor of
alpha = 0.20%, achieves an accuracy of 97.1% on the News test set, 91.2% on the
Reference set, and 90.2% on the ASR set.
  Results show strong generalization to reference and ASR transcripts,
demonstrating the model's effectiveness in real-world, noisy scenarios. This
work establishes a strong baseline for Bangla punctuation restoration and
contributes publicly available datasets and code to support future research in
low-resource NLP.

Abstract: Generating clinical synthetic text represents an effective solution for
common clinical NLP issues like sparsity and privacy. This paper aims to
conduct a systematic review on generating synthetic medical free-text by
formulating quantitative analysis to three research questions concerning (i)
the purpose of generation, (ii) the techniques, and (iii) the evaluation
methods. We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE,
Google Scholar, and arXiv databases for publications associated with generating
synthetic medical unstructured free-text. We have identified 94 relevant
articles out of 1,398 collected ones. A great deal of attention has been given
to the generation of synthetic medical text from 2018 onwards, where the main
purpose of such a generation is towards text augmentation, assistive writing,
corpus building, privacy-preserving, annotation, and usefulness. Transformer
architectures were the main predominant technique used to generate the text,
especially the GPTs. On the other hand, there were four main aspects of
evaluation, including similarity, privacy, structure, and utility, where
utility was the most frequent method used to assess the generated synthetic
medical text. Although the generated synthetic medical text demonstrated a
moderate possibility to act as real medical documents in different downstream
NLP tasks, it has proven to be a great asset as augmented, complementary to the
real documents, towards improving the accuracy and overcoming
sparsity/undersampling issues. Yet, privacy is still a major issue behind
generating synthetic medical text, where more human assessments are needed to
check for the existence of any sensitive information. Despite that, advances in
generating synthetic medical text will considerably accelerate the adoption of
workflows and pipeline development, discarding the time-consuming legalities of
data transfer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格数据存在稀疏特征级依赖，而LLM的自注意力机制会分散对关键关系的关注，导致性能下降。

Method: GraDe使用轻量级动态图学习模块，结合外部提取的功能依赖，优先处理关键特征交互。

Result: 实验表明，GraDe在复杂数据集上比现有LLM方法性能提升12%，在合成数据质量上与最先进方法竞争。

Conclusion: GraDe是一种高效且实用的方法，适用于结构感知的表格数据建模。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong potential for tabular data
generation by modeling textualized feature-value pairs. However, tabular data
inherently exhibits sparse feature-level dependencies, where many feature
interactions are structurally insignificant. This creates a fundamental
mismatch as LLMs' self-attention mechanism inevitably distributes focus across
all pairs, diluting attention on critical relationships, particularly in
datasets with complex dependencies or semantically ambiguous features. To
address this limitation, we propose GraDe (Graph-Guided Dependency Learning), a
novel method that explicitly integrates sparse dependency graphs into LLMs'
attention mechanism. GraDe employs a lightweight dynamic graph learning module
guided by externally extracted functional dependencies, prioritizing key
feature interactions while suppressing irrelevant ones. Our experiments across
diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that GraDe outperforms existing
LLM-based approaches by up to 12% on complex datasets while achieving
competitive results with state-of-the-art approaches in synthetic data quality.
Our method is minimally intrusive yet effective, offering a practical solution
for structure-aware tabular data modeling with LLMs.

TL;DR: GIIFT框架通过跨模态图注意力网络适配器，在无图像推理中实现多模态机器翻译的泛化，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MMT方法在模态对齐和多模态域推理上存在局限，需改进以支持更广泛的图像无关翻译。

Method: 构建多模态场景图，提出两阶段GIIFT框架，利用跨模态图注意力网络学习统一融合空间知识。

Result: 在Multi30K和WMT基准测试中，GIIFT表现优于现有方法，实现无图像推理的最优性能。

Conclusion: GIIFT展示了在多模态机器翻译中无图像推理的强大潜力，为跨模态泛化提供新思路。

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) has demonstrated the significant help of
visual information in machine translation. However, existing MMT methods face
challenges in leveraging the modality gap by enforcing rigid visual-linguistic
alignment whilst being confined to inference within their trained multimodal
domains. In this work, we construct novel multimodal scene graphs to preserve
and integrate modality-specific information and introduce GIIFT, a two-stage
Graph-guided Inductive Image-Free MMT framework that uses a cross-modal Graph
Attention Network adapter to learn multimodal knowledge in a unified fused
space and inductively generalize it to broader image-free translation domains.
Experimental results on the Multi30K dataset of English-to-French and
English-to-German tasks demonstrate that our GIIFT surpasses existing
approaches and achieves the state-of-the-art, even without images during
inference. Results on the WMT benchmark show significant improvements over the
image-free translation baselines, demonstrating the strength of GIIFT towards
inductive image-free inference.

*Ganesh Sapkota,Md Hasibur Rahman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种结合6-mer和BPE-600的混合分词策略，提升DNA语言模型的性能，优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统k-mer分词在捕捉DNA局部结构时存在分布不均和全局上下文理解不足的问题。

Method: 合并6-mer分词与600次BPE循环生成的BPE分词，形成平衡且上下文感知的词汇表。

Result: 模型在3-mer、4-mer和5-mer预测任务中表现优异，准确率分别为10.78%、10.1%和4.12%。

Conclusion: 混合分词策略能同时捕捉DNA的局部和全局信息，为基因组语言建模和下游研究奠定基础。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid tokenization strategy that enhances the
performance of DNA Language Models (DLMs) by combining 6-mer tokenization with
Byte Pair Encoding (BPE-600). Traditional k-mer tokenization is effective at
capturing local DNA sequence structures but often faces challenges, including
uneven token distribution and a limited understanding of global sequence
context. To address these limitations, we propose merging unique 6mer tokens
with optimally selected BPE tokens generated through 600 BPE cycles. This
hybrid approach ensures a balanced and context-aware vocabulary, enabling the
model to capture both short and long patterns within DNA sequences
simultaneously. A foundational DLM trained on this hybrid vocabulary was
evaluated using next-k-mer prediction as a fine-tuning task, demonstrating
significantly improved performance. The model achieved prediction accuracies of
10.78% for 3-mers, 10.1% for 4-mers, and 4.12% for 5-mers, outperforming
state-of-the-art models such as NT, DNABERT2, and GROVER. These results
highlight the ability of the hybrid tokenization strategy to preserve both the
local sequence structure and global contextual information in DNA modeling.
This work underscores the importance of advanced tokenization methods in
genomic language modeling and lays a robust foundation for future applications
in downstream DNA sequence analysis and biological research.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为WINO的训练免费解码算法，用于解决扩散大语言模型（DLLMs）中质量与速度的权衡问题，通过并行草稿-验证机制显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DLLMs在快速并行生成时存在严重的质量与速度权衡问题，标准解码的不可逆性导致早期错误积累。

Method: 引入WINO算法，采用并行草稿-验证机制，快速生成多个令牌并利用双向上下文验证和修正可疑令牌。

Result: 在GSM8K数学基准测试中，推理速度提升6倍且准确率提高2.58%；在Flickr30K字幕生成中，速度提升10倍且性能更高。

Conclusion: WINO有效解决了DLLMs的质量与速度权衡问题，展示了其优越性并提供了深入理解。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have emerged as a compelling
alternative to Autoregressive models, designed for fast parallel generation.
However, existing DLLMs are plagued by a severe quality-speed trade-off, where
faster parallel decoding leads to significant performance degradation. We
attribute this to the irreversibility of standard decoding in DLLMs, which is
easily polarized into the wrong decoding direction along with early error
context accumulation. To resolve this, we introduce Wide-In, Narrow-Out (WINO),
a training-free decoding algorithm that enables revokable decoding in DLLMs.
WINO employs a parallel draft-and-verify mechanism, aggressively drafting
multiple tokens while simultaneously using the model's bidirectional context to
verify and re-mask suspicious ones for refinement. Verified in open-source
DLLMs like LLaDA and MMaDA, WINO is shown to decisively improve the
quality-speed trade-off. For instance, on the GSM8K math benchmark, it
accelerates inference by 6$\times$ while improving accuracy by 2.58%; on
Flickr30K captioning, it achieves a 10$\times$ speedup with higher performance.
More comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority and
provide an in-depth understanding of WINO.

Conclusion: AQuilt为专业领域提供高效、低成本的数据合成解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) in general
domains, they often underperform in specialized domains. Existing approaches
typically rely on data synthesis methods and yield promising results by using
unlabeled data to capture domain-specific features. However, these methods
either incur high computational costs or suffer from performance limitations,
while also demonstrating insufficient generalization across different tasks. To
address these challenges, we propose AQuilt, a framework for constructing
instruction-tuning data for any specialized domains from corresponding
unlabeled data, including Answer, Question, Unlabeled data, Inspection, Logic,
and Task type. By incorporating logic and inspection, we encourage reasoning
processes and self-inspection to enhance model performance. Moreover,
customizable task instructions enable high-quality data generation for any
task. As a result, we construct a dataset of 703k examples to train a powerful
data synthesis model. Experiments show that AQuilt is comparable to DeepSeek-V3
while utilizing just 17% of the production cost. Further analysis demonstrates
that our generated data exhibits higher relevance to downstream tasks. Source

Motivation: 现有提示优化方法分为两类：基于文本反馈的无训练方法和基于数值奖励的训练方法。TRPrompt旨在统一这两种方法，利用文本反馈直接训练提示模型，提升推理能力。

Method: TRPrompt框架通过LLM内部对“好”提示的理解，将文本反馈作为高分辨率信号，迭代优化提示模型，无需预先数据集。

Result: 在GSMHard和MATH数据集上，TRPrompt生成的查询特定提示达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: TRPrompt通过结合文本反馈和训练方法，提供了一种高效且无需预收集数据的提示优化框架，显著提升了LLM的推理能力。

Abstract: Prompt optimization improves the reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs) without requiring parameter updates to the target model. Following
heuristic-based "Think step by step" approaches, the field has evolved in two
main directions: while one group of methods uses textual feedback to elicit
improved prompts from general-purpose LLMs in a training-free way, a concurrent
line of research relies on numerical rewards to train a special prompt model,
tailored for providing optimal prompts to the target model. In this paper, we
introduce the Textual Reward Prompt framework (TRPrompt), which unifies these
approaches by directly incorporating textual feedback into training of the
prompt model. Our framework does not require prior dataset collection and is
being iteratively improved with the feedback on the generated prompts. When
coupled with the capacity of an LLM to internalize the notion of what a "good"
prompt is, the high-resolution signal provided by the textual rewards allows us
to train a prompt model yielding state-of-the-art query-specific prompts for
the problems from the challenging math datasets GSMHard and MATH.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于清单反馈的强化学习方法（RLCF），通过动态评估指令完成情况来优化语言模型的指令跟随能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法通常使用固定标准（如“有用性”和“无害性”）优化语言模型，但这种方法难以适应多样化的用户指令需求。

Method: 从指令中提取清单，结合AI评估和专用验证程序对响应进行评分，生成强化学习的奖励信号。

Result: RLCF在多个基准测试中表现优异，包括FollowBench（硬满意度提升4点）、InFoBench（提升6点）和Arena-Hard（胜率提升3点）。

Conclusion: 清单反馈是提升语言模型多样化指令支持能力的关键工具。

Abstract: Language models must be adapted to understand and follow user instructions.
Reinforcement learning is widely used to facilitate this -- typically using
fixed criteria such as "helpfulness" and "harmfulness". In our work, we instead
propose using flexible, instruction-specific criteria as a means of broadening
the impact that reinforcement learning can have in eliciting instruction
following. We propose "Reinforcement Learning from Checklist Feedback" (RLCF).
From instructions, we extract checklists and evaluate how well responses
satisfy each item - using both AI judges and specialized verifier programs -
then combine these scores to compute rewards for RL. We compare RLCF with other
alignment methods applied to a strong instruction following model
(Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct) on five widely-studied benchmarks -- RLCF is the only
method to improve performance on every benchmark, including a 4-point boost in
hard satisfaction rate on FollowBench, a 6-point increase on InFoBench, and a
3-point rise in win rate on Arena-Hard. These results establish checklist
feedback as a key tool for improving language models' support of queries that
express a multitude of needs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要针对每个实例进行微调，限制了可扩展性，因此需要一种零样本的解决方案。

Method: 利用结构化2x2视频网格训练轻量级Grid-LoRA适配器，并通过Grid Fill模块完成部分布局。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在未见过的动态概念和编辑场景中均能生成高质量且一致的结果。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了零样本动态概念个性化，具有高效性和通用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have enabled high-quality
synthesis from text and image prompts. While the personalization of dynamic
concepts, which capture subject-specific appearance and motion from a single
video, is now feasible, most existing methods require per-instance fine-tuning,
limiting scalability. We introduce a fully zero-shot framework for dynamic
concept personalization in text-to-video models. Our method leverages
structured 2x2 video grids that spatially organize input and output pairs,
enabling the training of lightweight Grid-LoRA adapters for editing and
composition within these grids. At inference, a dedicated Grid Fill module
completes partially observed layouts, producing temporally coherent and
identity preserving outputs. Once trained, the entire system operates in a
single forward pass, generalizing to previously unseen dynamic concepts without
any test-time optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate high-quality and
consistent results across a wide range of subjects beyond trained concepts and
editing scenarios.

Motivation: 现有方法在平衡身份保持（重建）与新颖姿势和表情（动画）方面存在挑战，尤其是在处理面部区域几何偏差时表现不佳。

Result: 实验表明，GeoAvatar在重建和新动画场景中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GeoAvatar通过自适应几何处理和高斯分割，显著提升了3D头部化身的重建和动画效果。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in 3D head avatar generation, balancing identity
preservation, i.e., reconstruction, with novel poses and expressions, i.e.,
animation, remains a challenge. Existing methods struggle to adapt Gaussians to
varying geometrical deviations across facial regions, resulting in suboptimal
quality. To address this, we propose GeoAvatar, a framework for adaptive
geometrical Gaussian Splatting. GeoAvatar leverages Adaptive Pre-allocation
Stage (APS), an unsupervised method that segments Gaussians into rigid and
flexible sets for adaptive offset regularization. Then, based on mouth anatomy
and dynamics, we introduce a novel mouth structure and the part-wise
deformation strategy to enhance the animation fidelity of the mouth. Finally,
we propose a regularization loss for precise rigging between Gaussians and 3DMM
faces. Moreover, we release DynamicFace, a video dataset with highly expressive
facial motions. Extensive experiments show the superiority of GeoAvatar
compared to state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction and novel animation
scenarios.

Motivation: 现有逆渲染方法依赖固定环境光照，导致3D重建精度不足，而多视角光度立体视觉（MVPS）虽能提高精度，但效率低。

Method: 先构建2D高斯溅射模型作为初始几何，再通过包含光照计算多层感知机的完整渲染方程进行逆渲染，并利用未标定的光度立体视觉法线正则化渲染法线图。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在合成和真实数据集上均优于现有方法，重建精度和计算效率更高。

Conclusion: PS-GS方法解决了逆渲染的挑战，适用于新视角合成、重光照及材质形状编辑。

Abstract: Integrating inverse rendering with multi-view photometric stereo (MVPS)
yields more accurate 3D reconstructions than the inverse rendering approaches
that rely on fixed environment illumination. However, efficient inverse
rendering with MVPS remains challenging. To fill this gap, we introduce the
Gaussian Splatting for Multi-view Photometric Stereo (PS-GS), which efficiently
and jointly estimates the geometry, materials, and lighting of the object that
is illuminated by diverse directional lights (multi-light). Our method first
reconstructs a standard 2D Gaussian splatting model as the initial geometry.
Based on the initialization model, it then proceeds with the deferred inverse
rendering by the full rendering equation containing a lighting-computing
multi-layer perceptron. During the whole optimization, we regularize the
rendered normal maps by the uncalibrated photometric stereo estimated normals.
We also propose the 2D Gaussian ray-tracing for single directional light to
refine the incident lighting. The regularizations and the use of multi-view and
multi-light images mitigate the ill-posed problem of inverse rendering. After
optimization, the reconstructed object can be used for novel-view synthesis,
relighting, and material and shape editing. Experiments on both synthetic and
real datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms prior works in terms of
reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: 该方法为设备端实时推理提供了可行方案，是实现逼真数字角色的重要一步。

Abstract: The training of high-quality, robust machine learning models for
speech-driven 3D facial animation requires a large, diverse dataset of
high-quality audio-animation pairs. To overcome the lack of such a dataset,
recent work has introduced large pre-trained speech encoders that are robust to
variations in the input audio and, therefore, enable the facial animation model
to generalize across speakers, audio quality, and languages. However, the
resulting facial animation models are prohibitively large and lend themselves
only to offline inference on a dedicated machine. In this work, we explore
on-device, real-time facial animation models in the context of game
development. We overcome the lack of large datasets by using hybrid knowledge
distillation with pseudo-labeling. Given a large audio dataset, we employ a
high-performing teacher model to train very small student models. In contrast
to the pre-trained speech encoders, our student models only consist of
convolutional and fully-connected layers, removing the need for attention
context or recurrent updates. In our experiments, we demonstrate that we can
reduce the memory footprint to up to 3.4 MB and required future audio context
to up to 81 ms while maintaining high-quality animations. This paves the way
for on-device inference, an important step towards realistic, model-driven
digital characters.

Result: SR生成的方程准确描述了层流条件下的速度场和压力场，与文献中的解析解完全一致。

Conclusion: SR能简化复杂流动行为为可解释方程，结合知识表示方法可提高数据驱动模型的可靠性和物理一致性。

Abstract: Unlike conventional Machine-Learning (ML) approaches, often criticized as
"black boxes", Symbolic Regression (SR) stands out as a powerful tool for
revealing interpretable mathematical relationships in complex physical systems,
requiring no a priori assumptions about models' structures. Motivated by the
recognition that, in fluid mechanics, an understanding of the underlying flow
physics is as crucial as accurate prediction, this study applies SR to model a
fundamental three-dimensional (3D) incompressible flow in a rectangular
channel, focusing on the (axial) velocity and pressure fields under laminar
conditions. By employing the PySR library, compact symbolic equations were
derived directly from numerical simulation data, revealing key characteristics
of the flow dynamics. These equations not only approximate the parabolic
velocity profile and pressure drop observed in the studied fluid flow, but also
perfectly coincide with analytical solutions from the literature. Furthermore,
we propose an innovative approach that integrates SR with the
knowledge-representation framework of Answer Set Programming (ASP), combining
the generative power of SR with the declarative reasoning strengths of ASP. The
proposed hybrid SR/ASP framework ensures that the SR-generated symbolic
expressions are not only statistically accurate, but also physically plausible,
adhering to domain-specific principles. Overall, the study highlights two key
contributions: SR's ability to simplify complex flow behaviours into concise,
interpretable equations, and the potential of knowledge-representation
approaches to improve the reliability and alignment of data-driven SR models
with domain principles. Insights from the examined 3D channel flow pave the way
for integrating such hybrid approaches into efficient frameworks, [...] where
explainable predictions and real-time data analysis are crucial.

Conclusion: 结构化认知工作流对数据分析智能体设计至关重要，I2I-STRADA为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic systems for data analysis have emphasized
automation of insight generation through multi-agent frameworks, and
orchestration layers. While these systems effectively manage tasks like query
translation, data transformation, and visualization, they often overlook the
structured reasoning process underlying analytical thinking. Reasoning large
language models (LLMs) used for multi-step problem solving are trained as
general-purpose problem solvers. As a result, their reasoning or thinking steps
do not adhere to fixed processes for specific tasks. Real-world data analysis
requires a consistent cognitive workflow: interpreting vague goals, grounding
them in contextual knowledge, constructing abstract plans, and adapting
execution based on intermediate outcomes. We introduce I2I-STRADA
(Information-to-Insight via Structured Reasoning Agent for Data Analysis), an
agentic architecture designed to formalize this reasoning process. I2I-STRADA
focuses on modeling how analysis unfolds via modular sub-tasks that reflect the
cognitive steps of analytical reasoning. Evaluations on the DABstep and DABench
benchmarks show that I2I-STRADA outperforms prior systems in planning coherence
and insight alignment, highlighting the importance of structured cognitive
workflows in agent design for data analysis.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present intriguing opportunities to enhance user
interaction with traditional algorithms and tools in real-world applications.
An advanced planning system (APS) is a sophisticated software that leverages
optimization to help operations planners create, interpret, and modify an
operational plan. While highly beneficial, many customers are priced out of
using an APS due to the ongoing costs of consultants responsible for
customization and maintenance. To address the need for a more accessible APS
expressed by supply chain planners, we present SmartAPS, a conversational
system built on a tool-augmented LLM. Our system provides operations planners
with an intuitive natural language chat interface, allowing them to query
information, perform counterfactual reasoning, receive recommendations, and
execute scenario analysis to better manage their operation. A short video
demonstrating the system has been released: https://youtu.be/KtIrJjlDbyw

TL;DR: 本文识别了一种定性时间线规划的子片段，其计划存在性问题可直接映射到确定性有限自动机的非空性问题，从而合成策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 定性时间线规划的计划存在性问题为PSPACE完全，但现有方法需通过非确定性有限自动机解决，且需昂贵的确定性化步骤。本文旨在找到可直接映射到确定性自动机的子片段。

Method: 识别定性时间线规划的一个子片段，将其计划存在性问题映射到确定性有限自动机的非空性问题。

Result: 确定了可直接使用确定性有限自动机合成策略的规划子片段，并识别了适合该片段的Allen关系的最大子集。

Conclusion: 本文提出的确定性片段简化了策略合成过程，避免了非确定性自动机的复杂性。

Abstract: Qualitative timeline-based planning models domains as sets of independent,
but
  interacting, components whose behaviors over time, the timelines, are
governed
  by sets of qualitative temporal constraints (ordering relations), called
  synchronization rules.
  Its plan-existence problem has been shown to be PSPACE-complete; in
  particular, PSPACE-membership has been proved via reduction to the
  nonemptiness problem for nondeterministic finite automata.
  However, nondeterministic automata cannot be directly used to synthesize
  planning strategies as a costly determinization step is needed.
  In this paper, we identify a fragment of qualitative timeline-based planning
  whose plan-existence problem can be directly mapped into the nonemptiness
  problem of deterministic finite automata, which can then
  synthesize strategies.
  In addition, we identify a maximal subset of Allen's relations that fits into
  such a deterministic fragment.

*Yusen Peng,Shuhua Mao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了E.A.R.T.H.框架，通过五个阶段将模型生成的错误转化为创意资产，显著提升了创造力和新颖性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI如何超越模仿实现真正的创造力，提出‘创意潜藏于失败中’的理念。

Method: 采用五阶段生成管道（错误生成、放大、精炼选择、转换、利用反馈），结合结构化提示、语义评分和人类评估。

Result: 创造力评分提升70.4%，标语更短且新颖性提高40.7%，跨模态测试和人评均表现优异。

Conclusion: 错误驱动和反馈驱动的生成方法能有效增强AI创造力，为自进化、人类对齐的创意AI提供可行路径。

Abstract: How can AI move beyond imitation toward genuine creativity? This paper
proposes the E.A.R.T.H. framework, a five-stage generative pipeline that
transforms model-generated errors into creative assets through Error
generation, Amplification, Refine selection, Transform, and Harness feedback.
Drawing on cognitive science and generative modeling, we posit that "creative
potential hides in failure" and operationalize this via structured prompts,
semantic scoring, and human-in-the-loop evaluation. Implemented using
LLaMA-2-7B-Chat, SBERT, BERTScore, CLIP, BLIP-2, and Stable Diffusion, the
pipeline employs a composite reward function based on novelty, surprise, and
relevance. At the Refine stage, creativity scores increase by 52.5% (1.179 to
1.898, t = -5.56, p < 0.001), with final outputs reaching 2.010 - a 70.4%
improvement. Refined slogans are 48.4% shorter, 40.7% more novel, with only a
4.0% drop in relevance. Cross-modal tests show strong slogan-to-image alignment
(CLIPScore: 0.249; BERTScore F1: 0.816). In human evaluations, 60% of outputs
scored >= 4.0, with metaphorical slogans (avg. 4.09) outperforming literal ones
(3.99). Feedback highlights stylistic precision and emotional resonance. These
results demonstrate that error-centered, feedback-driven generation enhances
creativity, offering a scalable path toward self-evolving, human-aligned
creative AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨图表是否对AI系统分析数据有帮助。

Method: 使用GPT 4.1和Claude 3.5进行实验，对比带散点图、空白图和不匹配图的数据分析效果。

Result: 带散点图的数据分析表现最佳，表明图表内容对AI系统有实际帮助。

Conclusion: AI系统也能从可视化中受益，类似人类。

Abstract: Charts and graphs help people analyze data, but can they also be useful to AI
systems? To investigate this question, we perform a series of experiments with
two commercial vision-language models: GPT 4.1 and Claude 3.5. Across three
representative analysis tasks, the two systems describe synthetic datasets more
precisely and accurately when raw data is accompanied by a scatterplot,
especially as datasets grow in complexity. Comparison with two baselines --
providing a blank chart and a chart with mismatched data -- shows that the
improved performance is due to the content of the charts. Our results are
initial evidence that AI systems, like humans, can benefit from visualization.

TL;DR: MAGPO是一种新的多智能体强化学习框架，通过集中式训练与分散式执行的结合，解决了现有CTDE方法在集中式训练利用不足和缺乏理论保证的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CTDE方法在集中式训练利用不足且缺乏理论保证，MAGPO旨在通过集中式指导与分散式执行的结合来解决这些问题。

Method: MAGPO采用自回归联合策略进行可扩展的协调探索，并明确与分散式策略对齐以确保在部分可观测性下的可部署性。

Result: 在6个不同环境的43个任务上，MAGPO表现优于现有CTDE基线，并匹配或超越完全集中式方法。

Conclusion: MAGPO为分散式多智能体学习提供了有理论保证且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Due to practical constraints such as partial observability and limited
communication, Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) has
become the dominant paradigm in cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
(MARL). However, existing CTDE methods often underutilize centralized training
or lack theoretical guarantees. We propose Multi-Agent Guided Policy
Optimization (MAGPO), a novel framework that better leverages centralized
training by integrating centralized guidance with decentralized execution.
MAGPO uses an auto-regressive joint policy for scalable, coordinated
exploration and explicitly aligns it with decentralized policies to ensure
deployability under partial observability. We provide theoretical guarantees of
monotonic policy improvement and empirically evaluate MAGPO on 43 tasks across
6 diverse environments. Results show that MAGPO consistently outperforms strong
CTDE baselines and matches or surpasses fully centralized approaches, offering
a principled and practical solution for decentralized multi-agent learning. Our
code and experimental data can be found in https://github.com/liyheng/MAGPO.

TL;DR: ASI-Arch是一种自主超级智能系统，用于AI研究中的神经网络架构发现，突破了人类认知限制，实现了自动化创新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI研究受限于人类认知能力，ASI-Arch旨在通过自主创新打破这一瓶颈。

Method: ASI-Arch通过自主假设、实现、训练和验证新型架构，完成了1,773次实验，发现了106种创新架构。

Result: 系统发现了超越人类设计基准的新架构，并首次建立了科学发现的规模定律。

Conclusion: ASI-Arch为AI系统的自我加速研究提供了蓝图，将研究进展从人类限制转变为可计算扩展的过程。

Abstract: While AI systems demonstrate exponentially improving capabilities, the pace
of AI research itself remains linearly bounded by human cognitive capacity,
creating an increasingly severe development bottleneck. We present ASI-Arch,
the first demonstration of Artificial Superintelligence for AI research
(ASI4AI) in the critical domain of neural architecture discovery--a fully
autonomous system that shatters this fundamental constraint by enabling AI to
conduct its own architectural innovation. Moving beyond traditional Neural
Architecture Search (NAS), which is fundamentally limited to exploring
human-defined spaces, we introduce a paradigm shift from automated optimization
to automated innovation. ASI-Arch can conduct end-to-end scientific research in
the domain of architecture discovery, autonomously hypothesizing novel
architectural concepts, implementing them as executable code, training and
empirically validating their performance through rigorous experimentation and
past experience. ASI-Arch conducted 1,773 autonomous experiments over 20,000
GPU hours, culminating in the discovery of 106 innovative, state-of-the-art
(SOTA) linear attention architectures. Like AlphaGo's Move 37 that revealed
unexpected strategic insights invisible to human players, our AI-discovered
architectures demonstrate emergent design principles that systematically
surpass human-designed baselines and illuminate previously unknown pathways for
architectural innovation. Crucially, we establish the first empirical scaling
law for scientific discovery itself--demonstrating that architectural
breakthroughs can be scaled computationally, transforming research progress
from a human-limited to a computation-scalable process. We provide
comprehensive analysis of the emergent design patterns and autonomous research
capabilities that enabled these breakthroughs, establishing a blueprint for
self-accelerating AI systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动化临床数据处理的Agentic AI框架，通过模块化代理从数据输入到推理全流程处理，减少人工干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域机器学习部署成本高、流程碎片化，需解决数据隐私和模型兼容性问题。

Method: 采用模块化代理系统，包括数据识别、匿名化、特征提取、模型匹配、预处理和推理，支持结构化和非结构化数据。

Result: 在老年医学、姑息治疗和结肠镜影像数据集上验证，实现自动化特征选择、模型选择和预处理。

Conclusion: 该框架降低了专家干预需求，为临床AI提供了可扩展、高效的实施路径。

Abstract: Building and deploying machine learning solutions in healthcare remains
expensive and labor-intensive due to fragmented preprocessing workflows, model
compatibility issues, and stringent data privacy constraints. In this work, we
introduce an Agentic AI framework that automates the entire clinical data
pipeline, from ingestion to inference, through a system of modular,
task-specific agents. These agents handle both structured and unstructured
data, enabling automatic feature selection, model selection, and preprocessing
recommendation without manual intervention. We evaluate the system on publicly
available datasets from geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy imaging.
For example, in the case of structured data (anxiety data) and unstructured
data (colonoscopy polyps data), the pipeline begins with file-type detection by
the Ingestion Identifier Agent, followed by the Data Anonymizer Agent ensuring
privacy compliance, where we first identify the data type and then anonymize
it. The Feature Extraction Agent identifies features using an embedding-based
approach for tabular data, extracting all column names, and a multi-stage
MedGemma-based approach for image data, which infers modality and disease name.
These features guide the Model-Data Feature Matcher Agent in selecting the
best-fit model from a curated repository. The Preprocessing Recommender Agent
and Preprocessing Implementor Agent then apply tailored preprocessing based on
data type and model requirements. Finally, the ``Model Inference Agent" runs
the selected model on the uploaded data and generates interpretable outputs
using tools like SHAP, LIME, and DETR attention maps. By automating these
high-friction stages of the ML lifecycle, the proposed framework reduces the
need for repeated expert intervention, offering a scalable, cost-efficient
pathway for operationalizing AI in clinical environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究利用自然语言处理（NLP）和主动学习技术，开发了一个分类器，用于从急诊科分诊记录中快速检测潜在的疫苗安全问题，以弥补临床试验中安全数据收集的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于临床试验中安全数据收集时间有限，且疫苗广泛使用后需要快速监测安全问题，因此需要开发高效的方法来识别潜在风险。

Method: 结合自然语言处理（NLP）、主动学习和数据增强技术，开发分类器，从急诊科分诊记录中提取疫苗安全信号。

Result: 该方法能够更准确、高效地识别疫苗安全问题，减少误报，并优化标注数据的质量。

Conclusion: NLP与主动学习的结合为疫苗安全监测提供了快速、高效的解决方案，有助于提升公共卫生响应能力。

Abstract: The rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines has showcased the global
communitys ability to combat infectious diseases. However, the need for
post-licensure surveillance systems has grown due to the limited window for
safety data collection in clinical trials and early widespread implementation.
This study aims to employ Natural Language Processing techniques and Active
Learning to rapidly develop a classifier that detects potential vaccine safety
issues from emergency department notes. ED triage notes, containing expert,
succinct vital patient information at the point of entry to health systems, can
significantly contribute to timely vaccine safety signal surveillance. While
keyword-based classification can be effective, it may yield false positives and
demand extensive keyword modifications. This is exacerbated by the infrequency
of vaccination-related ED presentations and their similarity to other reasons
for ED visits. NLP offers a more accurate and efficient alternative, albeit
requiring annotated data, which is often scarce in the medical field. Active
learning optimizes the annotation process and the quality of annotated data,
which can result in faster model implementation and improved model performance.
This work combines active learning, data augmentation, and active learning and
evaluation techniques to create a classifier that is used to enhance vaccine
safety surveillance from ED triage notes.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了使用均值聚合函数的图神经网络（GNNs）的表达能力，发现其在非均匀设置下与比率模态逻辑等价，而在均匀设置下其表达能力低于使用求和或最大值聚合的GNNs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索不同聚合函数（均值、求和、最大值）对GNNs表达能力的影响，并比较其与模态逻辑的关系。

Method: 在非均匀和均匀设置下，分析均值聚合GNNs的表达能力，并与模态逻辑（如比率模态逻辑、交替自由模态逻辑）进行对比。

Result: 非均匀设置下，均值GNNs与比率模态逻辑等价；均匀设置下，其表达能力低于求和或最大值GNNs。

Conclusion: 均值GNNs的表达能力受聚合函数和设置影响，均匀设置下较弱，但放宽假设可提升表达能力。

Abstract: We study the expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) with mean as
the aggregation function. In the non-uniform setting, we show that such GNNs
have exactly the same expressive power as ratio modal logic, which has modal
operators expressing that at least a certain ratio of the successors of a
vertex satisfies a specified property. The non-uniform expressive power of mean
GNNs is thus higher than that of GNNs with max aggregation, but lower than for
sum aggregation--the latter are characterized by modal logic and graded modal
logic, respectively. In the uniform setting, we show that the expressive power
relative to MSO is exactly that of alternation-free modal logic, under the
natural assumptions that combination functions are continuous and
classification functions are thresholds. This implies that, relative to MSO and
in the uniform setting, mean GNNs are strictly less expressive than sum GNNs
and max GNNs. When any of the assumptions is dropped, the expressive power
increases.

*Mutian Yang,Jiandong Gao,Ji Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于双系统认知理论的框架，用于解耦大语言模型（LLMs）中知识和推理的贡献，通过快速和慢速思维模式分析其表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区分LLMs中知识和推理的贡献对模型分析、可解释性和开发至关重要。

Method: 将LLMs的认知分解为知识检索（Phase 1）和推理调整（Phase 2），并通过快速和慢速思维模式分别生成答案，量化两者的贡献。

Result: 研究发现推理调整是领域特定的，参数扩展显著提升知识能力，而知识主要分布在网络低层，推理则在高层。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅从解耦角度理解LLMs，还为现有研究（如扩展法则、分层知识编辑）提供了新见解。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) leverage both knowledge and reasoning
during inference, the capacity to distinguish between them plays a pivotal role
in model analysis, interpretability, and development. Inspired by dual-system
cognitive theory, we propose a cognition attribution framework to decouple the
contribution of knowledge and reasoning. In particular, the cognition of LLMs
is decomposed into two distinct yet complementary phases: knowledge retrieval
(Phase 1) and reasoning adjustment (Phase 2). To separate these phases, LLMs
are prompted to generate answers under two different cognitive modes, fast
thinking and slow thinking, respectively. The performance under different
cognitive modes is analyzed to quantify the contribution of knowledge and
reasoning. This architecture is employed to 15 LLMs across 3 datasets. Results
reveal: (1) reasoning adjustment is domain-specific, benefiting
reasoning-intensive domains (e.g., mathematics, physics, and chemistry) and
potentially imparing knowledge-intensive domains. (2) Parameter scaling
improves both knowledge and reasoning, with knowledge improvements being more
pronounced. Additionally, parameter scaling make LLMs reasoning significantly
more prudent, while moderately more intelligent. (3) Knowledge primarily
resides in lower network layers, while reasoning operates in higher layers. Our
framework not only helps understand LLMs from a "decoupling" perspective, but
also provides new insights into existing research, including scaling laws,
hierarchical knowledge editing, and limitations of small-model reasoning.

Motivation: 探讨析取在Answer Set Programming中的非最小化语义，比较不同方法的异同。

Method: 比较四种析取语义：Justified Models、Strongly Supported Models、Forks和DI语义，分析其定义和关系。

Result: 证明Forks、Justified Models和DI语义的合理松弛实际上一致，且比Strongly Supported Models更强。

Conclusion: 共同语义始终提供程序的稳定模型的超集，且比Strongly Supported Models更严格。

Abstract: In this paper, we compare four different semantics for disjunction in Answer
Set Programming that, unlike stable models, do not adhere to the principle of
model minimality. Two of these approaches, Cabalar and Mu\~niz' \emph{Justified
Models} and Doherty and Szalas' \emph{Strongly Supported Models}, directly
provide an alternative non-minimal semantics for disjunction. The other two,
Aguado et al's \emph{Forks} and Shen and Eiter's \emph{Determining Inference}
(DI) semantics, actually introduce a new disjunction connective, but are
compared here as if they constituted new semantics for the standard disjunction
operator. We are able to prove that three of these approaches (Forks, Justified
Models and a reasonable relaxation of the DI semantics) actually coincide,
constituting a common single approach under different definitions. Moreover,
this common semantics always provides a superset of the stable models of a
program (in fact, modulo any context) and is strictly stronger than the fourth
approach (Strongly Supported Models), that actually treats disjunctions as in
classical logic.

Result: 提供了AI风险分析的哲学基础，并为高风险和通用AI系统提供了操作性更强的评估模型。

Conclusion: 未来工作将开发正式模型和算法，以增强AI风险评估，支持负责任的AI治理。

Abstract: This chapter introduces a conceptual framework for qualitative risk
assessment of AI, particularly in the context of the EU AI Act. The framework
addresses the complexities of legal compliance and fundamental rights
protection by itegrating definitional balancing and defeasible reasoning.
Definitional balancing employs proportionality analysis to resolve conflicts
between competing rights, while defeasible reasoning accommodates the dynamic
nature of legal decision-making. Our approach stresses the need for an analysis
of AI deployment scenarios and for identifying potential legal violations and
multi-layered impacts on fundamental rights. On the basis of this analysis, we
provide philosophical foundations for a logical account of AI risk analysis. In
particular, we consider the basic building blocks for conceptually grasping the
interaction between AI deployment scenarios and fundamental rights,
incorporating in defeasible reasoning definitional balancing and arguments
about the contextual promotion or demotion of rights. This layered approach
allows for more operative models of assessment of both high-risk AI systems and
General Purpose AI (GPAI) systems, emphasizing the broader applicability of the
latter. Future work aims to develop a formal model and effective algorithms to
enhance AI risk assessment, bridging theoretical insights with practical
applications to support responsible AI governance.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在自动批改物理考试中表现出色，具有实用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: We present our method for automatically marking Physics exams. The marking
problem consists in assessing typed student answers for correctness with
respect to a ground truth solution. This is a challenging problem that we seek
to tackle using a combination of a computer algebra system, an SMT solver and a
term rewriting system. A Large Language Model is used to interpret and remove
errors from student responses and rewrite these in a machine readable format.
Once formalized and language-aligned, the next step then consists in applying
automated reasoning techniques for assessing student solution correctness. We
consider two methods of automated theorem proving: off-the-shelf SMT solving
and term rewriting systems tailored for physics problems involving
trigonometric expressions. The development of the term rewrite system and
establishing termination and confluence properties was not trivial, and we
describe it in some detail in the paper. We evaluate our system on a rich pool
of over 1500 real-world student exam responses from the 2023 Australian Physics
Olympiad.

Abstract: Most reasoning benchmarks for LLMs emphasize factual accuracy or step-by-step

decisions but also generate creative, plausible futures under uncertainty. We
introduce ConDiFi, a benchmark that jointly evaluates divergent and convergent
thinking in LLMs for financial tasks.
  ConDiFi features 607 macro-financial prompts for divergent reasoning and 990
multi-hop adversarial MCQs for convergent reasoning. Using this benchmark, we
evaluated 14 leading models and uncovered striking differences. Despite high
fluency, GPT-4o underperforms on Novelty and Actionability. In contrast, models
like DeepSeek-R1 and Cohere Command R+ rank among the top for generating
actionable, insights suitable for investment decisions. ConDiFi provides a new
perspective to assess reasoning capabilities essential to safe and strategic

Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的LLM推理方法缺乏理论支持，限制了方法论的进一步发展。

Method: 引入信息瓶颈原则，提出IBRO框架，并设计了一种轻量级的IB正则化方法。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中验证了IB正则化的有效性，显著提升了LLM的推理性能。

Conclusion: IB正则化是一种简单高效的方法，可无缝集成到现有RL框架中，提升LLM推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress
in reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR). By leveraging simple rule-based rewards, RL effectively
incentivizes LLMs to produce extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
trajectories, progressively guiding them toward correct answers. However,
existing approaches remain largely heuristic and intuition-driven, limiting the
development of principled methodologies. In this paper, we present a
theoretical characterization of LLM reasoning grounded in information
bottleneck (IB) principle, introducing IB-aware reasoning optimization (IBRO),
a framework that encourages reasoning trajectories to be both informative about
the final correct answer and generalizable across diverse prompts. We derive a
practical token-level surrogate objective and propose an efficient
approximation, resulting in the lightweight IB regularization method. This
technique integrates seamlessly into existing RL-based post-training frameworks
without additional computational overhead, requiring only a one-line code
modification. Empirically, we validate IB regularization across multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks and RL algorithms, demonstrating consistent
improvements in LLM reasoning performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化呼叫中心的路由策略，减少客户等待时间和员工空闲时间。

Method: 比较了基于模型的值迭代（VI）和无模型的近端策略优化（PPO），使用MDP框架和SBR模型。

Result: 经过1000次测试，PPO在奖励、客户等待时间和员工空闲时间上表现最优。

Conclusion: PPO方法尽管训练时间较长，但在呼叫中心路由优化中效果最佳。

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to
optimise call routing in call centres to minimise client waiting time and staff
idle time. Two methods are compared: a model-based approach using Value
Iteration (VI) under known system dynamics, and a model-free approach using
Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) that learns from experience. For the
model-based approach, a theoretical model is used, while a simulation model
combining Discrete Event Simulation (DES) with the OpenAI Gym environment is
developed for model-free learning. Both models frame the problem as a Markov
Decision Process (MDP) within a Skills-Based Routing (SBR) framework, with
Poisson client arrivals and exponentially distributed service and abandonment
times. For policy evaluation, random, VI, and PPO policies are evaluated using
the simulation model. After 1,000 test episodes, PPO consistently achives the
highest rewards, along with the lowest client waiting time and staff idle time,
despite requiring longer training time.

Abstract: Constraint Programming developed within Logic Programming in the Eighties;
nowadays all Prolog systems encompass modules capable of handling constraint
programming on finite domains demanding their solution to a constraint solver.
This work focuses on a specific form of constraint, the so-called table
constraint, used to specify conditions on the values of variables as an
enumeration of alternative options. Since every condition on a set of finite
domain variables can be ultimately expressed as a finite set of cases, Table
can, in principle, simulate any other constraint. These characteristics make
Table one of the most studied constraints ever, leading to a series of
increasingly efficient propagation algorithms. Despite this, it is not uncommon
to encounter real-world problems with hundreds or thousands of valid cases that
are simply too many to be handled effectively with standard CPU-based
approaches. In this paper, we deal with the Compact-Table (CT) algorithm, the
state-of-the-art propagation algorithms for Table. We describe how CT can be
enhanced by exploiting the massive computational power offered by modern GPUs
to handle large Table constraints. In particular, we report on the design and
implementation of GPU-accelerated CT, on its integration into an existing
constraint solver, and on an experimental validation performed on a significant
set of instances.

Abstract: Concept probing has recently garnered increasing interest as a way to help
interpret artificial neural networks, dealing both with their typically large
size and their subsymbolic nature, which ultimately renders them unfeasible for
direct human interpretation. Concept probing works by training additional
classifiers to map the internal representations of a model into human-defined
concepts of interest, thus allowing humans to peek inside artificial neural
networks. Research on concept probing has mainly focused on the model being
probed or the probing model itself, paying limited attention to the data
required to train such probing models. In this paper, we address this gap.
Focusing on concept probing in the context of image classification tasks, we
investigate the effect of the data used to train probing models on their
performance. We also make available concept labels for two widely used
datasets.

Motivation: 解决传统对齐方法（如RLHF）仅学习人类偏好的局限性，开发具有内在安全推理和自我反思能力的AI。

Method: 采用SafeLadder框架，结合大规模、渐进式、安全导向的强化学习后训练和多原则验证器。

Conclusion: SafeLadder框架证明安全与能力可协同进化，适用于构建稳健、可靠、可信的通用AI。

Abstract: We introduce SafeWork-R1, a cutting-edge multimodal reasoning model that
demonstrates the coevolution of capabilities and safety. It is developed by our
proposed SafeLadder framework, which incorporates large-scale, progressive,
safety-oriented reinforcement learning post-training, supported by a suite of
multi-principled verifiers. Unlike previous alignment methods such as RLHF that
simply learn human preferences, SafeLadder enables SafeWork-R1 to develop
intrinsic safety reasoning and self-reflection abilities, giving rise to safety
`aha' moments. Notably, SafeWork-R1 achieves an average improvement of
$46.54\%$ over its base model Qwen2.5-VL-72B on safety-related benchmarks
without compromising general capabilities, and delivers state-of-the-art safety
performance compared to leading proprietary models such as GPT-4.1 and Claude
Opus 4. To further bolster its reliability, we implement two distinct
inference-time intervention methods and a deliberative search mechanism,
enforcing step-level verification. Finally, we further develop
SafeWork-R1-InternVL3-78B, SafeWork-R1-DeepSeek-70B, and
SafeWork-R1-Qwen2.5VL-7B. All resulting models demonstrate that safety and
capability can co-evolve synergistically, highlighting the generalizability of
our framework in building robust, reliable, and trustworthy general-purpose AI.
