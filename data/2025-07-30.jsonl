BANG\nenhances control with spatial prompts, such as bounding boxes and surface\nregions, enabling users to specify which parts to decompose and how.

In practical\nterms, it is the intelligent use of word order, figurative speech and\nlinguistic embellishments to enhance message delivery. Despite the volumes that\nhave been written about it and the high status accorded to it, there is no way\nto objectively know whether a speaker or writer has used Arabic rhetoric in a\ngiven text, to what extent, and why. There is no objective way to compare the\nuse of Arabic rhetoric across genres, authors or epochs. It is impossible to\nknow which of pre-Islamic poetry, Andalucian Arabic poetry, or modern literary\ngenres are richer in Arabic rhetoric. The aim of the current study was to\ndevise a way to measure the density of the literary devices which constitute\nArabic rhetoric in a given text, as a proxy marker for Arabic rhetoric itself.\nA comprehensive list of 84 of the commonest literary devices and their\ndefinitions was compiled. A system of identifying literary devices in texts was\nconstructed. A method of calculating the density of literary devices based on\nthe morpheme count of the text was utilised. Four electronic tools and an\nanalogue tool were created to support the calculation of an Arabic text's\nrhetorical literary device density, including a website and online calculator.\nAdditionally, a technique of reporting the distribution of literary devices\nused across the three sub-domains of Arabic rhetoric was created. The output of\nthis project is a working tool which can accurately report the density of\nArabic rhetoric in any Arabic text or speech."}

For\nthe self-diversity, we calculate the fuzzy matching value of pairwise outputs\nwithin an LLM as its self-diversity value, subsequently prioritizing LLMs with\nhigh self-diversity values as cluster components in a training-free manner. For\nthe cross-consistency, we first measure cross-consistency values between the\nLLM with the highest self-diversity value and others, and then gradually mask\nout the LLM having the lowest cross-consistency value to eliminate the\npotential inconsistent output during the collaborative propagation. Extensive\nexperiments on two specialized medical datasets, NEJMQA and MMLU-Pro-health,\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our method across physician-oriented\nspecialties.

Toward this question, in this paper, we propose a benchmark for\ninvestigating to what extent the abilities of LLMs to interpret questions are\nactually compositional. For this, we generate three datasets of varying\ndifficulty based on graph patterns in DBpedia, relying on Lemon lexica for\nverbalization.

However, we observe two critical issues for patch-based approaches,\nwhich we call ``patch-level distribution shift\" and ``increased patch\nmonotonicity.\" To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Path Tracing (APT),\na framework that combines Statistical Matching to ensure patch distributions\nremain consistent in upsampled latents and Scale-aware Scheduling to deal with\nthe patch monotonicity. As a result, APT produces clearer and more refined\ndetails in high-resolution images. In addition, APT enables a shortcut\ndenoising process, resulting in faster sampling with minimal quality\ndegradation. Our experimental results confirm that APT produces more detailed\noutputs with improved inference speed, providing a practical approach to\nhigh-resolution image generation."}

While\nexplainable AI (XAI) has advanced in areas like feature attribution and model\ninterpretability, most methods still lack the structure and adaptability needed\nfor diverse health stakeholders, including clinicians, policymakers, and the\ngeneral public. We introduce PHAX-a Public Health Argumentation and\neXplainability framework-that leverages structured argumentation to generate\nhuman-centered explanations for AI outputs. PHAX is a multi-layer architecture\ncombining defeasible reasoning, adaptive natural language techniques, and user\nmodeling to produce context-aware, audience-specific justifications. More\nspecifically, we show how argumentation enhances explainability by supporting\nAI-driven decision-making, justifying recommendations, and enabling interactive\ndialogues across user types. We demonstrate the applicability of PHAX through\nuse cases such as medical term simplification, patient-clinician communication,\nand policy justification. In particular, we show how simplification decisions\ncan be modeled as argument chains and personalized based on user\nexpertise-enhancing both interpretability and trust.

Thus, we replicate and extend a previous NLP4RE study (baseline),\n\"Classifying User Requirements from Online Feedback in Small Dataset\nEnvironments using Deep Learning\", which evaluated different deep learning\nmodels for requirement classification from user reviews. We reproduced the\noriginal results using publicly released source code, thereby helping to\nstrengthen the external validity of the baseline study. We then extended the\nsetup by evaluating model performance on an external dataset and comparing\nresults to a GPT-4o zero-shot classifier. Furthermore, we prepared the\nreplication study ID-card for the baseline study, important for evaluating\nreplication readiness. Results showed diverse reproducibility levels across\ndifferent models, with Naive Bayes demonstrating perfect reproducibility. In\ncontrast, BERT and other models showed mixed results. Our findings revealed\nthat baseline deep learning models, BERT and ELMo, exhibited good\ngeneralization capabilities on an external dataset, and GPT-4o showed\nperformance comparable to traditional baseline machine learning models.\nAdditionally, our assessment confirmed the baseline study's replication\nreadiness; however missing environment setup files would have further enhanced\nreadiness. We include this missing information in our replication package and\nprovide the replication study ID-card for our study to further encourage and\nsupport the replication of our study."}

While\ntraining-based approaches address this limitation by training on\nhigh-resolution datasets, they require large amounts of data and considerable\ncomputational resources, making them less practical. Consequently,\ntraining-free methods, particularly patch-based approaches, have become a\npopular alternative. These methods divide an image into patches and fuse the\ndenoising paths of each patch, showing strong performance on high-resolution\ngeneration. However, we observe two critical issues for patch-based approaches,\nwhich we call ``patch-level distribution shift\" and ``increased patch\nmonotonicity.\" To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Path Tracing (APT),\na framework that combines Statistical Matching to ensure patch distributions\nremain consistent in upsampled latents and Scale-aware Scheduling to deal with\nthe patch monotonicity. As a result, APT produces clearer and more refined\ndetails in high-resolution images. In addition, APT enables a shortcut\ndenoising process, resulting in faster sampling with minimal quality\ndegradation. Our experimental results confirm that APT produces more detailed\noutputs with improved inference speed, providing a practical approach to\nhigh-resolution image generation."}

Despite rapid advancements, a\nsubstantial research gap remains in understanding the distinct roles of\ninternal components - knowledge that is essential for improving transparency\nand efficiency. Inspired by neuroscientific ablation studies, which investigate\nthe functions of brain regions through selective impairment, we systematically\nanalyze the impact of ablating key components in three state-of-the-art\ndetection transformer models: Detection transformer (DETR), deformable\ndetection transformer (DDETR), and DETR with improved denoising anchor boxes\n(DINO). The ablations target query embeddings, encoder and decoder multi-head\nself-attentions (MHSA) as well as decoder multi-head cross-attention (MHCA)\nlayers. We evaluate the effects of these ablations on the performance metrics\ngIoU and F1-score, quantifying effects on both the classification and\nregression sub-tasks on the COCO dataset. To facilitate reproducibility and\nfuture research, we publicly release the DeepDissect library. Our findings\nreveal model-specific resilience patterns: while DETR is particularly sensitive\nto ablations in encoder MHSA and decoder MHCA, DDETR's multi-scale deformable\nattention enhances robustness, and DINO exhibits the greatest resilience due to\nits look-forward twice update rule, which helps distributing knowledge across\nblocks. These insights also expose structural redundancies, particularly in\nDDETR's and DINO's decoder MHCA layers, highlighting opportunities for model\nsimplification without sacrificing performance. This study advances XAI for\nDETRs by clarifying the contributions of internal components to model\nperformance, offering insights to optimize and improve transparency and\nefficiency in critical applications."}

Among these applications, fundus image analysis\npresents special challenges, including small lesion areas in certain fundus\ndiseases and subtle inter-disease differences, which can lead to reduced\nprediction accuracy and overfitting in the models. To address these challenges,\nthis paper proposes the Transformer-based model SwinECAT, which combines the\nShifted Window (Swin) Attention with the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA)\nAttention. SwinECAT leverages the Swin Attention mechanism in the Swin\nTransformer backbone to effectively capture local spatial structures and\nlong-range dependencies within fundus images. The lightweight ECA mechanism is\nincorporated to guide the SwinECAT's attention toward critical feature\nchannels, enabling more discriminative feature representation. In contrast to\nprevious studies that typically classify fundus images into 4 to 6 categories,\nthis work expands fundus disease classification to 9 distinct types, thereby\nenhancing the granularity of diagnosis. We evaluate our method on the Eye\nDisease Image Dataset (EDID) containing 16,140 fundus images for 9-category\nclassification. Experimental results demonstrate that SwinECAT achieves 88.29\\%\naccuracy, with weighted F1-score of 0.88 and macro F1-score of 0.90.

Hence, it is important to understand the decision-making\nprocess of AI algorithms when they are applied in critical areas.
