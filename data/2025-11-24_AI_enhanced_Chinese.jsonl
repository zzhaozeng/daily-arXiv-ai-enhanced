However, existing vector database (VecDB) retrieval pipelines rely on flat or single-resolution indexing structures, which cannot adapt to the varying semantic granularity required by diverse user queries. This limitation leads to suboptimal trade-offs between retrieval speed and contextual relevance.\n  To address this, we propose \\textbf{Semantic Pyramid Indexing (SPI)}, a novel multi-resolution vector indexing framework that introduces query-adaptive resolution control for RAG in VecDBs. Unlike existing hierarchical methods that require offline tuning or separate model training, SPI constructs a semantic pyramid over document embeddings and dynamically selects the optimal resolution level per query through a lightweight classifier. This adaptive approach enables progressive retrieval from coarse-to-fine representations, significantly accelerating search while maintaining semantic coverage.\n  We implement SPI as a plugin for both FAISS and Qdrant backends and evaluate it across multiple RAG tasks including MS MARCO, Natural Questions, and multimodal retrieval benchmarks. SPI achieves up to \\textbf{5.7$\\times$} retrieval speedup and \\textbf{1.8$\\times$} memory efficiency gain while improving end-to-end QA F1 scores by up to \\textbf{2.5 points} compared to strong baselines. Our theoretical analysis provides guarantees on retrieval quality and latency bounds, while extensive ablation studies validate the contribution of each component. The framework's compatibility with existing VecDB infrastructures makes it readily deployable in production RAG systems.

While the growing availability of small open-source models and inference engines has lowered the entry barrier, users now face an overwhelming number of configuration choices. Identifying an optimal configuration -- balancing functional and non-functional requirements -- requires substantial manual effort. While several benchmarks target LLM inference, they are designed for narrow evaluation goals and not user-focused. They fail to integrate relevant system and task-specific metrics into a unified, easy-to-use benchmark that supports multiple inference engines, usage scenarios, and quantization levels. To address this gap, we present Bench360 -- Benchmarking Local LLM Inference from 360\u00b0. Bench360 allows users to easily define their own custom tasks along with datasets and relevant task-specific metrics and then automatically benchmarks selected LLMs, inference engines, and quantization levels across different usage scenarios (single stream, batch & server). Bench360 tracks a wide range of metrics, including (1) system metrics -- such as Computing Performance (e.g., latency, throughput), Resource Usage (e.g., energy per query), and Deployment (e.g., cold start time) -- and (2) task-specific metrics such as ROUGE, F1 score or accuracy. We demonstrate Bench360 on four common LLM tasks -- General Knowledge & Reasoning, QA, Summarization and Text-to-SQL -- across three hardware platforms and four state of the art inference engines. Our results reveal several interesting trade-offs between task performance and system-level efficiency, highlighting the differences in inference engines and models.

This neglect risks excluding millions of Tunisians from fully interacting with AI in their own language, pushing them toward French or English. Such a shift not only threatens the preservation of the Tunisian dialect but may also create challenges for literacy and influence younger generations to favor foreign languages. In this study, we introduce a novel dataset containing parallel Tunizi, standard Tunisian Arabic, and English translations, along with sentiment labels. We benchmark several popular LLMs on three tasks: transliteration, translation, and sentiment analysis.

To address this limitation, we propose EliDecide, a novel method that learns ellipsoid decision boundaries with varying scales along different feature directions. First, we employ supervised contrastive learning to obtain a discriminative feature space for known samples. Second, we apply learnable matrices to parameterize ellipsoids as the boundaries of each known class, offering greater flexibility than spherical boundaries defined solely by centers and radii. Third, we optimize the boundaries via a novelly designed dual loss function that balances empirical and open-space risks: expanding boundaries to cover known samples while contracting them against synthesized pseudo-open samples. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple text intent benchmarks and further on a question classification dataset.

With this setup, we compare a baseline prompt to one explicitly conditioned on values, and show that value steering is possible even without altering the model or dynamically optimising prompts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u8bc4\u4f30prompt\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u671d\u5411\u7279\u5b9a\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u9700\u8981\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u662f\u5e38\u89c1\u4f46\u9759\u6001\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u548c\u504f\u597d\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u6765\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u751f\u6210\u54cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u76ee\u6807\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u548c\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528Schwartz\u57fa\u672c\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u57fa\u7840prompt\u548c\u660e\u786e\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u7684prompt\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5373\u4f7f\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316prompt\uff0c\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u5f15\u5bfc\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u5f15\u5bfc\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316prompt\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u3002"}}

However, if a human-authored article is slightly polished by AI, a shift will occur in the borderline decision of these AI detection models, leading them to consider it AI-generated article. This misclassification may result in falsely accusing authors of AI plagiarism and harm the credibility of AI detector models. In English, some efforts were made to meet this challenge, but not in Arabic. In this paper, we generated two datasets. The first dataset contains 800 Arabic articles, half AI-generated and half human-authored. We used it to evaluate 14 Large Language models (LLMs) and commercial AI detectors to assess their ability in distinguishing between human-authored and AI-generated articles. The best 8 models were chosen to act as detectors for our primary concern, which is whether they would consider slightly polished human text as AI-generated. The second dataset, Ar-APT, contains 400 Arabic human-authored articles polished by 10 LLMs using 4 polishing settings, totaling 16400 samples. We use it to evaluate the 8 nominated models and determine whether slight polishing will affect their performance. The results reveal that all AI detectors incorrectly attribute a significant number of articles to AI. The best performing LLM, Claude-4 Sonnet, achieved 83.51%, their performance decreased to 57.63% for articles slightly polished by LLaMA-3. Whereas for the best performing commercial model, originality.AI, that achieves 92% accuracy, dropped to 12% for articles slightly polished by Mistral or Gemma-3.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86AI\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7ecf\u8fc7\u8f7b\u5faeAI\u6da6\u8272\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u64b0\u5199\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u6587\u7ae0\u65f6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u5c06\u7ecf\u8fc7\u8f7b\u5faeAI\u6da6\u8272\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u6587\u7ae0\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u4e3aAI\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bef\u5224\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u9886\u57df\u5c1a\u672a\u6709\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b800\u7bc7\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u6587\u672c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f3014\u4e2aLLMs\u548c\u5546\u7528AI\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2aAr-APT\u5305\u542b400\u7bc7\u4eba\u7c7b\u64b0\u5199\u6587\u7ae0\u7ecf\u8fc710\u4e2aLLMs\u548c4\u79cd\u6da6\u8272\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5904\u7406\uff08\u517116400\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f7b\u5fae\u6da6\u8272\u5bf9\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u90fd\u4f1a\u5c06\u5927\u91cf\u8f7b\u5fae\u6da6\u8272\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u6587\u7ae0\u8bef\u5224\u4e3aAI\u751f\u6210\u3002Claude-4 Sonnet\u5728\u7eaf\u51c0\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u738783.51%\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9LLaMA-3\u6da6\u8272\u6587\u672c\u964d\u81f357.63%\uff1boriginality.AI\u5728\u7eaf\u51c0\u6587\u672c\u4e0a92%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9Mistral\u6216Gemma-3\u6da6\u8272\u6587\u672c\u964d\u81f312%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f7b\u5faeAI\u6da6\u8272\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cdAI\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u8bef\u5224\u7387\uff0c\u8fd9\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

Using pretrained RoBERTa embeddings indexed with Faiss, we retrieve 20 neighbors per test input and apply one gradient update per neighbor across GPT-2 (117M, 774M), GPT-Neo (1.3B), and R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5-1.5B. Our experiments confirm that test-time training significantly reduces perplexity and bits-per-byte metrics across diverse domains from The Pile, with the largest improvements in structured or specialized datasets such as GitHub and EuroParl. We further validate that models not pretrained on The Pile benefit more from this adaptation than models already trained on similar data, allowing smaller models to approach the performance of larger ones. Due to infrastructure limitations, we introduce a memory-efficient retrieval implementation that loads only required line offsets rather than entire files, reducing RAM requirements from over 128 GB per server to 32 GB. We also extend the original study by evaluating R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5-1.5B, showing that test-time training yields consistent gains even for modern reasoning-optimized architectures.

We conduct a comprehensive probing study on six multilingual LLMs, covering all 268 transformer layers, using linear and nonlinear probes together with a new Token--Language Alignment analysis to quantify the layer-wise dynamics and geometric structure of language encoding. Our results show that language information becomes sharply separated in the first transformer block (+76.4$\\pm$8.2 percentage points from Layer 0 to 1) and remains almost fully linearly separable throughout model depth. We further find that the alignment between language directions and vocabulary embeddings is strongly tied to the language composition of the training data. Notably, Chinese-inclusive models achieve a ZH Match@Peak of 16.43\\%, whereas English-centric models achieve only 3.90\\%, revealing a 4.21$\\times$ structural imprinting effect. These findings indicate that multilingual LLMs distinguish languages not by surface script features but by latent representational structures shaped by the training corpus. Our analysis provides practical insights for data composition strategies and fairness in multilingual representation learning.

Knowledge retrieval in SNOMED CT is critical for its application, but often proves challenging due to language ambiguity, synonyms, polysemies and so on. This problem is exacerbated when the queries are out-of-vocabulary (OOV), i.e., having no equivalent matchings in the ontology. In this work, we focus on the problem of hierarchical concept retrieval from SNOMED CT with OOV queries, and propose an approach based on language model-based ontology embeddings. For evaluation, we construct OOV queries annotated against SNOMED CT concepts, testing the retrieval of the most direct subsumers and their less relevant ancestors. We find that our method outperforms the baselines including SBERT and two lexical matching methods.

Uncensored Dolphin matches safety-trained models, demonstrating empathy encoding emerges independent of safety training. Phi-3 probes correlate strongly with EIA behavioral scores (r=0.71, p<0.01). Cross-model probe agreement is limited (Qwen: r=-0.06, Dolphin: r=0.18), revealing architecture-specific implementations despite convergent detection.\n  Steering: Qwen achieves 65.3% success with bidirectional control and coherence at extreme interventions. Phi-3 shows 61.7% success with similar coherence. Dolphin exhibits asymmetric steerability: 94.4% success for pro-empathy steering but catastrophic breakdown for anti-empathy (empty outputs, code artifacts).\n  Implications: The detection-steering gap varies by model.

Human raters (N=255) and GPT4o evaluated the creativity of the resulting images. We found a clear creativity gradient, with Visual Artists being the most creative, followed by Non Artists, then Human Inspired generative AI, and finally Self Guided generative AI. Increased human guidance strongly improved GenAI's creative output, bringing its productions close to those of Non Artists. Notably, human and AI raters also showed vastly different creativity judgment patterns.

However, recent work by Kim et al. (2024) found that human ratings for agentivity and telicity were a poor predictor of the syntactic behavior of intransitives. Here we revisit this question using interpretable dimensions, computed from seed words on opposite poles of the agentive and telic scales.

Manually identifying and correcting errors among thousands of benchmark questions is not only infeasible but also a critical bottleneck for reliable evaluation. In this work, we introduce a framework for systematic benchmark revision that leverages statistical analysis of response patterns to flag potentially invalid questions for further expert review. Our approach builds on a core assumption commonly used in AI evaluations that the mean score sufficiently summarizes model performance. This implies a unidimensional latent construct underlying the measurement experiment, yielding expected ranges for various statistics for each item. When empirically estimated values for these statistics fall outside the expected range for an item, the item is more likely to be problematic.

This phenomenon results in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for policy gradients, significantly hindering algorithm convergence and performance improvement. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel Hybrid Differential Reward (HDR) mechanism. We first theoretically elucidate how the temporal quasi-steady nature of traffic states and the physical proximity of actions lead to the failure of traditional reward signals. Building on this analysis, the HDR framework innovatively integrates two complementary components: (1) a Temporal Difference Reward (TRD) based on a global potential function, which utilizes the evolutionary trend of potential energy to ensure optimal policy invariance and consistency with long-term objectives; and (2) an Action Gradient Reward (ARG), which directly measures the marginal utility of actions to provide a local guidance signal with a high SNR. Furthermore, we formulate the cooperative driving problem as a Multi-Agent Partially Observable Markov Game (POMDPG) with a time-varying agent set and provide a complete instantiation scheme for HDR within this framework. Extensive experiments conducted using both online planning (MCTS) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (QMIX, MAPPO, MADDPG) algorithms demonstrate that the HDR mechanism significantly improves convergence speed and policy stability. The results confirm that HDR guides agents to learn high-quality cooperative policies that effectively balance traffic efficiency and safety.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5dee\u5206\u5956\u52b1\uff08HDR\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u9891\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u591a\u8f66\u534f\u540c\u9a7e\u9a76\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f20\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u5956\u52b1\u5dee\u5f02\u6d88\u5931\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u9ad8\u9891\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u591a\u8f66\u534f\u540c\u9a7e\u9a76\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u5dee\u5f02\u6d88\u5931\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u4f4e\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "method": "HDR\u673a\u5236\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8e\u5168\u5c40\u52bf\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5dee\u5206\u5956\u52b1\uff08TRD\uff09\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u68af\u5ea6\u5956\u52b1\uff08ARG\uff09\u3002TRD\u5229\u7528\u52bf\u80fd\u6f14\u5316\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u548c\u4e0e\u957f\u671f\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1bARG\u76f4\u63a5\u6d4b\u91cf\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u8fb9\u9645\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5f15\u5bfc\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u5c06\u534f\u540c\u9a7e\u9a76\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u535a\u5f08\uff08POMDPG\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0HDR\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5728\u7ebf\u89c4\u5212\uff08MCTS\uff09\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08QMIX, MAPPO, MADDPG\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHDR\u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "HDR\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5f15\u5bfc\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u534f\u540c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4ea4\u901a\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

The recent work Soft Thinking has shown that LLMs' latent reasoning via soft concepts is a promising direction, but LLMs are trained on discrete tokens. To reduce this gap between the soft concepts in reasoning and the discrete tokens in training, we propose Soft Concept Mixing (SCM), a soft concept aware training scheme that directly exposes the model to soft representations during training. Specifically, SCM constructs a soft concept vector by forming a probability-weighted average of embeddings. Then, this vector is mixed into the model's hidden states, which embody rich contextual information. Finally, the entire latent reasoning process is optimized with Reinforcement Learning (RL).

Our method reduces the total number of forward passes by 18x and eliminates halting mechanisms, while maintaining quality comparable to standard TRMs. Notably, we achieve 24% accuracy on ARC-1 with only 0.8M parameters, outperforming most LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u9690\u5f0f\u7b56\u7565\u6539\u8fdb\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347Tiny Recursive Models\uff08TRMs\uff09\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u51cf\u5c1118\u500d\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u6b21\u6570\u548c\u6d88\u9664\u505c\u6b62\u673a\u5236\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u7ef4\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728ARC-1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8624%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u6539\u52a8\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347TRMs\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5c06TRMs\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u89c6\u4e3a\u65e0\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u9690\u5f0f\u7b56\u7565\u6539\u8fdb\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u6b21\u5faa\u73af\u63d0\u4f9b\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8618\u500d\u7684\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u505c\u6b62\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728ARC-1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8624%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5927\u591a\u6570LLMs\u3002"}}

With growing controversial topics, it is desirable to summarize not only diverse arguments, but also their rationale and justification. Early studies on text summarization focus on capturing general salient information in source documents, overlooking the argumentative nature of online conversations. Recent research on conversation summarization although considers the argumentative relationship among sentences, fail to explicate deeper argument structure within sentences for summarization. In this paper, we propose a novel task of argument-aware quantitative summarization to reveal the claim-reason structure of arguments in conversations, with quantities measuring argument strength. We further propose ARQUSUMM, a novel framework to address the task. To reveal the underlying argument structure within sentences, ARQUSUMM leverages LLM few-shot learning grounded in the argumentation theory to identify propositions within sentences and their claim-reason relationships. For quantitative summarization, ARQUSUMM employs argument structure-aware clustering algorithms to aggregate arguments and quantify their support.

To clarify this structure, we reinterpret the role of diffusion in inverse problem solving as an initialization stage within an expectation--maximization (EM)--style framework, where the diffusion stage and the data-driven refinement are fully decoupled. We introduce \\textbf{DAPS++}, which allows the likelihood term to guide inference more directly while maintaining numerical stability and providing insight into why unified diffusion trajectories remain effective in practice.

Using Hunan's modern historical celebrities shaped by Huxiang culture as a case study, pre-trained large models can help researchers efficiently extract key information, including biographical attributes, life events, and social relationships, from textual sources and construct structured knowledge graphs. However, systematic data resources for Hunan's historical celebrities remain limited, and general-purpose models often underperform in domain knowledge extraction and structured output generation in such low-resource settings. To address these issues, this study proposes a supervised fine-tuning approach for enhancing domain-specific information extraction. First, we design a fine-grained, schema-guided instruction template tailored to the Hunan historical celebrities domain and build an instruction-tuning dataset to mitigate the lack of domain-specific training corpora. Second, we apply parameter-efficient instruction fine-tuning to four publicly available large language models - Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen3-8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct - and develop evaluation criteria for assessing their extraction performance.

Yet, despite increasing demand for transparency and interpretability, the field has yet to develop a widely accepted solution for interpretable automated scoring to be used in large-scale real-world assessments. This work takes a principled approach to address this challenge. We analyze the needs and potential benefits of interpretable automated scoring for various assessment stakeholders and develop four principles of interpretability -- Faithfulness, Groundedness, Traceability, and Interchangeability (FGTI) -- targeted at those needs. To illustrate the feasibility of implementing these principles, we develop the AnalyticScore framework for short answer scoring as a baseline reference framework for future research. AnalyticScore operates by (1) extracting explicitly identifiable elements of the responses, (2) featurizing each response into human-interpretable values using LLMs, and (3) applying an intuitive ordinal logistic regression model for scoring. In terms of scoring accuracy, AnalyticScore outperforms many uninterpretable scoring methods, and is within only 0.06 QWK of the uninterpretable SOTA on average across 10 items from the ASAP-SAS dataset. By comparing against human annotators conducting the same featurization task, we further demonstrate that the featurization behavior of AnalyticScore aligns well with that of humans.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6AnalyticScore\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u53d6\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u3001\u4f7f\u7528LLMs\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u5316\u3001\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u6709\u5e8f\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u900f\u660e\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5bf9\u900f\u660e\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u5206\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u539f\u5219\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5404\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86Faithfulness, Groundedness, Traceability, \u548c Interchangeability (FGTI)\u56db\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u539f\u5219\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86AnalyticScore\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u53d6\u54cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u5143\u7d20\u3001\u4f7f\u7528LLMs\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u5316\u3001\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u6709\u5e8f\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "result": "AnalyticScore\u5728\u8bc4\u5206\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u8bb8\u591a\u4e0d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728ASAP-SAS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u768410\u4e2a\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ec5\u6bd4\u4e0d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f4e0.06 QWK\u3002\u7279\u5f81\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "AnalyticScore\u6846\u67b6\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u53c2\u8003\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u900f\u660e\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

While intrinsic reward methods have demonstrated effectiveness in single-agent rein-forcement learning scenarios, their application to multi-agent reinforcement learn-ing (MARL) remains problematic. The primary difficulties stem from two fac-tors: (1) the exponential sparsity of joint action trajectories that lead to rewards as the exploration space expands, and (2) existing methods often fail to account for joint actions that can influence team states. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Mutual Intrinsic Reward (MIR), a simple yet effective enhancement strategy for MARL with extremely sparse rewards like episodic rewards. MIR incentivizes individual agents to explore actions that affect their teammates, and when combined with original strategies, effectively stimulates team exploration and improves algorithm performance. For comprehensive experimental valida-tion, we extend the representative single-agent MiniGrid environment to create MiniGrid-MA, a series of MARL environments with sparse rewards.

We introduce MUCH, the first claim-level UQ benchmark designed for fair and reproducible evaluation of future methods under realistic conditions. It includes 4,873 samples across four European languages (English, French, Spanish, and German) and four instruction-tuned open-weight LLMs. Unlike prior claim-level benchmarks, we release 24 generation logits per token, facilitating the development of future white-box methods without re-generating data. Moreover, in contrast to previous benchmarks that rely on manual or LLM-based segmentation, we propose a new deterministic algorithm capable of segmenting claims using as little as 0.2% of the LLM generation time. This makes our segmentation approach suitable for real-time monitoring of LLM outputs, ensuring that MUCH evaluates UQ methods under realistic deployment constraints.

With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), there is increasing interest in harnessing their capabilities for this purpose. However, most of the LLMs are inherently causal and optimized for next-token prediction, making them suboptimal for producing holistic representations. To address this, recent studies introduced pretext tasks to adapt LLMs for text representation. Most of these tasks, however, rely on token-level prediction objectives, such as the masked next-token prediction (MNTP) used in LLM2Vec. In this work, we explore the untapped potential of context compression as a pretext task for unsupervised adaptation of LLMs. During compression pre-training, the model learns to generate compact memory tokens, which substitute the whole context for downstream sequence prediction. Experiments demonstrate that a well-designed compression objective can significantly enhance LLM-based text representations, outperforming models trained with token-level pretext tasks. Further improvements through contrastive learning produce a strong representation model (LLM2Comp) that outperforms contemporary LLM-based text encoders on a wide range of tasks while being more sample-efficient, requiring significantly less training data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u538b\u7f29\u4f5c\u4e3aLLMs\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u9884\u6587\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u591a\u6570LLMs\u662f\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bcd\u9884\u6d4b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u751f\u6210\u6574\u4f53\u8868\u793a\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\u6765\u6539\u8fdbLLM\u7684\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u538b\u7f29\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u751f\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u4ee5\u66ff\u4ee3\u6574\u4e2a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0b\u6e38\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6765\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u76ee\u6807\u8bad\u7ec3\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bcd\u5143\u7ea7\u9884\u6587\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6539\u8fdb\u7684LLM2Comp\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u4ee3LLM\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u538b\u7f29\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9884\u6587\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347LLM\u7684\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5f15\u5165\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u4e14\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3002"}}

However, natural examples of many behaviours are rare, forcing researchers to rely on synthetic or off-policy LLM responses for training probes. We systematically evaluate how the use of synthetic and off-policy data influences probe generalisation across eight distinct LLM behaviours. Testing linear and attention probes across multiple LLMs, we find that the response generation strategy can significantly affect probe performance, though the magnitude of this effect varies by behaviour. We find that successful generalisation from off-policy data, to test sets where the model is incentivised to produce the target behaviour, is predictive of successful on-policy generalisation. Leveraging this result, we predict that Deception and Sandbagging probes may fail to generalise from off-policy to on-policy data when used in real monitoring scenarios. Notably, shifts in the training data domain still cause even larger performance degradation, with different-domain test scores being consistently lower than the same-domain ones. These results indicate that, in the absence of on-policy data, using same-domain off-policy data yields more reliable probes than using on-policy data from a different domain, emphasizing the need for methods that can better handle distribution shifts in LLM monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548c\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a2\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u6570\u636e\u57df\u5bf9\u63a2\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u6d4b\u662f\u76d1\u63a7\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u81ea\u7136\u884c\u4e3a\u6837\u672c\u7a00\u5c11\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u5408\u6210\u6216\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a2\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u591a\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a2\u6d4b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u548c\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u516b\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u884c\u4e3a\u63a2\u6d4b\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u63a2\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u4ece\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u5230\u6fc0\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u751f\u76ee\u6807\u884c\u4e3a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u7684\u6210\u529f\u6cdb\u5316\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u5230\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u6210\u529f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u540c\u57df\u7684\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u6bd4\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u57df\u7684\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5904\u7406\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing generic CP approaches need to transmit large volumes of perception data that are irrelevant to the driving safety, exceeding available communication bandwidth. Moreover, most CP frameworks rely on pre-defined communication partners, making them unsuitable for dynamic traffic environments. This paper proposes a Spontaneous Risk-Aware Selective Cooperative Perception (SRA-CP) framework to address these challenges. SRA-CP introduces a decentralized protocol where connected agents continuously broadcast lightweight perception coverage summaries and initiate targeted cooperation only when risk-relevant blind zones are detected. A perceptual risk identification module enables each CV to locally assess the impact of occlusions on its driving task and determine whether cooperation is necessary. When CP is triggered, the ego vehicle selects appropriate peers based on shared perception coverage and engages in selective information exchange through a fusion module that prioritizes safety-critical content and adapts to bandwidth constraints.

Abstention, where the model chooses not to answer and instead outputs phrases such as \"I don't know\", is a common safeguard. However, existing abstention methods typically rely on post-generation signals, such as generation variations or feedback, which limits their ability to prevent unreliable responses in advance. In this paper, we introduce Aspect-Based Causal Abstention (ABCA), a new framework that enables early abstention by analysing the internal diversity of LLM knowledge through causal inference. This diversity reflects the multifaceted nature of parametric knowledge acquired from various sources, representing diverse aspects such as disciplines, legal contexts, or temporal frames. ABCA estimates causal effects conditioned on these aspects to assess the reliability of knowledge relevant to a given query. Based on these estimates, we enable two types of abstention: Type-1, where aspect effects are inconsistent (knowledge conflict), and Type-2, where aspect effects consistently support abstention (knowledge insufficiency). Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that ABCA improves abstention reliability, achieves state-of-the-art performance, and enhances the interpretability of abstention decisions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aABCA\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u5206\u6790\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e9\u671f\u907f\u514d\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u5e38\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7545\u4f46\u4e0d\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5373\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u907f\u514d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u540e\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u63d0\u524d\u9632\u6b62\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Aspect-Based Causal Abstention (ABCA)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u5206\u6790LLM\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f30\u8ba1\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4f30\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e24\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u907f\u514d\uff1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cABCA\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u907f\u514d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u907f\u514d\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ABCA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u907f\u514d\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u907f\u514d\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Traditional methods typically rely on statistical features like term frequencies or TF-IDF values, which are effective at capturing word-level importance but often fail to reflect contextual meaning. In contrast, modern deep learning approaches utilize semantic features to understand word usage within context, yet they may overlook simple, high-impact statistical indicators. This paper introduces an Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (AGFF) model that combines statistical and semantic features in a unified framework. The model applies an attention-based mechanism to dynamically determine the relative importance of each feature type, enabling more informed classification decisions. Through evaluation on benchmark news datasets, the AGFF model demonstrates superior performance compared to both traditional statistical models and purely semantic deep learning models. The results confirm that strategic integration of diverse feature types can significantly enhance classification accuracy. Additionally, ablation studies validate the contribution of each component in the fusion process. The findings highlight the model's ability to balance and exploit the complementary strengths of statistical and semantic representations, making it a practical and effective solution for real-world news classification tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\uff08AGFF\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65b0\u95fb\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u786e\u5b9a\u5404\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u8bcd\u7ea7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u4ee3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7406\u89e3\u8bed\u4e49\u5374\u53ef\u80fd\u5ffd\u89c6\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u7edf\u8ba1\u6307\u6807\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u79cd\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u65b0\u95fb\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\uff08AGFF\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u7ed3\u5408\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u786e\u5b9a\u6bcf\u79cd\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u65b0\u95fb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cAGFF\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7eaf\u8bed\u4e49\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u878d\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u7279\u5f81\u7c7b\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u5e73\u8861\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u65b0\u95fb\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Extensive experiments over diverse model architectures and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art approaches.

PARROT (i) isolates causal effects by comparing the neutral version of the same question with an authoritatively false version using a double-blind evaluation, (ii) quantifies confidence shifts toward the correct and imposed false responses using log-likelihood-based calibration tracking, and (iii) systematically classifies failure modes (e.g., robust correct, sycophantic agreement, reinforced error, stubborn error, self-correction, etc.) using an eight-state behavioral taxonomy. We evaluated 22 models using 1,302 MMLU-style multiple-choice questions across 13 domains and domain-specific authority templates. Findings show marked heterogeneity: advanced models (e.g., GPT-5, GPT-4.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5) exhibit low \"follow rates\" ($\\leq 11\\%$, GPT-5: 4\\%) and minimal accuracy loss, while older/smaller models show severe epistemic collapse (GPT-4: 80\\%, Qwen 2.5-1.5B: 94\\%). The danger is not limited to response changes; weak models reduce confidence in the correct response while increasing confidence in the imposed incorrect response. While international law and global knowledge at the domain level exhibit high fragility, elementary mathematics is relatively resilient.

We used the generalized additive model to decompose a given observed pitch contour into a set of component pitch contours that are tied to different control variables and semantic predictors. Even when variables such as word duration, gender, speaker identity, tonal context, vowel height, and utterance position are controlled for, the effect of word remains a strong predictor of tonal realization. We present evidence that this effect of word is a semantic effect: word sense is shown to be a better predictor than word, and heterographic homophones are shown to have different pitch contours. The strongest evidence for the importance of semantics is that the pitch contours of individual word tokens can be predicted from their contextualized embeddings with an accuracy that substantially exceeds a permutation baseline. For phonetics, distributional semantics is a new kid on the block.

However, we find that the options may leak exploitable signals, which makes the accuracy metrics unreliable for indicating real capabilities and encourages explicit or implicit answer guessing behaviors during RFT. We propose ReVeL (Rewrite and Verify by LLM), a framework that rewrites multiple-choice questions into open-form questions while keeping answers verifiable whenever possible. The framework categorizes questions according to different answer types, apply different rewriting and verification schemes, respectively. When applied for RFT, we converted 20k MCQA examples and use GRPO to finetune Qwen2.5-VL models. Models trained on ReVeL-OpenQA match MCQA accuracy on multiple-choice benchmarks and improve OpenQA accuracy by about six percentage points, indicating better data efficiency and more robust reward signals than MCQA-based training. When used for evaluation, ReVeL also reveals up to 20 percentage points of score inflation in MCQA benchmarks (relative to OpenQA), improves judging accuracy, and reduces both cost and latency. We will release code and data publicly.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u591a\u9009\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6ReVeL\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u9009\u9898\u683c\u5f0f\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u4ee3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u7b54\u6848\u6cc4\u9732\u548c\u9f13\u52b1\u731c\u6d4b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6307\u6807\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faReVeL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u591a\u9009\u9898\u6539\u5199\u4e3a\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u4e0d\u540c\u7b54\u6848\u7c7b\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u91cd\u5199\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528ReVeL-OpenQA\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u9898\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5339\u914d\u4e86MCQA\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7ea66\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "ReVeL\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u63ed\u793a\u4e86MCQA\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u5206\u6570\u81a8\u80c0\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5224\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002"}}

However, for a large portion of mathematical corpora, especially theorem proving, RLVR's scalability is limited: intermediate reasoning is crucial, while final answers are difficult to directly and reliably verify. Meanwhile, token-level SFT often degenerates into rote memorization rather than inducing longer chains of thought. Inspired by BERT's self-supervised tasks, we propose MR-RLVR (Masked-and-Reordered RLVR), which constructs process-level self-supervised rewards via \"masked-then-fill\" and \"step reordering\" to extract learnable signals from intermediate reasoning. Our training pipeline comprises two stages: we first perform self-supervised training on sampled mathematical calculation and proof data; we then conduct RLVR fine-tuning on mathematical calculation datasets where only outcomes are verifiable. We implement MR-RLVR on Qwen2.5-3B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, and evaluate on AIME24, AIME25, AMC23, and MATH500. Under a fixed sampling and decoding budget, MR-RLVR achieves average relative gains over the original RLVR of +9.86% Pass@1, +5.27% Pass@5, and +4.00% Pass@8.
