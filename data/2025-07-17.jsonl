While recent efforts have explored adapting large language\nmodels (LLMs) for time-series forecasting, LLMs primarily capture\none-dimensional sequential dependencies and struggle to model the richer\nspatio-temporal (ST) correlations essential for accurate ST forecasting. In\nthis paper, we present \\textbf{ST-VFM}, a novel framework that systematically\nreprograms Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for general-purpose spatio-temporal\nforecasting. While VFMs offer powerful spatial priors, two key challenges arise\nwhen applying them to ST tasks: (1) the lack of inherent temporal modeling\ncapacity and (2) the modality gap between visual and ST data. To address these,\nST-VFM adopts a \\emph{dual-branch architecture} that integrates raw ST inputs\nwith auxiliary ST flow inputs, where the flow encodes lightweight temporal\ndifference signals interpretable as dynamic spatial cues. To effectively\nprocess these dual-branch inputs, ST-VFM introduces two dedicated reprogramming\nstages.

Uni-paired modal decoder\nreconstructs modal representation based on uni-modal and paired-modal features.\nPgM offers three key benefits: 1) thorough learning of uni-modal and\npaired-modal features, 2) flexible distribution adjustment for uni-modal and\npaired-modal representations to suit diverse downstream tasks, and 3) different\nlearning rates across modalities and partitions. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of PgM across four multimodal tasks and further\nhighlight its transferability to existing models. Additionally, we visualize\nthe distribution of uni-modal and paired-modal features across modalities and\ntasks, offering insights into their respective contributions."}

There exists a harmfulness direction that is\ndistinct from the refusal direction. As causal evidence, steering along the\nharmfulness direction can lead LLMs to interpret harmless instructions as\nharmful, but steering along the refusal direction tends to elicit refusal\nresponses directly without reversing the model's judgment on harmfulness.\nFurthermore, using our identified harmfulness concept, we find that certain\njailbreak methods work by reducing the refusal signals without reversing the\nmodel's internal belief of harmfulness.

While recent efforts have explored adapting large language\nmodels (LLMs) for time-series forecasting, LLMs primarily capture\none-dimensional sequential dependencies and struggle to model the richer\nspatio-temporal (ST) correlations essential for accurate ST forecasting. In\nthis paper, we present \\textbf{ST-VFM}, a novel framework that systematically\nreprograms Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for general-purpose spatio-temporal\nforecasting. While VFMs offer powerful spatial priors, two key challenges arise\nwhen applying them to ST tasks: (1) the lack of inherent temporal modeling\ncapacity and (2) the modality gap between visual and ST data. To address these,\nST-VFM adopts a \\emph{dual-branch architecture} that integrates raw ST inputs\nwith auxiliary ST flow inputs, where the flow encodes lightweight temporal\ndifference signals interpretable as dynamic spatial cues. To effectively\nprocess these dual-branch inputs, ST-VFM introduces two dedicated reprogramming\nstages.

To overcome this limitation, we present a more\neffective paradigm for unsupervised part discovery, named Masked Part\nAutoencoder (MPAE). It first learns part descriptors as well as a feature map\nfrom the inputs and produces patch features from a masked version of the\noriginal images. Then, the masked regions are filled with the learned part\ndescriptors based on the similarity between the local features and descriptors.\nBy restoring these masked patches using the part descriptors, they become\nbetter aligned with their part shapes, guided by appearance features from\nunmasked patches.

While recent vision-language approaches have introduced\nsemantic textual descriptions to guide expression recognition, existing methods\nstill face two key limitations: they often underutilize the subtle emotional\ncues embedded in generated text, and they have yet to incorporate sufficiently\neffective mechanisms for filtering out facial dynamics that are irrelevant to\nemotional expression. To address these gaps, We propose GRACE, Granular\nRepresentation Alignment for Cross-modal Emotion recognition that integrates\ndynamic motion modeling, semantic text refinement, and token-level cross-modal\nalignment to facilitate the precise localization of emotionally salient\nspatiotemporal features. Our method constructs emotion-aware textual\ndescriptions via a Coarse-to-fine Affective Text Enhancement (CATE) module and\nhighlights expression-relevant facial motion through a motion-difference\nweighting mechanism. These refined semantic and visual signals are aligned at\nthe token level using entropy-regularized optimal transport.

However, the attention\nmechanism in ViTs makes each layer function as a low-pass filter, and the\nstacked-layer architecture in existing transformers suffers from frequency\nvanishing. This leads to the loss of critical details and textures. We propose\na novel, circuit-theory-inspired strategy called Frequency-Dynamic Attention\nModulation (FDAM), which can be easily plugged into ViTs. FDAM directly\nmodulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two\ntechniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling\n(FreqScale). Since circuit theory uses low-pass filters as fundamental\nelements, we introduce AttInv, a method that generates complementary high-pass\nfiltering by inverting the low-pass filter in the attention matrix, and\ndynamically combining the two. We further design FreqScale to weight different\nfrequency components for fine-grained adjustments to the target response\nfunction. Through feature similarity analysis and effective rank evaluation, we\ndemonstrate that our approach avoids representation collapse, leading to\nconsistent performance improvements across various models, including SegFormer,\nDeiT, and MaskDINO.

These\nsteps are then integrated with the original input prompt (problem statement or\ncode) and provided as input to the LLMs to generate the final output. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that the CoDes approach significantly surpasses the\nstandard prompting strategy across various metrics on both datasets. This\nmethod not only improves the quality of VHDL code generation and summarization\nbut also serves as a framework for future research aimed at enhancing code LLMs\nfor VHDL."}

To mitigate the above issues, this paper\nproposes a wavelet-based low-light stereo image enhancement method with feature\nspace decoupling. Our insight comes from the following findings: (1) Wavelet\ntransform enables the independent processing of low-frequency and\nhigh-frequency information. (2) Illumination adjustment can be achieved by\nadjusting the low-frequency component of a low-light image, extracted through\nmulti-level wavelet decomposition.

Despite its\nsignificance, this task remains largely unexplored. Most previous works have\nprimarily focused on mapping modalities like speech, audio, and music to\ngenerate human motion. As of yet, these models typically overlook the impact of\nspatial features encoded in spatial audio signals on human motion. To bridge\nthis gap and enable high-quality modeling of human movements in response to\nspatial audio, we introduce the first comprehensive Spatial Audio-Driven Human\nMotion (SAM) dataset, which contains diverse and high-quality spatial audio and\nmotion data. For benchmarking, we develop a simple yet effective\ndiffusion-based generative framework for human MOtion generation driven by\nSPatial Audio, termed MOSPA, which faithfully captures the relationship between\nbody motion and spatial audio through an effective fusion mechanism. Once\ntrained, MOSPA could generate diverse realistic human motions conditioned on\nvarying spatial audio inputs.

While meshes offer high precision, their\ndense vertex data complicates editing; NeRFs deliver excellent rendering but\nsuffer from structural ambiguity, hindering animation and manipulation; all\nrepresentations inherently struggle with the trade-off between data complexity\nand fidelity. To overcome these issues, we introduce a novel 3D Hierarchical\nProxy Node representation. Its core innovation lies in representing an object's\nshape and texture via a sparse set of hierarchically organized\n(tree-structured) proxy nodes distributed on its surface and interior. Each\nnode stores local shape and texture information (implicitly encoded by a small\nMLP) within its neighborhood. Querying any 3D coordinate's properties involves\nefficient neural interpolation and lightweight decoding from relevant nearby\nand parent nodes. This framework yields a highly compact representation where\nnodes align with local semantics, enabling direct drag-and-edit manipulation,\nand offers scalable quality-complexity control. Extensive experiments across 3D\nreconstruction and editing demonstrate our method's expressive efficiency,\nhigh-fidelity rendering quality, and superior editability."}
