### [1] [Learning to Borrow Features for Improved Detection of Small Objects in Single-Shot Detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00044)
*Richard Schmit*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新框架，通过从同类大对象中“借用”特征来增强小物体检测能力，显著提升了小物体检测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单次检测器中因空间分辨率和语义丰富度之间的权衡导致的小物体检测难题。

Method: 引入三个关键模块：特征匹配块（FMB）、特征表示块（FRB）和特征融合块（FFB），通过加权聚合和特征融合增强浅层特征。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了小物体检测的准确性，同时保持了实时检测性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂视觉环境中的鲁棒物体检测提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Detecting small objects remains a significant challenge in single-shot object
detectors due to the inherent trade-off between spatial resolution and semantic
richness in convolutional feature maps. To address this issue, we propose a
novel framework that enables small object representations to "borrow"
discriminative features from larger, semantically richer instances within the
same class. Our architecture introduces three key components: the Feature
Matching Block (FMB) to identify semantically similar descriptors across
layers, the Feature Representing Block (FRB) to generate enhanced shallow
features through weighted aggregation, and the Feature Fusion Block (FFB) to
refine feature maps by integrating original, borrowed, and context information.
Built upon the SSD framework, our method improves the descriptive capacity of
shallow layers while maintaining real-time detection performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach significantly boosts small object
detection accuracy over baseline methods, offering a promising direction for
robust object detection in complex visual environments.

Method: 通过结构化消融研究，开发了一个全面的提示工程框架，系统变化领域特异性、解剖精度、指令框架和输出约束。

Result: CONCH模型在精确解剖参考下表现最佳，解剖上下文对性能至关重要，模型复杂性并非性能保证。

Conclusion: 提示工程在计算病理学中具有重要作用，适当设计的提示能显著提升视觉语言模型的诊断准确性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have gained significant attention in
computational pathology due to their multimodal learning capabilities that
enhance big-data analytics of giga-pixel whole slide image (WSI). However,
their sensitivity to large-scale clinical data, task formulations, and prompt
design remains an open question, particularly in terms of diagnostic accuracy.
In this paper, we present a systematic investigation and analysis of three
state of the art VLMs for histopathology, namely Quilt-Net, Quilt-LLAVA, and
CONCH, on an in-house digestive pathology dataset comprising 3,507 WSIs, each
in giga-pixel form, across distinct tissue types. Through a structured ablative
study on cancer invasiveness and dysplasia status, we develop a comprehensive
prompt engineering framework that systematically varies domain specificity,
anatomical precision, instructional framing, and output constraints. Our
findings demonstrate that prompt engineering significantly impacts model
performance, with the CONCH model achieving the highest accuracy when provided
with precise anatomical references. Additionally, we identify the critical
importance of anatomical context in histopathological image analysis, as
performance consistently degraded when reducing anatomical precision. We also
show that model complexity alone does not guarantee superior performance, as
effective domain alignment and domain-specific training are critical. These
results establish foundational guidelines for prompt engineering in
computational pathology and highlight the potential of VLMs to enhance
diagnostic accuracy when properly instructed with domain-appropriate prompts.

### [3] [Eye2Eye: A Simple Approach for Monocular-to-Stereo Video Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00135)
*Michal Geyer,Omer Tov,Linyi Jin,Richard Tucker,Inbar Mosseri,Tali Dekel,Noah Snavely*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种将文本到视频生成器转换为视频到立体视频生成器的简单方法，直接合成新视角，避免传统多阶段方法的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 立体3D视频生成因数据稀缺而具有挑战性，传统方法在复杂场景（如镜面或透明物体）中表现不佳。

Method: 利用预训练视频模型的先验知识，直接合成新视角，无需中间步骤（如深度估计或修复）。

Result: 在复杂真实场景中展示了优势，支持多种物体材质和组合。

Conclusion: 该方法通过直接合成新视角，克服了传统方法的限制，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: The rising popularity of immersive visual experiences has increased interest
in stereoscopic 3D video generation. Despite significant advances in video
synthesis, creating 3D videos remains challenging due to the relative scarcity
of 3D video data. We propose a simple approach for transforming a text-to-video
generator into a video-to-stereo generator. Given an input video, our framework
automatically produces the video frames from a shifted viewpoint, enabling a
compelling 3D effect. Prior and concurrent approaches for this task typically
operate in multiple phases, first estimating video disparity or depth, then
warping the video accordingly to produce a second view, and finally inpainting
the disoccluded regions. This approach inherently fails when the scene involves
specular surfaces or transparent objects. In such cases, single-layer disparity
estimation is insufficient, resulting in artifacts and incorrect pixel shifts
during warping. Our work bypasses these restrictions by directly synthesizing
the new viewpoint, avoiding any intermediate steps. This is achieved by
leveraging a pre-trained video model's priors on geometry, object materials,
optics, and semantics, without relying on external geometry models or manually
disentangling geometry from the synthesis process. We demonstrate the
advantages of our approach in complex, real-world scenarios featuring diverse
object materials and compositions. See videos on

### [4] [Detecting and Mitigating Hateful Content in Multimodal Memes with Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00150)
*Minh-Hao Van,Xintao Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于视觉语言模型（VLMs）的方法，用于检测和转化仇恨性多模态模因，包括定义引导的提示技术和UnHateMeme框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体中仇恨性模因的滥用问题日益严重，现有研究多集中于检测，而转化仇恨内容的方法仍具挑战性。

Method: 采用定义引导的提示技术检测仇恨模因，并提出UnHateMeme框架，通过替换文本或视觉组件转化仇恨内容。

Result: VLMs在检测任务中表现优异，UnHateMeme框架能有效将仇恨模因转化为非仇恨形式，并保持多模态一致性。

Conclusion: VLMs在确保网络环境安全方面具有重要应用潜力，本文为相关研究提供了实用方法和分析。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of social media has provided enhanced communication
channels for individuals to create online content, enabling them to express
their thoughts and opinions. Multimodal memes, often utilized for playful or
humorous expressions with visual and textual elements, are sometimes misused to
disseminate hate speech against individuals or groups. While the detection of
hateful memes is well-researched, developing effective methods to transform
hateful content in memes remains a significant challenge. Leveraging the
powerful generation and reasoning capabilities of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), we address the tasks of detecting and mitigating hateful content. This
paper presents two key contributions: first, a definition-guided prompting
technique for detecting hateful memes, and second, a unified framework for
mitigating hateful content in memes, named UnHateMeme, which works by replacing
hateful textual and/or visual components. With our definition-guided prompts,
VLMs achieve impressive performance on hateful memes detection task.
Furthermore, our UnHateMeme framework, integrated with VLMs, demonstrates a
strong capability to convert hateful memes into non-hateful forms that meet
human-level criteria for hate speech and maintain multimodal coherence between
image and text. Through empirical experiments, we show the effectiveness of
state-of-the-art pretrained VLMs such as LLaVA, Gemini and GPT-4o on the
proposed tasks, providing a comprehensive analysis of their respective
strengths and limitations for these tasks. This paper aims to shed light on
important applications of VLMs for ensuring safe and respectful online
environments.

### [5] [V3LMA: Visual 3D-enhanced Language Model for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00156)
*Jannik Lübberstedt,Esteban Rivera,Nico Uhlemann,Markus Lienkamp*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: V3LMA通过结合LLMs和LVLMs提升3D场景理解能力，无需微调即可显著提升自动驾驶中的动态环境理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LVLMs在自动驾驶中对3D环境的理解有限，影响安全性。

Method: 整合LLMs与LVLMs，利用文本描述和3D对象数据预处理增强场景理解。

Result: 在LingoQA基准测试中得分0.56，提升复杂交通场景的决策能力。

Conclusion: V3LMA通过融合策略和3D数据预处理，推动自动驾驶系统的安全性提升。

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong capabilities in
understanding and analyzing visual scenes across various domains. However, in
the context of autonomous driving, their limited comprehension of 3D
environments restricts their effectiveness in achieving a complete and safe
understanding of dynamic surroundings. To address this, we introduce V3LMA, a
novel approach that enhances 3D scene understanding by integrating Large
Language Models (LLMs) with LVLMs. V3LMA leverages textual descriptions
generated from object detections and video inputs, significantly boosting
performance without requiring fine-tuning. Through a dedicated preprocessing
pipeline that extracts 3D object data, our method improves situational
awareness and decision-making in complex traffic scenarios, achieving a score
of 0.56 on the LingoQA benchmark. We further explore different fusion
strategies and token combinations with the goal of advancing the interpretation
of traffic scenes, ultimately enabling safer autonomous driving systems.

*Kelsey Allen,Carl Doersch,Guangyao Zhou,Mohammed Suhail,Danny Driess,Ignacio Rocco,Yulia Rubanova,Thomas Kipf,Mehdi S. M. Sajjadi,Kevin Murphy,Joao Carreira,Sjoerd van Steenkiste*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于点轨迹自动编码的新方法，用于更好地衡量生成视频中物体的交互和运动质量，解决了现有评估方法（如FVD）在捕捉运动问题上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成模型在生成逼真帧方面表现良好，但在运动质量上存在问题，而现有评估方法（如FVD）未能有效捕捉这一问题。

Method: 通过自动编码点轨迹提取运动特征，用于比较视频分布或评估单个视频的运动质量。

Result: 新方法对合成数据中的时间扭曲更敏感，能更好地预测人类对生成视频时间一致性和真实性的评价，并能定位生成视频中的不一致性。

Conclusion: 基于点轨迹的方法提供了更敏感和可解释的视频生成评估，优于现有方法。

Abstract: A current limitation of video generative video models is that they generate
plausible looking frames, but poor motion -- an issue that is not well captured
by FVD and other popular methods for evaluating generated videos. Here we go
beyond FVD by developing a metric which better measures plausible object
interactions and motion. Our novel approach is based on auto-encoding point
tracks and yields motion features that can be used to not only compare
distributions of videos (as few as one generated and one ground truth, or as
many as two datasets), but also for evaluating motion of single videos. We show
that using point tracks instead of pixel reconstruction or action recognition
features results in a metric which is markedly more sensitive to temporal
distortions in synthetic data, and can predict human evaluations of temporal
consistency and realism in generated videos obtained from open-source models
better than a wide range of alternatives. We also show that by using a point
track representation, we can spatiotemporally localize generative video
inconsistencies, providing extra interpretability of generated video errors
relative to prior work. An overview of the results and link to the code can be
found on the project page: http://trajan-paper.github.io.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Saltelli扩展Sobol方法的敏感性分析框架，用于量化前向模型超参数对GS-PINN性能的影响，并提出了复合评估指标以统一CGH配置的基准测试标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机生成全息术（CGH）在多个领域有广泛应用，但其核心问题是从强度测量中反演相位。虽然GS-PINNs在相位反演方面表现优异，但其性能受前向模型及其超参数的限制，影响了泛化能力和硬件优化。

Method: 采用Saltelli扩展的Sobol方法进行敏感性分析，量化前向模型超参数对GS-PINN性能的影响，并引入复合评估指标。

Result: 分析表明，SLM像素分辨率是影响神经网络敏感性的主要因素，其次是像素间距、传播距离和波长。自由空间传播前向模型表现优于傅里叶全息。

Conclusion: 研究为前向模型选择、神经网络架构和性能评估提供了具体指导，推动了稳健、可解释和泛化的神经网络在CGH中的应用。

Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) enables applications in holographic
augmented reality (AR), 3D displays, systems neuroscience, and optical
trapping. The fundamental challenge in CGH is solving the inverse problem of
phase retrieval from intensity measurements. Physics-inspired neural networks
(PINNs), especially Gerchberg-Saxton-based PINNs (GS-PINNs), have advanced
phase retrieval capabilities. However, their performance strongly depends on
forward models (FMs) and their hyperparameters (FMHs), limiting generalization,
complicating benchmarking, and hindering hardware optimization. We present a
systematic sensitivity analysis framework based on Saltelli's extension of
Sobol's method to quantify FMH impacts on GS-PINN performance. Our analysis
demonstrates that SLM pixel-resolution is the primary factor affecting neural
network sensitivity, followed by pixel-pitch, propagation distance, and
wavelength. Free space propagation forward models demonstrate superior neural
network performance compared to Fourier holography, providing enhanced
parameterization and generalization. We introduce a composite evaluation metric
combining performance consistency, generalization capability, and
hyperparameter perturbation resilience, establishing a unified benchmarking
standard across CGH configurations. Our research connects physics-inspired deep
learning theory with practical CGH implementations through concrete guidelines
for forward model selection, neural network architecture, and performance
evaluation. Our contributions advance the development of robust, interpretable,
and generalizable neural networks for diverse holographic applications,
supporting evidence-based decisions in CGH research and implementation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AVA是一种基于视频语言模型（VLM）的系统，通过事件知识图谱（EKG）和检索生成机制，解决了超长视频内容处理的挑战，并在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频分析系统局限于预定义任务，无法适应开放场景；VLM虽有潜力，但受限于上下文窗口，难以处理超长视频。

Method: AVA引入事件知识图谱（EKG）实时构建和代理检索生成机制，以高效处理复杂查询。

Result: 在LVBench、VideoMME-Long和AVA-100基准测试中，AVA分别达到62.3%、64.1%和75.8%的准确率，显著优于现有系统。

Conclusion: AVA通过创新方法解决了超长视频分析的挑战，展现了在开放场景中的强大潜力。

Abstract: AI-driven video analytics has become increasingly pivotal across diverse
domains. However, existing systems are often constrained to specific,
predefined tasks, limiting their adaptability in open-ended analytical
scenarios. The recent emergence of Video-Language Models (VLMs) as
transformative technologies offers significant potential for enabling
open-ended video understanding, reasoning, and analytics. Nevertheless, their
limited context windows present challenges when processing ultra-long video
content, which is prevalent in real-world applications. To address this, we
introduce AVA, a VLM-powered system designed for open-ended, advanced video
analytics. AVA incorporates two key innovations: (1) the near real-time
construction of Event Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) for efficient indexing of long or
continuous video streams, and (2) an agentic retrieval-generation mechanism
that leverages EKGs to handle complex and diverse queries. Comprehensive
evaluations on public benchmarks, LVBench and VideoMME-Long, demonstrate that
AVA achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 62.3% and 64.1% accuracy,
respectively, significantly surpassing existing VLM and video
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Furthermore, to evaluate video
analytics in ultra-long and open-world video scenarios, we introduce a new
benchmark, AVA-100. This benchmark comprises 8 videos, each exceeding 10 hours
in duration, along with 120 manually annotated, diverse, and complex
question-answer pairs. On AVA-100, AVA achieves top-tier performance with an
accuracy of 75.8%.

*Changjun Li,Runqing Jiang,Zhuo Song,Pengpeng Yu,Ye Zhang,Yulan Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Pack-PTQ的新型后训练量化方法，通过自适应分组和混合精度量化，解决了现有方法忽略跨块依赖性和低比特精度下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后训练量化方法采用块级重建，忽略了跨块依赖性，导致低比特情况下精度显著下降。

Method: 设计了Hessian引导的自适应分组机制，将块划分为非重叠组作为重建基础单元，并提出混合精度量化方法，根据组的敏感性分配不同比特宽度。

Result: 在2D图像和3D点云分类任务中，使用多种网络架构的实验表明，该方法优于现有后训练量化方法。

Conclusion: Pack-PTQ通过保留跨块依赖性和自适应量化，显著提升了低比特量化性能。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has evolved as a prominent solution for
compressing complex models, which advocates a small calibration dataset and
avoids end-to-end retraining. However, most existing PTQ methods employ
block-wise reconstruction, which neglects cross-block dependency and exhibits a
notable accuracy drop in low-bit cases. To address these limitations, this
paper presents a novel PTQ method, dubbed Pack-PTQ. First, we design a
Hessian-guided adaptive packing mechanism to partition blocks into
non-overlapping packs, which serve as the base unit for reconstruction, thereby
preserving the cross-block dependency and enabling accurate quantization
parameters estimation. Second, based on the pack configuration, we propose a
mixed-precision quantization approach to assign varied bit-widths to packs
according to their distinct sensitivities, thereby further enhancing
performance. Extensive experiments on 2D image and 3D point cloud
classification tasks, using various network architectures, demonstrate the
superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art PTQ methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdCare-VLM是一种基于视频-LLaVA的多模态视觉语言模型，用于通过患者视频进行药物依从性的视觉问答（VQA）。该方法在结核病药物监测视频数据集上表现优异，性能超越现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 慢性疾病患者药物依从性不足导致疾病恶化，亟需通过技术手段（如视频分析）提升监测效果。

Method: 使用806个结核病药物监测视频的私有数据集，通过视觉特征（如患者面部、药物、饮水等）与医学概念的关联，优化多模态交互。

Result: 实验表明，AdCare-VLM在多种配置下性能优于现有模型，绝对提升3.1%至3.54%。

Conclusion: AdCare-VLM通过视觉-语言对齐提升了药物依从性监测的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Chronic diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, asthma, HIV-AIDS,
epilepsy, and tuberculosis, necessitate rigorous adherence to medication to
avert disease progression, manage symptoms, and decrease mortality rates.
Adherence is frequently undermined by factors including patient behavior,
caregiver support, elevated medical costs, and insufficient healthcare
infrastructure. We propose AdCare-VLM, a specialized Video-LLaVA-based
multimodal large vision language model (LVLM) aimed at visual question
answering (VQA) concerning medication adherence through patient videos. We
employ a private dataset comprising 806 custom-annotated tuberculosis (TB)
medication monitoring videos, which have been labeled by clinical experts, to
fine-tune the model for adherence pattern detection. We present LLM-TB-VQA, a
detailed medical adherence VQA dataset that encompasses positive, negative, and
ambiguous adherence cases. Our method identifies correlations between visual
features, such as the clear visibility of the patient's face, medication, water
intake, and the act of ingestion, and their associated medical concepts in
captions. This facilitates the integration of aligned visual-linguistic
representations and improves multimodal interactions. Experimental results
indicate that our method surpasses parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
enabled VLM models, such as LLaVA-V1.5 and Chat-UniVi, with absolute
improvements ranging from 3.1% to 3.54% across pre-trained, regular, and
low-rank adaptation (LoRA) configurations. Comprehensive ablation studies and
attention map visualizations substantiate our approach, enhancing
interpretability.

*Xinlong Zhao,Shan Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为FGSTP的算法，用于高效准确地检测和分割气体泄漏，通过捕捉帧间运动信息并结合精细化的物体特征，实现了优于现有技术的分割效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气体泄漏对人类健康和环境构成重大风险，但由于其隐蔽性和随机形状，现有方法难以高效准确地检测和分割。

Method: FGSTP算法通过构建相关性体积捕捉帧间运动信息，逐步精细化物体特征，并使用解码器优化边界分割。

Result: 在自建数据集GasVid上的实验表明，FGSTP在分割非刚性物体（如气体泄漏）时表现优异，生成的掩码最准确。

Conclusion: FGSTP算法在气体泄漏分割任务中表现出色，为相关领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Gas leaks pose significant risks to human health and the environment. Despite
long-standing concerns, there are limited methods that can efficiently and
accurately detect and segment leaks due to their concealed appearance and
random shapes. In this paper, we propose a Fine-grained Spatial-Temporal
Perception (FGSTP) algorithm for gas leak segmentation. FGSTP captures critical
motion clues across frames and integrates them with refined object features in
an end-to-end network. Specifically, we first construct a correlation volume to
capture motion information between consecutive frames. Then, the fine-grained
perception progressively refines the object-level features using previous
outputs. Finally, a decoder is employed to optimize boundary segmentation.
Because there is no highly precise labeled dataset for gas leak segmentation,
we manually label a gas leak video dataset, GasVid. Experimental results on
GasVid demonstrate that our model excels in segmenting non-rigid objects such
as gas leaks, generating the most accurate mask compared to other
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的质量评估方法，用于放疗中自动生成轮廓的评估，通过贝叶斯序数分类和校准不确定性阈值，减少对人工标注的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线自适应放疗（OART）中，自动生成轮廓的质量评估需要高效且可靠的方法，以减少人工标注的工作量并提高临床决策的准确性。

Method: 开发了贝叶斯序数分类模型，结合校准的不确定性阈值，验证了三种数据场景（无标注、有限标注和充足标注），并采用几何替代标签、迁移学习和直接监督等方法。

Result: 模型在所有场景下表现稳健，仅需30个手动标签即可达到90%以上的测试准确率，校准后93%的轮廓质量预测准确率超过98%，显著减少人工审核需求。

Conclusion: 该质量评估模型提高了OART中轮廓生成的效率，通过不确定性量化确保了放疗工作流程的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Purpose: This study presents a Deep Learning (DL)-based quality assessment
(QA) approach for evaluating auto-generated contours (auto-contours) in
radiotherapy, with emphasis on Online Adaptive Radiotherapy (OART). Leveraging
Bayesian Ordinal Classification (BOC) and calibrated uncertainty thresholds,
the method enables confident QA predictions without relying on ground truth
contours or extensive manual labeling. Methods: We developed a BOC model to
classify auto-contour quality and quantify prediction uncertainty. A
calibration step was used to optimize uncertainty thresholds that meet clinical
accuracy needs. The method was validated under three data scenarios: no manual
labels, limited labels, and extensive labels. For rectum contours in prostate
cancer, we applied geometric surrogate labels when manual labels were absent,
transfer learning when limited, and direct supervision when ample labels were
available. Results: The BOC model delivered robust performance across all
scenarios. Fine-tuning with just 30 manual labels and calibrating with 34
subjects yielded over 90% accuracy on test data. Using the calibrated
threshold, over 93% of the auto-contours' qualities were accurately predicted
in over 98% of cases, reducing unnecessary manual reviews and highlighting
cases needing correction. Conclusion: The proposed QA model enhances contouring
efficiency in OART by reducing manual workload and enabling fast, informed
clinical decisions. Through uncertainty quantification, it ensures safer, more
reliable radiotherapy workflows.

detection accuracy, challenges remain in achieving consistent performance
across diverse datasets and manipulation types. In response, we propose a novel
two-tier ensemble framework for deepfake detection based on deep learning that
hierarchically combines multiple instances of three state-of-the-art
architectures: Xception, Res2Net101, and EfficientNet-B7. Our framework employs
a unique approach where each architecture is instantiated three times with
different initializations to enhance model diversity, followed by a learnable
weighting mechanism that dynamically combines their predictions. Unlike
traditional fixed-weight ensembles, our first-tier averages predictions within
each architecture family to reduce model variance, while the second tier learns
optimal contribution weights through backpropagation, automatically adjusting
each architecture's influence based on their detection reliability. Our
experiments achieved state-of-the-art intra-dataset performance with AUC scores
of 99.22% (FF++) and 100.00% (CelebDF-v2), and F1 scores of 98.06% (FF++) and
99.94% (CelebDF-v2) without augmentation. With augmentation, we achieve AUC
scores of 99.47% (FF++) and 100.00% (CelebDF-v2), and F1 scores of 98.43%
(FF++) and 99.95% (CelebDF-v2). The framework demonstrates robust cross-dataset
generalization, achieving AUC scores of 88.20% and 72.52%, and F1 scores of
93.16% and 80.62% in cross-dataset evaluations.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ResQu的新型超分辨率框架，结合四元数小波预处理与潜在扩散模型，通过动态整合小波嵌入提升重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度学习在超分辨率任务中取得进展，但在高放大倍数下保持细节和纹理的真实性仍具挑战性。现有扩散模型方法难以平衡感知质量与结构保真度。

Method: ResQu框架整合四元数小波预处理与潜在扩散模型，引入新的小波和时间感知编码器，动态嵌入小波信息于去噪过程，并利用Stable Diffusion等基础模型的生成先验。

Result: 在领域特定数据集上的实验表明，ResQu在感知质量和标准评估指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ResQu通过创新的四元数小波嵌入和动态整合机制，显著提升了超分辨率任务的重建质量。

Abstract: Image Super-Resolution is a fundamental problem in computer vision with broad
applications spacing from medical imaging to satellite analysis. The ability to
reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs is crucial for
enhancing downstream tasks such as object detection and segmentation. While
deep learning has significantly advanced SR, achieving high-quality
reconstructions with fine-grained details and realistic textures remains
challenging, particularly at high upscaling factors. Recent approaches
leveraging diffusion models have demonstrated promising results, yet they often
struggle to balance perceptual quality with structural fidelity. In this work,
we introduce ResQu a novel SR framework that integrates a quaternion wavelet
preprocessing framework with latent diffusion models, incorporating a new
quaternion wavelet- and time-aware encoder. Unlike prior methods that simply
apply wavelet transforms within diffusion models, our approach enhances the
conditioning process by exploiting quaternion wavelet embeddings, which are
dynamically integrated at different stages of denoising. Furthermore, we also
leverage the generative priors of foundation models such as Stable Diffusion.
Extensive experiments on domain-specific datasets demonstrate that our method
achieves outstanding SR results, outperforming in many cases existing
approaches in perceptual quality and standard evaluation metrics. The code will
be available after the revision process.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NVTM提出了一种新型视频表示框架，通过分解时空数据为2D网格和流信息，显著提升了训练速度和参数效率，并在多项任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网格型参数编码方法在视频应用中存在参数冗余和低效问题，需要一种能高效捕捉视频动态特性的新方法。

Method: 将时空3D视频数据分解为带有流信息的2D网格，实现快速学习和高效参数利用。

Result: NVTM在编码速度上比NeRV快3倍，PSNR/LPIPS指标显著提升，并在压缩任务中媲美H.264和HEVC标准。

Conclusion: NVTM是一种高效且多功能的视频表示框架，适用于多种视频处理任务。

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INR) has found successful applications
across diverse domains. To employ INR in real-life, it is important to speed up
training. In the field of INR for video applications, the state-of-the-art
approach employs grid-type parametric encoding and successfully achieves a
faster encoding speed in comparison to its predecessors. However, the grid
usage, which does not consider the video's dynamic nature, leads to redundant
use of trainable parameters. As a result, it has significantly lower parameter
efficiency and higher bitrate compared to NeRV-style methods that do not use a
parametric encoding. To address the problem, we propose Neural Video
representation with Temporally coherent Modulation (NVTM), a novel framework
that can capture dynamic characteristics of video. By decomposing the
spatio-temporal 3D video data into a set of 2D grids with flow information,
NVTM enables learning video representation rapidly and uses parameter
efficiently. Our framework enables to process temporally corresponding pixels
at once, resulting in the fastest encoding speed for a reasonable video
quality, especially when compared to the NeRV-style method, with a speed
increase of over 3 times. Also, it remarks an average of 1.54dB/0.019
improvements in PSNR/LPIPS on UVG (Dynamic) (even with 10% fewer parameters)
and an average of 1.84dB/0.013 improvements in PSNR/LPIPS on MCL-JCV (Dynamic),
compared to previous grid-type works. By expanding this to compression tasks,
we demonstrate comparable performance to video compression standards (H.264,
HEVC) and recent INR approaches for video compression. Additionally, we perform
extensive experiments demonstrating the superior performance of our algorithm
across diverse tasks, encompassing super resolution, frame interpolation and
video inpainting. Project page is https://sujiikim.github.io/NVTM/.

TL;DR: SPPIN挑战赛旨在推动神经母细胞瘤MRI自动分割技术的发展，最佳团队使用预训练网络STU-Net，但小肿瘤分割仍需改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经母细胞瘤手术规划依赖耗时且依赖用户的MRI 3D模型，需开发全自动分割方法。

Method: 组织SPPIN挑战赛，使用多模态MRI数据，基于Dice分数、HD95和VS评估团队表现。

Result: 最佳团队Dice分数0.82，HD95 7.69 mm，VS 0.91，但小肿瘤分割效果不足。

Conclusion: 预训练网络在小数据集有效，但需更可靠方法支持临床手术规划。

Abstract: Surgery plays an important role within the treatment for neuroblastoma, a
common pediatric cancer. This requires careful planning, often via magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI)-based anatomical 3D models. However, creating these
models is often time-consuming and user dependent. We organized the Surgical
Planning in Pediatric Neuroblastoma (SPPIN) challenge, to stimulate
developments on this topic, and set a benchmark for fully automatic
segmentation of neuroblastoma on multi-model MRI. The challenge started with a
training phase, where teams received 78 sets of MRI scans from 34 patients,
consisting of both diagnostic and post-chemotherapy MRI scans. The final test
phase, consisting of 18 MRI sets from 9 patients, determined the ranking of the
teams. Ranking was based on the Dice similarity coefficient (Dice score), the
95th percentile of the Hausdorff distance (HD95) and the volumetric similarity
(VS). The SPPIN challenge was hosted at MICCAI 2023. The final leaderboard
consisted of 9 teams. The highest-ranking team achieved a median Dice score
0.82, a median HD95 of 7.69 mm and a VS of 0.91, utilizing a large, pretrained
network called STU-Net. A significant difference for the segmentation results
between diagnostic and post-chemotherapy MRI scans was observed (Dice = 0.89 vs
Dice = 0.59, P = 0.01) for the highest-ranking team. SPPIN is the first medical
segmentation challenge in extracranial pediatric oncology. The highest-ranking
team used a large pre-trained network, suggesting that pretraining can be of
use in small, heterogenous datasets. Although the results of the
highest-ranking team were high for most patients, segmentation especially in
small, pre-treated tumors were insufficient. Therefore, more reliable
segmentation methods are needed to create clinically applicable models to aid
surgical planning in pediatric neuroblastoma.

TL;DR: Cues3D提出了一种基于NeRF的紧凑方法，用于开放词汇3D全景分割，通过隐式3D场实现全局一致性，无需显式跨视图监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖高保真3D点云或跨视图关联预处理，而Cues3D旨在仅通过NeRF实现全局一致性。

Method: 采用三阶段训练框架（初始化-消歧-细化），结合实例消歧方法匹配NeRF渲染的3D掩码。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，优于2D图像方法，并与最新2D-3D融合方法竞争，甚至在使用额外3D点云时超越它们。

Conclusion: Cues3D证明了仅依赖NeRF即可实现高效且一致的3D实例分割，为开放词汇3D分割提供了新思路。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D panoptic segmentation has recently emerged as a
significant trend. Top-performing methods currently integrate 2D segmentation
with geometry-aware 3D primitives. However, the advantage would be lost without
high-fidelity 3D point clouds, such as methods based on Neural Radiance Field
(NeRF). These methods are limited by the insufficient capacity to maintain
consistency across partial observations. To address this, recent works have
utilized contrastive loss or cross-view association pre-processing for view
consensus. In contrast to them, we present Cues3D, a compact approach that
relies solely on NeRF instead of pre-associations. The core idea is that NeRF's
implicit 3D field inherently establishes a globally consistent geometry,
enabling effective object distinction without explicit cross-view supervision.
We propose a three-phase training framework for NeRF,
initialization-disambiguation-refinement, whereby the instance IDs are
corrected using the initially-learned knowledge. Additionally, an instance
disambiguation method is proposed to match NeRF-rendered 3D masks and ensure
globally unique 3D instance identities. With the aid of Cues3D, we obtain
highly consistent and unique 3D instance ID for each object across views with a
balanced version of NeRF. Our experiments are conducted on ScanNet v2,
ScanNet200, ScanNet++, and Replica datasets for 3D instance, panoptic, and
semantic segmentation tasks. Cues3D outperforms other 2D image-based methods
and competes with the latest 2D-3D merging based methods, while even surpassing
them when using additional 3D point clouds. The code link could be found in the
appendix and will be released on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨光谱人脸识别系统在复杂操作条件下具有优势，但其对呈现攻击的鲁棒性尚未被系统研究。

Method: 通过全面评估NIR-VIS跨光谱人脸识别系统对呈现攻击的脆弱性。

Result: 实证结果表明，系统虽有一定可靠性，但对特定攻击仍存在脆弱性。

Conclusion: 需进一步研究以提高跨光谱人脸识别系统对呈现攻击的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Cross-spectral face recognition systems are designed to enhance the
performance of facial recognition systems by enabling cross-modal matching
under challenging operational conditions. A particularly relevant application
is the matching of near-infrared (NIR) images to visible-spectrum (VIS) images,
enabling the verification of individuals by comparing NIR facial captures
acquired with VIS reference images. The use of NIR imaging offers several
advantages, including greater robustness to illumination variations, better
visibility through glasses and glare, and greater resistance to presentation
attacks. Despite these claimed benefits, the robustness of NIR-based systems
against presentation attacks has not been systematically studied in the
literature. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation into the
vulnerability of NIR-VIS cross-spectral face recognition systems to
presentation attacks. Our empirical findings indicate that, although these
systems exhibit a certain degree of reliability, they remain vulnerable to
specific attacks, emphasizing the need for further research in this area.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有显著性检测方法在真实场景中因运动模糊和遮挡表现不佳，而脉冲相机的高时间分辨率虽能提升显著性检测，但其固有噪声会导致检测偏差。

Method: 提出SOTA框架，结合Spike-based Micro-debias (SM)和Spike-based Global-debias (SG)，分别处理帧间细微变化和全局不一致性。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上的实验表明，SOTA能有效消除复合噪声偏差，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SOTA通过脉冲相机和去偏技术显著提升了显著性检测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Existing saliency detection methods struggle in real-world scenarios due to
motion blur and occlusions. In contrast, spike cameras, with their high
temporal resolution, significantly enhance visual saliency maps. However, the
composite noise inherent to spike camera imaging introduces discontinuities in
saliency detection. Low-quality samples further distort model predictions,
leading to saliency bias. To address these challenges, we propose
Spike-navigated Optimal TrAnsport Saliency Region Detection (SOTA), a framework
that leverages the strengths of spike cameras while mitigating biases in both
spatial and temporal dimensions. Our method introduces Spike-based Micro-debias
(SM) to capture subtle frame-to-frame variations and preserve critical details,
even under minimal scene or lighting changes. Additionally, Spike-based
Global-debias (SG) refines predictions by reducing inconsistencies across
diverse conditions. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets
demonstrate that SOTA outperforms existing methods by eliminating composite
noise bias. Our code and dataset will be released at

Abstract: High-quality, animatable 3D human avatar reconstruction from monocular videos
offers significant potential for reducing reliance on complex hardware, making
it highly practical for applications in game development, augmented reality,
and social media. However, existing methods still face substantial challenges
in capturing fine geometric details and maintaining animation stability,
particularly under dynamic or complex poses. To address these issues, we
propose a novel real-time framework for animatable human avatar reconstruction
based on 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS). By leveraging 2DGS and global SMPL pose
parameters, our framework not only aligns positional and rotational
discrepancies but also enables robust and natural pose-driven animation of the
reconstructed avatars. Furthermore, we introduce a Rotation Compensation
Network (RCN) that learns rotation residuals by integrating local geometric
features with global pose parameters. This network significantly improves the
handling of non-rigid deformations and ensures smooth, artifact-free pose
transitions during animation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
successfully reconstructs realistic and highly animatable human avatars from
monocular videos, effectively preserving fine-grained details while ensuring
stable and natural pose variation. Our approach surpasses current
state-of-the-art methods in both reconstruction quality and animation
robustness on public benchmarks.

Result: 实验表明该方法有效，甚至超越监督学习方法。

Conclusion: 提出的零样本方法在3D零件组装中具有高效性和鲁棒性，适合大规模应用。

Abstract: 3D part assembly aims to understand part relationships and predict their
6-DoF poses to construct realistic 3D shapes, addressing the growing demand for
autonomous assembly, which is crucial for robots. Existing methods mainly
estimate the transformation of each part by training neural networks under
supervision, which requires a substantial quantity of manually labeled data.
However, the high cost of data collection and the immense variability of
real-world shapes and parts make traditional methods impractical for
large-scale applications. In this paper, we propose first a zero-shot part
assembly method that utilizes pre-trained point cloud diffusion models as
discriminators in the assembly process, guiding the manipulation of parts to
form realistic shapes. Specifically, we theoretically demonstrate that
utilizing a diffusion model for zero-shot part assembly can be transformed into
an Iterative Closest Point (ICP) process. Then, we propose a novel pushing-away
strategy to address the overlap parts, thereby further enhancing the robustness
of the method. To verify our work, we conduct extensive experiments and
quantitative comparisons to several strong baseline methods, demonstrating the
effectiveness of the proposed approach, which even surpasses the supervised
learning method. The code has been released on

Abstract: We present JointDiT, a diffusion transformer that models the joint
distribution of RGB and depth. By leveraging the architectural benefit and
outstanding image prior of the state-of-the-art diffusion transformer, JointDiT
not only generates high-fidelity images but also produces geometrically
plausible and accurate depth maps. This solid joint distribution modeling is
achieved through two simple yet effective techniques that we propose, i.e.,
adaptive scheduling weights, which depend on the noise levels of each modality,
and the unbalanced timestep sampling strategy. With these techniques, we train
our model across all noise levels for each modality, enabling JointDiT to
naturally handle various combinatorial generation tasks, including joint
generation, depth estimation, and depth-conditioned image generation by simply
controlling the timestep of each branch. JointDiT demonstrates outstanding
joint generation performance. Furthermore, it achieves comparable results in
depth estimation and depth-conditioned image generation, suggesting that joint
distribution modeling can serve as a replaceable alternative to conditional

Result: KeySync在唇重建和交叉同步中取得最先进效果，视觉质量提升，表情泄漏减少。

Conclusion: KeySync通过掩码策略和两阶段设计有效解决了唇同步的关键问题，实验验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Lip synchronization, known as the task of aligning lip movements in an
existing video with new input audio, is typically framed as a simpler variant
of audio-driven facial animation. However, as well as suffering from the usual
issues in talking head generation (e.g., temporal consistency), lip
synchronization presents significant new challenges such as expression leakage
from the input video and facial occlusions, which can severely impact
real-world applications like automated dubbing, but are often neglected in
existing works. To address these shortcomings, we present KeySync, a two-stage
framework that succeeds in solving the issue of temporal consistency, while
also incorporating solutions for leakage and occlusions using a carefully
designed masking strategy. We show that KeySync achieves state-of-the-art
results in lip reconstruction and cross-synchronization, improving visual
quality and reducing expression leakage according to LipLeak, our novel leakage
metric. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our new masking
approach in handling occlusions and validate our architectural choices through
several ablation studies. Code and model weights can be found at

Conclusion: HATIE为文本引导图像编辑任务提供了可靠且自动化的评估标准。

Abstract: A variety of text-guided image editing models have been proposed recently.
However, there is no widely-accepted standard evaluation method mainly due to
the subjective nature of the task, letting researchers rely on manual user
study. To address this, we introduce a novel Human-Aligned benchmark for
Text-guided Image Editing (HATIE). Providing a large-scale benchmark set
covering a wide range of editing tasks, it allows reliable evaluation, not
limited to specific easy-to-evaluate cases. Also, HATIE provides a
fully-automated and omnidirectional evaluation pipeline. Particularly, we
combine multiple scores measuring various aspects of editing so as to align
with human perception. We empirically verify that the evaluation of HATIE is
indeed human-aligned in various aspects, and provide benchmark results on
several state-of-the-art models to provide deeper insights on their
performance.

Result: 在KITTI数据集上，HeAL性能与全监督基线相当，仅需24%的样本。

Conclusion: HeAL通过启发式特征显著提升主动学习效率，为3D目标检测提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: Active Learning has proved to be a relevant approach to perform sample
selection for training models for Autonomous Driving. Particularly, previous
works on active learning for 3D object detection have shown that selection of
samples in uncontrolled scenarios is challenging. Furthermore, current
approaches focus exclusively on the theoretical aspects of the sample selection
problem but neglect the practical insights that can be obtained from the
extensive literature and application of 3D detection models. In this paper, we
introduce HeAL (Heuristical-enhanced Active Learning for 3D Object Detection)
which integrates those heuristical features together with Localization and
Classification to deliver the most contributing samples to the model's
training. In contrast to previous works, our approach integrates heuristical
features such as object distance and point-quantity to estimate the
uncertainty, which enhance the usefulness of selected samples to train
detection models. Our quantitative evaluation on KITTI shows that HeAL presents
competitive mAP with respect to the State-of-the-Art, and achieves the same mAP
as the full-supervised baseline with only 24% of the samples.

Conclusion: 不一致性样本选择策略在LiDAR数据标注中具有潜力，可显著减少标注成本。

Abstract: Deep learning models for object detection in autonomous driving have recently
achieved impressive performance gains and are already being deployed in
vehicles worldwide. However, current models require increasingly large datasets
for training. Acquiring and labeling such data is costly, necessitating the
development of new strategies to optimize this process. Active learning is a
promising approach that has been extensively researched in the image domain. In
our work, we extend this concept to the LiDAR domain by developing several
inconsistency-based sample selection strategies and evaluate their
effectiveness in various settings. Our results show that using a naive
inconsistency approach based on the number of detected boxes, we achieve the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交叉口是道路网络的关键点，但现有检测器要么忽略车载语义信息，要么依赖稀缺的人工标注数据。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 方法包括：(i) 在鸟瞰图中融合语义道路分割与车辆定位检测候选交叉口，(ii) 通过最小二乘法分析分支拓扑优化候选。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI数据集上测试，平均定位误差1.9米，精度89%，召回率77%（5米容忍度），优于最新学习基线。

Conclusion: 该方法对分割误差具有鲁棒性，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: Intersections are geometric and functional key points in every road network.
They offer strong landmarks to correct GNSS dropouts and anchor new sensor data
in up-to-date maps. Despite that importance, intersection detectors either
ignore the rich semantic information already computed onboard or depend on
scarce, hand-labeled intersection datasets. To close that gap, this paper
presents a LiDAR-based method for intersection detection that (i) fuses
semantic road segmentation with vehicle localization to detect intersection
candidates in a bird's eye view (BEV) representation and (ii) refines those
candidates by analyzing branch topology with a least squares formulation. To
evaluate our method, we introduce an automated benchmarking pipeline that pairs
detections with OpenStreetMap (OSM) intersection nodes using precise GNSS/INS
ground-truth poses. Tested on eight SemanticKITTI sequences, the approach
achieves a mean localization error of 1.9 m, 89% precision, and 77% recall at a
5 m tolerance, outperforming the latest learning-based baseline. Moreover, the
method is robust to segmentation errors higher than those of the benchmark
model, demonstrating its applicability in the real world.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的多目标多摄像头跟踪框架，用于解决城市交通场景中的车辆跟踪问题，表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着网络摄像头的增加，手动跟踪和匹配多摄像头中的车辆面临多样性、遮挡、光照变化等挑战。

Method: 使用Mask R-CNN进行目标检测，结合NMS和迁移学习进行重识别，利用ResNet-152和Deep SORT进行特征提取和跟踪。

Result: 在AI City Challenge数据集上，IDF1得分为0.8289，精确率和召回率分别为0.9026和0.8527。

Conclusion: 该框架在复杂城市交通场景中实现了高效、准确的车辆跟踪。

Abstract: Vision sensors are becoming more important in Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS) for traffic monitoring, management, and optimization as the
number of network cameras continues to rise. However, manual object tracking
and matching across multiple non-overlapping cameras pose significant
challenges in city-scale urban traffic scenarios. These challenges include
handling diverse vehicle attributes, occlusions, illumination variations,
shadows, and varying video resolutions. To address these issues, we propose an
efficient and cost-effective deep learning-based framework for Multi-Object
Multi-Camera Tracking (MO-MCT). The proposed framework utilizes Mask R-CNN for
object detection and employs Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to select target
objects from overlapping detections. Transfer learning is employed for
re-identification, enabling the association and generation of vehicle tracklets
across multiple cameras. Moreover, we leverage appropriate loss functions and
distance measures to handle occlusion, illumination, and shadow challenges. The
final solution identification module performs feature extraction using
ResNet-152 coupled with Deep SORT based vehicle tracking. The proposed
framework is evaluated on the 5th AI City Challenge dataset (Track 3),
comprising 46 camera feeds. Among these 46 camera streams, 40 are used for
model training and validation, while the remaining six are utilized for model
testing. The proposed framework achieves competitive performance with an IDF1
score of 0.8289, and precision and recall scores of 0.9026 and 0.8527
respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness in robust and accurate vehicle
tracking.

Motivation: 解决X射线安全成像中遮挡和隐藏物体检测的挑战，探索CNN与Transformer混合架构的潜力。

Method: 评估了多种混合CNN-Transformer架构（如Next-ViT-S与YOLOv8或RT-DETR检测头结合），并与CNN基线（YOLOv8）在三个数据集（EDS、HiXray、PIDray）上对比。

Result: 混合架构在数据分布变化（EDS数据集）时表现更鲁棒，而YOLOv8在HiXray和PIDray上更优。

Conclusion: 混合CNN-Transformer架构在特定场景下具有优势，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: In the field of X-ray security applications, even the smallest details can
significantly impact outcomes. Objects that are heavily occluded or
intentionally concealed pose a great challenge for detection, whether by human
observation or through advanced technological applications. While certain Deep
Learning (DL) architectures demonstrate strong performance in processing local
information, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), others excel in
handling distant information, e.g., transformers. In X-ray security imaging the
literature has been dominated by the use of CNN-based methods, while the
integration of the two aforementioned leading architectures has not been
sufficiently explored. In this paper, various hybrid CNN-transformer
architectures are evaluated against a common CNN object detection baseline,
namely YOLOv8. In particular, a CNN (HGNetV2) and a hybrid CNN-transformer
(Next-ViT-S) backbone are combined with different CNN/transformer detection
heads (YOLOv8 and RT-DETR). The resulting architectures are comparatively
evaluated on three challenging public X-ray inspection datasets, namely EDS,
HiXray, and PIDray. Interestingly, while the YOLOv8 detector with its default
backbone (CSP-DarkNet53) is generally shown to be advantageous on the HiXray
and PIDray datasets, when a domain distribution shift is incorporated in the
X-ray images (as happens in the EDS datasets), hybrid CNN-transformer
architectures exhibit increased robustness. Detailed comparative evaluation
results, including object-level detection performance and object-size error
analysis, demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of each architectural
combination and suggest guidelines for future research. The source code and
network weights of the models employed in this study are available at

TL;DR: BM-MAE是一种针对多模态MRI数据的预训练策略，能够适应任何模态组合，无需为每种组合单独训练模型，显著提高了效率和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态MRI数据在临床中常因采集问题或实验设计导致模态缺失，现有方法需为每种模态组合单独训练模型，资源消耗大且不实用。

Method: 提出BM-MAE，一种掩码图像建模预训练策略，同一预训练模型可适应任何模态组合，捕获模态内和模态间信息。

Result: 实验表明BM-MAE优于或与基线方法相当，且显著优于从头训练，还能高效重建缺失模态。

Conclusion: BM-MAE为多模态MRI数据提供了一种高效、灵活的预训练方法，具有重要临床价值。

Abstract: Multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) constitutes the first line of
investigation for clinicians in the care of brain tumors, providing crucial
insights for surgery planning, treatment monitoring, and biomarker
identification. Pre-training on large datasets have been shown to help models
learn transferable representations and adapt with minimal labeled data. This
behavior is especially valuable in medical imaging, where annotations are often
scarce. However, applying this paradigm to multimodal medical data introduces a
challenge: most existing approaches assume that all imaging modalities are
available during both pre-training and fine-tuning. In practice, missing
modalities often occur due to acquisition issues, specialist unavailability, or
specific experimental designs on small in-house datasets. Consequently, a
common approach involves training a separate model for each desired modality
combination, making the process both resource-intensive and impractical for
clinical use. Therefore, we introduce BM-MAE, a masked image modeling
pre-training strategy tailored for multimodal MRI data. The same pre-trained
model seamlessly adapts to any combination of available modalities, extracting
rich representations that capture both intra- and inter-modal information. This
allows fine-tuning on any subset of modalities without requiring architectural
changes, while still benefiting from a model pre-trained on the full set of
modalities. Extensive experiments show that the proposed pre-training strategy
outperforms or remains competitive with baselines that require separate
pre-training for each modality subset, while substantially surpassing training
from scratch on several downstream tasks. Additionally, it can quickly and
efficiently reconstruct missing modalities, highlighting its practical value.

Method: 提出AnimalMotionCLIP，在CLIP框架中交替使用视频帧和光流信息，并比较了密集、半密集和稀疏三种时间建模方案。

Result: 在Animal Kingdom数据集上的实验表明，AnimalMotionCLIP优于现有方法，能更准确地识别精细时间动作。

Conclusion: AnimalMotionCLIP通过整合运动信息和优化时间建模，显著提升了动物行为识别的效果。

Abstract: Recently, there has been a surge of interest in applying deep learning
techniques to animal behavior recognition, particularly leveraging pre-trained
visual language models, such as CLIP, due to their remarkable generalization
capacity across various downstream tasks. However, adapting these models to the
specific domain of animal behavior recognition presents two significant
challenges: integrating motion information and devising an effective temporal
modeling scheme. In this paper, we propose AnimalMotionCLIP to address these
challenges by interleaving video frames and optical flow information in the
CLIP framework. Additionally, several temporal modeling schemes using an
aggregation of classifiers are proposed and compared: dense, semi dense, and
sparse. As a result, fine temporal actions can be correctly recognized, which
is of vital importance in animal behavior analysis. Experiments on the Animal
Kingdom dataset demonstrate that AnimalMotionCLIP achieves superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Detecting and tracking objects is a crucial component of any autonomous
navigation method. For the past decades, object detection has yielded promising
results using neural networks on various datasets. While many methods focus on
performance metrics, few projects focus on improving the robustness of these

attempt to address this issue by creating a realistic synthetic data
augmentation pipeline for camera-radar Autonomous Vehicle (AV) datasets. Our
goal is to accurately simulate sensor failures and data deterioration due to
real-world interferences. We also present our results of a baseline lightweight
Noise Recognition neural network trained and tested on our augmented dataset,
reaching an overall recognition accuracy of 54.4\% on 11 categories across
10086 images and 2145 radar point-clouds.

Motivation: 领域偏移和数据不平衡导致模型在临床应用中存在偏差，影响部署效果。

Method: UMKD通过浅层和紧凑的特征对齐解耦任务无关和任务相关特征，并利用不确定性感知的解耦蒸馏机制动态调整知识转移权重。

Result: 在组织学前列腺分级和眼底图像分级实验中，UMKD在源不平衡和目标不平衡场景下均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: UMKD为实际疾病图像分级提供了鲁棒且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Automatic disease image grading is a significant application of artificial
intelligence for healthcare, enabling faster and more accurate patient
assessments. However, domain shifts, which are exacerbated by data imbalance,
introduce bias into the model, posing deployment difficulties in clinical
applications. To address the problem, we propose a novel
\textbf{U}ncertainty-aware \textbf{M}ulti-experts \textbf{K}nowledge
\textbf{D}istillation (UMKD) framework to transfer knowledge from multiple
expert models to a single student model. Specifically, to extract
discriminative features, UMKD decouples task-agnostic and task-specific
features with shallow and compact feature alignment in the feature space. At
the output space, an uncertainty-aware decoupled distillation (UDD) mechanism
dynamically adjusts knowledge transfer weights based on expert model
uncertainties, ensuring robust and reliable distillation. Additionally, UMKD
also tackles the problems of model architecture heterogeneity and distribution
discrepancies between source and target domains, which are inadequately tackled
by previous KD approaches. Extensive experiments on histology prostate grading
(\textit{SICAPv2}) and fundus image grading (\textit{APTOS}) demonstrate that
UMKD achieves a new state-of-the-art in both source-imbalanced and
target-imbalanced scenarios, offering a robust and practical solution for
real-world disease image grading.

Result: 实验表明卡尔曼滤波能提供平滑轨迹，预测准确性提升，对避碰和态势感知至关重要。

Conclusion: 需定制化数据集和模型，未来将扩展数据集并加入船舶分类以优化预测。

Abstract: The future of inland navigation increasingly relies on autonomous systems and
remote operations, emphasizing the need for accurate vessel trajectory
prediction. This study addresses the challenges of video-based vessel tracking
and prediction by integrating advanced object detection methods, Kalman
filters, and spline-based interpolation. However, existing detection systems
often misclassify objects in inland waterways due to complex surroundings. A
comparative evaluation of tracking algorithms, including BoT-SORT, Deep
OC-SORT, and ByeTrack, highlights the robustness of the Kalman filter in
providing smoothed trajectories. Experimental results from diverse scenarios
demonstrate improved accuracy in predicting vessel movements, which is
essential for collision avoidance and situational awareness. The findings
underline the necessity of customized datasets and models for inland
navigation. Future work will expand the datasets and incorporate vessel
classification to refine predictions, supporting both autonomous systems and
human operators in complex environments.

Conclusion: 3D重建方法为自动化饮食监测工具的发展提供了新思路。

Abstract: Monitoring dietary habits is crucial for preventing health risks associated
with overeating and undereating, including obesity, diabetes, and
cardiovascular diseases. Traditional methods for tracking food intake rely on
self-reported data before or after the eating, which are prone to inaccuracies.
This study proposes an approach to accurately monitor ingest behaviours by
leveraging 3D food models constructed from monocular 2D video. Using COLMAP and
pose estimation algorithms, we generate detailed 3D representations of food,
allowing us to observe changes in food volume as it is consumed. Experiments
with toy models and real food items demonstrate the approach's potential.
Meanwhile, we have proposed a new methodology for automated state recognition
challenges to accurately detect state changes and maintain model fidelity. The
3D reconstruction approach shows promise in capturing comprehensive dietary
behaviour insights, ultimately contributing to the development of automated and
accurate dietary monitoring tools.

Result: 在包含高多样性表情和角度的新基准测试中，几何精度比基线方法高出15%。

Conclusion: Pixel3DMM在单图像3D人脸重建中表现出色，尤其在复杂表情下几何精度显著提升。

Abstract: We address the 3D reconstruction of human faces from a single RGB image. To
this end, we propose Pixel3DMM, a set of highly-generalized vision transformers
which predict per-pixel geometric cues in order to constrain the optimization
of a 3D morphable face model (3DMM). We exploit the latent features of the DINO
foundation model, and introduce a tailored surface normal and uv-coordinate
prediction head. We train our model by registering three high-quality 3D face
datasets against the FLAME mesh topology, which results in a total of over
1,000 identities and 976K images. For 3D face reconstruction, we propose a
FLAME fitting opitmization that solves for the 3DMM parameters from the
uv-coordinate and normal estimates. To evaluate our method, we introduce a new
benchmark for single-image face reconstruction, which features high diversity
facial expressions, viewing angles, and ethnicities. Crucially, our benchmark
is the first to evaluate both posed and neutral facial geometry. Ultimately,
our method outperforms the most competitive baselines by over 15% in terms of
geometric accuracy for posed facial expressions.

Method: 设计了DSFA模块（多样语义引导的特征对齐）和SMFD模块（语义边界引导的特征解耦），并通过SCFR模块（语义一致性引导的特征恢复）防止行人语义丢失。

Result: 在三个VI-ReID数据集上的实验证明了DSFAD的优越性。

Conclusion: DSFAD通过文本嵌入空间对齐和解耦特征，有效提升了跨模态行人重识别的性能。

Abstract: Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification (VI-ReID) is a challenging task due
to the large modality discrepancy between visible and infrared images, which
complicates the alignment of their features into a suitable common space.
Moreover, style noise, such as illumination and color contrast, reduces the
identity discriminability and modality invariance of features. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel Diverse Semantics-guided Feature Alignment and
Decoupling (DSFAD) network to align identity-relevant features from different
modalities into a textual embedding space and disentangle identity-irrelevant
features within each modality. Specifically, we develop a Diverse
Semantics-guided Feature Alignment (DSFA) module, which generates pedestrian
descriptions with diverse sentence structures to guide the cross-modality
alignment of visual features. Furthermore, to filter out style information, we
propose a Semantic Margin-guided Feature Decoupling (SMFD) module, which
decomposes visual features into pedestrian-related and style-related
components, and then constrains the similarity between the former and the
textual embeddings to be at least a margin higher than that between the latter
and the textual embeddings. Additionally, to prevent the loss of pedestrian
semantics during feature decoupling, we design a Semantic Consistency-guided
Feature Restitution (SCFR) module, which further excavates useful information
for identification from the style-related features and restores it back into
the pedestrian-related features, and then constrains the similarity between the
features after restitution and the textual embeddings to be consistent with
that between the features before decoupling and the textual embeddings.
Extensive experiments on three VI-ReID datasets demonstrate the superiority of
our DSFAD.

Abstract: Brain diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and brain tumors, present
profound challenges due to their complexity and societal impact. Recent
advancements in brain foundation models have shown significant promise in
addressing a range of brain-related tasks. However, current brain foundation
models are limited by task and data homogeneity, restricted generalization
beyond segmentation or classification, and inefficient adaptation to diverse
clinical tasks. In this work, we propose SAM-Brain3D, a brain-specific
foundation model trained on over 66,000 brain image-label pairs across 14 MRI
sub-modalities, and Hypergraph Dynamic Adapter (HyDA), a lightweight adapter
for efficient and effective downstream adaptation. SAM-Brain3D captures
detailed brain-specific anatomical and modality priors for segmenting diverse
brain targets and broader downstream tasks. HyDA leverages hypergraphs to fuse
complementary multi-modal data and dynamically generate patient-specific
convolutional kernels for multi-scale feature fusion and personalized
patient-wise adaptation. Together, our framework excels across a broad spectrum
of brain disease segmentation and classification tasks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches, offering a new paradigm for brain disease analysis through
multi-modal, multi-scale, and dynamic foundation modeling.

Abstract: Deep learning has profoundly transformed remote sensing, yet prevailing

(iii) macro-architectural integrations, including CNN-Transformer-Mamba hybrids
and frequency-domain adaptations, (iv) rigorous benchmarking against
state-of-the-art methods in multiple application tasks, such as object

analysis of unresolved challenges with actionable future directions. By
bridging the gap between SSM theory and remote sensing practice, this survey
establishes Mamba as a transformative framework for remote sensing analysis. To
our knowledge, this paper is the first systematic review of Mamba architectures

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 德里作为全球污染最严重的城市之一，传统静态空气净化策略效果有限，亟需动态优化方法。

Method: 采用近端策略优化（PPO）算法，结合人口密度、交通模式等环境因素，迭代学习高影响区域。

Result: 实验表明，DRL方法在AQI改善、空间覆盖等方面优于传统策略，实现了均衡高效的净化设施分布。

Conclusion: AI驱动的空间优化在智能城市和空气质量管理中具有广阔应用前景。

Abstract: Urban air pollution remains a pressing global concern, particularly in
densely populated and traffic-intensive metropolitan areas like Delhi, where
exposure to harmful pollutants severely impacts public health. Delhi, being one
of the most polluted cities globally, experiences chronic air quality issues
due to vehicular emissions, industrial activities, and construction dust, which
exacerbate its already fragile atmospheric conditions. Traditional pollution
mitigation strategies, such as static air purifying installations, often fail
to maximize their impact due to suboptimal placement and limited adaptability
to dynamic urban environments. This study presents a novel deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) framework to optimize the placement of air purification booths
to improve the air quality index (AQI) in the city of Delhi. We employ Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO), a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm,
to iteratively learn and identify high-impact locations based on multiple
spatial and environmental factors, including population density, traffic
patterns, industrial influence, and green space constraints. Our approach is
benchmarked against conventional placement strategies, including random and
greedy AQI-based methods, using multi-dimensional performance evaluation
metrics such as AQI improvement, spatial coverage, population and traffic
impact, and spatial entropy. Experimental results demonstrate that the RL-based
approach outperforms baseline methods by achieving a balanced and effective
distribution of air purification infrastructure. Notably, the DRL framework
achieves an optimal trade-off between AQI reduction and high-coverage
deployment, ensuring equitable environmental benefits across urban regions. The
findings underscore the potential of AI-driven spatial optimization in
advancing smart city initiatives and data-driven urban air quality management.

*Tiange Luo,Lajanugen Logeswaran,Justin Johnson,Honglak Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RegionFocus是一种视觉测试时缩放方法，用于提升视觉语言模型代理在复杂网页环境中的动作选择准确性。通过动态放大相关区域和可视化关键地标，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网页的视觉复杂性和大量界面元素使得动作选择困难，需要一种方法减少背景干扰并提高准确性。

Method: 提出动态缩放相关区域的视觉测试时缩放方法，并结合图像作为地图的机制可视化关键地标。

Result: 在Screenspot-pro和WebVoyager基准测试中性能提升28%和24%，并在ScreenSpot-Pro上达到61.6%的最新性能。

Conclusion: RegionFocus通过视觉测试时缩放显著提升了视觉语言模型代理的性能，展示了在交互式环境中的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce RegionFocus, a visual test-time scaling approach for Vision
Language Model Agents. Understanding webpages is challenging due to the visual
complexity of GUI images and the large number of interface elements, making
accurate action selection difficult. Our approach dynamically zooms in on
relevant regions, reducing background clutter and improving grounding accuracy.
To support this process, we propose an image-as-map mechanism that visualizes
key landmarks at each step, providing a transparent action record and enables
the agent to effectively choose among action candidates. Even with a simple
region selection strategy, we observe significant performance gains of 28+\% on
Screenspot-pro and 24+\% on WebVoyager benchmarks on top of two
state-of-the-art open vision language model agents, UI-TARS and Qwen2.5-VL,
highlighting the effectiveness of visual test-time scaling in interactive
settings. We achieve a new state-of-the-art grounding performance of 61.6\% on
the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark by applying RegionFocus to a Qwen2.5-VL-72B model.
Our code will be released publicly at https://github.com/tiangeluo/RegionFocus.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种可扩展的城市模拟解决方案URBAN-SIM和任务基准URBAN-BENCH，用于提升自主微移动设备的安全性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前微移动设备依赖人工操作，存在安全和效率问题，AI辅助是潜在解决方案。

Method: 构建URBAN-SIM平台（包含三个关键模块）和URBAN-BENCH任务基准，评估AI代理在微移动中的能力。

Result: 实验表明不同机器人在多样化地形和城市结构中的表现各异。

Conclusion: URBAN-SIM和URBAN-BENCH为自主微移动的研究提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Micromobility, which utilizes lightweight mobile machines moving in urban
public spaces, such as delivery robots and mobility scooters, emerges as a
promising alternative to vehicular mobility. Current micromobility depends
mostly on human manual operation (in-person or remote control), which raises
safety and efficiency concerns when navigating busy urban environments full of
unpredictable obstacles and pedestrians. Assisting humans with AI agents in
maneuvering micromobility devices presents a viable solution for enhancing
safety and efficiency. In this work, we present a scalable urban simulation
solution to advance autonomous micromobility. First, we build URBAN-SIM - a
high-performance robot learning platform for large-scale training of embodied
agents in interactive urban scenes. URBAN-SIM contains three critical modules:
Hierarchical Urban Generation pipeline, Interactive Dynamics Generation
strategy, and Asynchronous Scene Sampling scheme, to improve the diversity,
realism, and efficiency of robot learning in simulation. Then, we propose
URBAN-BENCH - a suite of essential tasks and benchmarks to gauge various
capabilities of the AI agents in achieving autonomous micromobility.
URBAN-BENCH includes eight tasks based on three core skills of the agents:
Urban Locomotion, Urban Navigation, and Urban Traverse. We evaluate four robots
with heterogeneous embodiments, such as the wheeled and legged robots, across
these tasks. Experiments on diverse terrains and urban structures reveal each
robot's strengths and limitations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RayZer是一种无需3D监督的自监督多视角3D视觉模型，能够从无标定图像中恢复相机参数并合成新视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无需3D监督（如相机位姿和场景几何）的情况下实现3D感知的问题。

Method: 设计自监督框架和基于Transformer的模型，仅依赖射线结构作为3D先验。

Result: 在无需真实相机标注的情况下，RayZer展现出与依赖标注的方法相当或更优的新视角合成性能。

Conclusion: RayZer证明了自监督方法在3D视觉任务中的潜力，无需依赖传统3D监督。

Abstract: We present RayZer, a self-supervised multi-view 3D Vision model trained
without any 3D supervision, i.e., camera poses and scene geometry, while
exhibiting emerging 3D awareness. Concretely, RayZer takes unposed and
uncalibrated images as input, recovers camera parameters, reconstructs a scene
representation, and synthesizes novel views. During training, RayZer relies
solely on its self-predicted camera poses to render target views, eliminating
the need for any ground-truth camera annotations and allowing RayZer to be
trained with 2D image supervision. The emerging 3D awareness of RayZer is
attributed to two key factors. First, we design a self-supervised framework,
which achieves 3D-aware auto-encoding of input images by disentangling camera
and scene representations. Second, we design a transformer-based model in which
the only 3D prior is the ray structure, connecting camera, pixel, and scene
simultaneously. RayZer demonstrates comparable or even superior novel view
synthesis performance than ``oracle'' methods that rely on pose annotations in
both training and testing. Project: https://hwjiang1510.github.io/RayZer/

Motivation: 探索如何将思维链和强化学习应用于视觉生成领域，以改进文本到图像生成模型的性能。

Method: 提出双层次CoT（语义级和令牌级）和BiCoT-GRPO方法，优化生成过程。

Result: 在T2I-CompBench和WISE基准测试中分别提升了13%和19%，超越现有最佳模型FLUX。

Conclusion: T2I-R1通过双层次CoT和强化学习的结合，显著提升了文本到图像生成的性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models have demonstrated how
chain-of-thought (CoT) and reinforcement learning (RL) can improve performance.
However, applying such reasoning strategies to the visual generation domain
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present T2I-R1, a novel
reasoning-enhanced text-to-image generation model, powered by RL with a
bi-level CoT reasoning process. Specifically, we identify two levels of CoT
that can be utilized to enhance different stages of generation: (1) the
semantic-level CoT for high-level planning of the prompt and (2) the
token-level CoT for low-level pixel processing during patch-by-patch
generation. To better coordinate these two levels of CoT, we introduce
BiCoT-GRPO with an ensemble of generation rewards, which seamlessly optimizes
both generation CoTs within the same training step. By applying our reasoning
strategies to the baseline model, Janus-Pro, we achieve superior performance
with 13% improvement on T2I-CompBench and 19% improvement on the WISE
benchmark, even surpassing the state-of-the-art model FLUX.1. Code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有物理模拟方法难以扩展到真实视频，而视频编辑缺乏真实感和控制性。

Method: 采用视频扩散模型，结合合成视频、生成式图像编辑和自动标记的真实视频数据。

Result: 在天气模拟和去除任务中优于现有方法，生成高质量、物理合理且保留场景特征的结果。

Conclusion: WeatherWeaver为视频天气效果合成提供了高效、可控且真实的解决方案。

Abstract: Generating realistic and controllable weather effects in videos is valuable
for many applications. Physics-based weather simulation requires precise
reconstructions that are hard to scale to in-the-wild videos, while current
video editing often lacks realism and control. In this work, we introduce
WeatherWeaver, a video diffusion model that synthesizes diverse weather effects
-- including rain, snow, fog, and clouds -- directly into any input video
without the need for 3D modeling. Our model provides precise control over
weather effect intensity and supports blending various weather types, ensuring
both realism and adaptability. To overcome the scarcity of paired training
data, we propose a novel data strategy combining synthetic videos, generative
image editing, and auto-labeled real-world videos. Extensive evaluations show
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in weather simulation and
removal, providing high-quality, physically plausible, and
scene-identity-preserving results over various real-world videos.

TL;DR: Rosetta-PL是一个用于评估大语言模型在低资源语言和逻辑推理任务中表现的基准，通过翻译逻辑命题数据集并微调模型，研究发现翻译方法对模型性能有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在高资源自然语言上表现良好，但在低资源语言和深度逻辑推理任务中效果有限，因此需要设计专门的评估方法。

Method: 通过将Lean中的逻辑命题数据集翻译为自定义逻辑语言，构建Rosetta-PL基准，并用于微调LLM（如GPT-4o），分析数据集大小和翻译方法对模型性能的影响。

Result: 翻译过程中保持逻辑关系能显著提升模型精度，且训练样本超过约20,000时准确率趋于稳定。

Conclusion: 研究结果为优化大语言模型在形式推理任务中的训练提供了指导，有助于提升低资源语言应用中的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are primarily trained on high-resource natural
languages, limiting their effectiveness in low-resource settings and in tasks
requiring deep logical reasoning. This research introduces Rosetta-PL, a
benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' logical reasoning and generalization
capabilities in a controlled environment. We construct Rosetta-PL by
translating a dataset of logical propositions from Lean into a custom logical
language, which is then used to fine-tune an LLM (e.g., GPT-4o). Our
experiments analyze the impact of the size of the dataset and the translation
methodology on the performance of the model. Our results indicate that
preserving logical relationships in the translation process significantly
boosts precision, with accuracy plateauing beyond roughly 20,000 training
samples. These insights provide valuable guidelines for optimizing LLM training
in formal reasoning tasks and improving performance in various low-resource
language applications.

TL;DR: 论文指出计算主义无法解释符号接地问题，无论计算是基于有意义还是无意义的符号，都会导致语义先天论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨计算主义在解释符号接地问题上的局限性，揭示其隐含的语义先天论假设。

Method: 通过逻辑分析，提出计算主义的两种可能性（有意义符号与无意义符号）均无法避免语义先天论。

Result: 无论计算主义选择哪种符号基础，都无法避免语义先天论的结论。

Conclusion: 计算主义在解释符号接地问题上存在根本性缺陷，需重新审视其理论基础。

Abstract: The paper presents a paradoxical feature of computational systems that
suggests that computationalism cannot explain symbol grounding. If the mind is
a digital computer, as computationalism claims, then it can be computing either
over meaningful symbols or over meaningless symbols. If it is computing over
meaningful symbols its functioning presupposes the existence of meaningful
symbols in the system, i.e. it implies semantic nativism. If the mind is
computing over meaningless symbols, no intentional cognitive processes are
available prior to symbol grounding. In this case, no symbol grounding could
take place since any grounding presupposes intentional cognitive processes. So,
whether computing in the mind is over meaningless or over meaningful symbols,
computationalism implies semantic nativism.

Abstract: Psychological insights have long shaped pivotal NLP breakthroughs, including
the cognitive underpinnings of attention mechanisms, formative reinforcement
learning, and Theory of Mind-inspired social modeling. As Large Language Models
(LLMs) continue to grow in scale and complexity, there is a rising consensus
that psychology is essential for capturing human-like cognition, behavior, and
interaction. This paper reviews how psychological theories can inform and
enhance stages of LLM development, including data, pre-training, post-training,
and evaluation\&application. Our survey integrates insights from cognitive,
developmental, behavioral, social, personality psychology, and
psycholinguistics. Our analysis highlights current trends and gaps in how
psychological theories are applied. By examining both cross-domain connections
and points of tension, we aim to bridge disciplinary divides and promote more
thoughtful integration of psychology into future NLP research.

Motivation: 利用预训练语言模型的知识构建更高效的文本表示，并系统化分析其特性。

Method: 提出LangVAE框架，结合VAEs和LLMs，配套LangSpace工具进行表示分析（如向量遍历、解耦度量等）。实验测试了不同编码器-解码器组合和标注输入。

Result: 框架灵活、高效且可扩展，实验揭示了不同架构在泛化和解耦方面的交互作用。

Conclusion: LangVAE为文本表示的系统化实验和理解提供了有前景的框架。

Abstract: We present LangVAE, a novel framework for modular construction of variational
autoencoders (VAEs) on top of pre-trained large language models (LLMs). Such
language model VAEs can encode the knowledge of their pre-trained components
into more compact and semantically disentangled representations. The
representations obtained in this way can be analysed with the LangVAE companion
framework: LangSpace, which implements a collection of probing methods, such as
vector traversal and interpolation, disentanglement measures, and cluster
visualisations. LangVAE and LangSpace offer a flexible, efficient and scalable
way of building and analysing textual representations, with simple integration
for models available on the HuggingFace Hub. Additionally, we conducted a set
of experiments with different encoder and decoder combinations, as well as
annotated inputs, revealing a wide range of interactions across architectural
families and sizes w.r.t. generalisation and disentanglement. Our findings
demonstrate a promising framework for systematising the experimentation and
understanding of textual representations.

Method: 利用每日更新的国会议员推文数据集，训练语言模型生成与真实推文难以区分的文本，并用于预测投票行为。

Result: 模型生成的推文可用于预测投票行为和党派倾向，为资源分配提供支持。

Conclusion: 研究展示了数字孪生在政治分析中的潜力，但也指出了局限性和未来扩展方向。

Abstract: In this paper we provide evidence that a virtual model of U.S.
congresspersons based on a collection of language models satisfies the
definition of a digital twin. In particular, we introduce and provide
high-level descriptions of a daily-updated dataset that contains every Tweet
from every U.S. congressperson during their respective terms. We demonstrate
that a modern language model equipped with congressperson-specific subsets of
this data are capable of producing Tweets that are largely indistinguishable
from actual Tweets posted by their physical counterparts. We illustrate how
generated Tweets can be used to predict roll-call vote behaviors and to
quantify the likelihood of congresspersons crossing party lines, thereby
assisting stakeholders in allocating resources and potentially impacting
real-world legislative dynamics. We conclude with a discussion of the
limitations and important extensions of our analysis.

TL;DR: TA-LoRA提出了一种基于提示调优的多任务学习方法，通过低秩表示和快慢权重机制解决任务异质性，并在实验中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练语言模型在新任务上表现不佳，多任务学习虽能共享知识，但提示调优难以捕捉任务异质性。

Method: 采用低秩表示建模任务异质性，快慢权重机制分离共享与任务特定知识，并引入零初始化注意力机制。

Result: 在16个任务上，TA-LoRA在完整数据和少样本设置下均达到最优性能，且参数高效。

Conclusion: TA-LoRA通过改进提示调优，有效解决了任务异质性，提升了多任务学习的性能。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) demonstrate remarkable intelligence but
struggle with emerging tasks unseen during training in real-world applications.
Training separate models for each new task is usually impractical. Multi-task
learning (MTL) addresses this challenge by transferring shared knowledge from
source tasks to target tasks. As an dominant parameter-efficient fine-tuning
method, prompt tuning (PT) enhances MTL by introducing an adaptable vector that
captures task-specific knowledge, which acts as a prefix to the original prompt
that preserves shared knowledge, while keeping PLM parameters frozen. However,
PT struggles to effectively capture the heterogeneity of task-specific
knowledge due to its limited representational capacity. To address this
challenge, we propose Task-Adaptive Low-Rank Representation (TA-LoRA), an MTL
method built on PT, employing the low-rank representation to model task
heterogeneity and a fast-slow weights mechanism where the slow weight encodes
shared knowledge, while the fast weight captures task-specific nuances,
avoiding the mixing of shared and task-specific knowledge, caused by training
low-rank representations from scratch. Moreover, a zero-initialized attention
mechanism is introduced to minimize the disruption of immature low-rank
components on original prompts during warm-up epochs. Experiments on 16 tasks
demonstrate that TA-LoRA achieves state-of-the-art performance in full-data and
few-shot settings while maintaining superior parameter efficiency.

Abstract: Jailbreaking in Large Language Models (LLMs) threatens their safe use in
sensitive domains like education by allowing users to bypass ethical
safeguards. This study focuses on detecting jailbreaks in 2-Sigma, a clinical
education platform that simulates patient interactions using LLMs. We annotated
over 2,300 prompts across 158 conversations using four linguistic variables
shown to correlate strongly with jailbreak behavior. The extracted features
were used to train several predictive models, including Decision Trees, Fuzzy
Logic-based classifiers, Boosting methods, and Logistic Regression. Results
show that feature-based predictive models consistently outperformed Prompt
Engineering, with the Fuzzy Decision Tree achieving the best overall
performance. Our findings demonstrate that linguistic-feature-based models are
effective and explainable alternatives for jailbreak detection. We suggest
future work explore hybrid frameworks that integrate prompt-based flexibility
with rule-based robustness for real-time, spectrum-based jailbreak monitoring

TL;DR: 研究旨在构建高精度模型预测日语文本中的八种Plutchik情绪，使用WRIME语料库微调预训练模型，DeBERTa-v3-large表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 日语文本情感检测在社交媒体监控和客户反馈分析中需求高，但资源稀缺和类别不平衡影响模型性能。

Method: 使用WRIME语料库，将读者平均强度分数转为二元标签，微调四种预训练模型（BERT、RoBERTa、DeBERTa-v3-base、DeBERTa-v3-large），并评估两种大语言模型（TinySwallow-1.5B-Instruct和ChatGPT-4o）。

Result: DeBERTa-v3-large以平均准确率0.860和F1分数0.662表现最佳，大语言模型表现较差。

Conclusion: 微调后的DeBERTa-v3-large是目前日语二元情感分类的最可靠解决方案，未来需扩充稀有情绪数据并优化大语言模型性能。

Abstract: Background Practical applications such as social media monitoring and
customer-feedback analysis require accurate emotion detection for Japanese
text, yet resource scarcity and class imbalance hinder model performance.
  Objective This study aims to build a high-accuracy model for predicting the
presence or absence of eight Plutchik emotions in Japanese sentences.
  Methods Using the WRIME corpus, we transform reader-averaged intensity scores
into binary labels and fine-tune four pre-trained language models (BERT,
RoBERTa, DeBERTa-v3-base, DeBERTa-v3-large). For context, we also assess two
large language models (TinySwallow-1.5B-Instruct and ChatGPT-4o). Accuracy and
F1-score serve as evaluation metrics.
  Results DeBERTa-v3-large attains the best mean accuracy (0.860) and F1-score
(0.662), outperforming all other models. It maintains robust F1 across both
high-frequency emotions (e.g., Joy, Anticipation) and low-frequency emotions
(e.g., Anger, Trust). The LLMs lag, with ChatGPT-4o and
TinySwallow-1.5B-Instruct scoring 0.527 and 0.292 in mean F1, respectively.
  Conclusion The fine-tuned DeBERTa-v3-large model currently offers the most
reliable solution for binary emotion classification in Japanese. We release
this model as a pip-installable package (pip install
deberta-emotion-predictor). Future work should augment data for rare emotions,
reduce model size, and explore prompt engineering to improve LLM performance.

embeddings typically reside in unconstrained Euclidean spaces, which may limit
their ability to reflect complex relationships in language. In this work, we
introduce a novel framework that constrains sentence embeddings to lie on
continuous manifolds -- specifically the unit sphere, torus, and M\"obius strip
-- using triplet loss as the core training objective. By enforcing differential
geometric constraints on the output space, our approach encourages the learning
of embeddings that are both discriminative and topologically structured.
  We evaluate our method on benchmark datasets (AG News and MBTI) and compare
it to classical baselines including TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and unconstrained
Keras-derived embeddings. Our results demonstrate that manifold-constrained
embeddings, particularly those projected onto spheres and M\"obius strips,
significantly outperform traditional approaches in both clustering quality
(Silhouette Score) and classification performance (Accuracy). These findings
highlight the value of embedding in manifold space -- where topological
structure complements semantic separation -- offering a new and mathematically
grounded direction for geometric representation learning in NLP.

*MD Thamed Bin Zaman Chowdhury,Moazzem Hossain*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）和网络爬虫技术的自动化系统，用于解决孟加拉国交通事故数据收集的不可靠性问题。系统通过四个模块实现自动化，并在实际应用中表现出高效性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发展中国家如孟加拉国的交通事故数据收集存在手动、分散和不可靠的问题，导致数据缺失和不一致。研究旨在通过自动化技术解决这些问题。

Method: 系统由四个模块组成：自动化网络爬虫代码生成、新闻收集、事故新闻分类与结构化数据提取、去重。使用Gemini-2.0-Flash模型实现自动化。

Result: 系统在111天内处理了15,000多篇新闻文章，识别出705起独特事故。代码生成模块的校准和验证准确率分别为91.3%和80%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于LLM的系统能够高效、准确地收集交通事故数据，为数据驱动的道路安全政策制定提供了基础。

Abstract: Road traffic accidents remain a major public safety and socio-economic issue
in developing countries like Bangladesh. Existing accident data collection is
largely manual, fragmented, and unreliable, resulting in underreporting and
inconsistent records. This research proposes a fully automated system using
Large Language Models (LLMs) and web scraping techniques to address these
challenges. The pipeline consists of four components: automated web scraping
code generation, news collection from online sources, accident news
classification with structured data extraction, and duplicate removal. The
system uses the multimodal generative LLM Gemini-2.0-Flash for seamless
automation. The code generation module classifies webpages into pagination,
dynamic, or infinite scrolling categories and generates suitable Python scripts
for scraping. LLMs also classify and extract key accident information such as
date, time, location, fatalities, injuries, road type, vehicle types, and
pedestrian involvement. A deduplication algorithm ensures data integrity by
removing duplicate reports. The system scraped 14 major Bangladeshi news sites
over 111 days (Oct 1, 2024 - Jan 20, 2025), processing over 15,000 news
articles and identifying 705 unique accidents. The code generation module
achieved 91.3% calibration and 80% validation accuracy. Chittagong reported the
highest number of accidents (80), fatalities (70), and injuries (115), followed
by Dhaka, Faridpur, Gazipur, and Cox's Bazar. Peak accident times were morning
(8-9 AM), noon (12-1 PM), and evening (6-7 PM). A public repository was also
developed with usage instructions. This study demonstrates the viability of an
LLM-powered, scalable system for accurate, low-effort accident data collection,
providing a foundation for data-driven road safety policymaking in Bangladesh.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文将Text-to-SQL任务重新定义为通过SQL监督学习表格数据推理能力的框架，提出两阶段方法（CoT监督和GRPO强化学习），显著提升了模型在推理密集型数据集上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Text-to-SQL任务仅关注查询生成，忽略了表格数据的推理能力。本文希望通过SQL监督学习，开发可迁移的表格推理能力。

Method: 1. 通过真实SQL查询合成详细的链式思维（CoT）监督，提供逐步的表格操作指导；2. 提出GRPO强化学习目标，将SQL执行准确性与通用推理能力关联。

Result: 在标准Text-to-SQL基准和推理密集型数据集（如BIRD和CRT-QA）上表现显著提升，LLaMA模型准确率提高20%，Qwen提高5%。

Conclusion: SQL不仅是目标形式，还能作为学习结构化数据推理的有效支架，提升模型的泛化能力和可解释性。

Abstract: This work reframes the Text-to-SQL task as a pathway for teaching large
language models (LLMs) to reason over and manipulate tabular data--moving
beyond the traditional focus on query generation. We propose a two-stage
framework that leverages SQL supervision to develop transferable table
reasoning capabilities. First, we synthesize detailed chain-of-thought (CoT)
traces from real-world SQL queries, providing step-by-step, clause-level
supervision that teaches the model how to traverse, filter, and aggregate table
fields. Second, we introduce a Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
reinforcement learning objective that connects SQL execution accuracy to
generalizable reasoning by encouraging steps that extend beyond task-specific
syntax and transfer across datasets. Empirically, our approach improves
performance on standard Text-to-SQL benchmarks and achieves substantial gains
on reasoning-intensive datasets such as BIRD and CRT-QA, demonstrating enhanced
generalization and interpretability. Specifically, the distilled-quantized
LLaMA model achieved a 20\% increase in accuracy when trained on Text-to-SQL
tasks, while Qwen achieved a 5\% increase. These results suggest that SQL can
serve not only as a target formalism but also as an effective scaffold for
learning robust, transferable reasoning over structured data.

Motivation: 长提示会增加计算复杂性和经济成本，因此需要研究如何压缩提示而不影响LLM的响应质量。

Method: 研究六种提示压缩方法，并在13个数据集上评估其性能，涵盖生成表现、模型幻觉、多模态任务等。

Result: 实验发现，提示压缩对长上下文的影响更大，适度压缩在Longbench评估中甚至提升了性能。

Conclusion: 提示压缩是可行的，尤其在长上下文中，适度压缩可能带来性能提升。

Abstract: Prompt engineering enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform a variety
of tasks. However, lengthy prompts significantly increase computational
complexity and economic costs. To address this issue, we study six prompt
compression methods for LLMs, aiming to reduce prompt length while maintaining
LLM response quality. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis
covering aspects such as generation performance, model hallucinations, efficacy
in multimodal tasks, word omission analysis, and more. We evaluate these
methods across 13 datasets, including news, scientific articles, commonsense
QA, math QA, long-context QA, and VQA datasets. Our experiments reveal that
prompt compression has a greater impact on LLM performance in long contexts
compared to short ones. In the Longbench evaluation, moderate compression even
enhances LLM performance. Our code and data is available at

Motivation: 探讨OpenAI模型是否在未经授权的情况下使用了受版权保护的内容，以推动AI训练数据的透明度。

Method: 使用DE-COP成员推理攻击方法，分析34本O'Reilly书籍在不同OpenAI模型中的识别情况。

Result: GPT-4o对付费内容识别率高（AUROC=82%），GPT-3.5 Turbo对公开内容更敏感，GPT-4o Mini无显著识别能力。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁提高AI训练数据的透明度，并建立正式的内容授权框架。

Abstract: Using a legally obtained dataset of 34 copyrighted O'Reilly Media books, we
apply the DE-COP membership inference attack method to investigate whether
OpenAI's large language models were trained on copyrighted content without
consent. Our AUROC scores show that GPT-4o, OpenAI's more recent and capable
model, demonstrates strong recognition of paywalled O'Reilly book content
(AUROC = 82\%), compared to OpenAI's earlier model GPT-3.5 Turbo. In contrast,
GPT-3.5 Turbo shows greater relative recognition of publicly accessible
O'Reilly book samples. GPT-4o Mini, as a much smaller model, shows no knowledge
of public or non-public O'Reilly Media content when tested (AUROC $\approx$
50\%). Testing multiple models, with the same cutoff date, helps us account for
potential language shifts over time that might bias our findings. These results
highlight the urgent need for increased corporate transparency regarding
pre-training data sources as a means to develop formal licensing frameworks for
AI content training

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 食品危害检测任务面临数据分布不平衡、文本短且非结构化、语义类别重叠等挑战，需要改进分类性能。

Method: 使用BERT和RoBERTa作为基础分类器，结合随机过采样、EDA数据增强和焦点损失等策略。

Result: 实验表明EDA有效缓解类别不平衡，显著提升准确率和F1分数；结合焦点损失和过采样进一步增强了模型鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为食品危害检测的NLP分类模型提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Classification tasks often suffer from imbal- anced data distribution, which
presents chal- lenges in food hazard detection due to severe class imbalances,
short and unstructured text, and overlapping semantic categories. In this
paper, we present our system for SemEval- 2025 Task 9: Food Hazard Detection,
which ad- dresses these issues by applying data augmenta- tion techniques to
improve classification perfor- mance. We utilize transformer-based models, BERT
and RoBERTa, as backbone classifiers and explore various data balancing
strategies, including random oversampling, Easy Data Augmentation (EDA), and
focal loss. Our ex- periments show that EDA effectively mitigates class
imbalance, leading to significant improve- ments in accuracy and F1 scores.
Furthermore, combining focal loss with oversampling and EDA further enhances
model robustness, par- ticularly for hard-to-classify examples. These findings
contribute to the development of more effective NLP-based classification models
for food hazard detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管数据量对大型语言模型（LLM）至关重要，但数据质量对性能和训练效率的提升同样显著。本文旨在通过高质量数据集的构建验证这一点。

Method: 采用启发式和模型过滤技术，结合合成数据生成，构建了德语预训练数据集Aleph-Alpha-GermanWeb。数据集来源包括Common Crawl、FineWeb2和合成数据。

Result: 在德语基准测试（如MMMLU）中，Aleph-Alpha-GermanWeb表现显著优于FineWeb2，即使在8B规模下仍保持优势。

Conclusion: 模型驱动的数据筛选和合成数据生成能显著提升LLM预训练数据集的质量。

Abstract: Scaling data quantity is essential for large language models (LLMs), yet
recent findings show that data quality can significantly boost performance and
training efficiency. We introduce a German-language dataset curation pipeline
that combines heuristic and model-based filtering techniques with synthetic
data generation. We use our pipeline to create Aleph-Alpha-GermanWeb, a
large-scale German pre-training dataset which draws from: (1) Common Crawl web
data, (2) FineWeb2, and (3) synthetically-generated data conditioned on actual,
organic web data. We evaluate our dataset by pre-training both a 1B Llama-style
model and an 8B tokenizer-free hierarchical autoregressive transformer (HAT). A
comparison on German-language benchmarks, including MMMLU, shows significant
performance gains of Aleph-Alpha-GermanWeb over FineWeb2 alone. This advantage
holds at the 8B scale even when FineWeb2 is enriched by human-curated
high-quality data sources such as Wikipedia. Our findings support the growing
body of evidence that model-based data curation and synthetic data generation
can significantly enhance LLM pre-training datasets.

TL;DR: 论文提出Context Organizer (CORG)框架，通过分组处理多上下文，解决知识重复与不一致问题，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实语料中知识重复但存在不一致性，语言模型难以处理复杂上下文关系，需系统性解决方案。

Method: CORG框架包含图构造器、重排器和聚合器，将上下文分组独立处理以提高效率与消歧能力。

Result: CORG在性能与效率间取得平衡，优于现有分组方法，接近计算密集型单上下文方法的效果。

Conclusion: CORG有效解决多上下文关系问题，为语言模型处理复杂知识提供了实用框架。

Abstract: In a real-world corpus, knowledge frequently recurs across documents but
often contains inconsistencies due to ambiguous naming, outdated information,
or errors, leading to complex interrelationships between contexts. Previous
research has shown that language models struggle with these complexities,
typically focusing on single factors in isolation. We classify these
relationships into four types: distracting, ambiguous, counterfactual, and
duplicated. Our analysis reveals that no single approach effectively addresses
all these interrelationships simultaneously. Therefore, we introduce Context
Organizer (CORG), a framework that organizes multiple contexts into
independently processed groups. This design allows the model to efficiently
find all relevant answers while ensuring disambiguation. CORG consists of three
key components: a graph constructor, a reranker, and an aggregator. Our results
demonstrate that CORG balances performance and efficiency effectively,
outperforming existing grouping methods and achieving comparable results to
more computationally intensive, single-context approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如监督微调或模仿推理）在工具调用能力的扩展上存在局限性，无法实现泛化。受DeepSeek-R1启发，作者希望通过轻量级监督实现自主推理。

Method: 采用规则强化学习范式，仅通过评估工具调用的结构有效性和功能正确性的二进制奖励优化模型，避免标注推理轨迹。

Result: Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1-7B和14B在BFCL和API-Bank基准测试中表现优异，超越GPT-4o。

Conclusion: 轻量级监督的强化学习方法能有效提升语言模型的工具调用能力，且无需依赖标注推理轨迹。

Abstract: Enabling large language models with external tools has become a pivotal
strategy for extending their functionality beyond text generation tasks. Prior
work typically enhances tool-use abilities by either applying supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) to enforce tool-call correctness or distilling reasoning
traces from stronger models for SFT. However, both approaches fall short,
either omitting reasoning entirely or producing imitative reasoning that limits
generalization. Inspired by the success of DeepSeek-R1 in eliciting reasoning
through rule-based reinforcement learning, we develop the
Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1 series of tool-using language models using a similar
training paradigm. Instead of restrictively supervising intermediate reasoning
traces distilled from stronger models, Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1 is optimized
with a binary reward that evaluates only the structural validity and functional
correctness of tool invocations. This lightweight supervision allows the model
to autonomously internalize reasoning strategies, without the need for
annotated reasoning trajectories. Experiments on the BFCL and API-Bank
benchmarks show that Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1-7B and
Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1-14B, built on Qwen-2.5-7B/14B-Instruct, achieve
state-of-the-art results, outperforming GPT-4o on both evaluations.

Method: 设计知识转移管道，采用LoRA技术调整关键注意力层；实施4位权重量化等压缩技术；集成Flash Attention加速和连续批处理等推理优化技术。

Result: 在医疗问答数据集上，专业准确性保持的同时，内存消耗减少64.7%，推理延迟降低12.4%。

Conclusion: 为资源受限环境（如边缘计算设备）中的医疗大模型应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, despite foundation models like DeepSeek-R1 and ChatGPT
demonstrating significant capabilities in general tasks, professional knowledge
barriers, computational resource requirements, and deployment environment
limitations have severely hindered their application in actual medical
scenarios. Addressing these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient
lightweight medical vertical large language model architecture method,
systematically solving the lightweight problem of medical large models from
three dimensions: knowledge acquisition, model compression, and computational
optimization. At the knowledge acquisition level, a knowledge transfer pipeline
is designed from the fine-tuned DeepSeek-R1-Distill-70B teacher model to the
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-7B student model, and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technology
is adopted to precisely adjust key attention layers. At the model compression
level, compression techniques including 4-bit weight quantization are
implemented while preserving the core representation ability for medical
reasoning. At the computational optimization level, inference optimization
techniques such as Flash Attention acceleration and continuous batching are
integrated, and a professional prompt template system is constructed to adapt
to different types of medical problems. Experimental results on medical
question-answering datasets show that the method proposed in this paper
maintains professional accuracy while reducing memory consumption by 64.7\% and
inference latency by 12.4\%, providing an effective solution for the
application of medical large models in resource-constrained environments such
as edge computing devices.

Motivation: 旨在通过树结构高效表示文本中的主语、动作、宾语和状语及其子类关系，支持自然语言查询。

Method: 构建高质量的树结构，确保独立性以避免冗余，并通过树的可表达性覆盖大多数句子。

Result: 实验显示，基于子类关系构建的抽象树的平均精确率、召回率和F1分数均超过80%。

Conclusion: 该方法能快速缩小搜索范围，支持精确的文本操作和自然语言查询。

Abstract: This paper proposed an approach to automatically discovering subject
dimension, action dimension, object dimension and adverbial dimension from
texts to efficiently operate texts and support query in natural language. The
high quality of trees guarantees that all subjects, actions, objects and
adverbials and their subclass relations within texts can be represented. The
independency of trees ensures that there is no redundant representation between
trees. The expressiveness of trees ensures that the majority of sentences can
be accessed from each tree and the rest of sentences can be accessed from at
least one tree so that the tree-based search mechanism can support querying in
natural language. Experiments show that the average precision, recall and
F1-score of the abstraction trees constructed by the subclass relations of
subject, action, object and adverbial are all greater than 80%. The application
of the proposed approach to supporting query in natural language demonstrates
that different types of question patterns for querying subject or object have
high coverage of texts, and searching multiple trees on subject, action, object
and adverbial according to the question pattern can quickly reduce search space
to locate target sentences, which can support precise operation on texts.

Conclusion: 该框架为端到端语音对话系统的知识整合提供了有前景的方向，代码和数据集将开源以促进研究。

Abstract: In recent years, end-to-end speech-to-speech (S2S) dialogue systems have
garnered increasing research attention due to their advantages over traditional
cascaded systems, including achieving lower latency and more natural
integration of nonverbal cues such as emotion and speaker identity. However,
these end-to-end systems face key challenges, particularly in incorporating
external knowledge, a capability commonly addressed by Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) in text-based large language models (LLMs). The core
difficulty lies in the modality gap between input speech and retrieved textual
knowledge, which hinders effective integration. To address this issue, we
propose a novel end-to-end RAG framework that directly retrieves relevant
textual knowledge from speech queries, eliminating the need for intermediate
speech-to-text conversion via techniques like ASR. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of
end-to-end S2S dialogue systems while achieving higher retrieval efficiency.
Although the overall performance still lags behind cascaded models, our
framework offers a promising direction for enhancing knowledge integration in
end-to-end S2S systems. We will release the code and dataset to support
reproducibility and promote further research in this area.

Result: 实验证明SDFT在多个领域有效平衡知识获取与通用能力保留。

Conclusion: SDFT提供了一种数据中心的对话模板，平衡基础对齐与目标知识集成。

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models have demonstrated impressive versatile
capabilities through extensive multimodal pre-training, but face significant
limitations when incorporating specialized knowledge domains beyond their
training distribution. These models struggle with a fundamental dilemma: direct
adaptation approaches that inject domain-specific knowledge often trigger
catastrophic forgetting of foundational visual-linguistic abilities. We
introduce Structured Dialogue Fine-Tuning (SDFT), an effective approach that
effectively injects domain-specific knowledge while minimizing catastrophic
forgetting. Drawing inspiration from supervised fine-tuning in LLMs and
subject-driven personalization in text-to-image diffusion models, our method
employs a three-phase dialogue structure: Foundation Preservation reinforces
pre-trained visual-linguistic alignment through caption tasks; Contrastive
Disambiguation introduces carefully designed counterfactual examples to
maintain semantic boundaries; and Knowledge Specialization embeds specialized
information through chain-of-thought reasoning. Experimental results across
multiple domains confirm SDFT's effectiveness in balancing specialized
knowledge acquisition with general capability retention. Our key contributions
include a data-centric dialogue template that balances foundational alignment
with targeted knowledge integration, a weighted multi-turn supervision
framework, and comprehensive evaluation across diverse knowledge types.

Motivation: 探讨语言模型在模拟历史文本风格时的局限性，以避免时代错位风险。

Method: 通过提示和微调当代模型，生成历史风格文本，并与真实历史文本对比。

Result: 微调后的模型能欺骗自动化评估，但人类仍能区分其输出与真实历史文本。

Conclusion: 预训练可能是可靠模拟历史视角的必要条件。

Abstract: Before researchers can use language models to simulate the past, they need to
understand the risk of anachronism. We find that prompting a contemporary model
with examples of period prose does not produce output consistent with period
style. Fine-tuning produces results that are stylistically convincing enough to
fool an automated judge, but human evaluators can still distinguish fine-tuned
model outputs from authentic historical text. We tentatively conclude that
pretraining on period prose may be required in order to reliably simulate
historical perspectives for social research.

Method: LEPA算法要求LLM在解决问题前生成抽象计划，并通过自我反思优化计划，最终训练模型同时预测优化后的计划和解决方案。

Result: LEPA在多个自然语言推理基准测试中显著优于传统算法。

Conclusion: 通过引入抽象计划，LEPA有效提升了LLM的泛化能力和推理性能。

Abstract: In the field of large language model (LLM) post-training, the effectiveness
of utilizing synthetic data generated by the LLM itself has been
well-presented. However, a key question remains unaddressed: what essential
information should such self-generated data encapsulate? Existing approaches
only produce step-by-step problem solutions, and fail to capture the abstract
meta-knowledge necessary for generalization across similar problems. Drawing
insights from cognitive science, where humans employ high-level abstraction to
simplify complex problems before delving into specifics, we introduce a novel
self-training algorithm: LEarning to Plan before Answering (LEPA). LEPA trains
the LLM to formulate anticipatory plans, which serve as abstract meta-knowledge
for problem-solving, before engaging with the intricacies of problems. This
approach not only outlines the solution generation path but also shields the
LLM from the distraction of irrelevant details. During data generation, LEPA
first crafts an anticipatory plan based on the problem, and then generates a
solution that aligns with both the plan and the problem. LEPA refines the plan
through self-reflection, aiming to acquire plans that are instrumental in
yielding correct solutions. During model optimization, the LLM is trained to
predict both the refined plans and the corresponding solutions. By efficiently
extracting and utilizing the anticipatory plans, LEPA demonstrates remarkable
superiority over conventional algorithms on various challenging natural
language reasoning benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为MDD-LLM的高性能抑郁症诊断工具，利用微调的大型语言模型（LLMs）和真实世界样本，显著提升了诊断准确性和AUC值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球抑郁症患者超过3亿，但医疗资源分布不均和诊断方法复杂导致许多地区对该病的关注不足。

Method: 从UK Biobank队列中选择274,348条个体记录，设计表格数据转换方法生成大规模语料库，用于训练和评估MDD-LLM。

Result: MDD-LLM（70B）的准确率为0.8378，AUC为0.8919，显著优于现有机器学习和深度学习框架。

Conclusion: MDD-LLM在抑郁症诊断中表现出色，同时探讨了影响性能的因素，如数据转换技术和微调策略。

Abstract: Major depressive disorder (MDD) impacts more than 300 million people
worldwide, highlighting a significant public health issue. However, the uneven
distribution of medical resources and the complexity of diagnostic methods have
resulted in inadequate attention to this disorder in numerous countries and
regions. This paper introduces a high-performance MDD diagnosis tool named
MDD-LLM, an AI-driven framework that utilizes fine-tuned large language models
(LLMs) and extensive real-world samples to tackle challenges in MDD diagnosis.
Therefore, we select 274,348 individual information from the UK Biobank cohort
to train and evaluate the proposed method. Specifically, we select 274,348
individual records from the UK Biobank cohort and design a tabular data
transformation method to create a large corpus for training and evaluating the
proposed approach. To illustrate the advantages of MDD-LLM, we perform
comprehensive experiments and provide several comparative analyses against
existing model-based solutions across multiple evaluation metrics. Experimental
results show that MDD-LLM (70B) achieves an accuracy of 0.8378 and an AUC of
0.8919 (95% CI: 0.8799 - 0.9040), significantly outperforming existing machine
learning and deep learning frameworks for MDD diagnosis. Given the limited
exploration of LLMs in MDD diagnosis, we examine numerous factors that may
influence the performance of our proposed method, such as tabular data
transformation techniques and different fine-tuning strategies.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于频谱生成建模的NLP框架，替代Transformer中的自注意力机制，通过联合学习全局时变傅里叶字典和每个token的混合系数，实现了线性计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自注意力机制的计算复杂度高，限制了Transformer的可扩展性。本文旨在提出一种更高效的替代方案。

Method: 结合时间域（嵌入重建）和频域（短时傅里叶变换幅度匹配）的重建损失，以及GMM先验对混合向量建模，优化语言建模目标。

Result: 在WikiText2和Penn Treebank等基准测试中，取得了与Transformer相当的困惑度和生成质量，同时显著降低了推理延迟和内存占用。

Conclusion: 频谱字典模型是一种高效且性能优越的替代方案，适用于可扩展的语言建模。

Abstract: We propose a novel spectral generative modeling framework for natural
language processing that jointly learns a global time varying Fourier
dictionary and per token mixing coefficients, replacing the ubiquitous self
attention mechanism in transformer architectures. By enforcing reconstruction
losses in both the time domain (embedding reconstruction) and the frequency
domain (via Short Time Fourier Transform magnitude matching) alongside a
standard language modeling objective, and fitting a Gaussian Mixture Model
(GMM) prior over the learned mixing vectors, our approach achieves competitive
perplexity and generation quality on standard benchmarks such as WikiText2 and
Penn Treebank. In contrast to the quadratic computation complexity of self
attention, our method operates with linear complexity, delivering substantial
efficiency gains. We demonstrate that spectral dictionary models can achieve
competitive performance compared to transformer baselines while significantly
reducing inference latency and memory footprint, offering a compelling
alternative for scalable language modeling.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在自然语言处理任务中表现优异，但大参数模型需要巨大的计算资源。为降低成本，研究探索了小参数模型在钓鱼邮件检测中的有效性。

Method: 采用提示工程、解释增强微调和模型集成等方法优化小参数大语言模型的性能。

Result: 实验验证了方法的有效性，准确率从基线模型的0.5提升至0.976。

Conclusion: 小参数大语言模型通过优化方法可以在钓鱼邮件检测中达到高性能，同时降低计算成本。

Abstract: Large language models(LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on many
natural language processing(NLP) tasks and have been employed in phishing email
detection research. However, in current studies, well-performing LLMs typically
contain billions or even tens of billions of parameters, requiring enormous
computational resources. To reduce computational costs, we investigated the
effectiveness of small-parameter LLMs for phishing email detection. These LLMs
have around 3 billion parameters and can run on consumer-grade GPUs. However,
small LLMs often perform poorly in phishing email detection task. To address
these issues, we designed a set of methods including Prompt Engineering,
Explanation Augmented Fine-tuning, and Model Ensemble to improve phishing email
detection capabilities of small LLMs. We validated the effectiveness of our
approach through experiments, significantly improving accuracy on the
SpamAssassin dataset from around 0.5 for baseline models like
Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct to 0.976.

Motivation: 研究嘻哈歌词的语言复杂性及其与社会文化趋势的关系，揭示嘻哈音乐作为艺术形式和社会动态反映的演变。

Method: 使用自然语言处理技术分析3,814首歌曲的词汇多样性、押韵密度、主题内容和情感极性，并进行多维度统计分析。

Result: 词汇多样性增加23.7%，押韵密度提高34.2%，主题内容从社会正义转向内省，情感在政治危机时更负面，地域和时间对风格有显著影响。

Conclusion: 研究为嘻哈音乐的语言创新与文化背景的相互作用提供了量化证据，揭示了其作为艺术形式和社会动态反映的演变。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive computational framework for analyzing
linguistic complexity and socio-cultural trends in hip-hop lyrics. Using a
dataset of 3,814 songs from 146 influential artists spanning four decades
(1980-2020), we employ natural language processing techniques to quantify
multiple dimensions of lyrical complexity. Our analysis reveals a 23.7%
increase in vocabulary diversity over the study period, with East Coast artists
demonstrating 17.3% higher lexical variation than other regions. Rhyme density
increased by 34.2% across all regions, with Midwest artists exhibiting the
highest technical complexity (3.04 rhymes per line). Topic modeling identified
significant shifts in thematic content, with social justice themes decreasing
from 28.5% to 13.8% of content while introspective themes increased from 7.6%
to 26.3%. Sentiment analysis demon- strated that lyrics became significantly
more negative during sociopolitical crises, with polarity decreasing by 0.31
following major social unrest. Multi-dimensional analysis revealed four dis-
tinct stylistic approaches that correlate strongly with geographic origin
(r=0.68, p!0.001) and time period (r=0.59, p<0.001). These findings establish
quantitative evidence for the evolution of hip- hop as both an art form and a
reflection of societal dynamics, providing insights into the interplay between
linguistic innovation and cultural context in popular music.

TL;DR: 研究发现，尽管LLM在说服选民方面与传统政治广告效果相当，但其大规模应用仍受限于成本和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM是否比传统政治竞选方法更具成本效益的说服力，尤其是在大规模选民中的潜在威胁。

Method: 通过两项调查实验（N=10,417）和现实模拟，评估LLM与人类互动及短期/长期说服效果。

Result: LLM说服每位选民成本为48-74美元，低于传统的100美元，但传统方法更易扩展。

Conclusion: 目前LLM在大规模政治说服中优势有限，但随着技术发展，其潜力可能提升。

Abstract: In recent years, significant concern has emerged regarding the potential
threat that Large Language Models (LLMs) pose to democratic societies through
their persuasive capabilities. We expand upon existing research by conducting
two survey experiments and a real-world simulation exercise to determine
whether it is more cost effective to persuade a large number of voters using
LLM chatbots compared to standard political campaign practice, taking into
account both the "receive" and "accept" steps in the persuasion process (Zaller
1992). These experiments improve upon previous work by assessing extended
interactions between humans and LLMs (instead of using single-shot
interactions) and by assessing both short- and long-run persuasive effects
(rather than simply asking users to rate the persuasiveness of LLM-produced
content). In two survey experiments (N = 10,417) across three distinct
political domains, we find that while LLMs are about as persuasive as actual
campaign ads once voters are exposed to them, political persuasion in the
real-world depends on both exposure to a persuasive message and its impact
conditional on exposure. Through simulations based on real-world parameters, we
estimate that LLM-based persuasion costs between \$48-\$74 per persuaded voter
compared to \$100 for traditional campaign methods, when accounting for the
costs of exposure. However, it is currently much easier to scale traditional
campaign persuasion methods than LLM-based persuasion. While LLMs do not
currently appear to have substantially greater potential for large-scale
political persuasion than existing non-LLM methods, this may change as LLM
capabilities continue to improve and it becomes easier to scalably encourage
exposure to persuasive LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型（LLM）通常针对“平均用户”偏好进行对齐，而忽略了用户个体差异，亟需个性化解决方案。

Method: 提出HyPerAlign方法，通过少量用户示例推断其沟通策略、个性和写作风格，并基于这些假设生成定制化输出。

Result: 在作者归属和协商对齐任务中，HyPerAlign显著优于传统方法，帮助性提升高达70%，作者归属任务胜率普遍超过90%。

Conclusion: HyPerAlign是一种高效且可解释的LLM个性化策略，适用于多样化的用户和任务。

Abstract: Alignment algorithms are widely used to align large language models (LLMs) to
human users based on preference annotations that reflect their intended
real-world use cases. Typically these (often divergent) preferences are
aggregated over a diverse set of users, resulting in fine-tuned models that are
aligned to the ``average-user'' preference. Nevertheless, current models are
used by individual users in very specific contexts and situations, emphasizing
the need for user-dependent preference control. In this work we address the
problem of personalizing LLM outputs to their users, aiming to generate
customized responses tailored to individual users, instead of generic outputs
that emulate the collective voices of diverse populations. We propose a novel
interpretable and sample-efficient hypotheses-driven personalization approach
(HyPerAlign) where given few-shot examples written by a particular user, we
first infer hypotheses about their communication strategies, personality and
writing style, then prompt LLM models with these hypotheses and user specific
attributes to generate customized outputs. We conduct experiments on two
different personalization tasks, authorship attribution and deliberative
alignment, with datasets from diverse domains (news articles, blog posts,
emails, jailbreaking benchmarks), and demonstrate the superiority of
hypotheses-driven personalization approach when compared to preference-based
fine-tuning methods. For deliberative alignment, the helpfulness of LLM models
is improved by up to $70\%$ on average. For authorship attribution, results
indicate consistently high win-rates (commonly $>90\%$) against
state-of-the-art preference fine-tuning approaches for LLM personalization
across diverse user profiles and LLM models. Overall, our approach represents
an interpretable and sample-efficient strategy for the personalization of LLM
models to individual users.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律规范具有层次结构、大量引用和多版本的特点，传统方法难以处理其复杂性。

Method: 通过结合知识图谱和文本单元，构建更丰富的法律知识表示，并整合层次结构和时间演化。

Result: Graph RAG在法律规范数据集上的应用显著提升了法律人工智能的效果。

Conclusion: 该方法为法律研究、立法分析和决策支持提供了更有效的工具。

Abstract: This article proposes an adaptation of Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation
(Graph RAG) specifically designed for the analysis and comprehension of legal
norms, which are characterized by their predefined hierarchical structure,
extensive network of internal and external references and multiple temporal
versions. By combining structured knowledge graphs with contextually enriched
text segments, Graph RAG offers a promising solution to address the inherent
complexity and vast volume of legal data. The integration of hierarchical
structure and temporal evolution into knowledge graphs - along with the concept
of comprehensive Text Units - facilitates the construction of richer,
interconnected representations of legal knowledge. Through a detailed analysis
of Graph RAG and its application to legal norm datasets, this article aims to
significantly advance the field of Artificial Intelligence applied to Law,
creating opportunities for more effective systems in legal research,
legislative analysis, and decision support.

Motivation: 探讨对齐技术是否应普遍适用，揭示其对某些任务（如需要不可预测输出的任务）的负面影响。

Method: 研究随机数生成、混合策略游戏（如石头剪刀布和捉迷藏）和创意写作等任务，对比基础模型与对齐模型的表现。

Result: 对齐模型在需要不可预测输出的任务中表现较差，例如生成偏向特定数字、游戏策略可预测或创意写作缺乏原创性。

Conclusion: 对齐技术并非适用于所有任务，需权衡其在通用基准和特定任务中的表现。

Abstract: Alignment has quickly become a default ingredient in LLM development, with
techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback making models act
safely, follow instructions, and perform ever-better on complex tasks. While
these techniques are certainly useful, we propose that they should not be
universally applied and demonstrate a range of tasks on which base language
models consistently outperform their popular aligned forms. Particularly, we
study tasks that require unpredictable outputs, such as random number
generation, mixed strategy games (rock-paper-scissors and hide-and-seek), and
creative writing. In each case, aligned models tend towards narrow behaviors
that result in distinct disadvantages, for instance, preferring to generate "7"
over other uniformly random numbers, becoming almost fully predictable in some
game states, or prioritizing pleasant writing over creative originality. Across
models tested, better performance on common benchmarks tends to correlate with
worse performance on our tasks, suggesting an effective trade-off in the
required capabilities.

Result: 发现情绪模式与时尚主题受欢迎程度相关，预测模型准确率达78.35%。

Conclusion: 社交媒体情绪分析可作为时尚趋势的有效早期指标。

Abstract: This study explores the intersection of fashion trends and social media
sentiment through computational analysis of Twitter data using the T4SA
(Twitter for Sentiment Analysis) dataset. By applying natural language
processing and machine learning techniques, we examine how sentiment patterns
in fashion-related social media conversations can serve as predictors for
emerging fashion trends. Our analysis involves the identification and
categorization of fashion-related content, sentiment classification with
improved normalization techniques, time series decomposition, statistically
validated causal relationship modeling, cross-platform sentiment comparison,
and brand-specific sentiment analysis. Results indicate correlations between
sentiment patterns and fashion theme popularity, with accessories and
streetwear themes showing statistically significant rising trends. The Granger
causality analysis establishes sustainability and streetwear as primary trend
drivers, showing bidirectional relationships with several other themes. The
findings demonstrate that social media sentiment analysis can serve as an
effective early indicator of fashion trend trajectories when proper statistical
validation is applied. Our improved predictive model achieved 78.35% balanced
accuracy in sentiment classification, establishing a reliable foundation for
trend prediction across positive, neutral, and negative sentiment categories.

Result: 该方法优于现有聚类方法，生成更一致和连贯的聚类结果，同时支持适应性和符合人类直觉。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在表情包聚类中表现优异，代码已公开以支持后续研究。

Abstract: Meme clustering is critical for toxicity detection, virality modeling, and
typing, but it has received little attention in previous research. Clustering
similar Internet memes is challenging due to their multimodality, cultural
context, and adaptability. Existing approaches rely on databases, overlook
semantics, and struggle to handle diverse dimensions of similarity. This paper
introduces a novel method that uses template-based matching with
multi-dimensional similarity features, thus eliminating the need for predefined
databases and supporting adaptive matching. Memes are clustered using local and
global features across similarity categories such as form, visual content,
text, and identity. Our combined approach outperforms existing clustering
methods, producing more consistent and coherent clusters, while
similarity-based feature sets enable adaptability and align with human
intuition. We make all supporting code publicly available to support subsequent
research. Code: https://github.com/tygobl/meme-clustering

Motivation: 尽管语音识别任务在某些指标上已接近人类水平，但在复杂现实场景（如远距离语音）中仍表现不佳。BERSt数据集旨在填补这一研究空白。

Method: 通过智能手机收集98位演员在不同家庭环境中的语音数据，包括多种情感提示、喊叫和普通语音，以及19种不同位置（包括障碍物和不同房间）。

Result: ASR性能随距离和喊叫程度增加而下降，且情感意图对识别效果有影响。BERSt数据集对ASR和SER任务均具有挑战性。

Conclusion: BERSt数据集为复杂场景下的语音识别研究提供了新资源，未来需进一步提升系统的鲁棒性以适应现实需求。

Abstract: Some speech recognition tasks, such as automatic speech recognition (ASR),
are approaching or have reached human performance in many reported metrics.
Yet, they continue to struggle in complex, real-world, situations, such as with
distanced speech. Previous challenges have released datasets to address the
issue of distanced ASR, however, the focus remains primarily on distance,
specifically relying on multi-microphone array systems. Here we present the
B(asic) E(motion) R(andom phrase) S(hou)t(s) (BERSt) dataset. The dataset
contains almost 4 hours of English speech from 98 actors with varying regional
and non-native accents. The data was collected on smartphones in the actors
homes and therefore includes at least 98 different acoustic environments. The
data also includes 7 different emotion prompts and both shouted and spoken
utterances. The smartphones were places in 19 different positions, including
obstructions and being in a different room than the actor. This data is
publicly available for use and can be used to evaluate a variety of speech
recognition tasks, including: ASR, shout detection, and speech emotion
recognition (SER). We provide initial benchmarks for ASR and SER tasks, and
find that ASR degrades both with an increase in distance and shout level and
shows varied performance depending on the intended emotion. Our results show
that the BERSt dataset is challenging for both ASR and SER tasks and continued
work is needed to improve the robustness of such systems for more accurate
real-world use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在商业智能（BI）中的应用因语义幻觉、结构错误和缺乏领域特定评估框架而受限。

Method: 使用Exaone 3.5 LLM，构建了一个包含219个自然语言问题的基准测试，评估了答案准确性、执行成功率等指标。

Result: Exaone 3.5在简单任务中表现良好（93%准确率），但在复杂任务中表现较差（算术推理4%准确率）。

Conclusion: LLM在商业关键环境中存在局限性，需要事实一致性验证层和混合推理方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in enabling natural language
interfaces for structured data querying through text-to-SQL generation.
However, their application in real-world Business Intelligence (BI) contexts
remains limited due to semantic hallucinations, structural errors, and a lack
of domain-specific evaluation frameworks. In this study, we propose a
Fact-Consistency Evaluation Framework for assessing the semantic accuracy of
LLM-generated SQL outputs using Exaone 3.5--an instruction-tuned, bilingual LLM
optimized for enterprise tasks. We construct a domain-specific benchmark
comprising 219 natural language business questions across five SQL complexity
levels, derived from actual sales data in LG Electronics' internal BigQuery
environment. Each question is paired with a gold-standard SQL query and a
validated ground-truth answer. We evaluate model performance using answer
accuracy, execution success rate, semantic error rate, and non-response rate.
Experimental results show that while Exaone 3.5 performs well on simple
aggregation tasks (93% accuracy in L1), it exhibits substantial degradation in
arithmetic reasoning (4% accuracy in H1) and grouped ranking tasks (31% in H4),
with semantic errors and non-responses concentrated in complex cases.
Qualitative error analysis further identifies common failure types such as
misapplied arithmetic logic, incomplete filtering, and incorrect grouping
operations. Our findings highlight the current limitations of LLMs in
business-critical environments and underscore the need for fact-consistency
validation layers and hybrid reasoning approaches. This work contributes a
reproducible benchmark and evaluation methodology for advancing reliable
natural language interfaces to structured enterprise data systems.

Abstract: This study examines vulnerabilities in transformer-based automated
short-answer grading systems used in medical education, with a focus on how
these systems can be manipulated through adversarial gaming strategies. Our
research identifies three main types of gaming strategies that exploit the
system's weaknesses, potentially leading to false positives. To counteract
these vulnerabilities, we implement several adversarial training methods
designed to enhance the systems' robustness. Our results indicate that these
methods significantly reduce the susceptibility of grading systems to such
manipulations, especially when combined with ensemble techniques like majority
voting and ridge regression, which further improve the system's defense against
sophisticated adversarial inputs. Additionally, employing large language models
such as GPT-4 with varied prompting techniques has shown promise in recognizing
and scoring gaming strategies effectively. The findings underscore the
importance of continuous improvements in AI-driven educational tools to ensure

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GDI-Bench是一个全面的文档智能基准测试，包含1.9k图像和19个任务，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的能力，并识别其弱点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试无法系统识别模型弱点或指导改进，因此需要开发一个更全面的评估工具。

Method: 通过解耦视觉和推理复杂性，GDI-Bench设计分级任务，并提出了GDI模型，采用智能保留训练策略以避免灾难性遗忘。

Result: GDI模型在现有基准和GDI-Bench上表现优异，GPT-4o在推理任务中表现突出，但视觉能力有限。

Conclusion: GDI-Bench和GDI模型为文档智能领域提供了有效的评估和优化工具，并将开源。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has
profoundly impacted the document domain, creating a wide array of application
scenarios. This progress highlights the need for a comprehensive benchmark to
evaluate these models' capabilities across various document-specific tasks.
However, existing benchmarks often fail to locate specific model weaknesses or
guide systematic improvements. To bridge this gap, we introduce a General
Document Intelligence Benchmark (GDI-Bench), featuring 1.9k images across 9 key
scenarios and 19 document-specific tasks. By decoupling visual complexity and
reasoning complexity, the GDI-Bench structures graded tasks that allow
performance assessment by difficulty, aiding in model weakness identification
and optimization guidance. We evaluate the GDI-Bench on various open-source and
closed-source models, conducting decoupled analyses in the visual and reasoning
domains. For instance, the GPT-4o model excels in reasoning tasks but exhibits
limitations in visual capabilities. To address the diverse tasks and domains in
the GDI-Bench, we propose a GDI Model that mitigates the issue of catastrophic
forgetting during the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) process through a
intelligence-preserving training strategy. Our model achieves state-of-the-art
performance on previous benchmarks and the GDI-Bench. Both our benchmark and
model will be open source.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放书问答中模型答案依赖上下文而非参数知识的问题，现有评估方法存在偏见、扩展性差和依赖外部系统等局限。

Method: 提出一种新指标，对比模型在有上下文和无上下文时的困惑度，生成分数以量化答案对上下文的依赖。

Result: 实验证明该指标能有效识别答案是否基于上下文，且计算高效、可解释、适应性强。

Conclusion: 新指标为开放书问答系统提供了一种可扩展且实用的上下文利用评估方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable success in
open-book question answering (QA), where the task requires generating answers
grounded in a provided external context. A critical challenge in open-book QA
is to ensure that model responses are based on the provided context rather than
its parametric knowledge, which can be outdated, incomplete, or incorrect.
Existing evaluation methods, primarily based on the LLM-as-a-judge approach,
face significant limitations, including biases, scalability issues, and
dependence on costly external systems. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel metric that contrasts the perplexity of the model response under two
conditions: when the context is provided and when it is not. The resulting
score quantifies the extent to which the model's answer relies on the provided
context. The validity of this metric is demonstrated through a series of
experiments that show its effectiveness in identifying whether a given answer
is grounded in the provided context. Unlike existing approaches, this metric is
computationally efficient, interpretable, and adaptable to various use cases,
offering a scalable and practical solution to assess context utilization in
open-book QA systems.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在翻译低资源黎巴嫩方言时的效果，发现使用文化真实的小数据集比大数据集表现更好，对比微调方法效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨文化真实性数据对低资源方言翻译的影响，挑战“数据越多越好”的范式。

Method: 比较三种微调方法（基础、对比、语法提示），使用开源Aya23模型，并引入LebEval新基准。

Result: 文化真实的小数据集（LW）表现优于大数据集，对比微调结合对比提示效果最佳。

Conclusion: 文化真实性在方言翻译中至关重要，新基准LebEval提供了更真实的评估。

Abstract: This paper examines the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
translating the low-resource Lebanese dialect, focusing on the impact of
culturally authentic data versus larger translated datasets. We compare three
fine-tuning approaches: Basic, contrastive, and grammar-hint tuning, using
open-source Aya23 models. Experiments reveal that models fine-tuned on a
smaller but culturally aware Lebanese dataset (LW) consistently outperform
those trained on larger, non-native data. The best results were achieved
through contrastive fine-tuning paired with contrastive prompting, which
indicates the benefits of exposing translation models to bad examples. In
addition, to ensure authentic evaluation, we introduce LebEval, a new benchmark
derived from native Lebanese content, and compare it to the existing FLoRes
benchmark. Our findings challenge the "More Data is Better" paradigm and
emphasize the crucial role of cultural authenticity in dialectal translation.
We made our datasets and code available on Github.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLMs）在推理长度与答案正确性之间存在矛盾：简单问题过度推理，复杂问题推理不足。通过偏好优化算法减少生成长度，可在保持准确性的同时显著缩短输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在推理长度与答案正确性之间的关系，揭示模型可能误判问题难度并无法合理调整响应长度。

Method: 通过系统性实证研究分析推理长度与答案正确性的关系，并采用偏好优化算法减少生成长度。

Result: LLMs在简单问题上过度推理，复杂问题上推理不足；通过长度优化可显著减少输出长度且保持准确性。

Conclusion: 生成长度是推理行为的重要信号，未来需进一步探索LLMs在推理长度自适应方面的自我意识。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly optimized for long reasoning,
under the assumption that more reasoning leads to better performance. However,
emerging evidence suggests that longer responses can sometimes degrade accuracy
rather than improve it. In this paper, we conduct a systematic empirical study
of the relationship between reasoning length and answer correctness. We find
that LLMs tend to overthink simple problems, generating unnecessarily long
outputs, and underthink harder ones, failing to extend their reasoning when it
is most needed. This indicates that models might misjudge problem difficulty
and fail to calibrate their response length appropriately. Furthermore, we
investigate the effects of length reduction with a preference optimization
algorithm when simply preferring the shorter responses regardless of answer
correctness. Experiments show that the generation length can be significantly
reduced while maintaining acceptable accuracy. Our findings highlight
generation length as a meaningful signal for reasoning behavior and motivate
further exploration into LLMs' self-awareness in reasoning length adaptation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了小语言模型（SLMs）在上下文学习（ICL）中的性能差距，提出AdaptMI和AdaptMI+方法，通过自适应选择技能示例提升SLMs的数学问题解决能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有技能提示策略在大语言模型（LLMs）中有效，但在SLMs中效果不佳，甚至可能因信息过载而降低性能。

Method: 提出AdaptMI和AdaptMI+方法，基于认知负荷理论，自适应地选择技能示例，仅在其表现不佳时引入，并针对缺失技能补充示例。

Result: 在5-shot评估中，AdaptMI+在多个数学基准和SLMs上比传统技能策略提升准确率高达6%。

Conclusion: AdaptMI+通过自适应技能示例选择，有效解决了SLMs在ICL中的性能问题，为小模型优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) allows a language model to improve its
problem-solving capability when provided with suitable information in context.
Since the choice of in-context information can be determined based on the
problem itself, in-context learning is analogous to human learning from
teachers in a classroom. Recent works (Didolkar et al., 2024a; 2024b) show that
ICL performance can be improved by leveraging a frontier large language model's
(LLM) ability to predict required skills to solve a problem, popularly referred
to as an LLM's metacognition, and using the recommended skills to construct
necessary in-context examples. While this skill-based strategy boosts ICL
performance in larger models, its gains on small language models (SLMs) have
been minimal, highlighting a performance gap in ICL capabilities. We
investigate this gap and show that skill-based prompting can hurt SLM
performance on easy questions by introducing unnecessary information, akin to
cognitive overload. To address this, we introduce AdaptMI, an adaptive approach
to selecting skill-based in-context Math Instructions for SLMs. Inspired by
cognitive load theory from human pedagogy, our method only introduces
skill-based examples when the model performs poorly. We further propose
AdaptMI+, which adds examples targeted to the specific skills missing from the
model's responses. On 5-shot evaluations across popular math benchmarks and
five SLMs (1B--7B; Qwen, Llama), AdaptMI+ improves accuracy by up to 6% over
naive skill-based strategies.

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR数据集上的实验验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架通过设计实现可解释性，有望提升医疗AI的临床接受度。

Abstract: The development of AI-based methods for analyzing radiology reports could
lead to significant advances in medical diagnosis--from improving diagnostic
accuracy to enhancing efficiency and reducing workload. However, the lack of
interpretability in these methods has hindered their adoption in clinical
settings. In this paper, we propose an interpretable-by-design framework for
classifying radiology reports. The key idea is to extract a set of most
informative queries from a large set of reports and use these queries and their
corresponding answers to predict a diagnosis. Thus, the explanation for a
prediction is, by construction, the set of selected queries and answers. We use
the Information Pursuit framework to select informative queries, the Flan-T5
model to determine if facts are present in the report, and a classifier to
predict the disease. Experiments on the MIMIC-CXR dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, highlighting its potential to enhance
trust and usability in medical AI.

this gap, we enhance the KoLLA Korean learner corpus by adding multiple
grammatical error correction (GEC) references, thereby enabling more nuanced
and flexible evaluation of GEC systems, and reflects the variability of human
language. Additionally, we enrich the corpus with rubric-based scores aligned

Conclusion: 呼吁建立更全面的基准和跨学科合作，以提高语言模型的一致性，同时保持其实用性和适应性。

Abstract: The hallmark of effective language use lies in consistency -- expressing
similar meanings in similar contexts and avoiding contradictions. While human
communication naturally demonstrates this principle, state-of-the-art language
models struggle to maintain reliable consistency across different scenarios.
This paper examines the landscape of consistency research in AI language
systems, exploring both formal consistency (including logical rule adherence)
and informal consistency (such as moral and factual coherence). We analyze
current approaches to measure aspects of consistency, identify critical
research gaps in standardization of definitions, multilingual assessment, and
methods to improve consistency. Our findings point to an urgent need for robust
benchmarks to measure and interdisciplinary approaches to ensure consistency in
the application of language models on domain-specific tasks while preserving
the utility and adaptability.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming education, presenting
unprecedented opportunities for personalized learning and streamlined content
creation. However, realizing the full potential of AI in educational settings
necessitates careful consideration of the quality, cognitive depth, and ethical
implications of AI-generated materials. This paper synthesizes insights from

encompassing cognitive alignment, linguistic feedback integration, and ethical
safeguards. The practical application of this framework is demonstrated through
its integration into OneClickQuiz, an AI-powered Moodle plugin for quiz
generation. This work contributes a comprehensive and actionable guide for
educators, researchers, and developers aiming to harness AI's potential while

Motivation: 现有研究主要基于小规模成人数据集，缺乏针对青少年认知扭曲的大规模研究，因此需要填补这一空白。

Method: 使用多LLM协商方法进行认知扭曲分类，并通过认知澄清和认知平衡生成合成数据。

Result: LLM在显性标记分类上表现良好，但在上下文推理上不如人类评估者。

Conclusion: KoACD数据集将推动未来认知扭曲检测的研究。

Abstract: Cognitive distortion refers to negative thinking patterns that can lead to
mental health issues like depression and anxiety in adolescents. Previous
studies using natural language processing (NLP) have focused mainly on
small-scale adult datasets, with limited research on adolescents. This study
introduces KoACD, the first large-scale dataset of cognitive distortions in
Korean adolescents, containing 108,717 instances. We applied a multi-Large
Language Model (LLM) negotiation method to refine distortion classification and
generate synthetic data using two approaches: cognitive clarification for
textual clarity and cognitive balancing for diverse distortion representation.
Validation through LLMs and expert evaluations showed that while LLMs
classified distortions with explicit markers, they struggled with
context-dependent reasoning, where human evaluators demonstrated higher
accuracy. KoACD aims to enhance future research on cognitive distortion
detection.

Motivation: 当前无监督句子表示方法主要基于判别式预训练语言模型，而生成式模型由于参数规模大，相关研究较少。鉴于生成式模型在学术界和工业界的广泛应用，亟需一种适用于解码器专用模型的高效无监督文本表示框架。

Method: 提出CSE-SFP方法，利用生成模型的结构特性，仅需单次前向传播即可实现有效的无监督对比学习。

Result: 实验表明，CSE-SFP不仅生成更高质量的嵌入，还显著减少了训练时间和内存消耗。此外，引入了两种比率指标，用于评估编码模型的语义空间特性。

Conclusion: CSE-SFP为生成式预训练语言模型提供了一种高效的文本表示框架，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: As a fundamental task in Information Retrieval and Computational Linguistics,
sentence representation has profound implications for a wide range of practical
applications such as text clustering, content analysis, question-answering
systems, and web search. Recent advances in pre-trained language models (PLMs)
have driven remarkable progress in this field, particularly through
unsupervised embedding derivation methods centered on discriminative PLMs like
BERT. However, due to time and computational constraints, few efforts have
attempted to integrate unsupervised sentence representation with generative
PLMs, which typically possess much larger parameter sizes. Given that
state-of-the-art models in both academia and industry are predominantly based
on generative architectures, there is a pressing need for an efficient
unsupervised text representation framework tailored to decoder-only PLMs. To
address this concern, we propose CSE-SFP, an innovative method that exploits
the structural characteristics of generative models. Compared to existing
strategies, CSE-SFP requires only a single forward pass to perform effective
unsupervised contrastive learning. Rigorous experimentation demonstrates that
CSE-SFP not only produces higher-quality embeddings but also significantly
reduces both training time and memory consumption. Furthermore, we introduce
two ratio metrics that jointly assess alignment and uniformity, thereby
providing a more robust means for evaluating the semantic spatial properties of
encoding models.

Motivation: 识别法律中的监管语句有助于衡量法规密度和严格性，但现有方法定义不一，需提出明确方法以应对欧盟庞大的法律文本。

Method: 基于机构语法工具定义监管语句，开发并比较依赖解析和Transformer模型两种方法。

Result: 两种方法准确率分别为80%和84%，K alpha为0.58，表现相似但一致性不高。

Conclusion: 两种方法各有优势，结合使用可能提升性能。

Abstract: Identifying regulatory statements in legislation is useful for developing
metrics to measure the regulatory density and strictness of legislation. A
computational method is valuable for scaling the identification of such
statements from a growing body of EU legislation, constituting approximately
180,000 published legal acts between 1952 and 2023. Past work on extraction of
these statements varies in the permissiveness of their definitions for what
constitutes a regulatory statement. In this work, we provide a specific
definition for our purposes based on the institutional grammar tool. We develop
and compare two contrasting approaches for automatically identifying such
statements in EU legislation, one based on dependency parsing, and the other on
a transformer-based machine learning model. We found both approaches performed
similarly well with accuracies of 80% and 84% respectively and a K alpha of
0.58. The high accuracies and not exceedingly high agreement suggests potential
for combining strengths of both approaches.

challenge. Existing benchmarks for hallucination detection are often
synthetically generated, narrowly focused on extractive question answering, and
fail to capture the complexity of real-world scenarios involving multi-document

diverse, task-agnostic dataset that includes examples from a range of domains
and formats. Using this benchmark, we evaluate seven hallucination detection
systems$\unicode{x2013}$both open and closed
source$\unicode{x2013}$highlighting differences in performance across tasks,
document lengths, and input representations. Our analysis highlights
substantial performance disparities between short and long contexts, with
critical implications for real-world Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

Abstract: The recent development of reasoning language models (RLMs) represents a novel
evolution in large language models. In particular, the recent release of
DeepSeek-R1 has generated widespread social impact and sparked enthusiasm in
the research community for exploring the explicit reasoning paradigm of
language models. However, the implementation details of the released models
have not been fully open-sourced by DeepSeek, including DeepSeek-R1-Zero,
DeepSeek-R1, and the distilled small models. As a result, many replication
studies have emerged aiming to reproduce the strong performance achieved by
DeepSeek-R1, reaching comparable performance through similar training
procedures and fully open-source data resources. These works have investigated
feasible strategies for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning
from verifiable rewards (RLVR), focusing on data preparation and method design,
yielding various valuable insights. In this report, we provide a summary of
recent replication studies to inspire future research. We primarily focus on
SFT and RLVR as two main directions, introducing the details for data
construction, method design and training procedure of current replication
studies. Moreover, we conclude key findings from the implementation details and
experimental results reported by these studies, anticipating to inspire future
research. We also discuss additional techniques of enhancing RLMs, highlighting
the potential of expanding the application scope of these models, and
discussing the challenges in development. By this survey, we aim to help
researchers and developers of RLMs stay updated with the latest advancements,
and seek to inspire new ideas to further enhance RLMs.

LLMs can still generate outputs that are fluent yet fundamentally untrue.
Understanding the cognitive dynamics that underlie these hallucinations remains
an open problem. In this study, we propose a prompt-based framework to
systematically trigger and quantify hallucination: a Hallucination-Inducing
Prompt (HIP), which synthetically fuses semantically distant concepts (e.g.,
periodic table of elements and tarot divination) in a misleading way, and a
Hallucination Quantifying Prompt (HQP), which scores the plausibility,
confidence, and coherence of the output. Controlled experiments across multiple
LLMs revealed that HIPs consistently produced less coherent and more
hallucinated responses than their null-fusion controls. These effects varied
across models, with reasoning-oriented LLMs showing distinct profiles from
general-purpose ones. Our framework provides a reproducible testbed for
studying hallucination vulnerability, and opens the door to developing safer,
more introspective LLMs that can detect and self-regulate the onset of
conceptual instability.

*Jushi Kai,Boyi Zeng,Yixuan Wang,Haoli Bai,Bo Jiang,Zhouhan Lin*

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FreqKV的新方法，通过频域压缩KV缓存来高效扩展LLMs的上下文窗口，解决了内存需求和计算复杂度的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展LLMs的上下文窗口对长文本生成至关重要，但现有方法在内存和计算复杂度上存在挑战。

Method: 利用KV缓存在频域中能量集中于低频的特性，提出FreqKV方法，通过过滤高频分量压缩缓存。

Result: 实验表明，FreqKV在长上下文任务中高效且有效，无需额外参数或架构修改。

Conclusion: FreqKV为LLMs的上下文窗口扩展提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Extending the context window in large language models (LLMs) is essential for
applications involving long-form content generation. However, the linear
increase in key-value (KV) cache memory requirements and the quadratic
complexity of self-attention with respect to sequence length present
significant challenges during fine-tuning and inference. Existing methods
suffer from performance degradation when extending to longer contexts. In this
work, we introduce a novel context extension method that optimizes both
fine-tuning and inference efficiency. Our method exploits a key observation: in
the frequency domain, the energy distribution of the KV cache is primarily
concentrated in low-frequency components. By filtering out the high-frequency
components, the KV cache can be effectively compressed with minimal information
loss. Building on this insight, we propose an efficient compression technique,
FreqKV, that iteratively compresses the increasing KV cache to a fixed size in
the frequency domain, applicable to both fine-tuning and inference. FreqKV
introduces no additional parameters or architectural modifications. With
minimal fine-tuning, LLMs can learn to leverage the limited cache that is
compressed in the frequency domain and extend the context window efficiently.
Experiments on various long context language modeling and understanding tasks
demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed method.

Conclusion: 该方法为频域微调大型模型提供了高效途径。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is difficult due to their huge model
size. Recent Fourier domain-based methods show potential for reducing
fine-tuning costs. We propose a block circulant matrix-based fine-tuning method
with a stable training heuristic to leverage the properties of circulant
matrices and one-dimensional Fourier transforms to reduce storage and
computation costs. Experiments show that our method uses $14\times$ less number
of parameters than VeRA, $16\times$ smaller than LoRA and $32\times$ less FLOPs
than FourierFT, while maintaining close or better task performance. Our
approach presents a promising way in frequency domain to fine-tune large models

Conclusion: FineScope框架高效且鲁棒，适用于领域优化LLM的开发，代码将开源。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) from scratch requires significant
computational resources, driving interest in developing smaller,
domain-specific LLMs that maintain both efficiency and strong task performance.
Medium-sized models such as LLaMA, llama} have served as starting points for
domain-specific adaptation, but they often suffer from accuracy degradation
when tested on specialized datasets. We introduce FineScope, a framework for
deriving compact, domain-optimized LLMs from larger pretrained models.
FineScope leverages the Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) framework, inspired by its
ability to produce interpretable feature representations, to extract
domain-specific subsets from large datasets. We apply structured pruning with
domain-specific constraints, ensuring that the resulting pruned models retain
essential knowledge for the target domain. To further enhance performance,
these pruned models undergo self-data distillation, leveraging SAE-curated
datasets to restore key domain-specific information lost during pruning.
Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that FineScope achieves
highly competitive performance, outperforming several large-scale
state-of-the-art LLMs in domain-specific tasks. Additionally, our results show
that FineScope enables pruned models to regain a substantial portion of their
original performance when fine-tuned with SAE-curated datasets. Furthermore,
applying these datasets to fine-tune pretrained LLMs without pruning also
improves their domain-specific accuracy, highlighting the robustness of our
approach. The code will be released.

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何通过调整输入编码中的token-wise提示来增强大语言模型（LLM）的角色分离能力，以减少对表面代理的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保LLM能准确区分不同输入角色（如系统指令、用户查询等）对实现一致的多角色行为至关重要。

Method: 提出了一种通过调整输入编码中的位置ID来强化角色边界信号的机制。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能帮助模型更清晰地区分角色，减少对任务类型和文本开头的依赖。

Conclusion: 通过机制中心的视角，研究为LLM如何更可靠地保持多角色行为提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) that integrate multiple input roles (e.g.,
system instructions, user queries, external tool outputs) are increasingly
prevalent in practice. Ensuring that the model accurately distinguishes
messages from each role -- a concept we call \emph{role separation} -- is
crucial for consistent multi-role behavior. Although recent work often targets
state-of-the-art prompt injection defenses, it remains unclear whether such
methods truly teach LLMs to differentiate roles or merely memorize known
triggers. In this paper, we examine \emph{role-separation learning}: the
process of teaching LLMs to robustly distinguish system and user tokens.
Through a \emph{simple, controlled experimental framework}, we find that
fine-tuned models often rely on two proxies for role identification: (1) task
type exploitation, and (2) proximity to begin-of-text. Although data
augmentation can partially mitigate these shortcuts, it generally leads to
iterative patching rather than a deeper fix. To address this, we propose
reinforcing \emph{invariant signals} that mark role boundaries by adjusting
token-wise cues in the model's input encoding. In particular, manipulating
position IDs helps the model learn clearer distinctions and reduces reliance on
superficial proxies. By focusing on this mechanism-centered perspective, our
work illuminates how LLMs can more reliably maintain consistent multi-role
behavior without merely memorizing known prompts or triggers.

Abstract: Large language models exhibit exciting capabilities, yet can show
surprisingly narrow generalization from finetuning -- from failing to
generalize to simple reversals of relations they are trained on, to missing
logical deductions that can be made from trained information. These failures to
generalize from fine-tuning can hinder practical application of these models.
However, language models' in-context learning shows different inductive biases,
and can generalize better in some of these cases. Here, we explore these
differences in generalization between in-context- and fine-tuning-based
learning. To do so, we constructed several novel datasets to evaluate and
improve models' ability to generalize from finetuning data. The datasets are
constructed to isolate the knowledge in the dataset from that in pretraining,
to create clean tests of generalization. We expose pretrained large models to
controlled subsets of the information in these datasets -- either in context,
or through fine-tuning -- and evaluate their performance on test sets that
require various types of generalization. We find overall that in data-matched
settings, in-context learning can generalize more flexibly than fine-tuning
(though we also find some qualifications of prior findings, such as cases when
fine-tuning can generalize to reversals embedded in a larger structure of
knowledge). We build on these findings to propose a method to enable improved
generalization from fine-tuning: adding in-context inferences to finetuning
data. We show that this method improves generalization across various splits of
our datasets and other benchmarks. Our results have implications for
understanding the inductive biases of different modes of learning in language
models, and practically improving their performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM的快速发展，对其输出提供准确反馈和可扩展监督成为紧迫问题，利用LLM作为批判模型实现自动化监督是一种有前景的解决方案。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1）使用Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct生成4.5K长形式批判数据用于监督微调；2）通过强化学习（基于PRM800K或自动标注数据）进一步提升批判能力。

Result: 基于Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct的批判模型在错误识别基准上显著优于现有模型（如DeepSeek-R1-distill和GPT-4o），并能通过更详细反馈帮助生成模型修正错误。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了LLM的数学批判能力，为自动化监督提供了可行方案。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving, providing accurate
feedback and scalable oversight on their outputs becomes an urgent and critical
problem. Leveraging LLMs as critique models to achieve automated supervision is
a promising solution. In this work, we focus on studying and enhancing the math
critique ability of LLMs. Current LLM critics provide critiques that are too
shallow and superficial on each step, leading to low judgment accuracy and
struggling to offer sufficient feedback for the LLM generator to correct
mistakes. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel and effective two-stage
framework to develop LLM critics that are capable of deliberately critiquing on
each reasoning step of math solutions. In the first stage, we utilize
Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct to generate 4.5K long-form critiques as seed data for
supervised fine-tuning. Each seed critique consists of deliberate step-wise
critiques that includes multi-perspective verifications as well as in-depth
critiques of initial critiques for each reasoning step. Then, we perform
reinforcement learning on the fine-tuned model with either existing
human-labeled data from PRM800K or our automatically annotated data obtained
via Monte Carlo sampling-based correctness estimation, to further incentivize
its critique ability. Our developed critique model built on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct
not only significantly outperforms existing LLM critics (including the
same-sized DeepSeek-R1-distill models and GPT-4o) on various error
identification benchmarks, but also more effectively helps the LLM generator
refine erroneous steps through more detailed feedback.

Abstract: Memory is a fundamental component of AI systems, underpinning large language
models (LLMs) based agents. While prior surveys have focused on memory
applications with LLMs, they often overlook the atomic operations that underlie
memory dynamics. In this survey, we first categorize memory representations
into parametric, contextual structured, and contextual unstructured and then
introduce six fundamental memory operations: Consolidation, Updating, Indexing,
Forgetting, Retrieval, and Compression. We systematically map these operations
to the most relevant research topics across long-term, long-context, parametric
modification, and multi-source memory. By reframing memory systems through the
lens of atomic operations and representation types, this survey provides a
structured and dynamic perspective on research, benchmark datasets, and tools
related to memory in AI, clarifying the functional interplay in LLMs based
agents while outlining promising directions for future research\footnote{The

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
rewriting text across various styles. However, effectively leveraging this
ability for example-based arbitrary style transfer, where an input text is
rewritten to match the style of a given exemplar, remains an open challenge. A
key question is how to describe the style of the exemplar to guide LLMs toward
high-quality rewrites. In this work, we propose a prompting method based on
register analysis to guide LLMs to perform this task. Empirical evaluations
across multiple style transfer tasks show that our prompting approach enhances
style transfer strength while preserving meaning more effectively than existing
prompting strategies.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have garnered significant attention
for their ability to model complex signals across a variety of domains.
Recently, INR-based approaches have emerged as promising frameworks for neural
video compression. While conventional methods primarily focus on embedding
video content into compact neural networks for efficient representation, they
often struggle to reconstruct high-frequency details under stringent model size
constraints, which are critical in practical compression scenarios. To address
this limitation, we propose an INR-based video representation method that
integrates a general-purpose super-resolution (SR) network. Motivated by the
observation that high-frequency components exhibit low temporal redundancy
across frames, our method entrusts the reconstruction of fine details to the SR
network. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
conventional INR-based baselines in terms of reconstruction quality, while
maintaining comparable model sizes.

Abstract: Spinal cord functional MRI studies require precise localization of spinal
levels for reliable voxelwise group analyses. Traditional template-based
registration of the spinal cord uses intervertebral discs for alignment.
However, substantial anatomical variability across individuals exists between
vertebral and spinal levels. This study proposes a novel registration approach
that leverages spinal nerve rootlets to improve alignment accuracy and
reproducibility across individuals. We developed a registration method
leveraging dorsal cervical rootlets segmentation and aligning them non-linearly
with the PAM50 spinal cord template. Validation was performed on a
multi-subject, multi-site dataset (n=267, 44 sites) and a multi-subject dataset
with various neck positions (n=10, 3 sessions). We further validated the method
on task-based functional MRI (n=23) to compare group-level activation maps
using rootlet-based registration to traditional disc-based methods.
Rootlet-based registration showed superior alignment across individuals
compared to the traditional disc-based method. Notably, rootlet positions were
more stable across neck positions. Group-level analysis of task-based
functional MRI using rootlet-based increased Z scores and activation cluster
size compared to disc-based registration (number of active voxels from 3292 to
7978). Rootlet-based registration enhances both inter- and intra-subject
anatomical alignment and yields better spatial normalization for group-level
fMRI analyses. Our findings highlight the potential of rootlet-based
registration to improve the precision and reliability of spinal cord
neuroimaging group analysis.

Result: 实验表明BlindHarmonyDiff优于现有方法，能更好地协调源域图像至目标域，并在下游任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: BlindHarmonyDiff是一种鲁棒且通用的盲协调方法，适用于多样化的MR扫描仪。

Abstract: Blind harmonization has emerged as a promising technique for MR image
harmonization to achieve scale-invariant representations, requiring only target
domain data (i.e., no source domain data necessary). However, existing methods
face limitations such as inter-slice heterogeneity in 3D, moderate image
quality, and limited performance for a large domain gap. To address these
challenges, we introduce BlindHarmonyDiff, a novel blind 3D harmonization
framework that leverages an edge-to-image model tailored specifically to
harmonization. Our framework employs a 3D rectified flow trained on target
domain images to reconstruct the original image from an edge map, then yielding
a harmonized image from the edge of a source domain image. We propose
multi-stride patch training for efficient 3D training and a refinement module
for robust inference by suppressing hallucination. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BlindHarmonyDiff outperforms prior arts by harmonizing diverse
source domain images to the target domain, achieving higher correspondence to
the target domain characteristics. Downstream task-based quality assessments
such as tissue segmentation and age prediction on diverse MR scanners further
confirm the effectiveness of our approach and demonstrate the capability of our
robust and generalizable blind harmonization.

Method: 采用类似MobileNet的深度可分离卷积结构，并引入扩张卷积融合块，结合MSE、L2正则化和光谱角度损失函数。

Result: 在两个公开高光谱数据集上取得了极具竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: DSDCN是一种适用于高光谱图像超分辨率的轻量且高效的方法。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated highly competitive performance in
super-resolution (SR) for natural images by learning mappings from
low-resolution (LR) to high-resolution (HR) images. However, hyperspectral
super-resolution remains an ill-posed problem due to the high spectral
dimensionality of the data and the scarcity of available training samples.
Moreover, existing methods often rely on large models with a high number of
parameters or require the fusion with panchromatic or RGB images, both of which
are often impractical in real-world scenarios. Inspired by the MobileNet
architecture, we introduce a lightweight depthwise separable dilated
convolutional network (DSDCN) to address the aforementioned challenges.
Specifically, our model leverages multiple depthwise separable convolutions,
similar to the MobileNet architecture, and further incorporates a dilated
convolution fusion block to make the model more flexible for the extraction of
both spatial and spectral features. In addition, we propose a custom loss
function that combines mean squared error (MSE), an L2 norm
regularization-based constraint, and a spectral angle-based loss, ensuring the
preservation of both spectral and spatial details. The proposed model achieves
very competitive performance on two publicly available hyperspectral datasets,
making it well-suited for hyperspectral image super-resolution tasks. The

Abstract: Parkinsons Disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that primarily
affects motor functions and can lead to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and
dementia in its advanced stages. With approximately 10 million people diagnosed
globally 1 to 1.8 per 1,000 individuals, according to reports by the Japan
Times and the Parkinson Foundation early and accurate diagnosis of PD is
crucial for improving patient outcomes. While numerous studies have utilized
machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques for PD recognition,
existing surveys are limited in scope, often focusing on single data modalities
and failing to capture the potential of multimodal approaches. To address these
gaps, this study presents a comprehensive review of PD recognition systems
across diverse data modalities, including Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI),
gait-based pose analysis, gait sensory data, handwriting analysis, speech test
data, Electroencephalography (EEG), and multimodal fusion techniques. Based on
over 347 articles from leading scientific databases, this review examines key
aspects such as data collection methods, settings, feature representations, and
system performance, with a focus on recognition accuracy and robustness. This
survey aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for researchers, providing
actionable guidance for the development of next generation PD recognition
systems. By leveraging diverse data modalities and cutting-edge machine
learning paradigms, this work contributes to advancing the state of PD
diagnostics and improving patient care through innovative, multimodal

### [120] [Deep Learning Assisted Outer Volume Removal for Highly-Accelerated Real-Time Dynamic MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00643)
*Merve Gülle,Sebastian Weingärtner,Mehmet Akçakaya*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型外体积去除（OVR）方法，通过后处理框架消除非心脏区域的混叠伪影，结合深度学习模型和物理驱动DL方法，显著提升了实时动态MRI的图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时动态MRI在捕捉快速生理过程中至关重要，但高加速率下混叠伪影问题严重，影响心脏功能评估。

Method: 利用时间交错欠采样模式的复合时间图像估计外体积信号，训练深度学习模型去除伪影，再通过物理驱动DL方法重建高分辨率图像。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在高加速率下图像质量与临床基线图像相当，且优于传统重建技术。

Conclusion: 该方法无需修改采集过程即可有效减少伪影，为实时动态MRI的高加速率提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time (RT) dynamic MRI plays a vital role in capturing rapid
physiological processes, offering unique insights into organ motion and
function. Among these applications, RT cine MRI is particularly important for
functional assessment of the heart with high temporal resolution. RT imaging
enables free-breathing, ungated imaging of cardiac motion, making it a crucial
alternative for patients who cannot tolerate conventional breath-hold,
ECG-gated acquisitions. However, achieving high acceleration rates in RT cine
MRI is challenging due to aliasing artifacts from extra-cardiac tissues,
particularly at high undersampling factors. In this study, we propose a novel
outer volume removal (OVR) method to address this challenge by eliminating
aliasing contributions from non-cardiac regions in a post-processing framework.
Our approach estimates the outer volume signal for each timeframe using
composite temporal images from time-interleaved undersampling patterns, which
inherently contain pseudo-periodic ghosting artifacts. A deep learning (DL)
model is trained to identify and remove these artifacts, producing a clean
outer volume estimate that is subsequently subtracted from the corresponding
k-space data. The final reconstruction is performed with a physics-driven DL
(PD-DL) method trained using an OVR-specific loss function to restore high
spatio-temporal resolution images. Experimental results show that the proposed
method at high accelerations achieves image quality that is visually comparable
to clinical baseline images, while outperforming conventional reconstruction
techniques, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The proposed approach
provides a practical and effective solution for artifact reduction in RT cine
MRI without requiring acquisition modifications, offering a pathway to higher
acceleration rates while preserving diagnostic quality.

*Aditya Arora,Zhengzhong Tu,Yufei Wang,Ruizheng Bai,Jian Wang,Sizhuo Ma*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: GuideSR是一种新型单步扩散图像超分辨率模型，通过双分支架构提升图像保真度，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散超分辨率方法因依赖降采样输入而损害结构保真度，GuideSR旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用双分支架构：指导分支保留高保真结构，扩散分支增强感知质量，结合FRBs和IGN。

Result: 在基准测试中表现优异，PSNR提升达1.39dB，计算成本低。

Conclusion: GuideSR在图像恢复任务中实现了实用化进步，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose GuideSR, a novel single-step diffusion-based image
super-resolution (SR) model specifically designed to enhance image fidelity.
Existing diffusion-based SR approaches typically adapt pre-trained generative
models to image restoration tasks by adding extra conditioning on a
VAE-downsampled representation of the degraded input, which often compromises
structural fidelity. GuideSR addresses this limitation by introducing a
dual-branch architecture comprising: (1) a Guidance Branch that preserves
high-fidelity structures from the original-resolution degraded input, and (2) a
Diffusion Branch, which a pre-trained latent diffusion model to enhance
perceptual quality. Unlike conventional conditioning mechanisms, our Guidance
Branch features a tailored structure for image restoration tasks, combining
Full Resolution Blocks (FRBs) with channel attention and an Image Guidance
Network (IGN) with guided attention. By embedding detailed structural
information directly into the restoration pipeline, GuideSR produces sharper
and more visually consistent results. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that GuideSR achieves state-of-the-art performance while
maintaining the low computational cost of single-step approaches, with up to
1.39dB PSNR gain on challenging real-world datasets. Our approach consistently
outperforms existing methods across various reference-based metrics including
PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, DISTS and FID, further representing a practical advancement
for real-world image restoration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM多智能体系统中的故障归因对系统调试至关重要，但目前研究不足且人工成本高。

Method: 提出自动化故障归因任务，引入Who&When数据集，开发并评估三种自动化方法。

Result: 最佳方法在识别故障责任代理上达到53.5%准确率，但在定位故障步骤上仅14.2%，部分方法表现低于随机。

Conclusion: 任务复杂度高，现有方法实用性不足，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Failure attribution in LLM multi-agent systems-identifying the agent and step
responsible for task failures-provides crucial clues for systems debugging but
remains underexplored and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose and
formulate a new research area: automated failure attribution for LLM
multi-agent systems. To support this initiative, we introduce the Who&When
dataset, comprising extensive failure logs from 127 LLM multi-agent systems
with fine-grained annotations linking failures to specific agents and decisive
error steps. Using the Who&When, we develop and evaluate three automated
failure attribution methods, summarizing their corresponding pros and cons. The
best method achieves 53.5% accuracy in identifying failure-responsible agents
but only 14.2% in pinpointing failure steps, with some methods performing below
random. Even SOTA reasoning models, such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1, fail to
achieve practical usability. These results highlight the task's complexity and
the need for further research in this area. Code and dataset are available at

TL;DR: 该论文系统回顾了将心理学理论应用于大语言模型（LLMs）的六个关键维度，包括评估工具、数据集、评估指标等，并指出了当前方法的优缺点及未来发展方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在人类中心任务中的广泛应用，评估其心理特质对理解其社会影响和确保可信AI对齐至关重要。现有研究未系统讨论某些重要领域，如多样化的心理测试、LLM特定数据集等。

Method: 系统回顾了六个关键维度：评估工具、LLM特定数据集、评估指标（一致性和稳定性）、实证发现、人格模拟方法和基于LLM的行为模拟。

Result: 研究发现某些LLMs在特定提示方案下表现出可复现的人格模式，但在任务和设置中存在显著变异性。

Conclusion: 研究指出了当前方法的局限性，如心理工具与LLM能力的不匹配，并提出了未来发展方向，以开发更可解释、稳健和通用的LLM心理评估框架。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in human-centered
tasks, assessing their psychological traits is crucial for understanding their
social impact and ensuring trustworthy AI alignment. While existing reviews
have covered some aspects of related research, several important areas have not
been systematically discussed, including detailed discussions of diverse
psychological tests, LLM-specific psychological datasets, and the applications
of LLMs with psychological traits. To address this gap, we systematically
review six key dimensions of applying psychological theories to LLMs: (1)
assessment tools; (2) LLM-specific datasets; (3) evaluation metrics
(consistency and stability); (4) empirical findings; (5) personality simulation
methods; and (6) LLM-based behavior simulation. Our analysis highlights both
the strengths and limitations of current methods. While some LLMs exhibit
reproducible personality patterns under specific prompting schemes, significant
variability remains across tasks and settings. Recognizing methodological
challenges such as mismatches between psychological tools and LLMs'
capabilities, as well as inconsistencies in evaluation practices, this study
aims to propose future directions for developing more interpretable, robust,
and generalizable psychological assessment frameworks for LLMs.

*Rafael C. Pinto,Anderson R. Tavares*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于原型对象（proto-objects）的注意力机制，替代传统的矩形图像块注意力，显著降低了表示复杂性和训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于矩形图像块的注意力机制在视觉强化学习中表现优异，但存在表示复杂性和计算效率问题。原型对象作为共享视觉特性的图像区域，提供了更高层次的语义特征。

Method: 利用图像分割技术提取原型对象，将其编码为紧凑特征向量，构建更小的自注意力模块处理语义信息。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在性能上匹配或超越基于块的实现，同时减少62%的参数和2.6倍的训练时间。

Conclusion: 原型对象注意力机制在降低复杂性和提升效率方面具有显著优势，为视觉任务提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Proto-objects - image regions that share common visual properties - offer a
promising alternative to traditional attention mechanisms based on
rectangular-shaped image patches in neural networks. Although previous work
demonstrated that evolving a patch-based hard-attention module alongside a
controller network could achieve state-of-the-art performance in visual
reinforcement learning tasks, our approach leverages image segmentation to work
with higher-level features. By operating on proto-objects rather than fixed
patches, we significantly reduce the representational complexity: each image
decomposes into fewer proto-objects than regular patches, and each proto-object
can be efficiently encoded as a compact feature vector. This enables a
substantially smaller self-attention module that processes richer semantic
information. Our experiments demonstrate that this proto-object-based approach
matches or exceeds the state-of-the-art performance of patch-based
implementations with 62% less parameters and 2.6 times less training time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高维向量嵌入存储带来的内存挑战。

Method: 系统评估了量化和降维技术，包括float16、int8、float8、PCA等方法。

Result: float8量化实现4倍存储压缩且性能损失最小，结合PCA可达到8倍压缩。

Conclusion: 提出可视化方法帮助选择最优配置，平衡性能与存储需求。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation enhances language models by retrieving
relevant information from external knowledge bases, relying on high-dimensional
vector embeddings typically stored in float32 precision. However, storing these
embeddings at scale presents significant memory challenges. To address this
issue, we systematically investigate on MTEB benchmark two complementary
optimization strategies: quantization, evaluating standard formats (float16,
int8, binary) and low-bit floating-point types (float8), and dimensionality
reduction, assessing methods like PCA, Kernel PCA, UMAP, Random Projections and
Autoencoders. Our results show that float8 quantization achieves a 4x storage
reduction with minimal performance degradation (<0.3%), significantly
outperforming int8 quantization at the same compression level, being simpler to
implement. PCA emerges as the most effective dimensionality reduction
technique. Crucially, combining moderate PCA (e.g., retaining 50% dimensions)
with float8 quantization offers an excellent trade-off, achieving 8x total
compression with less performance impact than using int8 alone (which provides
only 4x compression). To facilitate practical application, we propose a
methodology based on visualizing the performance-storage trade-off space to
identify the optimal configuration that maximizes performance within their
specific memory constraints.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了EnronQA基准数据集，用于评估和优化RAG（检索增强生成）在私有数据上的表现，填补了现有公共数据基准的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG基准主要基于公共数据（如维基百科），缺乏对私有和个人化数据的评估能力，限制了RAG在企业私有文档中的应用。

Method: 作者发布了EnronQA数据集，包含103,638封邮件和528,304个问答对，覆盖150个用户邮箱，用于评估RAG在私有数据上的表现。

Result: EnronQA为私有数据的RAG评估提供了更真实的基准，并探索了私有文档中记忆与检索的权衡。

Conclusion: EnronQA填补了私有数据RAG评估的空白，为个性化检索设置提供了实验基础。

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has become one of the most popular
methods for bringing knowledge-intensive context to large language models (LLM)
because of its ability to bring local context at inference time without the
cost or data leakage risks associated with fine-tuning. A clear separation of
private information from the LLM training has made RAG the basis for many
enterprise LLM workloads as it allows the company to augment LLM's
understanding using customers' private documents. Despite its popularity for
private documents in enterprise deployments, current RAG benchmarks for
validating and optimizing RAG pipelines draw their corpora from public data
such as Wikipedia or generic web pages and offer little to no personal context.
Seeking to empower more personal and private RAG we release the EnronQA
benchmark, a dataset of 103,638 emails with 528,304 question-answer pairs
across 150 different user inboxes. EnronQA enables better benchmarking of RAG
pipelines over private data and allows for experimentation on the introduction
of personalized retrieval settings over realistic data. Finally, we use EnronQA
to explore the tradeoff in memorization and retrieval when reasoning over
private documents.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种称为“任务算术”的技术，通过简单的数学操作（如加减）结合预训练LLM的权重，无需额外微调即可适应不同任务和领域的检索模型。实验表明，该方法在多个数据集上显著提升了零样本检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在零样本任务中表现优异，但在未见过的任务和领域上性能下降，主要原因是词汇和词分布的差异。研究旨在通过任务算术技术解决这一问题。

Method: 采用任务算术技术，通过数学操作（如加减）结合不同任务或领域预训练的LLM权重，合成多样化的任务和领域知识到一个模型中。

Result: 在科学、生物医学和多语言数据集上的实验表明，该方法将NDCG@10和P@10分别提升了18%和15%。

Conclusion: 任务算术是一种有效的零样本学习和模型适应策略，但仍需进一步研究其局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive zero-shot performance
across a variety of Natural Language Processing tasks, including document
re-ranking. However, their effectiveness degrades on unseen tasks and domains,
largely due to shifts in vocabulary and word distributions. In this paper, we
investigate Task Arithmetic, a technique that combines the weights of LLMs
pre-trained on different tasks or domains via simple mathematical operations,
such as addition or subtraction, to adapt retrieval models without requiring
additional fine-tuning. Our method is able to synthesize diverse tasks and
domain knowledge into a single model, enabling effective zero-shot adaptation
in different retrieval contexts. Extensive experiments on publicly available
scientific, biomedical, and multilingual datasets show that our method improves
state-of-the-art re-ranking performance by up to 18% in NDCG@10 and 15% in
P@10. In addition to these empirical gains, our analysis provides insights into
the strengths and limitations of Task Arithmetic as a practical strategy for
zero-shot learning and model adaptation. We make our code publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统水下滑翔机设计工具依赖人工试错，限制了形状多样性，且复杂固-流相互作用建模计算成本高。

Method: 采用降阶几何表示和基于神经网络的流体代理模型，结合形状与控制信号的协同优化算法，实现端到端设计流程。

Conclusion: 该框架为高效水下滑翔机开发提供了新途径，对远洋探索和环境监测有重要意义。

Abstract: The development of novel autonomous underwater gliders has been hindered by
limited shape diversity, primarily due to the reliance on traditional design
tools that depend heavily on manual trial and error. Building an automated
design framework is challenging due to the complexities of representing glider
shapes and the high computational costs associated with modeling complex
solid-fluid interactions. In this work, we introduce an AI-enhanced automated
computational framework designed to overcome these limitations by enabling the
creation of underwater robots with non-trivial hull shapes. Our approach
involves an algorithm that co-optimizes both shape and control signals,
utilizing a reduced-order geometry representation and a differentiable
neural-network-based fluid surrogate model. This end-to-end design workflow
facilitates rapid iteration and evaluation of hydrodynamic performance, leading
to the discovery of optimal and complex hull shapes across various control
settings. We validate our method through wind tunnel experiments and swimming
pool gliding tests, demonstrating that our computationally designed gliders
surpass manually designed counterparts in terms of energy efficiency. By
addressing challenges in efficient shape representation and neural fluid
surrogate models, our work paves the way for the development of highly
efficient underwater gliders, with implications for long-range ocean
exploration and environmental monitoring.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言在机器人控制中缺乏空间精确性，导致模糊和冗长问题。

Method: 引入RoVI（对象中心的手绘符号表示）和VIEW（基于RoVI的策略流程），利用VLMs解析RoVI并生成3D动作序列。

Result: 在11个新任务中验证，VIEW在真实场景中达到87.5%的成功率。

Conclusion: RoVI和VIEW显著提升了机器人任务的精确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recently, natural language has been the primary medium for human-robot
interaction. However, its inherent lack of spatial precision for robotic
control introduces challenges such as ambiguity and verbosity. To address these
limitations, we introduce the Robotic Visual Instruction (RoVI), a novel
paradigm to guide robotic tasks through an object-centric, hand-drawn symbolic
representation. RoVI effectively encodes spatial-temporal information into
human-interpretable visual instructions through 2D sketches, utilizing arrows,
circles, colors, and numbers to direct 3D robotic manipulation. To enable
robots to understand RoVI better and generate precise actions based on RoVI, we
present Visual Instruction Embodied Workflow (VIEW), a pipeline formulated for
RoVI-conditioned policies. This approach leverages Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) to interpret RoVI inputs, decode spatial and temporal constraints from
2D pixel space via keypoint extraction, and then transform them into executable
3D action sequences. We additionally curate a specialized dataset of 15K
instances to fine-tune small VLMs for edge deployment, enabling them to
effectively learn RoVI capabilities. Our approach is rigorously validated
across 11 novel tasks in both real and simulated environments, demonstrating
significant generalization capability. Notably, VIEW achieves an 87.5% success
rate in real-world scenarios involving unseen tasks that feature multi-step
actions, with disturbances, and trajectory-following requirements. Code and
Datasets in this paper will be released soon.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种递归KL散度优化（RKDO）方法，通过动态调整局部条件分布的KL散度，统一了多种表示学习目标，并在效率和资源消耗上优于静态方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如I-Con）通过固定邻域条件的KL散度统一学习范式，但忽视了学习过程中的递归结构。

Method: 引入RKDO，将表示学习建模为KL散度在数据邻域上的动态演化，涵盖对比学习、聚类和降维方法。

Result: 实验显示，RKDO在三个数据集上损失值降低约30%，计算资源减少60%-80%。

Conclusion: RKDO的递归更新机制为表示学习提供了更高效的优化路径，特别适合资源受限场景。

Abstract: We propose a generalization of modern representation learning objectives by
reframing them as recursive divergence alignment processes over localized
conditional distributions While recent frameworks like Information Contrastive
Learning I-Con unify multiple learning paradigms through KL divergence between
fixed neighborhood conditionals we argue this view underplays a crucial
recursive structure inherent in the learning process. We introduce Recursive KL
Divergence Optimization RKDO a dynamic formalism where representation learning
is framed as the evolution of KL divergences across data neighborhoods. This
formulation captures contrastive clustering and dimensionality reduction
methods as static slices while offering a new path to model stability and local
adaptation. Our experiments demonstrate that RKDO offers dual efficiency
advantages approximately 30 percent lower loss values compared to static
approaches across three different datasets and 60 to 80 percent reduction in
computational resources needed to achieve comparable results. This suggests
that RKDOs recursive updating mechanism provides a fundamentally more efficient
optimization landscape for representation learning with significant
implications for resource constrained applications.

Motivation: 尽管文本到视频生成模型在质量和指令遵循上取得进展，但其是否遵守基本物理定律尚未被系统评估。

Method: 通过T2VPhysBench，结合人类评估和第一性原理物理，对开源和商业模型进行12项物理定律的测试。

Result: 模型在所有物理类别中平均得分低于0.60，且即使提供详细提示也无法纠正物理违规。

Conclusion: 当前架构在物理感知方面存在局限，需进一步研究改进。

Abstract: Text-to-video generative models have made significant strides in recent
years, producing high-quality videos that excel in both aesthetic appeal and
accurate instruction following, and have become central to digital art creation
and user engagement online. Yet, despite these advancements, their ability to
respect fundamental physical laws remains largely untested: many outputs still
violate basic constraints such as rigid-body collisions, energy conservation,
and gravitational dynamics, resulting in unrealistic or even misleading
content. Existing physical-evaluation benchmarks typically rely on automatic,
pixel-level metrics applied to simplistic, life-scenario prompts, and thus
overlook both human judgment and first-principles physics. To fill this gap, we
introduce \textbf{T2VPhysBench}, a first-principled benchmark that
systematically evaluates whether state-of-the-art text-to-video systems, both
open-source and commercial, obey twelve core physical laws including Newtonian
mechanics, conservation principles, and phenomenological effects. Our benchmark
employs a rigorous human evaluation protocol and includes three targeted
studies: (1) an overall compliance assessment showing that all models score
below 0.60 on average in each law category; (2) a prompt-hint ablation
revealing that even detailed, law-specific hints fail to remedy physics
violations; and (3) a counterfactual robustness test demonstrating that models
often generate videos that explicitly break physical rules when so instructed.
The results expose persistent limitations in current architectures and offer
concrete insights for guiding future research toward truly physics-aware video
generation.

Motivation: 现有视频基准测试仅提供结果监督，缺乏中间推理步骤，难以评估模型是否真正结合了感知和时间信息进行推理。

Method: 创建MINERVA数据集，包含多样化的视频领域和长度，以及复杂的多步问题，每道问题附带5个答案选项和详细的手工推理痕迹。

Result: 数据集对前沿开源和专有模型构成挑战，错误分析显示主要失败模式为时间定位和视觉感知错误。

Conclusion: MINERVA数据集为视频推理提供了更全面的评估工具，并揭示了模型在时间定位和视觉感知上的主要缺陷。

Abstract: Multimodal LLMs are turning their focus to video benchmarks, however most
video benchmarks only provide outcome supervision, with no intermediate or
interpretable reasoning steps. This makes it challenging to assess if models
are truly able to combine perceptual and temporal information to reason about
videos, or simply get the correct answer by chance or by exploiting linguistic
biases. To remedy this, we provide a new video reasoning dataset called MINERVA
for modern multimodal models. Each question in the dataset comes with 5 answer
choices, as well as detailed, hand-crafted reasoning traces. Our dataset is
multimodal, diverse in terms of video domain and length, and consists of
complex multi-step questions. Extensive benchmarking shows that our dataset
provides a challenge for frontier open-source and proprietary models. We
perform fine-grained error analysis to identify common failure modes across
various models, and create a taxonomy of reasoning errors. We use this to
explore both human and LLM-as-a-judge methods for scoring video reasoning
traces, and find that failure modes are primarily related to temporal
localization, followed by visual perception errors, as opposed to logical or
completeness errors. The dataset, along with questions, answer candidates and
reasoning traces will be publicly available under

Motivation: 减少对任务特定知识工程的依赖，通过自动构建和优化自我生成的示例数据库来提升代理性能。

Method: 构建并优化成功轨迹数据库，引入数据库级和示例级选择策略。

Result: 在ALFWorld、Wordcraft和InterCode-SQL基准测试中显著提升性能，最高达91%。

Conclusion: 自动轨迹数据库构建是替代人工知识工程的有效方法。

Abstract: Many methods for improving Large Language Model (LLM) agents for sequential
decision-making tasks depend on task-specific knowledge engineering--such as
prompt tuning, curated in-context examples, or customized observation and
action spaces. Using these approaches, agent performance improves with the
quality or amount of knowledge engineering invested. Instead, we investigate
how LLM agents can automatically improve their performance by learning
in-context from their own successful experiences on similar tasks. Rather than
relying on task-specific knowledge engineering, we focus on constructing and
refining a database of self-generated examples. We demonstrate that even a
naive accumulation of successful trajectories across training tasks boosts test
performance on three benchmarks: ALFWorld (73% to 89%), Wordcraft (55% to 64%),
and InterCode-SQL (75% to 79%)--matching the performance the initial agent
achieves if allowed two to three attempts per task. We then introduce two
extensions: (1) database-level selection through population-based training to
identify high-performing example collections, and (2) exemplar-level selection
that retains individual trajectories based on their empirical utility as
in-context examples. These extensions further enhance performance, achieving
91% on ALFWorld--matching more complex approaches that employ task-specific
components and prompts. Our results demonstrate that automatic trajectory
database construction offers a compelling alternative to labor-intensive
knowledge engineering.

Conclusion: MoSA是高效且性能优越的稀疏注意力方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models highlighted the excessive quadratic
cost of self-attention. Despite the significant research efforts, subquadratic
attention methods still suffer from inferior performance in practice. We
hypothesize that dynamic, learned content-based sparsity can lead to more
efficient attention mechanisms. We present Mixture of Sparse Attention (MoSA),
a novel approach inspired by Mixture of Experts (MoE) with expert choice
routing. MoSA dynamically selects tokens for each attention head, allowing
arbitrary sparse attention patterns. By selecting $k$ tokens from a sequence of
length $T$, MoSA reduces the computational complexity of each attention head
from $O(T^2)$ to $O(k^2 + T)$. This enables using more heads within the same
computational budget, allowing higher specialization. We show that among the
tested sparse attention variants, MoSA is the only one that can outperform the
dense baseline, sometimes with up to 27% better perplexity for an identical
compute budget. MoSA can also reduce the resource usage compared to dense
self-attention. Despite using torch implementation without an optimized kernel,
perplexity-matched MoSA models are simultaneously faster in wall-clock time,
require less memory for training, and drastically reduce the size of the
KV-cache compared to the dense transformer baselines.

Abstract: Data mixing strategies have successfully reduced the costs involved in
training language models. While promising, such methods suffer from two flaws.
First, they rely on predetermined data domains (e.g., data sources, task
types), which may fail to capture critical semantic nuances, leaving
performance on the table. Second, these methods scale with the number of
domains in a computationally prohibitive way. We address these challenges via
R&B, a framework that re-partitions training data based on semantic similarity
(Regroup) to create finer-grained domains, and efficiently optimizes the data
composition (Balance) by leveraging a Gram matrix induced by domain gradients
obtained throughout training. Unlike prior works, it removes the need for
additional compute to obtain evaluation information such as losses or
gradients. We analyze this technique under standard regularity conditions and
provide theoretical insights that justify R&B's effectiveness compared to
non-adaptive mixing approaches. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness
of R&B on five diverse datasets ranging from natural language to reasoning and
multimodal tasks. With as little as 0.01% additional compute overhead, R&B
matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art data mixing strategies.

Abstract: Accurate classification of medical device risk levels is essential for
regulatory oversight and clinical safety. We present a Transformer-based
multimodal framework that integrates textual descriptions and visual
information to predict device regulatory classification. The model incorporates
a cross-attention mechanism to capture intermodal dependencies and employs a
self-training strategy for improved generalization under limited supervision.
Experiments on a real-world regulatory dataset demonstrate that our approach
achieves up to 90.4% accuracy and 97.9% AUROC, significantly outperforming
text-only (77.2%) and image-only (54.8%) baselines. Compared to standard
multimodal fusion, the self-training mechanism improved SVM performance by 3.3
percentage points in accuracy (from 87.1% to 90.4%) and 1.4 points in macro-F1,
suggesting that pseudo-labeling can effectively enhance generalization under
limited supervision. Ablation studies further confirm the complementary
benefits of both cross-modal attention and self-training.
