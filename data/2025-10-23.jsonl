The effect of verification manifests\nthrough interactions of three quantities: (i) the generator's coverage, (ii)\nthe verifier's region of convergence (ROC), and (iii) the sampling algorithm's\nsub-optimality. Though recent studies capture subsets of these factors, a\nunified framework quantifying the geometry of their interplay is missing. We\nframe verifiable test-time scaling as a transport problem. This characterizes\nthe interaction of coverage, ROC, and sub-optimality, and uncovers that the\nsub-optimality--coverage curve exhibits three regimes. A transport regime --\nwhere sub-optimality increases with coverage, a policy improvement regime --\nwhere sub-optimality may decrease with coverage, depending on the verifier's\nROC, and a saturation regime -- where sub-optimality plateaus, unaffected by\ncoverage.

In this paper, we observe that hallucinations in\nMLLMs are strongly associated with insufficient attention allocated to visual\ntokens.

Existing approaches typically\nrely on single or multiple-dimensional score-based selection. However, directly\nselecting top-scored data often degrades performance, and sampling from a\nbroader range is required to recover results. The above non-monotonicity\nbetween dataset scores and downstream benchmark results reveals a fundamental\nbias: score-based methods collapse correlated dimensions, causing top-scored\ndata to appear high-quality while systematically overlooking diversity. We\nargue that ensuring diversity requires decomposing correlated metrics into\northogonal feature dimensions, from which the top-scored data can be directly\nselected. Therefore, we proposed the Orthogonal Diversity-Aware Selection\n(ODiS) algorithm, which preserves both quality and diversity during data\nselection. First, ODiS evaluates data from multiple dimensions, covering\nlanguage quality, knowledge quality, and comprehension difficulty. The\nmulti-dimensional scores are then decorrelated via Principal Component Analysis\n(PCA), yielding orthogonal evaluation dimensions. For each dimension, a\nRoberta-based scorer is trained to regress the data onto PCA-projected scores,\nenabling scalable inference on large corpora. Finally, ODiS constructs the\ntraining dataset by selecting top-scored data within each orthogonal dimension,\nthereby ensuring both quality and diversity.

Therefore, improving the efficiency of warehouse operations is\nessential. To achieve this, various approaches have been explored, and among\nthem, the use of digital twins is gaining attention. To make this approach\npossible, it is necessary to accurately collect the positions of workers in a\nwarehouse and reflect them in a virtual space. However, a single camera has\nlimitations in its field of view, therefore sensing with multiple cameras is\nnecessary. In this study, we explored a method to track workers using 19\nwide-angle cameras installed on the ceiling, looking down at the floor of the\nlogistics warehouse. To understand the relationship between the camera\ncoordinates and the actual positions in the warehouse, we performed alignment\nbased on the floor surface. However, due to the characteristics of wide-angle\ncameras, significant distortion occurs at the edges of the image, particularly\nin the vertical direction. To address this, the detected worker positions from\neach camera were aligned based on foot positions, reducing the effects of image\ndistortion, and enabling accurate position alignment across cameras. As a\nresult, we confirmed an improvement of over 20% in tracking accuracy.\nFurthermore, we compared multiple methods for utilizing appearance features and\nvalidated the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}

To mitigate this phenomenon, existing solutions either introduce\nadditional data for further training or incorporate external or internal\ninformation during inference.

In this paper, we observe that hallucinations in\nMLLMs are strongly associated with insufficient attention allocated to visual\ntokens. In particular, the presence of redundant visual tokens disperses the\nmodel's attention, preventing it from focusing on the most informative ones. As\na result, critical visual cues are often under-attended, which in turn\nexacerbates the occurrence of hallucinations.

While\nreinforcement learning (RL) enhances short-context reasoning by inducing \"Aha\"\nmoments in chain-of-thought, the advanced thinking patterns required for\nlong-context reasoning remain largely unexplored, and high-difficulty RL data\nare scarce. In this paper, we introduce LoongRL, a data-driven RL method for\nadvanced long-context reasoning. Central to LoongRL is KeyChain, a synthesis\napproach that transforms short multi-hop QA into high-difficulty long-context\ntasks by inserting UUID chains that hide the true question among large\ncollections of distracting documents. Solving these tasks requires the model to\ntrace the correct chain step-by-step, identify the true question, retrieve\nrelevant facts and reason over them to answer correctly. RL training on\nKeyChain data induces an emergent plan-retrieve-reason-recheck reasoning\npattern that generalizes far beyond training length. Models trained at 16K\neffectively solve 128K tasks without prohibitive full-length RL rollout costs.\nOn Qwen2.5-7B and 14B, LoongRL substantially improves long-context multi-hop QA\naccuracy by +23.5% and +21.1% absolute gains. The resulting LoongRL-14B reaches\na score of 74.2, rivaling much larger frontier models such as o3-mini (74.5)\nand DeepSeek-R1 (74.9). It also improves long-context retrieval, passes all\n128K needle-in-a-haystack stress tests, and preserves short-context reasoning\ncapabilities."}

For LLMs to be effective in the real world,\nthey too must critically evaluate content by factoring in the motivations of\nthe source -- for instance, weighing the credibility of claims made in a sales\npitch. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive study of whether LLMs have\nthis capacity for motivational vigilance. We first employ controlled\nexperiments from cognitive science to verify that LLMs' behavior is consistent\nwith rational models of learning from motivated testimony, and find they\nsuccessfully discount information from biased sources in a human-like manner.\nWe then extend our evaluation to sponsored online adverts, a more naturalistic\nreflection of LLM agents' information ecosystems.

However, VLMs still exhibit several limitations in\nvisual reasoning, such as difficulties in identifying relations (e.g., spatial,\ntemporal, and among objects), understanding temporal sequences (e.g., frames),\nand counting objects. In this work, we go beyond score-level benchmark\nevaluations of VLMs by investigating the underlying causes of their failures\nand proposing a targeted approach to improve their reasoning capabilities. We\nstudy the reasoning skills of seven state-of-the-art VLMs in the counting task\nunder controlled experimental conditions. Our experiments show that VLMs are\nhighly sensitive to the number and type of objects, their spatial arrangement,\nand the co-occurrence of distractors. A layer-wise analysis reveals that errors\nare due to incorrect mapping of the last-layer representation into the output\nspace. Our targeted training shows that fine-tuning just the output layer\nimproves accuracy by up to 21%. We corroborate these findings by achieving\nconsistent improvements on real-world datasets."}

These rules often feature vague boundaries\nand implicit logic relationships, making precise application challenging for\nagents. However, this critical capability is largely overlooked by current\nagent benchmarks.\n  To fill this gap, we introduce HSCodeComp, the first realistic, expert-level\ne-commerce benchmark designed to evaluate deep search agents in hierarchical\nrule application. In this task, the deep reasoning process of agents is guided\nby these rules to predict 10-digit Harmonized System Code (HSCode) of products\nwith noisy but realistic descriptions. These codes, established by the World\nCustoms Organization, are vital for global supply chain efficiency. Built from\nreal-world data collected from large-scale e-commerce platforms, our proposed\nHSCodeComp comprises 632 product entries spanning diverse product categories,\nwith these HSCodes annotated by several human experts.\n  Extensive experimental results on several state-of-the-art LLMs, open-source,\nand closed-source agents reveal a huge performance gap: best agent achieves\nonly 46.8% 10-digit accuracy, far below human experts at 95.0%. Besides,\ndetailed analysis demonstrates the challenges of hierarchical rule application,\nand test-time scaling fails to improve performance further."}

While\nrecent efforts aim to unify world modeling and planning in a single framework,\nthe synergistic facilitation mechanism of world modeling for planning still\nrequires further exploration. In this work, we introduce a new driving paradigm\nnamed Policy World Model (PWM), which not only integrates world modeling and\ntrajectory planning within a unified architecture, but is also able to benefit\nplanning using the learned world knowledge through the proposed action-free\nfuture state forecasting scheme. Through collaborative state-action prediction,\nPWM can mimic the human-like anticipatory perception, yielding more reliable\nplanning performance. To facilitate the efficiency of video forecasting, we\nfurther introduce a dynamically enhanced parallel token generation mechanism,\nequipped with a context-guided tokenizer and an adaptive dynamic focal loss.\nDespite utilizing only front camera input, our method matches or exceeds\nstate-of-the-art approaches that rely on multi-view and multi-modal inputs.\nCode and model weights will be released at\nhttps://github.com/6550Zhao/Policy-World-Model."}

However, the research community's progress remains constrained\nby the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and openly accessible datasets\nbuilt from real images. We introduce Pico-Banana-400K, a comprehensive\n400K-image dataset for instruction-based image editing. Our dataset is\nconstructed by leveraging Nano-Banana to generate diverse edit pairs from real\nphotographs in the OpenImages collection. What distinguishes Pico-Banana-400K\nfrom previous synthetic datasets is our systematic approach to quality and\ndiversity. We employ a fine-grained image editing taxonomy to ensure\ncomprehensive coverage of edit types while maintaining precise content\npreservation and instruction faithfulness through MLLM-based quality scoring\nand careful curation. Beyond single turn editing, Pico-Banana-400K enables\nresearch into complex editing scenarios. The dataset includes three specialized\nsubsets: (1) a 72K-example multi-turn collection for studying sequential\nediting, reasoning, and planning across consecutive modifications; (2) a\n56K-example preference subset for alignment research and reward model training;\nand (3) paired long-short editing instructions for developing instruction\nrewriting and summarization capabilities. By providing this large-scale,\nhigh-quality, and task-rich resource, Pico-Banana-400K establishes a robust\nfoundation for training and benchmarking the next generation of text-guided\nimage editing models."}
