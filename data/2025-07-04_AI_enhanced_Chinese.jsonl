Explanations of the robot's\nreasoning process can help users to understand the robot intentions. However,\nwhen to provide explanations and what they contain are important to avoid user\nannoyance. We have investigated user preferences for explanation demand and\ncontent for a robot that helps with daily cleaning tasks in a kitchen. Our\nresults show that users want explanations in surprising situations and prefer\nconcise explanations that clearly state the intention behind the confusing\naction and the contextual factors that were relevant to this decision. Based on\nthese findings, we propose two algorithms to identify surprising actions and to\nconstruct effective explanations for Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) robots.

In\ngenerative speech systems, identity is often assessed using automatic speaker\nverification (ASV) embeddings, designed for discrimination rather than\ncharacterizing identity. This paper investigates which aspects of a voice are\ncaptured in such representations. We find that widely used ASV embeddings focus\nmainly on static features like timbre and pitch range, while neglecting dynamic\nelements such as rhythm. We also identify confounding factors that compromise\nspeaker similarity measurements and suggest mitigation strategies.

Creating such detailed face avatars from\nvideos is a challenging problem and has numerous applications in augmented and\nvirtual reality. While tremendous successes have been achieved for static\nfaces, animatable avatars from monocular videos still fall in the uncanny\nvalley. The de facto standard, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), represents a face\nthrough a collection of 3D Gaussian primitives. 3DGS excels at rendering static\nfaces, but the state-of-the-art still struggles with nonlinear deformations,\ncomplex lighting effects, and fine details. While most related works focus on\npredicting better Gaussian parameters from expression codes, we rethink the 3D\nGaussian representation itself and how to make it more expressive. Our insights\nlead to a novel extension of 3D Gaussians to high-dimensional multivariate\nGaussians, dubbed 'HyperGaussians'. The higher dimensionality increases\nexpressivity through conditioning on a learnable local embedding. However,\nsplatting HyperGaussians is computationally expensive because it requires\ninverting a high-dimensional covariance matrix. We solve this by\nreparameterizing the covariance matrix, dubbed the 'inverse covariance trick'.\nThis trick boosts the efficiency so that HyperGaussians can be seamlessly\nintegrated into existing models. To demonstrate this, we plug in HyperGaussians\ninto the state-of-the-art in fast monocular face avatars: FlashAvatar.

While established methods exist, they often\ntrade off accuracy for tractability. We propose a unified abstraction framework\nthat improves both the tightness of probabilistic guarantees and computational\nefficiency. First, we introduce multi-interval MDPs (MI-MDPs), a generalization\nof interval-valued MDPs (IMDPs), which allows multiple, possibly overlapping\nclusters of successor states. This results in tighter abstractions but with\nincreased computational complexity. To mitigate this, we further propose a\ngeneralized form of MDPs with set-valued transition probabilities (SMDPs),\nwhich model transitions as a fixed probability to a state cluster, followed by\na non-deterministic choice within the cluster, as a sound abstraction. We show\nthat control synthesis for MI-MDPs reduces to robust dynamic programming via\nlinear optimization, while SMDPs admit even more efficient synthesis algorithms\nthat avoid linear programming altogether. Theoretically, we prove that, given\nthe partitioning of the state and disturbance spaces, both MI-MDPs and SMDPs\nyield tighter probabilistic guarantees than IMDPs, and that SMDPs are tighter\nthan MI-MDPs. Extensive experiments across several benchmarks validate our\ntheoretical results and demonstrate that SMDPs achieve favorable trade-offs\namong tightness, memory usage, and computation time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u533a\u95f4MDP\uff08MI-MDPs\uff09\u548c\u96c6\u5408\u503cMDP\uff08SMDPs\uff09\u6539\u8fdb\u6982\u7387\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u7d27\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165MI-MDPs\u548cSMDPs\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u533a\u95f4\u72b6\u6001\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u96c6\u5408\u503c\u8f6c\u79fb\u6982\u7387\u6539\u8fdb\u62bd\u8c61\u7d27\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660eMI-MDPs\u548cSMDPs\u6bd4IMDPs\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7d27\u7684\u6982\u7387\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0cSMDPs\u4f18\u4e8eMI-MDPs\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SMDPs\u5728\u7d27\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

However, intelligent\nmachines generally have no enough computing resources when faced with huge\nvolume of data. This paper develops a new method based on sampling techniques\nand rough set theory to address the challenge of feature selection for massive\ndata.

Based on this measure, a new feature\nselection method is proposed. This method constructs positive region preserved\nsamples from massive data to find a feature subset with high discriminatory\nability.

Second, the lower boundary of\nthe probability of the object pairs that can be discerned using the feature\nsubset selected in all object pairs that should be distinguished can be\nestimated before finding reducts. Furthermore, 11 data sets of different sizes\nwere used to validate the proposed method. The results show that approximate\nreducts can be found in a very short period of time, and the discriminatory\nability of the final reduct is larger than the estimated lower boundary.\nExperiments on four large-scale data sets also showed that an approximate\nreduct with high discriminatory ability can be obtained in reasonable time on a\npersonal computer.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u6280\u672f\u548c\u7c97\u7cd9\u96c6\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\u96c6\u7684\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5feb\u901f\u627e\u5230\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7ea6\u7b80\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e2a\u4eba\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "motivation": "\u667a\u80fd\u673a\u5668\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6d77\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u5bf9\u8c61\u5bf9\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\u8861\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\u96c6\u7684\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6b63\u533a\u57df\u4fdd\u7559\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u9ad8\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5b50\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u572811\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u627e\u5230\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7ea6\u7b80\uff0c\u4e14\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u9ad8\u4e8e\u9884\u4f30\u4e0b\u9650\u3002\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e5f\u663e\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4e2a\u4eba\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4e0a\u8fd0\u884c\u826f\u597d\u3002"}}

At its core, LiteReality first performs scene\nunderstanding and parses the results into a coherent 3D layout and objects with\nthe help of a structured scene graph. It then reconstructs the scene by\nretrieving the most visually similar 3D artist-crafted models from a curated\nasset database. Next, the Material Painting module enhances realism by\nrecovering high-quality, spatially varying materials. Finally, the\nreconstructed scene is integrated into a simulation engine with basic physical\nproperties to enable interactive behavior. The resulting scenes are compact,\neditable, and fully compatible with standard graphics pipelines, making them\nsuitable for applications in AR/VR, gaming, robotics, and digital twins. In\naddition, LiteReality introduces a training-free object retrieval module that\nachieves state-of-the-art similarity performance on the Scan2CAD benchmark,\nalong with a robust material painting module capable of transferring\nappearances from images of any style to 3D assets -- even under severe\nmisalignment, occlusion, and poor lighting.

To ensure\nthe security of Web3 services among diverse user entities, a decentralized\nidentity (DID) system is essential. Especially, a user's access request to Web3\nservices can be treated as a DID transaction within the blockchain, executed\nthrough a consensus mechanism. However, a critical implementation issue arises\nin the current Web3, i.e., how to deploy network nodes to serve users on a\nglobal scale. To address this issue, emerging Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite\ncommunication systems, such as Starlink, offer a promising solution. With their\nglobal coverage and high reliability, these communication satellites can\ncomplement terrestrial networks as Web3 deployment infrastructures. In this\ncase, this paper develops three hybrid satellite-ground modes to deploy the\nblockchain-enabled DID system for Web3 users. Three modes integrate ground\nnodes and satellites to provide flexible and continuous DID services for\nworldwide users.

While recent research has increasingly\nincorporated visual materials such as Figure 1 as de facto GAs, their potential\nto enhance scientific communication remains largely unexplored.

As a preliminary step toward GA design support, we define two\ntasks: 1) Intra-GA recommendation, which identifies figures within a given\npaper that are well-suited to serve as GAs, and 2) Inter-GA recommendation,\nwhich retrieves GAs from other papers to inspire the creation of new GAs. We\nprovide reasonable baseline models for these tasks. Furthermore, we propose\nConfidence Adjusted top-1 ground truth Ratio (CAR), a novel recommendation\nmetric that offers a fine-grained analysis of model behavior. CAR addresses\nlimitations in traditional ranking-based metrics by considering cases where\nmultiple figures within a paper, beyond the explicitly labeled GA, may also\nserve as GAs.

Multi-variate time-series (MTS) analysis has emerged as a\ncritical methodology for enabling real-time monitoring, fault detection, and\npredictive maintenance in such environments. However, anomaly prediction in\nsemiconductor fabrication presents several critical challenges, including high\ndata dimensionality, severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults,\nnoisy and missing measurements, and non-stationary behavior of production\nsystems. Furthermore, the complex interdependencies between variables and the\ndelayed emergence of faults across downstream stages complicate both anomaly\ndetection and root-cause-analysis. This paper presents a novel and generic\napproach for anomaly detection in MTS data using machine learning. The proposed\nmethodology consists of three main steps: a) converting MTS data into\nimage-based representations using the Continuous Wavelet Transform, b)\ndeveloping a multi-class image classifier by fine-tuning a pretrained VGG-16\narchitecture on custom CWT image datasets, and c) constructing a Siamese\nnetwork composed of two identical sub-networks, each utilizing the fine-tuned\nVGG-16 as a backbone. The network takes pairs of CWT images as input -one\nserving as a reference or anchor (representing a known-good signal), and the\nother as a query (representing an unknown signal). The model then compares the\nembeddings of both inputs to determine whether they belong to the same class at\na given time step.

In this study, we conduct the first\nsystematic evaluation of these protective perturbations against VC under\nrealistic threat models that include perturbation purification. Our findings\nreveal that while existing purification methods can neutralize a considerable\nportion of the protective perturbations, they still lead to distortions in the\nfeature space of VC models, which degrades the performance of VC. From this\nperspective, we propose a novel two-stage purification method: (1) Purify the\nperturbed speech; (2) Refine it using phoneme guidance to align it with the\nclean speech distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that our method\noutperforms state-of-the-art purification methods in disrupting VC defenses.\nOur study reveals the limitations of adversarial perturbation-based VC defenses\nand underscores the urgent need for more robust solutions to mitigate the\nsecurity and privacy risks posed by VC.

This complexity arises from the non-linear,\ntime-dependent interactions among all the variables of the control problem and\nthe changing internal and external constraints. Focusing on the accurate\nmodeling of the indoor temperature, we propose a data-driven approach to\naddress this challenge. We account for thermal inertia, non-linear effects,\nsmall perturbations of the indoor climate dynamics caused by ventilation and\nweather variations, as well as for the stochastic nature of the control system\ndue to the observed noise in the input signal. Since the prohibitive cost of\nquality data acquisition and processing limits the implementation of\ndata-driven approaches for real-life problems, we applied a method that merges\nseveral Bayesian machine learning and deep learning architectures that are\nsuitable for predicting complex system dynamics, while relaxing the dataset\nquality requirements. Our framework includes a built-in deep Kalman filter,\nwhich makes it deployable even with low-accuracy temperature sensors.

(Accepted)", "summary": "Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are fundamental in various scientific\napplications, ranging from biomedical protein-protein interactions (PPI) to\nlarge-scale recommendation systems. An essential component for modeling graph\nstructures in GCNs is sparse general matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM). As\nthe size of graph data continues to scale up, SpGEMMs are often conducted in an\nout-of-core fashion due to limited GPU memory space in resource-constrained\nsystems. Albeit recent efforts that aim to alleviate the memory constraints of\nout-of-core SpGEMM through either GPU feature caching, hybrid CPU-GPU memory\nlayout, or performing the computation in sparse format, current systems suffer\nfrom both high I/O latency and GPU under-utilization issues.\n  In this paper, we first identify the problems of existing systems, where\nsparse format data alignment and memory allocation are the main performance\nbottlenecks, and propose AIRES, a novel algorithm-system co-design solution to\naccelerate out-of-core SpGEMM computation for GCNs. Specifically, from the\nalgorithm angle, AIRES proposes to alleviate the data alignment issues on the\nblock level for matrices in sparse formats and develops a tiling algorithm to\nfacilitate row block-wise alignment. On the system level, AIRES employs a\nthree-phase dynamic scheduling that features a dual-way data transfer strategy\nutilizing a tiered memory system: integrating GPU memory, GPU Direct Storage\n(GDS), and host memory to reduce I/O latency and improve throughput.\nEvaluations show that AIRES significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmethods, achieving up to 1.8x lower latency in real-world graph processing\nbenchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faAIRES\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5-\u7cfb\u7edf\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a0\u901fGCN\u4e2d\u7684\u5916\u5b58SpGEMM\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5206\u914d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5927\uff0c\u5916\u5b58SpGEMM\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u56e0GPU\u5185\u5b58\u4e0d\u8db3\u800c\u666e\u904d\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8I/O\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548cGPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "AIRES\u901a\u8fc7\u7b97\u6cd5\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u5757\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5206\u5757\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u53cc\u8def\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "AIRES\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u5904\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u8fbe1.8\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "AIRES\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5916\u5b58SpGEMM\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u56fe\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This module is employed to actively adjust velocity commands in\nresponse to external forces based on real-time force estimates. With the\ncompliance action module, a quadruped robot can robustly handle minor\ndisturbances while appropriately yielding to significant forces, thus striking\na balance between robustness and compliance.

In this work, we\nbenchmark several state-of-the-art foundational LLMs - including models from\nOpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and Deepseek, and compare them with our\nproprietary domain-specific hiring model (Match Score) for job candidate\nmatching. We evaluate each model's predictive accuracy (ROC AUC,\nPrecision-Recall AUC, F1-score) and fairness (impact ratio of cut-off analysis\nacross declared gender, race, and intersectional subgroups). Our experiments on\na dataset of roughly 10,000 real-world recent candidate-job pairs show that\nMatch Score outperforms the general-purpose LLMs on accuracy (ROC AUC 0.85 vs\n0.77) and achieves significantly more equitable outcomes across demographic\ngroups. Notably, Match Score attains a minimum race-wise impact ratio of 0.957\n(near-parity), versus 0.809 or lower for the best LLMs, (0.906 vs 0.773 for the\nintersectionals, respectively). We discuss why pretraining biases may cause\nLLMs with insufficient safeguards to propagate societal biases in hiring\nscenarios, whereas a bespoke supervised model can more effectively mitigate\nthese biases. Our findings highlight the importance of domain-specific modeling\nand bias auditing when deploying AI in high-stakes domains such as hiring, and\ncaution against relying on off-the-shelf LLMs for such tasks without extensive\nfairness safeguards.

In this\npaper, we ask the question \"Is it possible to generalize these System 2\nThinking approaches, and develop models that learn to think solely from\nunsupervised learning?\" Interestingly, we find the answer is yes, by learning\nto explicitly verify the compatibility between inputs and\ncandidate-predictions, and then re-framing prediction problems as optimization\nwith respect to this verifier. Specifically, we train Energy-Based Transformers\n(EBTs) -- a new class of Energy-Based Models (EBMs) -- to assign an energy\nvalue to every input and candidate-prediction pair, enabling predictions\nthrough gradient descent-based energy minimization until convergence. Across\nboth discrete (text) and continuous (visual) modalities, we find EBTs scale\nfaster than the dominant Transformer++ approach during training, achieving an\nup to 35% higher scaling rate with respect to data, batch size, parameters,\nFLOPs, and depth. During inference, EBTs improve performance with System 2\nThinking by 29% more than the Transformer++ on language tasks, and EBTs\noutperform Diffusion Transformers on image denoising while using fewer forward\npasses. Further, we find that EBTs achieve better results than existing models\non most downstream tasks given the same or worse pretraining performance,\nsuggesting that EBTs generalize better than existing approaches.

This coarse-grained annotation approach misaligns with\nthe dynamic and temporally localized nature of emotional responses as they\nunfold with video narratives, introducing label noise that limits emotion\nrecognition algorithm evaluation and performance. To solve the label noise\nproblem caused by coarse-grained annotation, we propose a fine-grained\nannotation method through an immediate recall paradigm.

It includes Conditional 3D\nLookup Table Color Correction (CLTCC) for preliminary color and quality\ncorrection and Multi-Axis Adaptive Enhancement (MAAE) for detail refinement.\nThis model prevents over-enhancement and saturation while handling underwater\nchallenges.

Notably, recent advances in\npre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated\nconsiderable potential in enhancing the generalization capabilities of deep\nlearning models. Despite the increasing attention toward VFM-based domain\nprompt tuning within DG, the effective design of prompts capable of\ndisentangling invariant features across diverse domains remains a critical\nchallenge. In this paper, we propose addressing this challenge by leveraging\nthe controllable and flexible language prompt of the VFM. Noting that the text\nmodality of VFMs is naturally easier to disentangle, we introduce a novel\nframework for text feature-guided visual prompt tuning. This framework first\nautomatically disentangles the text prompt using a large language model (LLM)\nand then learns domain-invariant visual representation guided by the\ndisentangled text feature. However, relying solely on language to guide visual\nfeature disentanglement has limitations, as visual features can sometimes be\ntoo complex or nuanced to be fully captured by descriptive text. To address\nthis, we introduce Worst Explicit Representation Alignment (WERA), which\nextends text-guided visual prompts by incorporating an additional set of\nabstract prompts. These prompts enhance source domain diversity through\nstylized image augmentations, while alignment constraints ensure that visual\nrepresentations remain consistent across both the original and augmented\ndistributions.

However, applying SAM to\nremote sensing (RS) images still faces two major challenges. First, manually\nconstructing precise prompts for each image (e.g., points or boxes) is\nlabor-intensive and inefficient, especially in RS scenarios with dense small\nobjects or spatially fragmented distributions. Second, SAM lacks domain\nadaptability, as it is pre-trained primarily on natural images and struggles to\ncapture RS-specific semantics and spatial characteristics, especially when\nsegmenting novel or unseen classes. To address these issues, inspired by\nfew-shot learning, we propose ViRefSAM, a novel framework that guides SAM\nutilizing only a few annotated reference images that contain class-specific\nobjects. Without requiring manual prompts, ViRefSAM enables automatic\nsegmentation of class-consistent objects across RS images. Specifically,\nViRefSAM introduces two key components while keeping SAM's original\narchitecture intact: (1) a Visual Contextual Prompt Encoder that extracts\nclass-specific semantic clues from reference images and generates object-aware\nprompts via contextual interaction with target images; and (2) a Dynamic Target\nAlignment Adapter, integrated into SAM's image encoder, which mitigates the\ndomain gap by injecting class-specific semantics into target image features,\nenabling SAM to dynamically focus on task-relevant regions. Extensive\nexperiments on three few-shot segmentation benchmarks, including iSAID-5$^i$,\nLoveDA-2$^i$, and COCO-20$^i$, demonstrate that ViRefSAM enables accurate and\nautomatic segmentation of unseen classes by leveraging only a few reference\nimages and consistently outperforms existing few-shot segmentation methods\nacross diverse datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "ViRefSAM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u5f15\u5bfcSAM\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u624b\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3SAM\u5728\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u624b\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63d0\u793a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u793a\u5e76\u6ce8\u5165\u7c7b\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u4e49\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ViRefSAM\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u3002"}}

An\nideal generator would meet three demands at once, namely (i) keep the normal\nbackground intact, (ii) inpaint anomalous regions to tightly overlap with the\ncorresponding anomaly masks, and (iii) generate anomalous regions in a\nsemantically valid location, while still producing realistic, diverse\nappearances from only a handful of real examples.

We propose MAGIC--Mask-guided inpainting\nwith multi-level perturbations and Context-aware alignment--to resolve all\nthree issues. At its core, MAGIC fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting\nbackbone that preserves normal regions and ensures strict adherence of the\nsynthesized anomaly to the supplied mask, directly addressing background\ncorruption and misalignment. To offset the diversity loss that fine-tuning can\ncause, MAGIC adds two complementary perturbation strategies: (i) Gaussian\nprompt-level perturbation applied during fine-tuning and inference that\nbroadens the global appearance of anomalies while avoiding low-fidelity textual\nappearances, and (ii) mask-guided spatial noise injection that enriches local\ntexture variations.

On most ride-hailing aggregator platforms,\nservice providers that offer lower fares are ranked higher in listings and,\nconsequently, are more likely to be selected by passengers. This competitive\nranking mechanism creates a strong incentive for service providers to adopt\ncoupon strategies that lower prices to secure a greater number of orders, as\norder volume directly influences their long-term viability and sustainability.\nThus, designing an effective coupon strategy that can dynamically adapt to\nmarket fluctuations while optimizing order acquisition under budget constraints\nis a critical research challenge.

Numerous advanced\nworks based on LLMs have been proposed and applied in various scenarios. Among\nthem, video language models (VidLMs) are particularly widely used. However,\nexisting works primarily focus on terrestrial scenarios, overlooking the highly\ndemanding application needs of underwater observation. To overcome this gap, we\nintroduce UVLM, an under water observation benchmark which is build through a\ncollaborative approach combining human expertise and AI models. To ensure data\nquality, we have conducted in-depth considerations from multiple perspectives.\nFirst, to address the unique challenges of underwater environments, we selected\nvideos that represent typical underwater challenges including light variations,\nwater turbidity, and diverse viewing angles to construct the dataset. Second,\nto ensure data diversity, the dataset covers a wide range of frame rates,\nresolutions, 419 classes of marine animals, and various static plants and\nterrains. Next, for task diversity, we adopted a structured design where\nobservation targets are categorized into two major classes: biological and\nenvironmental. Each category includes content observation and change/action\nobservation, totaling 20 distinct task types.

From a\nspectral perspective, spectral heterogeneity causes inconsistencies in signal\nfrequencies across subgraphs, which makes local GNNs overfit the local signal\npropagation schemes. As a result, spectral client drifts occur, undermining\nglobal generalizability. To tackle the challenges, we propose a global\nknowledge repository to mitigate label signal disruption and a frequency\nalignment to address spectral client drifts. The combination of spatial and\nspectral strategies forms our framework S2FGL. Extensive experiments on\nmultiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of S2FGL.

However, acquiring large-scale, fully annotated\nmedical image datasets is both time-consuming and costly. Scribble annotations,\nas a form of sparse labeling, provide an efficient and cost-effective\nalternative for medical image segmentation. However, the sparsity of scribble\nannotations limits the feature learning of the target region and lacks\nsufficient boundary supervision, which poses significant challenges for\ntraining segmentation networks. Methods: We propose TAB Net, a novel\nweakly-supervised medical image segmentation framework, consisting of two key\ncomponents: the triplet augmentation self-recovery (TAS) module and the\nboundary-aware pseudo-label supervision (BAP) module. The TAS module enhances\nfeature learning through three complementary augmentation strategies: intensity\ntransformation improves the model's sensitivity to texture and contrast\nvariations, cutout forces the network to capture local anatomical structures by\nmasking key regions, and jigsaw augmentation strengthens the modeling of global\nanatomical layout by disrupting spatial continuity. By guiding the network to\nrecover complete masks from diverse augmented inputs, TAS promotes a deeper\nsemantic understanding of medical images under sparse supervision. The BAP\nmodule enhances pseudo-supervision accuracy and boundary modeling by fusing\ndual-branch predictions into a loss-weighted pseudo-label and introducing a\nboundary-aware loss for fine-grained contour refinement.

Although current 3D Gaussian editing methods\ncan be adapted for facial makeup purposes, these methods fail to meet the\nfundamental requirements for achieving realistic makeup effects: 1) ensuring a\nconsistent appearance during drivable expressions, 2) preserving the identity\nthroughout the makeup process, and 3) enabling precise control over fine\ndetails. To address these, we propose a specialized 3D makeup method named\nAvatarMakeup, leveraging a pretrained diffusion model to transfer makeup\npatterns from a single reference photo of any individual. We adopt a\ncoarse-to-fine idea to first maintain the consistent appearance and identity,\nand then to refine the details. In particular, the diffusion model is employed\nto generate makeup images as supervision. Due to the uncertainties in diffusion\nprocess, the generated images are inconsistent across different viewpoints and\nexpressions. Therefore, we propose a Coherent Duplication method to coarsely\napply makeup to the target while ensuring consistency across dynamic and\nmultiview effects. Coherent Duplication optimizes a global UV map by recoding\nthe averaged facial attributes among the generated makeup images.

Existing TTA methods consider scenarios where data\nfrom one or multiple domains arrives in complete domain units. However, in\nclinical practice, data usually arrives in domain fragments of arbitrary\nlengths and in random arrival orders, due to resource constraints and patient\nvariability. This paper investigates a practical Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation\n(F$^{2}$TTA) task, where a source model is adapted to such free-form domain\nfragments, with shifts occurring between fragments unpredictably. In this\nsetting, these shifts could distort the adaptation process. To address this\nproblem, we propose a novel Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT)\nframework. I-DiPT employs an image-invariant prompt to explore domain-invariant\nrepresentations for mitigating the unpredictable shifts, and an image-specific\nprompt to adapt the source model to each test image from the incoming\nfragments. The prompts may suffer from insufficient knowledge representation\nsince only one image is available for training. To overcome this limitation, we\nfirst introduce Uncertainty-oriented Masking (UoM), which encourages the\nprompts to extract sufficient information from the incoming image via masked\nconsistency learning driven by the uncertainty of the source model\nrepresentations. Then, we further propose a Parallel Graph Distillation (PGD)\nmethod that reuses knowledge from historical image-specific and image-invariant\nprompts through parallel graph networks. Experiments on breast cancer and\nglaucoma classification demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing\nTTA approaches in F$^{2}$TTA.

We demonstrate our approach using the Medical Data Pecking\nTool (MDPT), which consists of two main components: (1) an automated test\ngenerator that uses large language models and grounding techniques to create a\ntest suite from data and study descriptions, and (2) a data testing framework\nthat executes these tests, reporting potential errors and coverage.\n  Results: We evaluated MDPT on three datasets: All of Us (AoU), MIMIC-III, and\nSyntheticMass, generating 55-73 tests per cohort across four conditions.

Among them,\npedestrian tracking has extremely high application value and has become the\nmost popular research category. Existing methods mainly use motion or\nappearance information for tracking, which is often difficult in complex\nscenarios. For the motion information, mutual occlusions between objects often\nprevent updating of the motion state; for the appearance information,\nnon-robust results are often obtained due to reasons such as only partial\nvisibility of the object or blurred images. Although learning how to perform\ntracking in these situations from the annotated data is the simplest solution,\nthe existing MOT dataset fails to satisfy this solution. Existing methods\nmainly have two drawbacks: relatively simple scene composition and\nnon-realistic scenarios. Although some of the video sequences in existing\ndataset do not have the above-mentioned drawbacks, the number is far from\nadequate for research purposes. To this end, we propose a difficult large-scale\ndataset for multi-pedestrian tracking, shot mainly from the first-person view\nand all from real-life complex scenarios. We name it ``CrowdTrack'' because\nthere are numerous objects in most of the sequences. Our dataset consists of 33\nvideos, containing a total of 5,185 trajectories. Each object is annotated with\na complete bounding box and a unique object ID. The dataset will provide a\nplatform to facilitate the development of algorithms that remain effective in\ncomplex situations.

IMASHRIMP incorporates two discrimination\nmodules, based on a modified ResNet-50 architecture, to classify images by the\npoint of view and determine rostrum integrity. It is proposed a \"two-factor\nauthentication (human and IA)\" system, it reduces human error in view\nclassification from 0.97% to 0% and in rostrum detection from 12.46% to 3.64%.\nAdditionally, a pose estimation module was adapted from VitPose to predict 23\nkey points on the shrimp's skeleton, with separate networks for lateral and\ndorsal views. A morphological regression module, using a Support Vector Machine\n(SVM) model, was integrated to convert pixel measurements to centimeter units.\nExperimental results show that the system effectively reduces human error,\nachieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 97.94% for pose estimation and a\npixel-to-centimeter conversion error of 0.07 (+/- 0.1) cm.

This study addresses that gap by evaluating the performance of three\nMARL algorithms: MADDPG, MADQN, and QMIX against static rule-based baselines,\nwithin a simulated environment informed by real e-commerce transaction data and\na LightGBM demand prediction model. Results show that rule-based agents achieve\nnear-perfect fairness (Jain's Index: 0.9896) and the highest price stability\n(volatility: 0.024), but they fully lack competitive dynamics. Among MARL\nagents, MADQN exhibits the most aggressive pricing behaviour, with the highest\nvolatility and the lowest fairness (0.5844). MADDPG provides a more balanced\napproach, supporting market competition (share volatility: 9.5 pp) while\nmaintaining relatively high fairness (0.8819) and stable pricing. These\nfindings suggest that MARL introduces emergent strategic behaviour not captured\nby static pricing rules and may inform future developments in dynamic pricing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MARL\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u6539\u8fdb\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u52a8\u6001\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e09\u79cdMARL\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u9759\u6001\u89c4\u5219\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfERP\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u89c4\u5219\u5b9a\u4ef7\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u5e02\u573a\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u95f4\u7684\u6218\u7565\u4e92\u52a8\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u4e3a\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u7535\u5546\u4ea4\u6613\u6570\u636e\u548cLightGBM\u9700\u6c42\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30MADDPG\u3001MADQN\u548cQMIX\u4e09\u79cdMARL\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u9759\u6001\u89c4\u5219\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u9759\u6001\u89c4\u5219\u65b9\u6cd5\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u9ad8\uff08Jain\u6307\u65700.9896\uff09\u4e14\u4ef7\u683c\u7a33\u5b9a\uff08\u6ce2\u52a80.024\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ade\u4e89\u52a8\u6001\uff1bMADQN\u5b9a\u4ef7\u6700\u6fc0\u8fdb\uff08\u516c\u5e73\u60270.5844\uff09\uff0cMADDPG\u5e73\u8861\u7ade\u4e89\u4e0e\u516c\u5e73\uff08\u516c\u5e73\u60270.8819\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "MARL\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u9759\u6001\u89c4\u5219\u65e0\u6cd5\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u6218\u7565\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7684\u672a\u6765\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose Adaptive Personalized Training\n(APT), a novel framework that mitigates overfitting by employing adaptive\ntraining strategies and regularizing the model's internal representations\nduring fine-tuning. APT consists of three key components: (1) Adaptive Training\nAdjustment, which introduces an overfitting indicator to detect the degree of\noverfitting at each time step bin and applies adaptive data augmentation and\nadaptive loss weighting based on this indicator; (2)Representation\nStabilization, which regularizes the mean and variance of intermediate feature\nmaps to prevent excessive shifts in noise prediction; and (3) Attention\nAlignment for Prior Knowledge Preservation, which aligns the cross-attention\nmaps of the fine-tuned model with those of the pretrained model to maintain\nprior knowledge and semantic coherence. Through extensive experiments, we\ndemonstrate that APT effectively mitigates overfitting, preserves prior\nknowledge, and outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality, diverse\nimages with limited reference data.", "AI": {"tldr": "APT\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3001\u4e22\u5931\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u9000\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "APT\u5305\u542b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bad\u7ec3\u8c03\u6574\u3001\u8868\u793a\u7a33\u5b9a\u5316\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3001\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u4fdd\u6301\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eAPT\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u591a\u6837\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "conclusion": "APT\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

GRPO-style approaches implement\nthis by using self-generated samples labeled by an outcome-based verifier.\nHowever, these methods depend heavily on the model's initial ability to produce\npositive samples. They primarily refine what the model already knows\n(distribution sharpening) rather than enabling the model to solve problems\nwhere it initially fails. This limitation is especially problematic in\nearly-stage RL training and on challenging reasoning tasks, where positive\nsamples are unlikely to be generated. To unlock reasoning ability in such\nsettings, the model must explore new reasoning trajectories beyond its current\noutput distribution. Such exploration requires access to sufficiently good\npositive samples to guide the learning.

Recent efforts extend these\nmodels to incorporate conditional images (e.g., depth or pose maps) for\nfine-grained spatial control. Among them, feature injection methods have\nemerged as a training-free alternative to traditional fine-tuning approaches.\nHowever, they often suffer from structural misalignment, condition leakage, and\nvisual artifacts, especially when the condition image diverges significantly\nfrom natural RGB distributions. By revisiting existing methods, we identify a\ncore limitation: the synchronous injection of condition features fails to\naccount for the trade-off between domain alignment and structural preservation\nduring denoising. Inspired by this observation, we propose a flexible feature\ninjection framework that decouples the injection timestep from the denoising\nprocess. At its core is a structure-rich injection module, which enables the\nmodel to better adapt to the evolving interplay between alignment and structure\npreservation throughout the diffusion steps, resulting in more faithful\nstructural generation.

Recent developments have achieved\nthis by performing per-scene optimization with embedded language information.\nHowever, they heavily rely on the calibrated dense-view reconstruction\nparadigm, thereby suffering from severe rendering artifacts and implausible\nsemantic synthesis when limited views are available. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel generative framework, coined LangScene-X, to unify and\ngenerate 3D consistent multi-modality information for reconstruction and\nunderstanding.

Furthermore, we propose a Language Quantized Compressor (LQC),\ntrained on large-scale image datasets, to efficiently encode language\nembeddings, enabling cross-scene generalization without per-scene retraining.\nFinally, we reconstruct the language surface fields by aligning language\ninformation onto the surface of 3D scenes, enabling open-ended language\nqueries.

However, the security vulnerabilities exhibited by the visual\nmodality pose significant challenges to deploying such models in open-world\nenvironments. Recent studies have successfully induced harmful responses from\ntarget MLLMs by encoding harmful textual semantics directly into visual inputs.\nHowever, in these approaches, the visual modality primarily serves as a trigger\nfor unsafe behavior, often exhibiting semantic ambiguity and lacking grounding\nin realistic scenarios. In this work, we define a novel setting: visual-centric\njailbreak, where visual information serves as a necessary component in\nconstructing a complete and realistic jailbreak context. Building on this\nsetting, we propose the VisCo (Visual Contextual) Attack.

Following the paradigm introduced by DUSt3R, which unifies\nan image pair densely into a shared coordinate system, subsequent methods\nmaintain an implicit memory to achieve dense 3D reconstruction from more\nimages. However, such implicit memory is limited in capacity and may suffer\nfrom information loss of earlier frames. We propose Point3R, an online\nframework targeting dense streaming 3D reconstruction. To be specific, we\nmaintain an explicit spatial pointer memory directly associated with the 3D\nstructure of the current scene. Each pointer in this memory is assigned a\nspecific 3D position and aggregates scene information nearby in the global\ncoordinate system into a changing spatial feature. Information extracted from\nthe latest frame interacts explicitly with this pointer memory, enabling dense\nintegration of the current observation into the global coordinate system. We\ndesign a 3D hierarchical position embedding to promote this interaction and\ndesign a simple yet effective fusion mechanism to ensure that our pointer\nmemory is uniform and efficient. Our method achieves competitive or\nstate-of-the-art performance on various tasks with low training costs.
