To address these limitations, we propose Inversion-DPO, a novel\nalignment framework that circumvents reward modeling by reformulating Direct\nPreference Optimization (DPO) with DDIM inversion for DMs. Our method conducts\nintractable posterior sampling in Diffusion-DPO with the deterministic\ninversion from winning and losing samples to noise and thus derive a new\npost-training paradigm. This paradigm eliminates the need for auxiliary reward\nmodels or inaccurate appromixation, significantly enhancing both precision and\nefficiency of training. We apply Inversion-DPO to a basic task of text-to-image\ngeneration and a challenging task of compositional image generation. Extensive\nexperiments show substantial performance improvements achieved by Inversion-DPO\ncompared to existing post-training methods and highlight the ability of the\ntrained generative models to generate high-fidelity compositionally coherent\nimages.

While recent efforts have explored adapting large language\nmodels (LLMs) for time-series forecasting, LLMs primarily capture\none-dimensional sequential dependencies and struggle to model the richer\nspatio-temporal (ST) correlations essential for accurate ST forecasting. In\nthis paper, we present \\textbf{ST-VFM}, a novel framework that systematically\nreprograms Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for general-purpose spatio-temporal\nforecasting. While VFMs offer powerful spatial priors, two key challenges arise\nwhen applying them to ST tasks: (1) the lack of inherent temporal modeling\ncapacity and (2) the modality gap between visual and ST data. To address these,\nST-VFM adopts a \\emph{dual-branch architecture} that integrates raw ST inputs\nwith auxiliary ST flow inputs, where the flow encodes lightweight temporal\ndifference signals interpretable as dynamic spatial cues. To effectively\nprocess these dual-branch inputs, ST-VFM introduces two dedicated reprogramming\nstages.

While meshes offer high precision, their\ndense vertex data complicates editing; NeRFs deliver excellent rendering but\nsuffer from structural ambiguity, hindering animation and manipulation; all\nrepresentations inherently struggle with the trade-off between data complexity\nand fidelity. To overcome these issues, we introduce a novel 3D Hierarchical\nProxy Node representation. Its core innovation lies in representing an object's\nshape and texture via a sparse set of hierarchically organized\n(tree-structured) proxy nodes distributed on its surface and interior. Each\nnode stores local shape and texture information (implicitly encoded by a small\nMLP) within its neighborhood.

However, extending these\ngains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains\na challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this\nintuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language\nModels(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge,\nhuman-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as\nverifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and\nrobotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a\nstrong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often\ngenerating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is\npervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several\nmethods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering). Notably, it occurs\ndespite MLLMs showing strong, human-aligned priors on desired behavior. To\naddress this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method\nthat enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing\ntheir own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation. SGV\noperates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to retrieve broad priors\nabout task completion, independent of the data under evaluation. Then,\nconditioned on self-generated priors, it reasons over and evaluates a candidate\ntrajectory. Enhanced with SGV, MLLM verifiers show gains of up to 20 points in\naccuracy and failure detection rates, and can perform real-time supervision of\nheterogeneous agents, boosting task completion of a GUI specialist in OSWorld,\na diffusion policy in robomimic, and a ReAct agent in VisualWebArena -- setting\na new state of the art on the benchmark, surpassing the previous best by 48%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5b58\u5728\u2018\u540c\u610f\u504f\u89c1\u2019\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u6211\u57fa\u7840\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff08SGV\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u6210\u529f\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4f7f\u7528\uff09\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f4\u89c9\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\uff0cMLLMs\u56e0\u5176\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u6210\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u6211\u57fa\u7840\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff08SGV\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u4e24\u6b65\uff0c\u5229\u7528MLLMs\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u673a\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "SGV\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86MLLMs\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff08\u9ad8\u8fbe20\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e4b\u524d\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd548%\u3002", "conclusion": "SGV\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86MLLMs\u7684\u2018\u540c\u610f\u504f\u89c1\u2019\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the\npotential to automate this process. However, DP problems pose unique challenges\ndue to their inherently stochastic transitions and the limited availability of\ntraining data. These factors make it difficult to directly apply existing\nLLM-based models or frameworks developed for other optimization problems, such\nas linear or integer programming. We introduce DP-Bench, the first benchmark\ncovering a wide range of textbook-level DP problems to enable systematic\nevaluation. We present Dynamic Programming Language Model (DPLM), a\n7B-parameter specialized model that achieves performance comparable to\nstate-of-the-art LLMs like OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, and surpasses them on\nhard problems. Central to DPLM's effectiveness is DualReflect, our novel\nsynthetic data generation pipeline, designed to scale up training data from a\nlimited set of initial examples. DualReflect combines forward generation for\ndiversity and backward generation for reliability. Our results reveal a key\ninsight: backward generation is favored in low-data regimes for its strong\ncorrectness guarantees, while forward generation, though lacking such\nguarantees, becomes increasingly valuable at scale for introducing diverse\nformulations.

To address these challenges,\nwe propose VISTA (View-Invariant Segmentation-Based Tracking for Frame\nAlignment), a novel open-set, monocular global localization framework that\ncombines: 1) a front-end, object-based, segmentation and tracking pipeline,\nfollowed by 2) a submap correspondence search, which exploits geometric\nconsistencies between environment maps to align vehicle reference frames. VISTA\nenables consistent localization across diverse camera viewpoints and seasonal\nchanges, without requiring any domain-specific training or finetuning. We\nevaluate VISTA on seasonal and oblique-angle aerial datasets, achieving up to a\n69% improvement in recall over baseline methods.

Designing intelligent systems with\nhuman-like AVR abilities has been a long-standing topic in the artificial\nintelligence community.

In such a paradigm, solving new tasks often\nmeans retraining the model, and sometimes retuning the model architectures,\nwhich increases the cost of solving AVR problems.

In this work, we\npropose a novel framework that leverages the inherent knowledge of vanilla\nautoregressive language models about future tokens, combining techniques to\nrealize this potential and enable simultaneous prediction of multiple\nsubsequent tokens. Our approach introduces several key innovations: (1) a\nmasked-input formulation where multiple future tokens are jointly predicted\nfrom a common prefix; (2) a gated LoRA formulation that preserves the original\nLLM's functionality, while equipping it for multi-token prediction; (3) a\nlightweight, learnable sampler module that generates coherent sequences from\nthe predicted future tokens; (4) a set of auxiliary training losses, including\na consistency loss, to enhance the coherence and accuracy of jointly generated\ntokens; and (5) a speculative generation strategy that expands tokens\nquadratically in the future while maintaining high fidelity. Our method\nachieves significant speedups through supervised fine-tuning on pretrained\nmodels. For example, it generates code and math nearly 5x faster, and improves\ngeneral chat and knowledge tasks by almost 2.5x.

This paper proposes a topology-enhanced MARL (TPE-MARL)\nmethod for optimizing cooperative decision-making of connected and autonomous\nvehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic. This work presents two primary contributions:\nFirst, we construct a game topology tensor for dynamic traffic flow,\neffectively compressing high-dimensional traffic state information and decrease\nthe search space for MARL algorithms. Second, building upon the designed game\ntopology tensor and using QMIX as the backbone RL algorithm, we establish a\ntopology-enhanced MARL framework incorporating visit counts and agent mutual\ninformation. Extensive simulations across varying traffic densities and CAV\npenetration rates demonstrate the effectiveness of TPE-MARL. Evaluations\nencompassing training dynamics, exploration patterns, macroscopic traffic\nperformance metrics, and microscopic vehicle behaviors reveal that TPE-MARL\nsuccessfully balances exploration and exploitation. Consequently, it exhibits\nsuperior performance in terms of traffic efficiency, safety, decision\nsmoothness, and task completion. Furthermore, the algorithm demonstrates\ndecision-making rationality comparable to or exceeding that of human drivers in\nboth mixed-autonomy and fully autonomous traffic scenarios.

However,\naccording to the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem, high-frequency components\nare vulnerable to aliasing or distortion when propagating through downsampling\nlayers such as strided-convolution. Here, we propose a novel Spatial Frequency\nModulation (SFM) that modulates high-frequency features to a lower frequency\nbefore downsampling and then demodulates them back during upsampling.\nSpecifically, we implement modulation through adaptive resampling (ARS) and\ndesign a lightweight add-on that can densely sample the high-frequency areas to\nscale up the signal, thereby lowering its frequency in accordance with the\nFrequency Scaling Property. We also propose Multi-Scale Adaptive Upsampling\n(MSAU) to demodulate the modulated feature and recover high-frequency\ninformation through non-uniform upsampling This module further improves\nsegmentation by explicitly exploiting information interaction between densely\nand sparsely resampled areas at multiple scales.

Prior work has shown that LLMs' refusal\nbehaviors can be mediated by a one-dimensional subspace, i.e., a refusal\ndirection. In this work, we identify a new dimension to analyze safety\nmechanisms in LLMs, i.e., harmfulness, which is encoded internally as a\nseparate concept from refusal. There exists a harmfulness direction that is\ndistinct from the refusal direction. As causal evidence, steering along the\nharmfulness direction can lead LLMs to interpret harmless instructions as\nharmful, but steering along the refusal direction tends to elicit refusal\nresponses directly without reversing the model's judgment on harmfulness.\nFurthermore, using our identified harmfulness concept, we find that certain\njailbreak methods work by reducing the refusal signals without reversing the\nmodel's internal belief of harmfulness. We also find that adversarially\nfinetuning models to accept harmful instructions has minimal impact on the\nmodel's internal belief of harmfulness. These insights lead to a practical\nsafety application: The model's latent harmfulness representation can serve as\nan intrinsic safeguard (Latent Guard) for detecting unsafe inputs and reducing\nover-refusals that is robust to finetuning attacks. For instance, our Latent\nGuard achieves performance comparable to or better than Llama Guard 3 8B, a\ndedicated finetuned safeguard model, across different jailbreak methods.

Therefore, evaluating the visual quality of compressed videos is\ncrucial for guiding the practical usage and further development of video\ncompression algorithms. Although numerous compressed video quality assessment\n(VQA) methods have been proposed, they often lack the generalization capability\nneeded to handle the increasing diversity of video types, particularly high\ndynamic range (HDR) content. In this paper, we introduce CompressedVQA-HDR, an\neffective VQA framework designed to address the challenges of HDR video quality\nassessment. Specifically, we adopt the Swin Transformer and SigLip 2 as the\nbackbone networks for the proposed full-reference (FR) and no-reference (NR)\nVQA models, respectively. For the FR model, we compute deep structural and\ntextural similarities between reference and distorted frames using\nintermediate-layer features extracted from the Swin Transformer as its\nquality-aware feature representation. For the NR model, we extract the global\nmean of the final-layer feature maps from SigLip 2 as its quality-aware\nrepresentation. To mitigate the issue of limited HDR training data, we\npre-train the FR model on a large-scale standard dynamic range (SDR) VQA\ndataset and fine-tune it on the HDRSDR-VQA dataset. For the NR model, we employ\nan iterative mixed-dataset training strategy across multiple compressed VQA\ndatasets, followed by fine-tuning on the HDRSDR-VQA dataset.

Class-wise prototypes, representing class centroids, serve as\ndomain-invariant cues that benefit generalization due to their stability and\nsemantic consistency.

Second, naive prototypes computed by averaging source\nbatch features are prone to overfitting and may be negatively affected by\nunrelated source data.

Although unsupervised\npart discovery can eliminate the reliance on labels, most of them cannot\nmaintain robustness across various categories and scenarios, which restricts\ntheir application range. To overcome this limitation, we present a more\neffective paradigm for unsupervised part discovery, named Masked Part\nAutoencoder (MPAE). It first learns part descriptors as well as a feature map\nfrom the inputs and produces patch features from a masked version of the\noriginal images. Then, the masked regions are filled with the learned part\ndescriptors based on the similarity between the local features and descriptors.\nBy restoring these masked patches using the part descriptors, they become\nbetter aligned with their part shapes, guided by appearance features from\nunmasked patches. Finally, MPAE robustly discovers meaningful parts that\nclosely match the actual object shapes, even in complex scenarios. Moreover,\nseveral looser yet more effective constraints are proposed to enable MPAE to\nidentify the presence of parts across various scenarios and categories in an\nunsupervised manner. This provides the foundation for addressing challenges\nposed by occlusion and for exploring part similarity across multiple\ncategories.

We introduce ID-EA, a novel framework that\nguides text embeddings to align with visual identity embeddings, thereby\nimproving identity preservation in a personalized generation. ID-EA comprises\ntwo key components: the ID-driven Enhancer (ID-Enhancer) and the ID-conditioned\nAdapter (ID-Adapter).

It\nproposes innovative approaches based on representation smoothness, including\nregularization strategies that utilize Jacobian and Hessian matrices to\nstabilize training and mitigate sensitivity to input perturbations. The second\npart focuses on methods to significantly enhance data and parameter efficiency\nby integrating active learning strategies with parameter-efficient fine-tuning,\nguided by insights from representation smoothness analysis. It presents\nsmoothness-informed early-stopping techniques designed to eliminate the need\nfor labeled validation sets and proposes innovative combinations of active\nlearning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning to reduce labeling efforts and\ncomputational resources. Extensive experimental evaluations across various NLP\ntasks demonstrate that these combined approaches substantially outperform\ntraditional methods in terms of performance, stability, and efficiency. The\nthird part explores weak supervision techniques enhanced by in-context learning\nto effectively utilize unlabeled data, further reducing dependence on extensive\nlabeling. It shows that using in-context learning as a mechanism for weak\nsupervision enables models to better generalize from limited labeled data by\nleveraging unlabeled examples more effectively during training.

However, the attention\nmechanism in ViTs makes each layer function as a low-pass filter, and the\nstacked-layer architecture in existing transformers suffers from frequency\nvanishing. This leads to the loss of critical details and textures. We propose\na novel, circuit-theory-inspired strategy called Frequency-Dynamic Attention\nModulation (FDAM), which can be easily plugged into ViTs. FDAM directly\nmodulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two\ntechniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling\n(FreqScale). Since circuit theory uses low-pass filters as fundamental\nelements, we introduce AttInv, a method that generates complementary high-pass\nfiltering by inverting the low-pass filter in the attention matrix, and\ndynamically combining the two. We further design FreqScale to weight different\nfrequency components for fine-grained adjustments to the target response\nfunction. Through feature similarity analysis and effective rank evaluation, we\ndemonstrate that our approach avoids representation collapse, leading to\nconsistent performance improvements across various models, including SegFormer,\nDeiT, and MaskDINO. These improvements are evident in tasks such as semantic\nsegmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Additionally, we\napply our method to remote sensing detection, achieving state-of-the-art\nresults in single-scale settings.

In\nterms of decoupling, we design a Spectral Adaptive Idempotent Decoupling (SAID)\nmodule in the aspect of spectral decomposition. Due to the style and content\ninformation being highly embedded in different frequency bands, this module can\ndecouple DI and DS components more accurately and interpretably. A novel filter\nbank-based spectral processing paradigm and a self-distillation-driven\ndecoupling loss are proposed to improve the spectral domain decoupling. In\nterms of coupling, a new spatial-spectral coupling method is proposed, which\nrealizes joint coupling through spatial and spectral DI feature pyramids.\nMeanwhile, this paper introduces DS from decoupling to reduce the domain bias.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the\nbaseline performance and outperform existing UDAOD methods on multiple RGB-IR\ndatasets, including a new experimental protocol proposed in this paper based on\nthe FLIR-ADAS dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89e3\u8026-\u8026\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u7684SS-DC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u5230\u7ea2\u5916\uff08RGB-IR\uff09\u57df\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4-\u5149\u8c31\u8026\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06RGB\u57df\u89c6\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u57df\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u591a\u4e2a\u5b50\u57df\uff08\u5982\u767d\u5929\u3001\u591c\u665a\u3001\u96fe\u5929\u573a\u666f\uff09\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u89e3\u8026\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u548c\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u6709\u52a9\u4e8eRGB-IR\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5149\u8c31\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e42\u7b49\u89e3\u8026\uff08SAID\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u89e3\u89e3\u8026\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u548c\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u7ec4\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u5904\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\u548c\u89e3\u8026\u635f\u5931\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4-\u5149\u8c31\u8026\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u57fa\u7ebf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2aRGB-IR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8eFLIR-ADAS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u65b0\u5b9e\u9a8c\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026-\u8026\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0cSS-DC\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86RGB-IR\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u591a\u5b50\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

While recent advances have made significant progress in this area,\nexisting NCD methods face two major limitations. First, they primarily focus on\nsingle-view data (e.g., images), overlooking the increasingly common multi-view\ndata, such as multi-omics datasets used in disease diagnosis. Second, their\nreliance on pseudo-labels to supervise novel class clustering often results in\nunstable performance, as pseudo-label quality is highly sensitive to factors\nsuch as data noise and feature dimensionality. To address these challenges, we\npropose a novel framework named Intra-view and Inter-view Correlation Guided\nMulti-view Novel Class Discovery (IICMVNCD), which is the first attempt to\nexplore NCD in multi-view setting so far. Specifically, at the intra-view\nlevel, leveraging the distributional similarity between known and novel\nclasses, we employ matrix factorization to decompose features into\nview-specific shared base matrices and factor matrices. The base matrices\ncapture distributional consistency among the two datasets, while the factor\nmatrices model pairwise relationships between samples. At the inter-view level,\nwe utilize view relationships among known classes to guide the clustering of\nnovel classes. This includes generating predicted labels through the weighted\nfusion of factor matrices and dynamically adjusting view weights of known\nclasses based on the supervision loss, which are then transferred to novel\nclass learning.

In the realm\nof Electronic Design Automation (EDA), LLMs show promise for tasks like\nRegister-Transfer Level (RTL) code generation and summarization. However,\ndespite the proliferation of LLMs for general code-related tasks, there's a\ndearth of research focused on evaluating and refining these models for hardware\ndescription languages (HDLs), notably VHDL. In this study, we evaluate the\nperformance of existing code LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization\nusing various metrics and two datasets -- VHDL-Eval and VHDL-Xform. The latter,\nan in-house dataset, aims to gauge LLMs' understanding of functionally\nequivalent code. Our findings reveal consistent underperformance of these\nmodels across different metrics, underscoring a significant gap in their\nsuitability for this domain. To address this challenge, we propose\nChain-of-Descriptions (CoDes), a novel approach to enhance the performance of\nLLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization tasks. CoDes involves\ngenerating a series of intermediate descriptive steps based on: (i) the problem\nstatement for code generation, and (ii) the VHDL code for summarization. These\nsteps are then integrated with the original input prompt (problem statement or\ncode) and provided as input to the LLMs to generate the final output. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that the CoDes approach significantly surpasses the\nstandard prompting strategy across various metrics on both datasets.

In contrast to most existing data-driven approaches that directly\npredict future trajectories, we rethink this task from a planning perspective,\nadvocating a \"First Reasoning, Then Forecasting\" strategy that explicitly\nincorporates behavior intentions as spatial guidance for trajectory prediction.\nTo achieve this, we introduce an interpretable, reward-driven intention\nreasoner grounded in a novel query-centric Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL)\nscheme. Our method first encodes traffic agents and scene elements into a\nunified vectorized representation, then aggregates contextual features through\na query-centric paradigm. This enables the derivation of a reward distribution,\na compact yet informative representation of the target agent's behavior within\nthe given scene context via IRL.

This\nleads to highly entangled features and strong black-box characteristics, making\nthe model prone to shortcut learning. To mitigate the above issues, this paper\nproposes a wavelet-based low-light stereo image enhancement method with feature\nspace decoupling. Our insight comes from the following findings: (1) Wavelet\ntransform enables the independent processing of low-frequency and\nhigh-frequency information. (2) Illumination adjustment can be achieved by\nadjusting the low-frequency component of a low-light image, extracted through\nmulti-level wavelet decomposition. Thus, by using wavelet transform the feature\nspace is decomposed into a low-frequency branch for illumination adjustment and\nmultiple high-frequency branches for texture enhancement. Additionally, stereo\nlow-light image enhancement can extract useful cues from another view to\nimprove enhancement. To this end, we propose a novel high-frequency guided\ncross-view interaction module (HF-CIM) that operates within high-frequency\nbranches rather than across the entire feature space, effectively extracting\nvaluable image details from the other view. Furthermore, to enhance the\nhigh-frequency information, a detail and texture enhancement module (DTEM) is\nproposed based on cross-attention mechanism.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have strong generative\ncapabilities, they are limited by static pretraining, short context windows,\nand challenges in processing heterogeneous data formats. Conventional\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks address some of these gaps but\noften struggle with structured and semi-structured data.\n  This work proposes an advanced RAG framework that combines hybrid retrieval\nstrategies using dense embeddings (all-mpnet-base-v2) and BM25, enhanced by\nmetadata-aware filtering with SpaCy NER and cross-encoder reranking. The\nframework applies semantic chunking to maintain textual coherence and retains\ntabular data structures to preserve row-column integrity. Quantized indexing\noptimizes retrieval efficiency, while human-in-the-loop feedback and\nconversation memory improve adaptability.\n  Experiments on enterprise datasets show notable improvements: Precision@5\nincreased by 15 percent (90 versus 75), Recall@5 by 13 percent (87 versus 74),\nand Mean Reciprocal Rank by 16 percent (0.85 versus 0.69). Qualitative\nevaluations show higher scores in Faithfulness (4.6 versus 3.0), Completeness\n(4.2 versus 2.5), and Relevance (4.5 versus 3.2) on a 5-point Likert scale.\nThese results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in delivering accurate,\ncomprehensive, and contextually relevant responses for enterprise tasks.

To explore this, we propose benchmark-targeted\nranking (BETR), a simple method that selects pretraining documents based on\nsimilarity to benchmark training examples.

However, existing approaches are limited to linear affine\ntransformations, hindering their ability to model complex color relationships.\nMeanwhile, while multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) excel at non-linear mappings,\ntraditional MLP-based methods employ globally shared parameters, which is hard\nto deal with localized variations. To overcome these dual challenges, we\npropose a Bilateral Grid-based Pixel-Adaptive Multi-layer Perceptron (BPAM)\nframework. Our approach synergizes the spatial modeling of bilateral grids with\nthe non-linear capabilities of MLPs. Specifically, we generate bilateral grids\ncontaining MLP parameters, where each pixel dynamically retrieves its unique\ntransformation parameters and obtain a distinct MLP for color mapping based on\nspatial coordinates and intensity values.

We introduce a novel training framework, TGDA, that integrates\ndata-aware augmentation with weak supervision via a fine-grained-aware teacher\nmodel, implemented through knowledge distillation. This framework unlocks the\ndesign of task-specific and hardware-aware architectures, including LRNets for\nlow-resolution FGIR and ViTFS, a family of Vision Transformers optimized for\nefficient inference.\n  Extensive experiments across three FGIR benchmarks over diverse settings\ninvolving low-resolution and high-resolution inputs show that our method\nconsistently matches or surpasses state-of-the-art pretrained counterparts.

Existing 3D generation\nprimarily emphasizes geometries and textures while neglecting physical-grounded\nmodeling. Consequently, despite the rapid development of 3D generative models,\nthe synthesized 3D assets often overlook rich and important physical\nproperties, hampering their real-world application in physical domains like\nsimulation and embodied AI. As an initial attempt to address this challenge, we\npropose \\textbf{PhysX}, an end-to-end paradigm for physical-grounded 3D asset\ngeneration. 1) To bridge the critical gap in physics-annotated 3D datasets, we\npresent PhysXNet - the first physics-grounded 3D dataset systematically\nannotated across five foundational dimensions: absolute scale, material,\naffordance, kinematics, and function description. In particular, we devise a\nscalable human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline based on vision-language models,\nwhich enables efficient creation of physics-first assets from raw 3D assets.2)\nFurthermore, we propose \\textbf{PhysXGen}, a feed-forward framework for\nphysics-grounded image-to-3D asset generation, injecting physical knowledge\ninto the pre-trained 3D structural space. Specifically, PhysXGen employs a\ndual-branch architecture to explicitly model the latent correlations between 3D\nstructures and physical properties, thereby producing 3D assets with plausible\nphysical predictions while preserving the native geometry quality. Extensive\nexperiments validate the superior performance and promising generalization\ncapability of our framework. All the code, data, and models will be released to\nfacilitate future research in generative physical AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PhysX\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u76843D\u8d44\u4ea7\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6570\u636e\u96c6PhysXNet\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6PhysXGen\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u67093D\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7269\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u5177\u8eabAI\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "1) \u6784\u5efa\u7269\u7406\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6PhysXNet\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u6846\u67b6PhysXGen\uff0c\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\u6ce8\u5165\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76843D\u7ed3\u6784\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86PhysXGen\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "PhysX\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u76843D\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u3001\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u5f00\u6e90\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}
