This paper will present a\nreal-time object detection system based on RT-DETR, enhanced by employing\naugmented synthetic images while strictly evaluating on real data. This study\nemploys RT-DETR for the maritime environment by combining multi-scale feature\nfusion, uncertainty-minimizing query selection, and smart weight between\nsynthetic and real training samples. The fusion module in DETR enhances the\ndetection of small, low-contrast vessels, query selection focuses on the most\nreliable proposals, and the weighting strategy helps reduce the visual gap\nbetween synthetic and real domains. This design preserves DETR's refined\nend-to-end set prediction while allowing users to adjust between speed and\naccuracy at inference time. Data augmentation techniques were also used to\nbalance the different classes of the dataset to improve the robustness and\naccuracy of the model. Regarding this study, a full Python robust maritime\ndetection pipeline is delivered that maintains real-time performance even under\npractical limits.

(i) While the emphasis is on\nsubject-centric prompts or static camera scenes, camera motion essential for\nproducing cinematic shots and existing metrics under dynamic motion are largely\nunexplored. (ii) These benchmarks typically aggregate video-level scores into a\nsingle model-level score for ranking generative models. Such aggregation,\nhowever, overlook video-level evaluation, which is vital to selecting the\nbetter video among the candidate videos generated for a given prompt. To\naddress these gaps, we introduce DynamicEval, a benchmark consisting of\nsystematically curated prompts emphasizing dynamic camera motion, paired with\n45k human annotations on video pairs from 3k videos generated by ten T2V\nmodels. DynamicEval evaluates two key dimensions of video quality: background\nscene consistency and foreground object consistency. For background scene\nconsistency, we obtain the interpretable error maps based on the Vbench motion\nsmoothness metric. We observe that while the Vbench motion smoothness metric\nshows promising alignment with human judgments, it fails in two cases:\nocclusions/disocclusions arising from camera and foreground object movements.\nBuilding on this, we propose a new background consistency metric that leverages\nobject error maps to correct two failure cases in a principled manner. Our\nsecond innovation is the introduction of a foreground consistency metric that\ntracks points and their neighbors within each object instance to assess object\nfidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed metrics achieve\nstronger correlations with human preferences at both the video level and the\nmodel level (an improvement of more than 2% points), establishing DynamicEval\nas a more comprehensive benchmark for evaluating T2V models under dynamic\ncamera motion."}

Due to the limited availability of\nhigh-quality training samples and the high dimensionality of spectral data, HSI\nclassification models are prone to overfitting and often face challenges in\nbalancing accuracy and computational complexity. Furthermore, most of HSI\nclassification models are monomodal, where it solely relies on spectral-spatial\ndata to learn decision boundaries in the high dimensional embedding space. To\naddress this, we propose a general-purpose Semantic Spectral-Spatial Fusion\nNetwork (S3FN) that uses contextual, class specific textual descriptions to\ncomplement the training of an HSI classification model. Specifically, S3FN\nleverages LLMs to generate comprehensive textual descriptions for each class\nlabel that captures their unique characteristics and spectral behaviors. These\ndescriptions are then embedded into a vector space using a pre-trained text\nencoder such as BERT or RoBERTa to extract meaningful label semantics which in\nturn leads to a better feature-label alignment for improved classification\nperformance.

Both qualitative and\nquantitative evaluations demonstrate that X2Video can produce long, temporally\nconsistent, and photorealistic videos guided by intrinsic conditions.\nAdditionally, X2Video effectively accommodates multi-modal controls with\nreference images, global and local text prompts, and simultaneously supports\nediting on color, material, geometry, and lighting through parametric tuning.\nProject page: https://luckyhzt.github.io/x2video"}

The system is modular in that one first creates a target\nphonology for the language using an agentic approach that refines its output at\neach step with commentary feedback on its previous attempt. Next, a set of\nsentences is 'translated' from their English original into a morphosyntactic\nmarkup that reflects the word order and morphosyntactic feature specifications\nof the desired target language, with affixes represented as morphosyntactic\nfeature bundles. From this translated corpus, a lexicon is constructed using\nthe phonological model and the set of morphemes (stems and affixes) extracted\nfrom the 'translated' sentences. The system is then instructed to provide an\northography for the language, using an existing script such as Latin or\nCyrillic. Finally, the system writes a brief grammatical handbook of the\nlanguage. The system can also translate further sentences into the target\nlanguage.\n  Our goal is twofold. First, we hope that these tools will be fun to use for\ncreating artificially constructed languages.

Event cameras can asynchronously capture rapid visual changes and are\nrobust to motion blur, but they do not provide color information.

To address these shortcomings, we\npropose ReInAgent, a context-aware multi-agent framework that leverages dynamic\ninformation management to enable human-in-the-loop mobile task navigation.\nReInAgent integrates three specialized agents around a shared memory module: an\ninformation-managing agent for slot-based information management and proactive\ninteraction with the user, a decision-making agent for conflict-aware planning,\nand a reflecting agent for task reflection and information consistency\nvalidation. Through continuous contextual information analysis and sustained\nuser-agent collaboration, ReInAgent overcomes the limitation of existing\napproaches that rely on clear and static task assumptions. Consequently, it\nenables more adaptive and reliable mobile task navigation in complex,\nreal-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ReInAgent\neffectively resolves information dilemmas and produces outcomes that are more\nclosely aligned with genuine user preferences. Notably, on complex tasks\ninvolving information dilemmas, ReInAgent achieves a 25% higher success rate\nthan Mobile-Agent-v2."}

Preprint", "summary": "Models employing long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have shown superior\nperformance on complex reasoning tasks. Yet, this capability introduces a\ncritical and often overlooked inefficiency -- overthinking -- models often\nengage in unnecessarily extensive reasoning even for simple queries, incurring\nsignificant computations without accuracy improvements. While prior work has\nexplored solutions to mitigate overthinking, a fundamental gap remains in our\nunderstanding of its underlying causes. Most existing analyses are limited to\nsuperficial, profiling-based observations, failing to delve into LLMs' inner\nworkings. This study introduces a systematic, fine-grained analyzer of LLMs'\nthought process to bridge the gap, TRACE. We first benchmark the overthinking\nissue, confirming that long-thinking models are five to twenty times slower on\nsimple tasks with no substantial gains. We then use TRACE to first decompose\nthe thought process into minimally complete sub-thoughts. Next, by inferring\ndiscourse relationships among sub-thoughts, we construct granular thought\nprogression graphs and subsequently identify common thinking patterns for\ntopically similar queries. Our analysis reveals two major patterns for\nopen-weight thinking models -- Explorer and Late Landing. This finding provides\nevidence that over-verification and over-exploration are the primary drivers of\noverthinking in LLMs. Grounded in thought structures, we propose a\nutility-based definition of overthinking, which moves beyond length-based\nmetrics. This revised definition offers a more insightful understanding of\nLLMs' thought progression, as well as practical guidelines for principled\noverthinking management."}

To\naddress these challenges, we propose Multimodal Reasoning Edit (MURE), a novel\nframework that shifts the visual editing process from purely text-based\nreasoning to a series of interleaved textual and visual rationales. Our\nframework performs image editing using a natively multimodal, interleaved\ntext-image CoT. This approach generates a step-by-step chain of reasoning where\na textual description is followed by a corresponding visual cue, such as a\npositional mask that defined intended edited regions or a representation of new\ncontent.

This paradigm explores a tree of visual reasoning paths at each step.\nBy pruning low-quality branches using a deep confidence score from a reward\nmodel, it ensures the model consistently follows a high-quality trajectory\ntowards the final edited result.

Strategic information gathering requires models to know not only how to\neffectively acquire information, but also when to stop gathering information\nand make a decision, in order to avoid overthinking or getting derailed when\nacting. In this paper, we formalize this problem and introduce Counterfactuals\nand Reasoning for Termination (CaRT), an approach for teaching LLMs when to\nstop seeking information. To appropriately learn when to terminate, CaRT\nfine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories, one where\ntermination is appropriate and a minimally modified version of the same\ntrajectory where it is not. It trains the LLM to explain the rationale for the\ntermination decision in either case via verbal reasoning, and imbues this\ncapability into the base LLM via fine-tuning.

This forces agents to waste exploration and computational\nresources on irrelevant features, leading to sample-inefficient and unstable\nlearning. To address this, inspired by human visual foveation, we introduce\nGaze on the Prize. This framework augments visual RL with a learnable foveal\nattention mechanism (Gaze), guided by a self-supervised signal derived from the\nagent's experience pursuing higher returns (the Prize). Our key insight is that\nreturn differences reveal what matters most: If two similar representations\nproduce different outcomes, their distinguishing features are likely\ntask-relevant, and the gaze should focus on them accordingly. This is realized\nthrough return-guided contrastive learning that trains the attention to\ndistinguish between the features relevant to success and failure. We group\nsimilar visual representations into positives and negatives based on their\nreturn differences and use the resulting labels to construct contrastive\ntriplets. These triplets provide the training signal that teaches the attention\nmechanism to produce distinguishable representations for states associated with\ndifferent outcomes.

In this paper, we propose the function token\nhypothesis to explain the workings of LLMs: During inference, function tokens\nactivate the most predictive features from context and govern next token\nprediction (memory retrieval). During pre-training, predicting the next tokens\n(usually content tokens) that follow function tokens increases the number of\nlearned features of LLMs and updates the model parameters (memory\nconsolidation). Function tokens here roughly correspond to function words in\nlinguistics, including punctuation marks, articles, prepositions, and\nconjunctions, in contrast to content tokens. We provide extensive experimental\nevidence supporting this hypothesis. Using bipartite graph analysis, we show\nthat a small number of function tokens activate the majority of features.

Inspired by\nconditional discrete graph diffusion models, GTD formulates topology synthesis\nas an iterative construction process. At each step, the generation is steered\nby a lightweight proxy model that predicts multi-objective rewards (e.g.,\naccuracy, utility, cost), enabling real-time, gradient-free optimization\ntowards task-adaptive topologies. This iterative, guided synthesis process\ndistinguishes GTD from single-step generative frameworks, enabling it to better\nnavigate complex design trade-offs. We validated GTD across multiple\nbenchmarks, and experiments show that this framework can generate highly\ntask-adaptive, sparse, and efficient communication topologies, significantly\noutperforming existing methods in LLM agent collaboration."}

This flexible\nformulation naturally unifies many existing controllable video generation\ntasks--including first-frame image-to-video, inpainting, extension, and\ninterpolation--under a single, cohesive paradigm. Realizing this vision,\nhowever, faces a fundamental obstacle in modern latent video diffusion models:\nthe temporal ambiguity introduced by causal VAEs, where multiple pixel frames\nare compressed into a single latent representation, making precise frame-level\nconditioning structurally difficult. We address this challenge with\nVideoCanvas, a novel framework that adapts the In-Context Conditioning (ICC)\nparadigm to this fine-grained control task with zero new parameters. We propose\na hybrid conditioning strategy that decouples spatial and temporal control:\nspatial placement is handled via zero-padding, while temporal alignment is\nachieved through Temporal RoPE Interpolation, which assigns each condition a\ncontinuous fractional position within the latent sequence. This resolves the\nVAE's temporal ambiguity and enables pixel-frame-aware control on a frozen\nbackbone.

Profile-informed stylistic refinement yields 40--48\\%\ngains in BLEU scores and 25--27\\% in ROUGE. Overall, our system demonstrates\nthat combining contextual understanding with author-specific stylistic\nadaptation can generate captions that are both scientifically accurate and\nstylistically faithful to the source paper."}

Comprehensive evaluations across three challenging benchmarks\n(AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and GPQA) and multiple reasoning models demonstrate that\nDeepPrune achieves remarkable token reduction by over 80% compared to\nconventional consensus sampling on most cases, while maintaining competitive\naccuracy within 3 percentage points. Our work establishes a new standard for\nefficient parallel reasoning, making high-performance reasoning more efficient.\nOur code and data are here: https://deepprune.github.io/"}

In this paper, we propose a novel AI-based\napproach for automatic radiology report generation tailored to cranial trauma\ncases. Our model integrates an AC-BiFPN with a Transformer architecture to\ncapture and process complex medical imaging data such as CT and MRI scans. The\nAC-BiFPN extracts multi-scale features, enabling the detection of intricate\nanomalies like intracranial hemorrhages, while the Transformer generates\ncoherent, contextually relevant diagnostic reports by modeling long-range\ndependencies. We evaluate the performance of our model on the RSNA Intracranial\nHemorrhage Detection dataset, where it outperforms traditional CNN-based models\nin both diagnostic accuracy and report generation. This solution not only\nsupports radiologists in high-pressure environments but also provides a\npowerful educational tool for trainee physicians, offering real-time feedback\nand enhancing their learning experience. Our findings demonstrate the potential\nof combining advanced feature extraction with transformer-based text generation\nto improve clinical decision-making in the diagnosis of traumatic brain\ninjuries."}

Project page: https://davidhalladay.github.io/diysink_demo", "summary": "Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have recently emerged as powerful\narchitectures capable of understanding and reasoning over both visual and\ntextual information. These models typically rely on two key components: a\nVision Transformer (ViT) and a Large Language Model (LLM). ViT encodes visual\ncontent into a sequence of image tokens and serves as the perceptual front-end\n-- the eyes of the model. In contrast, the LLM interprets these tokens to\nperform high-level reasoning, generates responses, and functions as the\ncognitive core -- the brain of the model. However, it remains unclear which\nvisual tokens contribute most significantly to understanding and reasoning, and\nhow effectively these signals are propagated from ViT to the LLM. While most\nexisting works have focused on identifying attention sinks, low-semantic tokens\nreceiving disproportionately high attention, within the LLM, we shift the focus\nto the vision encoder by identifying a class of high-norm visual tokens from\nViT, referred to as ViT attention sinks -- a problem that has been rarely\nstudied but is indeed very important for LVLMs. Our findings show that these\nViT sinks encapsulate high-level semantic concepts from images, allowing the\nLLM to perform more effective understanding and reasoning. Despite their\nimportance, these sink tokens are often overlooked in existing LVLM\narchitectures. To explore their contribution, we present both qualitative and\nquantitative analyses of the information embedded in these sink tokens. We also\npropose both training-free and training-based approaches to better leverage how\nthis information is interpreted by the LLM, and to what extent. By explicitly\nutilizing these tokens, we demonstrate substantial improvements across a range\nof LVLMs and visual reasoning tasks, highlighting the untapped potential of ViT\nattention sinks in enhancing visual reasoning."}

Current RL-based methods either rely on dense\nexternal reward signals or extract intrinsic reward signals from LLMs\nthemselves. However, these approaches diverge from the self-evolution\nmechanisms observed in human intelligence, where individuals learn and improve\nthrough mutual discussion and collaboration. In this work, we introduce\nCo-Evolving Multi-Agent Systems (CoMAS), a novel framework that enables agents\nto improve autonomously by learning from inter-agent interactions without\nexternal supervision. CoMAS generates intrinsic rewards from rich discussion\ndynamics, employs an LLM-as-a-judge mechanism to formulate these rewards, and\noptimizes each agent's policy through RL, thereby enabling decentralized and\nscalable co-evolution. Experimental results demonstrate that CoMAS consistently\noutperforms untrained agents and achieves state-of-the-art performance across\nmost evaluation settings. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of\ninteraction-based reward signals and reveal promising scalability as the number\nand diversity of agents increase.

To\naddress this challenge, we present a comprehensive methodology for building\nspatial intelligence progressively.
