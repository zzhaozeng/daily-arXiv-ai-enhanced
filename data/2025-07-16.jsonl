Yet\nas graphs grow more complex, these depictions can become difficult to\nunderstand. Quilts are matrix-based depictions for layered graphs designed to\naddress this problem. In this research, we first improve Quilts by developing\nthree design alternatives, and then compare the best of these alternatives to\nbetter-known node-link and matrix depictions. A primary weakness in Quilts is\ntheir depiction of skip links, links that do not simply connect to a succeeding\nlayer. Therefore in our first study, we compare Quilts using color-only,\ntext-only, and mixed (color and text) skip link depictions, finding that path\nfinding with the color-only depiction is significantly slower and less\naccurate, and that in certain cases, the mixed depiction offers an advantage\nover the text-only depiction. In our second study, we compare Quilts using the\nmixed depiction to node-link diagrams and centered matrices. Overall results\nshow that users can find paths through graphs significantly faster with Quilts\n(46.6 secs) than with node-link (58.3 secs) or matrix (71.2 secs) diagrams.\nThis speed advantage is still greater in large graphs (e.g. in 200 node graphs,\n55.4 secs vs. 71.1 secs for node-link and 84.2 secs for matrix depictions)."}

While considerable progress\nhas been made in computing constant-radius offset surfaces, computing\nvariable-radius offset surfaces remains a challenging problem. In this paper,\nwe present OffsetCrust, a novel framework that efficiently addresses the\nvariable-radius offsetting problem by computing a power diagram. Let $R$ denote\nthe radius function defined on the base surface $S$. The power diagram is\nconstructed from contributing sites, consisting of carefully sampled base\npoints on $S$ and their corresponding off-surface points, displaced along\n$R$-dependent directions. In the constant-radius case only, these displacement\ndirections align exactly with the surface normals of $S$.

However, their ability to effectively utilize tools via API\ncalls remains underexplored in knowledge-intensive domains like meteorology.\nThis paper introduces KG2data, a system that integrates knowledge graphs, LLMs,\nReAct agents, and tool-use technologies to enable intelligent data acquisition\nand query handling in the meteorological field. Using a virtual API, we\nevaluate API call accuracy across three metrics: name recognition failure,\nhallucination failure, and call correctness. KG2data achieves superior\nperformance (1.43%, 0%, 88.57%) compared to RAG2data (16%, 10%, 72.14%) and\nchat2data (7.14%, 8.57%, 71.43%). KG2data differs from typical LLM-based\nsystems by addressing their limited access to domain-specific knowledge, which\nhampers performance on complex or terminology-rich queries. By using a\nknowledge graph as persistent memory, our system enhances content retrieval,\ncomplex query handling, domain-specific reasoning, semantic relationship\nresolution, and heterogeneous data integration. It also mitigates the high cost\nof fine-tuning LLMs, making the system more adaptable to evolving domain\nknowledge and API structures. In summary, KG2data provides a novel solution for\nintelligent, knowledge-based question answering and data analysis in domains\nwith high knowledge demands."}

At predefined timepoints called \"decision points,\"\nintelligent mHealth systems such as just-in-time adaptive interventions\n(JITAIs) estimate an individual's biobehavioral context from sensor or survey\ndata and determine whether and how to intervene. For interventions targeting\nhabitual behavior (e.g., oral hygiene), effectiveness often hinges on\ndelivering support shortly before the target behavior is likely to occur.\nCurrent practice schedules decision points at a fixed interval (e.g., one hour)\nbefore user-provided behavior times, and the fixed interval is kept the same\nfor all individuals. However, this one-size-fits-all approach performs poorly\nfor individuals with irregular routines, often scheduling decision points after\nthe target behavior has already occurred, rendering interventions ineffective.\nIn this paper, we propose SigmaScheduling, a method to dynamically schedule\ndecision points based on uncertainty in predicted behavior times. When behavior\ntiming is more predictable, SigmaScheduling schedules decision points closer to\nthe predicted behavior time; when timing is less certain, SigmaScheduling\nschedules decision points earlier, increasing the likelihood of timely\nintervention. We evaluated SigmaScheduling using real-world data from 68\nparticipants in a 10-week trial of Oralytics, a JITAI designed to improve daily\ntoothbrushing.

This delay is\ncrucial because it represents the time required to perform a computation: in an\nArithmetic-Logic Unit it represents the maximum time taken by the circuit to\nperform an arithmetic operation. When such a circuit is part of a larger,\nsynchronous system, like a CPU, the maximum delay directly impacts the maximum\nclock frequency of the entire system. Typically, hardware designers use Static\nTiming Analysis to compute an upper bound of the maximum delay because it can\nbe determined in polynomial time. However, relying on this upper bound can lead\nto suboptimal processor speeds, thereby missing performance opportunities. In\nthis work, we tackle the challenging task of computing the actual maximum\ndelay, rather than an approximate value.

By introducing two key designs: contrasting with cluster centroids\nand a multi-layer contrastive training (MCT) paradigm, this paper proposes a\nnovel clustering-guided self-supervised multi-layer contrastive representation\nlearning (CMCRL) algorithm. The proposed method demonstrates several advantages\nover existing counterparts: (1) optimizing with massive unannotated samples;\n(2) effective adaptation to the symptom similarity across distinct citrus\ndiseases; (3) hierarchical feature representation learning. The proposed method\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on the public citrus image set CDD,\noutperforming existing methods by 4.5\\%-30.1\\% accuracy. Remarkably, our method\nnarrows the performance gap with fully supervised counterparts (all samples are\nlabeled). Beyond classification accuracy, our method shows great performance on\nother evaluation metrics (F1 score, precision, and recall), highlighting the\nrobustness against the class imbalance challenge."}

To\ntackle these challenges, we propose ViewSRD, a framework that formulates 3D\nvisual grounding as a structured multi-view decomposition process. First, the\nSimple Relation Decoupling (SRD) module restructures complex multi-anchor\nqueries into a set of targeted single-anchor statements, generating a\nstructured set of perspective-aware descriptions that clarify positional\nrelationships. These decomposed representations serve as the foundation for the\nMulti-view Textual-Scene Interaction (Multi-TSI) module, which integrates\ntextual and scene features across multiple viewpoints using shared, Cross-modal\nConsistent View Tokens (CCVTs) to preserve spatial correlations. Finally, a\nTextual-Scene Reasoning module synthesizes multi-view predictions into a\nunified and robust 3D visual grounding. Experiments on 3D visual grounding\ndatasets show that ViewSRD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods,\nparticularly in complex queries requiring precise spatial differentiation."}
