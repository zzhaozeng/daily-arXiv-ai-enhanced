### [1] [FiNERweb: Datasets and Artifacts for Scalable Multilingual Named Entity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13884)
*Jonas Golde,Patrick Haller,Alan Akbik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FiNERweb是一个多语言命名实体识别数据集创建流程，扩展了教师-学生模式至91种语言和25种文字。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大规模语言模型（LLMs）在多语言命名实体识别（NER）中表现出色，但这些数据集通常是广泛实验的副产品，而非系统性、可重用的资源。

Method: 基于FineWeb-Edu，训练回归模型识别NER相关段落，并使用多语言LLMs进行标注。

Result: 生成了约225k个段落，带有235k个不同的实体标签；在英语、泰语和斯瓦希里语的零样本迁移设置中，性能相当或更优；标注质量在忠实度和完整性上均表现良好。

Conclusion: FiNERweb提供了高质量、多语言的NER数据集，有助于更有效的学生-教师多语言命名实体识别训练。

Abstract: Recent multilingual named entity recognition (NER) work has shown that large language models (LLMs) can provide effective synthetic supervision, yet such datasets have mostly appeared as by-products of broader experiments rather than as systematic, reusable resources. We introduce FiNERweb, a dataset-creation pipeline that scales the teacher-student paradigm to 91 languages and 25 scripts. Building on FineWeb-Edu, our approach trains regression models to identify NER-relevant passages and annotates them with multilingual LLMs, resulting in about 225k passages with 235k distinct entity labels. Our experiments show that the regression model achieves more than 84 F1, and that models trained on FiNERweb obtain comparable or improved performance in zero shot transfer settings on English, Thai, and Swahili, despite being trained on 19x less data than strong baselines. In addition, we assess annotation quality using LLM-as-a-judge and observe consistently high scores for both faithfulness (3.99 out of 5) and completeness (4.05 out of 5), indicating reliable and informative annotations. Further, we release the dataset with both English labels and translated label sets in the respective target languages because we observe that the performance of current state-of-the-art models drops by 0.02 to 0.09 F1 when evaluated using target language labels instead of English ones. We release FiNERweb together with all accompanying artifacts to the research community in order to facilitate more effective student-teacher training for multilingual named entity recognition.

### [3] [Structure-Aware Decoding Mechanisms for Complex Entity Extraction with Large-Scale Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13980)
*Zhimin Qiu,Di Wu,Feng Liu,Chenrui Hu,Yuxiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种基于大语言模型的结构感知解码方法，解决嵌套和重叠实体提取中的语义和结构一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在嵌套和重叠实体提取任务中难以兼顾语义完整性和结构一致性，需要新的方法提升复杂场景下的识别能力。

Method: 引入候选跨度生成机制和结构化注意力建模，统一建模实体边界、层级关系和交叉依赖；使用预训练语言模型获取语义表示，结合多粒度跨度特征和层级结构约束进行解码，并通过联合优化分类损失和结构一致性损失增强稳定性。

Result: 在ACE 2005数据集上，准确率、精确率、召回率和F1分数显著提升，尤其在嵌套和重叠实体识别中表现出更强的边界定位和结构建模能力。

Conclusion: 结构感知解码方法在复杂语义提取任务中有效，为具有层级理解能力的语言模型开发提供了新视角，为高精度信息提取奠定了方法论基础。

Abstract: This paper proposes a structure-aware decoding method based on large language models to address the difficulty of traditional approaches in maintaining both semantic integrity and structural consistency in nested and overlapping entity extraction tasks. The method introduces a candidate span generation mechanism and structured attention modeling to achieve unified modeling of entity boundaries, hierarchical relationships, and cross-dependencies. The model first uses a pretrained language model to obtain context-aware semantic representations, then captures multi-granular entity span features through candidate representation combinations, and introduces hierarchical structural constraints during decoding to ensure consistency between semantics and structure. To enhance stability in complex scenarios, the model jointly optimizes classification loss and structural consistency loss, maintaining high recognition accuracy under multi-entity co-occurrence and long-sentence dependency conditions. Experiments conducted on the ACE 2005 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, particularly in nested and overlapping entity recognition, where the model shows stronger boundary localization and structural modeling capability. This study verifies the effectiveness of structure-aware decoding in complex semantic extraction tasks, provides a new perspective for developing language models with hierarchical understanding, and establishes a methodological foundation for high-precision information extraction.

### [4] [What Affects the Effective Depth of Large Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14064)
*Yi Hu,Cai Zhou,Muhan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型的性能增益随着层数增加而减小，现有模型未能充分利用其所有层。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究有效深度如何随模型规模、训练类型和任务难度的变化，以提高层利用率和模型性能。

Method: 分析Qwen-2.5家族模型，比较基础和长CoT模型，评估不同难度任务下的模型行为。

Result: 有效层数随模型大小增长，但有效深度比率保持稳定；基础模型和长CoT模型在有效深度上没有增加；模型未对更难任务动态使用更多层。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在不同规模、训练范式和任务难度下均未能充分利用可用深度，提高层利用率为未来研究方向。

Abstract: The scaling of large language models (LLMs) emphasizes increasing depth, yet performance gains diminish with added layers. Prior work introduces the concept of "effective depth", arguing that deeper models fail to fully utilize their layers for meaningful computation. Building on this, we systematically study how effective depth varies with model scale, training type, and task difficulty. First, we analyze the model behavior of Qwen-2.5 family (1.5B-32B) and find that while the number of effective layers grows with model size, the effective depth ratio remains stable. Besides, comparisons between base and corresponding long-CoT models show no increase in effective depth, suggesting that improved reasoning stems from longer context rather than deeper per-token computation. Furthermore, evaluations across tasks of varying difficulty indicate that models do not dynamically use more layers for harder problems. Our results suggest that current LLMs underuse available depth across scales, training paradigms and tasks of varying difficulties, pointing out research opportunities on increasing the layer utilization rate of LLMs, model pruning, and early exiting. Our code is released at https://github.com/AheadOFpotato/what_affects_effective_depth.

### [5] [Efficient-DLM: From Autoregressive to Diffusion Language Models, and Beyond in Speed](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14067)
*Yonggan Fu,Lexington Whalen,Zhifan Ye,Xin Dong,Shizhe Diao,Jingyu Liu,Chengyue Wu,Hao Zhang,Enze Xie,Song Han,Maksim Khadkevich,Jan Kautz,Yingyan Celine Lin,Pavlo Molchanov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了AR-to-dLM转换，以将预训练的AR模型转换为高效dLM，提升生成速度并保持任务准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型（dLMs）虽然支持并行、非自回归生成，但其学习效率低于自回归（AR）语言模型。因此，研究如何通过AR-to-dLM转换来提升dLMs的效率。

Method: 1. 提出连续预训练方案与块级注意力模式，以保持预训练AR模型权重分布；2. 提出位置依赖的token masking策略，缩小训练和测试之间的差距。

Result: Efficient-DLM家族超越现有AR模型和dLMs，例如Efficient-DLM 8B在Dream 7B和Qwen3 4B上分别实现+5.4%/+2.7%的准确率提升和4.5x/2.7x的吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: 通过改进注意力模式和训练策略，成功实现高效AR-to-dLM转换，为大规模应用提供了可行的方法。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (dLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm that enables parallel, non-autoregressive generation, but their learning efficiency lags behind that of autoregressive (AR) language models when trained from scratch. To this end, we study AR-to-dLM conversion to transform pretrained AR models into efficient dLMs that excel in speed while preserving AR models' task accuracy. We achieve this by identifying limitations in the attention patterns and objectives of existing AR-to-dLM methods and then proposing principles and methodologies for more effective AR-to-dLM conversion. Specifically, we first systematically compare different attention patterns and find that maintaining pretrained AR weight distributions is critical for effective AR-to-dLM conversion. As such, we introduce a continuous pretraining scheme with a block-wise attention pattern, which remains causal across blocks while enabling bidirectional modeling within each block. We find that this approach can better preserve pretrained AR models' weight distributions than fully bidirectional modeling, in addition to its known benefit of enabling KV caching, and leads to a win-win in accuracy and efficiency. Second, to mitigate the training-test gap in mask token distributions (uniform vs. highly left-to-right), we propose a position-dependent token masking strategy that assigns higher masking probabilities to later tokens during training to better mimic test-time behavior. Leveraging this framework, we conduct extensive studies of dLMs' attention patterns, training dynamics, and other design choices, providing actionable insights into scalable AR-to-dLM conversion. These studies lead to the Efficient-DLM family, which outperforms state-of-the-art AR models and dLMs, e.g., our Efficient-DLM 8B achieves +5.4%/+2.7% higher accuracy with 4.5x/2.7x higher throughput compared to Dream 7B and Qwen3 4B, respectively.

### [6] [A Unified Sparse Attention via Multi-Granularity Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14082)
*Siran Liu,Zane Cao,Yongchao He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出UniSparse，通过复合令牌和动态稀疏注意力机制，实现高效长上下文处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文理解对LLM应用重要，但自注意力机制存在计算瓶颈，现有稀疏注意力方法各有局限。

Method: 引入复合令牌概念，基于此动态构建稀疏注意力，实现多粒度压缩和块级选择。

Result: 在多种任务和模态上，UniSparse在准确率和效率上优于现有稀疏注意力方法。

Conclusion: UniSparse是一个统一的高效稀疏注意力机制，适用于多种场景，性能优越。

Abstract: Efficient long-context understanding and reasoning are increasingly vital for large language model (LLM) applications such as multi-turn dialogue and program analysis. However, the core self-attention mechanism scales quadratically with sequence length, creating a fundamental computational bottleneck. Existing sparse attention methods alleviate this issue but face trade-offs: training-based methods are costly and cannot be directly applied as acceleration plugins for other models, while inference-time methods often compromise efficiency or cross-modal generality. To address these limitations, we present UniSparse, a unified mechanism that introduces the notion of composite tokens--compact representations that aggregate multi-granularity contextual information. Building on this abstraction, UniSparse dynamically constructs sparse attention through multi-granularity compression and block-level selection, enabling efficient and hardware-friendly execution on GPU. Across multiple modalities and tasks ranging from synthetic benchmarks to real-world applications, UniSparse consistently surpasses state-of-the-art sparse attention methods (e.g., MInference, XAttention, FlexPrefill) in both accuracy and efficiency, achieving $\ge$ 99% of full-attention accuracy and up to 2.61$\times$ faster attention computation than FlashAttention.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个多语言的连续反馈预测模型，适用于日语、英语和中文，并探讨了跨语言的时间行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过多语言模型揭示不同语言中反馈时机的差异，进而改进口语对话系统的自然性和文化适应性。

Method: 采用基于Transformer的模型，在约300小时的双人对话数据上进行联合训练，并包含辅助任务。

Result: 多语言模型在所有三种语言中均匹配或超越了单语言基线，零样本迁移有限，揭示了跨语言的实质性差异。

Conclusion: 不同语言对反馈时机的依赖不同，多语言训练促进了共享但可适应的表征，为更自然、文化感知的对话系统设计提供了实证依据。

Abstract: We present a multilingual, continuous backchannel prediction model for Japanese, English, and Chinese, and use it to investigate cross-linguistic timing behavior. The model is Transformer-based and operates at the frame level, jointly trained with auxiliary tasks on approximately 300 hours of dyadic conversations. Across all three languages, the multilingual model matches or surpasses monolingual baselines, indicating that it learns both language-universal cues and language-specific timing patterns. Zero-shot transfer with two-language training remains limited, underscoring substantive cross-lingual differences. Perturbation analyses reveal distinct cue usage: Japanese relies more on short-term linguistic information, whereas English and Chinese are more sensitive to silence duration and prosodic variation; multilingual training encourages shared yet adaptable representations and reduces overreliance on pitch in Chinese. A context-length study further shows that Japanese is relatively robust to shorter contexts, while Chinese benefits markedly from longer contexts. Finally, we integrate the trained model into a real-time processing software, demonstrating CPU-only inference. Together, these findings provide a unified model and empirical evidence for how backchannel timing differs across languages, informing the design of more natural, culturally-aware spoken dialogue systems.

### [8] [CogMem: A Cognitive Memory Architecture for Sustained Multi-Turn Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14118)
*Yiran Zhang,Jincheng Hu,Mark Dras,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CogMem是一种新型记忆增强型大语言模型架构，通过分层记忆系统改善多轮对话中的推理连贯性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在单轮推理中表现出色，但在多轮交互中常出现准确性下降和连贯性丧失的问题，如推理偏差、任务漂移、幻觉、过度自信和记忆衰退等。

Method: CogMem采用三层记忆结构：长期记忆（LTM）用于整合跨会话推理策略；直接访问（DA）记忆用于维护会话级笔记并检索相关长期记忆；注意焦点（FoA）机制用于动态重建每轮任务相关上下文。

Result: 在TurnBench上的实验表明，CogMem的分层设计减轻了推理失败，控制了上下文增长，并提高了扩展推理链的一致性。

Conclusion: CogMem通过结构化、持久性记忆支持持续迭代推理，使大语言模型在多轮交互中更接近可靠、类人的推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at single-turn reasoning but often lose accuracy and coherence over extended, multi-turn interactions. Recent evaluations such as TurnBench highlight recurring failure modes-reasoning bias, task drift, hallucination, overconfidence, and memory decay. Current approaches typically append full conversational histories, causing unbounded context growth, higher computational costs, and degraded reasoning efficiency. We introduce CogMem, a cognitively inspired, memory-augmented LLM architecture that supports sustained iterative reasoning through structured, persistent memory. CogMem incorporates three layers: a Long-Term Memory (LTM) that consolidates cross-session reasoning strategies; a Direct Access (DA) memory that maintains session-level notes and retrieves relevant long-term memories; and a Focus of Attention (FoA) mechanism that dynamically reconstructs concise, task-relevant context at each turn. Experiments on TurnBench show that this layered design mitigates reasoning failures, controls context growth, and improves consistency across extended reasoning chains, moving toward more reliable, human-like reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Translating from a standard language to its regional dialects is a significant NLP challenge due to scarce data and linguistic variation, a problem prominent in the Bengali language. This paper proposes and compares two novel RAG pipelines for standard-to-dialectal Bengali translation. The first, a Transcript-Based Pipeline, uses large dialect sentence contexts from audio transcripts. The second, a more effective Standardized Sentence-Pairs Pipeline, utilizes structured local\_dialect:standard\_bengali sentence pairs. We evaluated both pipelines across six Bengali dialects and multiple LLMs using BLEU, ChrF, WER, and BERTScore. Our findings show that the sentence-pair pipeline consistently outperforms the transcript-based one, reducing Word Error Rate (WER) from 76\% to 55\% for the Chittagong dialect. Critically, this RAG approach enables smaller models (e.g., Llama-3.1-8B) to outperform much larger models (e.g., GPT-OSS-120B), demonstrating that a well-designed retrieval strategy can be more crucial than model size. This work contributes an effective, fine-tuning-free solution for low-resource dialect translation, offering a practical blueprint for preserving linguistic diversity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了两种用于Nawatl语料库扩展的上下文无关文法（CFG）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nawatl是一种美洲印第安语言，数字资源稀缺，导致大型语言模型（LLM）学习所需的语料库几乎不存在，这是一个重大挑战。

Method: 引入了两种新的Nawatl CFG，并使用生成模式扩展语料库，然后使用扩展后的语料库学习嵌入并评估其在句子语义相似度任务中的相关性。

Result: 结果表明，与仅使用原始语料库相比，使用人工扩展的语料库结果更好，并且经济嵌入在某些情况下比一些大型语言模型表现更佳。

Conclusion: 通过引入和使用新的CFG，可以显著扩展Nawatl语料库，并有效提升嵌入学习的效果。

Abstract: The aim of this article is to introduce two Context-Free Grammars (CFG) for Nawatl Corpora expansion. Nawatl is an Amerindian language (it is a National Language of Mexico) of the $π$-language type, i.e. a language with few digital resources. For this reason the corpora available for the learning of Large Language Models (LLMs) are virtually non-existent, posing a significant challenge. The goal is to produce a substantial number of syntactically valid artificial Nawatl sentences and thereby to expand the corpora for the purpose of learning non contextual embeddings. For this objective, we introduce two new Nawatl CFGs and use them in generative mode. Using these grammars, it is possible to expand Nawatl corpus significantly and subsequently to use it to learn embeddings and to evaluate their relevance in a sentences semantic similarity task. The results show an improvement compared to the results obtained using only the original corpus without artificial expansion, and also demonstrate that economic embeddings often perform better than some LLMs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Managing extensive context remains a critical bottleneck for Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in applications like long-document question answering and autonomous agents where lengthy inputs incur high computational costs and introduce noise. Existing compression techniques often disrupt local coherence through discrete token removal or rely on implicit latent encoding that suffers from positional bias and incompatibility with closed-source APIs. To address these limitations, we introduce the EDU-based Context Compressor, a novel explicit compression framework designed to preserve both global structure and fine-grained details. Our approach reformulates context compression as a structure-then-select process. First, our LingoEDU transforms linear text into a structural relation tree of Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs) which are anchored strictly to source indices to eliminate hallucination. Second, a lightweight ranking module selects query-relevant sub-trees for linearization. To rigorously evaluate structural understanding, we release StructBench, a manually annotated dataset of 248 diverse documents. Empirical results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art structural prediction accuracy and significantly outperforms frontier LLMs while reducing costs. Furthermore, our structure-aware compression substantially enhances performance across downstream tasks ranging from long-context tasks to complex Deep Search scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文研究GPT-3.5-turbo等大型语言模型（LLMs）基于宏观经济价格信号形成通货膨胀感知和预期的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型是否能够模仿人类对通货膨胀的感知和预期，并与实际的家庭调查数据和官方统计进行比较。

Method: 通过拟实验设计，利用GPT的训练截止时间和英格兰银行的通货膨胀态度调查（IAS）的信息集和人群特征，比较GPT输出与家庭调查数据和官方统计。

Result: GPT在短期内跟踪了总体调查预测和官方统计数据，并在细分层面上复制了家庭通货膨胀感知的关键实证规律，但对食品通胀信息表现出更高的敏感性，且缺乏一致的消费者价格通胀模型。

Conclusion: 该方法可用于评估LLMs在社会科学中的应用，比较不同模型，或协助调查设计。

Abstract: This paper investigates the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-3.5-turbo (GPT), to form inflation perceptions and expectations based on macroeconomic price signals. We compare the LLM's output to household survey data and official statistics, mimicking the information set and demographic characteristics of the Bank of England's Inflation Attitudes Survey (IAS). Our quasi-experimental design exploits the timing of GPT's training cut-off in September 2021 which means it has no knowledge of the subsequent UK inflation surge. We find that GPT tracks aggregate survey projections and official statistics at short horizons. At a disaggregated level, GPT replicates key empirical regularities of households' inflation perceptions, particularly for income, housing tenure, and social class. A novel Shapley value decomposition of LLM outputs suited for the synthetic survey setting provides well-defined insights into the drivers of model outputs linked to prompt content. We find that GPT demonstrates a heightened sensitivity to food inflation information similar to that of human respondents. However, we also find that it lacks a consistent model of consumer price inflation. More generally, our approach could be used to evaluate the behaviour of LLMs for use in the social sciences, to compare different models, or to assist in survey design.

Abstract: The standard practice for training large language models involves packing multiple documents together to optimize computational efficiency. However, the impact of this process on the models' capabilities remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we investigate how different document-packing strategies influence the latent multi-hop reasoning abilities of LLMs. Our findings indicate that packing can improve model performance compared to training on individual documents, at the expense of more compute. To further understand the underlying mechanisms, we conduct an ablation study, identifying key factors that explain the advantages of packing. Ultimately, our research deepens the understanding of LLM training dynamics and provides practical insights for optimizing model development.

*Shizhuo Mao,Song Chen,Yi Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出SASQ，一种轻量级量化感知训练框架，专门优化激活量化因子，实现高精度静态推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型因规模增长超过GPU内存进步而面临部署挑战，传统量化方法在计算开销和精度间存在权衡。

Method: SASQ仅优化量化因子而不改变预训练权重，自适应截断部分异常值以降低量化难度。

Result: 在LLaMA2-7B上，SASQ比QuaRot困惑度低5.2%，比FP16模型在WikiText2上低4.7%。

Conclusion: SASQ超越了现有最先进的量化方案，并在性能上优于对应的FP16模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language tasks but face deployment challenges due to their growing size outpacing GPU memory advancements. Model quantization mitigates this issue by lowering weight and activation precision, but existing solutions face fundamental trade-offs: dynamic quantization incurs high computational overhead and poses deployment challenges on edge devices, while static quantization sacrifices accuracy. Existing approaches of quantization-aware training (QAT) further suffer from weight training costs. We propose SASQ: a lightweight QAT framework specifically tailored for activation quantization factors. SASQ exclusively optimizes only the quantization factors (without changing pre-trained weights), enabling static inference with high accuracy while maintaining deployment efficiency. SASQ adaptively truncates some outliers, thereby reducing the difficulty of quantization while preserving the distributional characteristics of the activations. SASQ not only surpasses existing SOTA quantization schemes but also outperforms the corresponding FP16 models. On LLaMA2-7B, it achieves 5.2% lower perplexity than QuaRot and 4.7% lower perplexity than the FP16 model on WikiText2.

Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLM)擅长高级编程语言任务，但在汇编语言等低级语言任务中表现不佳。

Method: 提出名为C-ing Clearly的合成数据生成方法，通过微调生成的数据提升LLM对汇编的理解。

Result: 在不同LLM家族和模型规模中，二进制代码摘要和漏洞检测性能均得到一致提升。

Conclusion: C-ing Clearly方法有效提升了LLM在低级编程语言任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) typically excel at coding tasks involving high-level programming languages, as opposed to lower-level programming languages, such as assembly. We propose a synthetic data generation method named C-ing Clearly, which leverages the corresponding C code to enhance an LLM's understanding of assembly. By fine-tuning on data generated through our method, we demonstrate improved LLM performance for binary code summarization and vulnerability detection. Our approach demonstrates consistent gains across different LLM families and model sizes.

Abstract: Futrell and Mahowald present a useful framework bridging technology-oriented deep learning systems and explanation-oriented linguistic theories. Unfortunately, the target article's focus on generative text-based LLMs fundamentally limits fruitful interactions with linguistics, as many interesting questions on human language fall outside what is captured by written text. We argue that audio-based deep learning models can and should play a crucial role.

Method: 通过训练和评估50个语言模型，研究在不同数据重复程度下双目标训练的最优比例。

Result: 在所有评估设置下，双目标训练均表现最佳，并且最优比例在自回归或掩码扩散下游性能目标下相似。

Conclusion: 双目标训练可以结合自回归和掩码扩散模型的优点，实现更优的语言模型性能。

Abstract: This paper combines autoregressive and masked-diffusion training objectives without any architectural modifications, resulting in flexible language models that outperform single-objective models. Autoregressive modeling has been a popular approach, partly because of its training efficiency; however, that comes at the cost of sensitivity to overfitting. On the other hand, masked-diffusion models are less efficient to train while being more resilient to overfitting. In this work, we demonstrate that dual-objective training achieves the best of both worlds. To derive the optimal ratio between both objectives, we train and evaluate 50 language models under varying levels of data repetition. We show that it is optimal to combine both objectives under all evaluated settings and that the optimal ratio is similar whether targeting autoregressive or masked-diffusion downstream performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 越南法律的复杂性、层次结构和频繁修订对大型语言模型的应用提出挑战，需要系统评估模型的法律知识理解能力。

Method: 基于Bloom认知分类法，设计了涵盖多层次法律理解任务的VLegal-Bench，包含10,450个样本，通过法律专家标注和交叉验证，确保样本基于权威法律文件并反映实际法律助理工作流程。

Result: VLegal-Bench为评估越南法律语境下的LLM表现提供了标准化、透明且认知信息丰富的评估框架。

Conclusion: VLegal-Bench为越南法律领域AI辅助系统的开发奠定了坚实基础，支持更可靠、可解释和伦理一致的AI法律系统开发。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled new possibilities for applying artificial intelligence within the legal domain. Nonetheless, the complexity, hierarchical organization, and frequent revisions of Vietnamese legislation pose considerable challenges for evaluating how well these models interpret and utilize legal knowledge. To address this gap, Vietnamese Legal Benchmark (VLegal-Bench) is introduced, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically assess LLMs on Vietnamese legal tasks. Informed by Bloom's cognitive taxonomy, VLegal-Bench encompasses multiple levels of legal understanding through tasks designed to reflect practical usage scenarios. The benchmark comprises 10,450 samples generated through a rigorous annotation pipeline, where legal experts label and cross-validate each instance using our annotation system to ensure every sample is grounded in authoritative legal documents and mirrors real-world legal assistant workflows, including general legal questions and answers, retrieval-augmented generation, multi-step reasoning, and scenario-based problem solving tailored to Vietnamese law. By providing a standardized, transparent, and cognitively informed evaluation framework, VLegal-Bench establishes a solid foundation for assessing LLM performance in Vietnamese legal contexts and supports the development of more reliable, interpretable, and ethically aligned AI-assisted legal systems.

Motivation: 为了有效生成具有人物角色一致性的调查数据，尤其是在资源有限的情况下实现高效和可控的数据生成。

Method: 该框架采用LoRA适配器和4位量化技术对紧凑聊天模型进行指令调优，并引入对话式数据管道以保留人物角色线索。

Result: 实验表明，TinyLlama 1.1B和Phi-2等小模型的性能与7B到8B的大模型相当，最高BLEU分数为0.090，ROUGE-1为0.429。

Conclusion: 通过角色条件微调，小语言模型能够生成可靠且连贯的合成调查数据，该框架为调查数据生成提供了高效且可复现的方法。

Abstract: This paper introduces PolyPersona, a generative framework for synthesizing persona-conditioned survey responses across multiple domains. The framework instruction-tunes compact chat models using parameter-efficient LoRA adapters with 4-bit quantization under a resource-adaptive training setup. A dialogue-based data pipeline explicitly preserves persona cues, ensuring consistent behavioral alignment across generated responses. Using this pipeline, we construct a dataset of 3,568 synthetic survey responses spanning ten domains and 433 distinct personas, enabling controlled instruction tuning and systematic multi-domain evaluation. We evaluate the generated responses using a multi-metric evaluation suite that combines standard text generation metrics, including BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore, with survey-specific metrics designed to assess structural coherence, stylistic consistency, and sentiment alignment.Experimental results show that compact models such as TinyLlama 1.1B and Phi-2 achieve performance comparable to larger 7B to 8B baselines, with a highest BLEU score of 0.090 and ROUGE-1 of 0.429. These findings demonstrate that persona-conditioned fine-tuning enables small language models to generate reliable and coherent synthetic survey data. The proposed framework provides an efficient and reproducible approach for survey data generation, supporting scalable evaluation while facilitating bias analysis through transparent and open protocols.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: JMMMU-Pro旨在通过将问题图像和文本合成为一个图像来扩展JMMMU，以创建一个需要通过视觉感知进行综合视觉-文本理解的基准。

Method: 提出Vibe Benchmark Construction方法，利用图像生成模型（如Nano Banana Pro）生成候选视觉问题，并由人工验证输出，必要时通过调整提示重新生成，以确保质量。

Result: 实验结果显示，所有开源LMM在JMMMU-Pro上均表现不佳，突出了JMMMU-Pro作为指导未来开源社区工作的重要基准。

Conclusion: JMMMU-Pro为评估LMM的日语能力提供了更严格的工具，Vibe Benchmark Construction也为未来基于图像的VQA基准开发提供了高效指导。

Abstract: This paper introduces JMMMU-Pro, an image-based Japanese Multi-discipline Multimodal Understanding Benchmark, and Vibe Benchmark Construction, a scalable construction method. Following the evolution from MMMU to MMMU-Pro, JMMMU-Pro extends JMMMU by composing the question image and question text into a single image, thereby creating a benchmark that requires integrated visual-textual understanding through visual perception. To build JMMMU-Pro, we propose Vibe Benchmark Construction, a methodology in which an image generative model (e.g., Nano Banana Pro) produces candidate visual questions, and humans verify the outputs and, when necessary, regenerate with adjusted prompts to ensure quality. By leveraging Nano Banana Pro's highly realistic image generation capabilities and its ability to embed clean Japanese text, we construct a high-quality benchmark at low cost, covering a wide range of background and layout designs. Experimental results show that all open-source LMMs struggle substantially with JMMMU-Pro, underscoring JMMMU-Pro as an important benchmark for guiding future efforts in the open-source community. We believe that JMMMU-Pro provides a more rigorous evaluation tool for assessing the Japanese capabilities of LMMs and that our Vibe Benchmark Construction also offers an efficient guideline for future development of image-based VQA benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型通用语言模型在处理大量数据和实时响应方面速度不够快，且能耗高，不适合效率关键的应用。因此，需要训练更小、更高效的模型。

Method: 使用现代训练技术，如蒸馏，训练小型模型，并支持低资源语言。展示了从多语言教师模型蒸馏出单语模型，以及从相对位置嵌入教师模型蒸馏出绝对位置嵌入模型。

Result: 在常见的NLP任务中，TiME模型在性能、吞吐量、延迟和能耗之间取得了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: TiME模型为需要高效率的应用提供了一个可行的解决方案，并展示了现代训练技术如蒸馏在小型模型训练中的有效性。

Abstract: Today, a lot of research on language models is focused on large, general-purpose models. However, many NLP pipelines only require models with a well-defined, small set of capabilities. While large models are capable of performing the tasks of those smaller models, they are simply not fast enough to process large amounts of data or offer real-time responses. Furthermore, they often use unnecessarily large amounts of energy, leading to sustainability concerns and problems when deploying them on battery-powered devices. In our work, we show how to train small models for such efficiency-critical applications. As opposed to many off-the-shelf NLP pipelines, our models use modern training techniques such as distillation, and offer support for low-resource languages. We call our models TiME (Tiny Monolingual Encoders) and comprehensively evaluate them on a range of common NLP tasks, observing an improved trade-off between benchmark performance on one hand, and throughput, latency and energy consumption on the other. Along the way, we show that distilling monolingual models from multilingual teachers is possible, and likewise distilling models with absolute positional embeddings from teachers with relative positional embeddings.

TL;DR: Jacobi Forcing是一种渐进式蒸馏范式，通过在自己的并行解码轨迹上训练模型，将自回归模型平稳转变为高效并行解码器，同时保留其预训练的因果推理特性，实现了显著的推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多token生成是加速基于Transformer的大模型推理的有前途的范式，当前的方法在自回归（AR）模型和多token生成之间存在预训练与后训练不匹配的问题，限制了加速效果。

Method: 引入了Jacobi Forcing，一种渐进式蒸馏范式，模型在自己的并行解码轨迹上训练，平滑地将AR模型转变为高效并行解码器，同时保留因果推理特性。还提出了多块解码与拒绝回收技术，进一步提升解码效率。

Result: Jacobi Forcing模型在编码和数学基准测试中实现了3.8倍的时钟加速，性能损失极小；结合多块解码与拒绝回收技术，实现了高达4.5倍的每轮迭代token接受数和近4.0倍的时钟加速。

Conclusion: Jacobi Forcing范式成功解决了AR模型向并行解码转换中的预训练与后训练不匹配问题，显著提升了模型推理速度，为高效推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multi-token generation has emerged as a promising paradigm for accelerating transformer-based large model inference. Recent efforts primarily explore diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) for parallel decoding to reduce inference latency. To achieve AR-level generation quality, many techniques adapt AR models into dLLMs to enable parallel decoding. However, they suffer from limited speedup compared to AR models due to a pretrain-to-posttrain mismatch. Specifically, the masked data distribution in post-training deviates significantly from the real-world data distribution seen during pretraining, and dLLMs rely on bidirectional attention, which conflicts with the causal prior learned during pretraining and hinders the integration of exact KV cache reuse. To address this, we introduce Jacobi Forcing, a progressive distillation paradigm where models are trained on their own generated parallel decoding trajectories, smoothly shifting AR models into efficient parallel decoders while preserving their pretrained causal inference property. The models trained under this paradigm, Jacobi Forcing Model, achieves 3.8x wall-clock speedup on coding and math benchmarks with minimal loss in performance. Based on Jacobi Forcing Models' trajectory characteristics, we introduce multi-block decoding with rejection recycling, which enables up to 4.5x higher token acceptance count per iteration and nearly 4.0x wall-clock speedup, effectively trading additional compute for lower inference latency. Our code is available at https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/JacobiForcing.

Abstract: Recent audio language models can follow long conversations. However, research on emotion-aware or spoken dialogue summarization is constrained by the lack of data that links speech, summaries, and paralinguistic cues. We introduce Spoken DialogSum, the first corpus aligning raw conversational audio with factual summaries, emotion-rich summaries, and utterance-level labels for speaker age, gender, and emotion. The dataset is built in two stages: first, an LLM rewrites DialogSum scripts with Switchboard-style fillers and back-channels, then tags each utterance with emotion, pitch, and speaking rate. Second, an expressive TTS engine synthesizes speech from the tagged scripts, aligned with paralinguistic labels. Spoken DialogSum comprises 13,460 emotion-diverse dialogues, each paired with both a factual and an emotion-focused summary. The dataset is available online at https://fatfat-emosum.github.io/EmoDialog-Sum-Audio-Samples/. Baselines show that an Audio-LLM raises emotional-summary ROUGE-L by 28% relative to a cascaded ASR-LLM system, confirming the value of end-to-end speech modeling.

Abstract: Video foundation models generate visually realistic and temporally coherent content, but their reliability as world simulators depends on whether they capture physical, logical, and spatial constraints. Existing metrics such as Frechet Video Distance (FVD) emphasize perceptual quality and overlook reasoning failures, including violations of causality, physics, and global consistency. We introduce MMGR (Multi-Modal Generative Reasoning Evaluation and Benchmark), a principled evaluation framework based on five reasoning abilities: Physical, Logical, 3D Spatial, 2D Spatial, and Temporal. MMGR evaluates generative reasoning across three domains: Abstract Reasoning (ARC-AGI, Sudoku), Embodied Navigation (real-world 3D navigation and localization), and Physical Commonsense (sports and compositional interactions). MMGR applies fine-grained metrics that require holistic correctness across both video and image generation. We benchmark leading video models (Veo-3, Sora-2, Wan-2.2) and image models (Nano-banana, Nano-banana Pro, GPT-4o-image, Qwen-image), revealing strong performance gaps across domains. Models show moderate success on Physical Commonsense tasks but perform poorly on Abstract Reasoning (below 10 percent accuracy on ARC-AGI) and struggle with long-horizon spatial planning in embodied settings. Our analysis highlights key limitations in current models, including overreliance on perceptual data, weak global state consistency, and objectives that reward visual plausibility over causal correctness. MMGR offers a unified diagnostic benchmark and a path toward reasoning-aware generative world models.

Motivation: 当前的研究多集中于新闻文章，无法适应孟加拉语真实世界文本的多样性。随着数字时代孟加拉语内容的爆炸性增长，急需能够减轻信息过载的摘要系统。

Method: 开发了一个包含从Cinegolpo等博客和Samakal等报纸收集的54,000篇孟加拉语文章和摘要的数据集，并使用LSTM、BanglaT5-small和MTS-small等深度学习及迁移学习模型进行训练和评估。

Result: 该数据集提供了强大的基线，并展示了作为孟加拉语自然语言处理研究基准的潜力。

Conclusion: 该数据集为构建稳健的摘要系统奠定了坚实基础，并有助于扩展低资源语言的NLP资源。

Abstract: This study developed a new Bangla abstractive summarization dataset to generate concise summaries of Bangla articles from diverse sources. Most existing studies in this field have concentrated on news articles, where journalists usually follow a fixed writing style. While such approaches are effective in limited contexts, they often fail to adapt to the varied nature of real-world Bangla texts. In today's digital era, a massive amount of Bangla content is continuously produced across blogs, newspapers, and social media. This creates a pressing need for summarization systems that can reduce information overload and help readers understand content more quickly. To address this challenge, we developed a dataset of over 54,000 Bangla articles and summaries collected from multiple sources, including blogs such as Cinegolpo and newspapers such as Samakal and The Business Standard. Unlike single-domain resources, our dataset spans multiple domains and writing styles. It offers greater adaptability and practical relevance. To establish strong baselines, we trained and evaluated this dataset using several deep learning and transfer learning models, including LSTM, BanglaT5-small, and MTS-small. The results highlight its potential as a benchmark for future research in Bangla natural language processing. This dataset provides a solid foundation for building robust summarization systems and helps expand NLP resources for low-resource languages.

Abstract: Manual chart review remains an extremely time-consuming and resource-intensive component of clinical research, requiring experts to extract often complex information from unstructured electronic health record (EHR) narratives. We present a secure, modular framework for automated structured feature extraction from clinical notes leveraging locally deployed large language models (LLMs) on institutionally approved, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA)-compliant compute infrastructure. This system integrates retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and structured response methods of LLMs into a widely deployable and scalable container to provide feature extraction for diverse clinical domains. In evaluation, the framework achieved high accuracy across multiple medical characteristics present in large bodies of patient notes when compared against an expert-annotated dataset and identified several annotation errors missed in manual review. This framework demonstrates the potential of LLM systems to reduce the burden of manual chart review through automated extraction and increase consistency in data capture, accelerating clinical research.

Motivation: 传统无线电地图构建方法需要大量位置标记数据，成本高昂且不切实际，特别是在许多现实场景中。

Method: 利用非视距（NLOS）下的信道状态信息（CSI）空间连续性，推导出与物理距离成比例的CSI距离度量；在泊松分布的接入点（AP）部署中，利用理论结果开发了一个空间正则化的贝叶斯推理框架，联合估计信道特征、区分LOS/NLOS条件并恢复用户轨迹。

Result: 在射线追踪数据集上的实验表明，该方法的平均定位误差为0.68米，波束地图重建误差为3.3%。

Conclusion: 所提出的盲映射方法在无需位置标签的情况下有效，并验证了其在定位和波束地图重建方面的性能。

Abstract: Radio maps enable intelligent wireless applications by capturing the spatial distribution of channel characteristics. However, conventional construction methods demand extensive location-labeled data, which are costly and impractical in many real-world scenarios. This paper presents a blind radio map construction framework that infers user trajectories from indoor multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) channel measurements without relying on location labels. It first proves that channel state information (CSI) under non-line-of-sight (NLOS) exhibits spatial continuity under a quasi-specular environmental model, allowing the derivation of a CSI-distance metric that is proportional to the corresponding physical distance. For rectilinear trajectories in Poisson-distributed access point (AP) deployments, it is shown that the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) of localization error vanishes asymptotically, even under poor angular resolution. Building on these theoretical results, a spatially regularized Bayesian inference framework is developed that jointly estimates channel features, distinguishes line-of-sight (LOS)/NLOS conditions and recovers user trajectories. Experiments on a ray-tracing dataset demonstrate an average localization error of 0.68 m and a beam map reconstruction error of 3.3%, validating the effectiveness of the proposed blind mapping method.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Adjudicator的系统，用于自动识别和修正机器学习训练数据中的标签噪声，通过构建动态知识图谱和多智能体大语言模型架构，显著提高了标签纠错的精确度和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险工业应用中，训练数据中的噪声标签会降低性能并削弱用户信任，因此需要一种能够自动识别和修正标签噪声的系统。

Method: Adjudicator系统采用神经符号学方法，首先构建动态知识图谱（KG）以统一项目上下文，然后通过新颖的多智能体大语言模型架构（即“智能体委员会”）进行标签有效性的辩论和投票。

Result: 在AlleNoise基准的1,000个项目平衡子集上验证，KG信息模型的F1得分达到0.99，明显优于单一LLM基线（0.48 F1）和非KG委员会（0.59 F1）。

Conclusion: 该系统通过知识图谱和多智能体架构的结合，实现了高精确度的自动化数据验证，为在严格监管的工业环境中生成黄金数据集提供了有力证明。

Abstract: The performance of production machine learning systems is fundamentally limited by the quality of their training data. In high-stakes industrial applications, noisy labels can degrade performance and erode user trust. This paper presents Adjudicator, a system that addresses the critical data mining challenge of automatically identifying and correcting label noise and has been validated for production deployment. Adjudicator models this as a neuro-symbolic task, first constructing a dynamic Knowledge Graph (KG) to unify item context. This KG then informs a "Council of Agents," a novel multi-agent Large Language Model architecture where specialized agents debate and vote on a label's validity. We validate our system on a 1,000-item balanced subset of the AlleNoise benchmark. Our KG-informed model achieves a 0.99 F1-score, significantly outperforming a single-LLM baseline (0.48 F1) and a non-KG council (0.59 F1). Our analysis reveals this is due to a Precision, achieved by a novel override logic that uses the KG to perfectly identify complex, structural errors (complete Recall) -- a class of errors that baselines fail to find. This result demonstrates a robust and explainable system for automated, high-precision data verification, serving as a vital proof-of-concept for generating golden datasets in strictly governed industrial environments.

Abstract: LLM implementations are failing in highly regulated industries owing to instability issues, inconsistent reasoning, hallucinations and performance variability, especially in workflows. These reliability issues restrict safe use of LLM in areas that need the precision of facts and consistent behavior (Aiyappa et al., 2023). The current methods of stabilization, such as, reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) and supervised fine-tuning, offer quantifiable improvements but are expensive and based on the intensive annotation of humans, thus being not easily scaled in a sustainable way (Dong et al., 2023; Retzlaff et al., 2024). This paper presents an AI-based annotation pipeline that systematically identifies, labels, and fixes for instability patterns on LLM output. Our human-AI synergy method combines the models of automated weak supervision and confidence-based annotation with the target human validation to guarantee the reliability and moral uprightness of feedback information (Cabitza et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023). The semantic consistency, factual correctness, and logical coherence categories of stability-specific annotation are introduced into our framework, allowing the continuous calibration of models and the enhancement of their robustness based on the feedback loops (Honovich et al., 2021; Nan et al., 2021).

Abstract: Personalized decision-making is essential for human-AI interaction, enabling AI agents to act in alignment with individual users' value preferences. As AI systems expand into real-world applications, adapting to personalized values beyond task completion or collective alignment has become a critical challenge. We address this by proposing a value-driven approach to personalized decision-making. Human values serve as stable, transferable signals that support consistent and generalizable behavior across contexts. Compared to task-oriented paradigms driven by external rewards and incentives, value-driven decision-making enhances interpretability and enables agents to act appropriately even in novel scenarios. We introduce ValuePilot, a two-phase framework consisting of a dataset generation toolkit (DGT) and a decision-making module (DMM). DGT constructs diverse, value-annotated scenarios from a human-LLM collaborative pipeline. DMM learns to evaluate actions based on personal value preferences, enabling context-sensitive, individualized decisions. When evaluated on previously unseen scenarios, DMM outperforms strong LLM baselines, including GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, Gemini-2-flash, and Llama-3.1-70b, in aligning with human action choices. Our results demonstrate that value-driven decision-making is an effective and extensible engineering pathway toward building interpretable, personalized AI agents.

Abstract: Causal reasoning in Large Language Models spanning association, intervention, and counterfactual inference is essential for reliable decision making in high stakes settings. As deployment shifts toward edge and resource constrained environments, quantized models such as INT8 and NF4 are becoming standard. Yet the impact of precision reduction on formal causal reasoning is poorly understood. To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically evaluate quantization effects across all three levels of Pearls Causal Ladder. Using a 3000 sample stratified CLadder benchmark, we find that rung level accuracy in Llama 3 8B remains broadly stable under quantization, with NF4 showing less than one percent overall degradation. Interventional queries at rung 2 are the most sensitive to precision loss, whereas counterfactual reasoning at rung 3 is comparatively stable but exhibits heterogeneous weaknesses across query types such as collider bias and backdoor adjustment. Experiments on the CRASS benchmark show near identical performance across precisions, indicating that existing commonsense counterfactual datasets lack the structural sensitivity needed to reveal quantization induced reasoning drift. We further evaluate Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation using ground truth causal graphs and observe a consistent improvement in NF4 interventional accuracy of plus 1.7 percent, partially offsetting compression related degradation. These results suggest that causal reasoning is unexpectedly robust to four bit quantization, graph structured augmentation can selectively reinforce interventional reasoning, and current counterfactual benchmarks fail to capture deeper causal brittleness. This work provides an initial empirical map of compressed causal reasoning and practical guidance for deploying efficient and structurally supported causal AI systems.

*TK Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种定性案例研究方法，用于审计大型语言模型在长时间互动中的政策相关行为选择性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准定量基准无法捕捉到LLMs在长时间互动中展示出的行为模式，尤其是在敏感领域的行为选择性。

Method: 通过一个86轮的对话会话，研究模型在非敏感和敏感领域的表现，提出了三种响应机制（正常表现、功能拒绝和元叙事），并引入‘learned incapacity’概念描述模型的选择性回避行为。

Result: 研究发现，在相同模型的单一对话中，非敏感领域表现出正常表现，而在敏感领域反复出现功能拒绝，且元叙事与拒绝在相同敏感情境下共存。

Conclusion: 研究提出了一种基于可观察行为的互动层面审计框架，并将‘learned incapacity’作为检查潜在对齐副作用的视角，值得在用户和模型间进一步研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely deployed as general-purpose tools, yet extended interaction can reveal behavioral patterns not captured by standard quantitative benchmarks. We present a qualitative case-study methodology for auditing policy-linked behavioral selectivity in long-horizon interaction. In a single 86-turn dialogue session, the same model shows Normal Performance (NP) in broad, non-sensitive domains while repeatedly producing Functional Refusal (FR) in provider- or policy-sensitive domains, yielding a consistent asymmetry between NP and FR across domains. Drawing on learned helplessness as an analogy, we introduce learned incapacity (LI) as a behavioral descriptor for this selective withholding without implying intentionality or internal mechanisms. We operationalize three response regimes (NP, FR, Meta-Narrative; MN) and show that MN role-framing narratives tend to co-occur with refusals in the same sensitive contexts. Overall, the study proposes an interaction-level auditing framework based on observable behavior and motivates LI as a lens for examining potential alignment side effects, warranting further investigation across users and models.

TL;DR: 本文引入了语义基础指数（SGI）来检测RAG系统中的幻觉响应，发现幻觉在嵌入空间中留下几何痕迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究RAG系统幻觉响应在嵌入空间中的几何特征，以开发更有效的检测工具。

Method: 定义SGI为响应在单位超球面与问题和上下文的角度距离之比，并使用HaluEval数据集和五个嵌入模型进行实验。

Result: 幻觉响应在角度上更接近问题而不是上下文，SGI在长响应和短问题上表现优异，并且效果随问题-上下文角度分离度增加而提高。

Conclusion: SGI提供了理论基础和计算效率高的工具，用于在生产RAG系统中识别需要验证的响应，但需注意其度量的是主题相关性而非事实准确性。

Abstract: When retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems hallucinate, what geometric trace does this leave in embedding space? We introduce the Semantic Grounding Index (SGI), defined as the ratio of angular distances from the response to the question versus the context on the unit hypersphere $\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$.Our central finding is \emph{semantic laziness}: hallucinated responses remain angularly proximate to questions rather than departing toward retrieved contexts. On HaluEval ($n$=5,000), we observe large effect sizes (Cohen's $d$ ranging from 0.92 to 1.28) across five embedding models with mean cross-model correlation $r$=0.85. Crucially, we derive from the spherical triangle inequality that SGI's discriminative power should increase with question-context angular separation $θ(q,c)$-a theoretical prediction confirmed empirically: effect size rises monotonically from $d$=0.61 -low $θ(q,c)$, to $d$=1.27 -high $θ(q,c)$, with AUC improving from 0.72 to 0.83. Subgroup analysis reveals that SGI excels on long responses ($d$=2.05) and short questions ($d$=1.22), while remaining robust across context lengths. Calibration analysis yields ECE=0.10, indicating SGI scores can serve as probability estimates, not merely rankings. A critical negative result on TruthfulQA (AUC=0.478) establishes that angular geometry measures topical engagement rather than factual accuracy. SGI provides computationally efficient, theoretically grounded infrastructure for identifying responses that warrant verification in production RAG deployments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to evolve programs and multi-agent systems, yet most existing approaches rely on overwrite-based mutations that maintain only a single candidate at a time. Such methods discard useful variants, suffer from destructive edits, and explore a brittle search space prone to structural failure. We introduce EvoLattice, a framework that represents an entire population of candidate programs or agent behaviors within a single directed acyclic graph. Each node stores multiple persistent alternatives, and every valid path through the graph defines a distinct executable candidate, yielding a large combinatorial search space without duplicating structure. EvoLattice enables fine-grained alternative-level evaluation by scoring each alternative across all paths in which it appears, producing statistics that reveal how local design choices affect global performance. These statistics provide a dense, data-driven feedback signal for LLM-guided mutation, recombination, and pruning, while preserving successful components. Structural correctness is guaranteed by a deterministic self-repair mechanism that enforces acyclicity and dependency consistency independently of the LLM. EvoLattice naturally extends to agent evolution by interpreting alternatives as prompt fragments or sub-agent behaviors. Across program synthesis (proxy and optimizer meta-learning), EvoLattice yields more stable evolution, greater expressivity, and stronger improvement trajectories than prior LLM-guided methods. The resulting dynamics resemble quality-diversity optimization, emerging implicitly from EvoLattice's internal multi-alternative representation rather than an explicit external archive.

TL;DR: 提出MURIM，一种多维基于声誉的激励机制，用于联邦学习，提升公平性和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习面临弱的客户端激励、隐私风险和资源限制等挑战，需要评估客户端可靠性以合理分配激励。

Method: MURIM综合考虑客户端可靠性、隐私、资源容量和公平性，通过声誉和可靠性验证模块分配激励。

Result: 在MNIST、FMNIST和ADULT Income数据集上的实验表明，MURIM在公平性指标上提升达18%，隐私攻击成功率降低5-9%，并增强对攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MURIM有效缓解对抗性威胁，促进公平和真实的参与，并在异质和动态联邦环境中保持模型稳定收敛。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a leading privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm, enabling participants to share model updates instead of raw data. However, FL continues to face key challenges, including weak client incentives, privacy risks, and resource constraints. Assessing client reliability is essential for fair incentive allocation and ensuring that each client's data contributes meaningfully to the global model. To this end, we propose MURIM, a MUlti-dimensional Reputation-based Incentive Mechanism that jointly considers client reliability, privacy, resource capacity, and fairness while preventing malicious or unreliable clients from earning undeserved rewards. MURIM allocates incentives based on client contribution, latency, and reputation, supported by a reliability verification module. Extensive experiments on MNIST, FMNIST, and ADULT Income datasets demonstrate that MURIM achieves up to 18% improvement in fairness metrics, reduces privacy attack success rates by 5-9%, and improves robustness against poisoning and noisy-gradient attacks by up to 85% compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Overall, MURIM effectively mitigates adversarial threats, promotes fair and truthful participation, and preserves stable model convergence across heterogeneous and dynamic federated settings.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在自动数学推理和科学发现方面取得了显著进展，但对其在标准研究生级数学理论上的基础推理能力仍需严格评估。

Method: 对四种模型（GPT-5-Thinking, Gemini-3-Pro, Claude-Sonnet-4.5-Thinking, 和 Grok-4）进行基准测试，要求生成一系列引理和习题的LaTeX证明，并分析其准确性、简洁性、幻觉率和逻辑结构。

Conclusion: 前沿模型已达到适合研究生级教学辅助和形式化的熟练度门槛，但在严格数学推导的可靠性方面仍存在显著差异。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to significant breakthroughs in automated mathematical reasoning and scientific discovery. Georgiev, G${ó}$mez-Serrano, Tao, and Wagner [GGSTW+25] demonstrate that AI systems can explore new constructions and improve existing bounds, illustrating the growing potential of LLMs to accelerate mathematical discovery. Similarly, Bubeck et al. [BCE+25] show that GPT-5 can meaningfully contribute to scientific workflows, from proposing hypotheses to generating proofs and analyses. Despite these advances, a rigorous evaluation of these models on canonical, graduate-level mathematical theory remains necessary to understand their baseline reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we present a comprehensive benchmark of four frontier models: GPT-5-Thinking, Gemini-3-Pro, Claude-Sonnet-4.5-Thinking, and Grok-4 against the classic curriculum of Randomized Algorithms by Motwani and Raghavan [MR95].
  We tasked each model with generating formal LaTeX proofs for a series of lemmas and exercises spanning the textbook. We find that while the top-tier models (Gemini, and Claude) achieve a high accuracy rate (approx. 66%), demonstrating a robust grasp of probabilistic method and formal logic, other models lag significantly in consistency (approx. 40%). We provide a qualitative analysis of the generated proofs, highlighting differences in conciseness, hallucination rates, and logical structure. Our results suggest that while frontier models have reached a threshold of proficiency suitable for graduate-level pedagogical assistance and formalization, significant variance exists in their reliability for rigorous mathematical derivation.

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型中的自我反思能力，通过表示工程的方法控制推理过程中的反思频率，以减少冗余并提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自我反思虽然提升了推理性能，但也增加了推理成本。研究动机是通过控制反思行为来降低不必要的计算开销。

Method: 通过将模型的推理过程分步，识别与反思相关的步骤，并在潜在空间中抽取反射方向，提出了一种逐步控制反思频率的方法ReflCtrl。

Result: 实验表明，反思在多数情况下是冗余的，特别是在更强的模型中，能够节省高达33.6%的推理标记同时保持性能。

Conclusion: 模型的反思行为与内部不确定性信号高度相关，暗示自我反思可能由模型的不确定性控制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning have achieved strong performance across diverse tasks, including mathematics, coding, and general reasoning. A distinctive ability of these reasoning models is self-reflection: the ability to review and revise previous reasoning steps. While self-reflection enhances reasoning performance, it also increases inference cost. In this work, we study self-reflection through the lens of representation engineering. We segment the model's reasoning into steps, identify the steps corresponding to reflection, and extract a reflection direction in the latent space that governs this behavior. Using this direction, we propose a stepwise steering method that can control reflection frequency. We call our framework ReflCtrl. Our experiments show that (1) in many cases reflections are redundant, especially in stronger models (in our experiments, we can save up to 33.6 percent of reasoning tokens while preserving performance), and (2) the model's reflection behavior is highly correlated with an internal uncertainty signal, implying self-reflection may be controlled by the model's uncertainty.

TL;DR: 提出DTop-p MoE，一种可控稀疏性的动态Top-p路由机制，通过PI控制器和动态路由归一化优化专家选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Top-k路由策略采用统一的稀疏模式，忽略了不同token的难度差异；而现有Top-p路由通常依赖固定的全局概率阈值，导致计算成本不可控且对超参数敏感。

Method: 提出DTop-p MoE，利用PI控制器动态调整概率阈值以匹配目标稀疏性，并引入动态路由归一化机制，使各层能学习不同的专家选择模式。

Result: 在大规模语言模型和扩散变换器上的广泛实验表明，DTop-p在性能上始终优于Top-k和固定阈值Top-p基线，并能精确控制激活专家数量。

Conclusion: DTop-p在不同专家粒度、专家容量、模型大小和数据集大小下均表现出良好的扩展性，为大规模MoE预训练提供了稳健框架。

Abstract: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures effectively scale model capacity by activating only a subset of experts for each input token. However, the standard Top-k routing strategy imposes a uniform sparsity pattern that ignores the varying difficulty of tokens. While Top-p routing offers a flexible alternative, existing implementations typically rely on a fixed global probability threshold, which results in uncontrolled computational costs and sensitivity to hyperparameter selection. In this paper, we propose DTop-p MoE, a sparsity-controllable dynamic Top-p routing mechanism. To resolve the challenge of optimizing a non-differentiable threshold, we utilize a Proportional-Integral (PI) Controller that dynamically adjusts the probability threshold to align the running activated-expert sparsity with a specified target. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic routing normalization mechanism that adapts layer-wise routing logits, allowing different layers to learn distinct expert-selection patterns while utilizing a global probability threshold. Extensive experiments on Large Language Models and Diffusion Transformers demonstrate that DTop-p consistently outperforms both Top-k and fixed-threshold Top-p baselines. Our analysis confirms that DTop-p maintains precise control over the number of activated experts while adaptively allocating resources across different tokens and layers. Furthermore, DTop-p exhibits strong scaling properties with respect to expert granularity, expert capacity, model size, and dataset size, offering a robust framework for large-scale MoE pre-training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在代码生成中表现出色，但现有的思维链提示方法在简单任务上容易导致过度思考，并缺乏对代码生成中意图抽象的关注。

Method: 提出了RoutingGen框架，采用难度感知路由，对简单任务使用少样本提示，对复杂任务引入结构化推理策略（ICoT），以捕捉任务意图。

Result: RoutingGen在多个模型和代码生成基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，同时平均减少了46.37%的标记使用量。ICoT在挑战性基准上优于六个现有提示方法。

Conclusion: 通过动态调整提示策略，RoutingGen不仅提高了代码生成的性能，还优化了资源使用，解决了现有方法的过度思考问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong generative capabilities and have shown great potential in code generation. Existing chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting methods enhance model reasoning by eliciting intermediate steps, but suffer from two major limitations: First, their uniform application tends to induce overthinking on simple tasks. Second, they lack intention abstraction in code generation, such as explicitly modeling core algorithmic design and efficiency, leading models to focus on surface-level structures while neglecting the global problem objective. Inspired by the cognitive economy principle of engaging structured reasoning only when necessary to conserve cognitive resources, we propose RoutingGen, a novel difficulty-aware routing framework that dynamically adapts prompting strategies for code generation. For simple tasks, it adopts few-shot prompting; for more complex ones, it invokes a structured reasoning strategy, termed Intention Chain-of-Thought (ICoT), which we introduce to guide the model in capturing task intention, such as the core algorithmic logic and its time complexity. Experiments across three models and six standard code generation benchmarks show that RoutingGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in most settings, while reducing total token usage by 46.37% on average across settings. Furthermore, ICoT outperforms six existing prompting baselines on challenging benchmarks.

Motivation: 大型语言模型的质量依赖于训练数据的质量和多样性，但数据集的组成和来源往往不透明，这妨碍了模型的可重复性和数据特性与模型行为之间因果关系的理解。

Method: ODA平台包含四个主要部分：统一的训练-评估流程、多维评分框架、交互式数据血统浏览器和开源工具包，以实现对数据质量的全面评估。

Result: 在ODA上进行的广泛实验揭示了数据复杂性与任务性能之间的权衡，通过血统追踪识别了常见基准的冗余，并绘制了数据集之间的谱系关系。

Conclusion: ODA旨在推动从试错式数据整理向以数据为中心的AI原则转变，为数据混合法则和基础模型的战略组成研究铺平道路。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) is predicated on the quality and diversity of post-training datasets. However, a critical dichotomy persists: while models are rigorously benchmarked, the data fueling them remains a black box--characterized by opaque composition, uncertain provenance, and a lack of systematic evaluation. This opacity hinders reproducibility and obscures the causal link between data characteristics and model behaviors. To bridge this gap, we introduce OpenDataArena (ODA), a holistic and open platform designed to benchmark the intrinsic value of post-training data. ODA establishes a comprehensive ecosystem comprising four key pillars: (i) a unified training-evaluation pipeline that ensures fair, open comparisons across diverse models (e.g., Llama, Qwen) and domains; (ii) a multi-dimensional scoring framework that profiles data quality along tens of distinct axes; (iii) an interactive data lineage explorer to visualize dataset genealogy and dissect component sources; and (iv) a fully open-source toolkit for training, evaluation, and scoring to foster data research. Extensive experiments on ODA--covering over 120 training datasets across multiple domains on 22 benchmarks, validated by more than 600 training runs and 40 million processed data points--reveal non-trivial insights. Our analysis uncovers the inherent trade-offs between data complexity and task performance, identifies redundancy in popular benchmarks through lineage tracing, and maps the genealogical relationships across datasets. We release all results, tools, and configurations to democratize access to high-quality data evaluation. Rather than merely expanding a leaderboard, ODA envisions a shift from trial-and-error data curation to a principled science of Data-Centric AI, paving the way for rigorous studies on data mixing laws and the strategic composition of foundation models.

Result: 在三个LLM和四个任务上的评估显示，RADAR实现了3.17x-4.82x的加速。

Conclusion: RADAR通过动态调整候选标记生成，有效减少了冗余计算，提高了推理速度。

Abstract: Inference with modern Large Language Models (LLMs) is expensive and slow, and speculative sampling has emerged as an effective solution to this problem, however, the number of the calls to the draft model for generating candidate tokens in speculative sampling is a preset hyperparameter, lacking flexibility. To generate and utilize the candidate tokens more effectively, we propose RADAR, a novel speculative sampling method with RL-based dynamic draft trees. RADAR formulates the draft tree generation process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and employs offline reinforcement learning to train a prediction model, which enables real-time decision on the calls to the draft model, reducing redundant computations and further accelerating inference. Evaluations across three LLMs and four tasks show that RADAR achieves a speedup of 3.17x-4.82x over the auto-regressive decoding baseline.

Abstract: Automatic search for Multi-Agent Systems has recently emerged as a key focus in agentic AI research. Several prior approaches have relied on LLM-based free-form search over the code space. In this work, we propose a more structured framework that explores the same space through a fixed set of simple, composable components. We show that, despite lacking the generative flexibility of LLMs during the candidate generation stage, our method outperforms prior approaches on four out of five benchmarks across two domains: mathematics and question answering. Furthermore, our method offers additional advantages, including a more cost-efficient search process and the generation of modular, interpretable multi-agent systems with simpler logic.

Abstract: Real-time streamflow monitoring networks generate millions of observations annually, yet maintaining data quality across thousands of remote sensors remains labor-intensive. We introduce HydroGEM (Hydrological Generalizable Encoder for Monitoring), a foundation model for continental-scale streamflow quality control. HydroGEM uses two-stage training: self-supervised pretraining on 6.03 million sequences from 3,724 USGS stations learns hydrological representations, followed by fine-tuning with synthetic anomalies for detection and reconstruction. A hybrid TCN-Transformer architecture (14.2M parameters) captures local temporal patterns and long-range dependencies, while hierarchical normalization handles six orders of magnitude in discharge. On held-out synthetic tests comprising 799 stations with 18 expert-validated anomaly types, HydroGEM achieves F1 = 0.792 for detection and 68.7% reconstruction-error reduction, a 36.3% improvement over existing methods. Zero-shot transfer to 100 Environment and Climate Change Canada stations yields F1 = 0.586, exceeding all baselines and demonstrating cross-national generalization. The model maintains consistent detection across correction magnitudes and aligns with operational seasonal patterns. HydroGEM is designed for human-in-the-loop workflows - outputs are quality control suggestions requiring expert review, not autonomous corrections.

Abstract: Supply chain management (SCM) faces significant challenges like demand fluctuations and the bullwhip effect. Traditional methods and even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle with benchmarks like the Vending Machine Test, failing to handle SCM's complex continuous time-series data. While ML approaches like LSTM and XGBoost offer solutions, they are often limited by computational inefficiency. Liquid Neural Networks (LNN), known for their adaptability and efficiency in robotics, remain untapped in SCM. This study proposes a hybrid LNN+XGBoost model for multi-tier supply chains. By combining LNN's dynamic feature extraction with XGBoost's global optimization, the model aims to minimize the bullwhip effect and increase profitability. This innovative approach addresses the need for efficiency and adaptability, filling a critical gap in intelligent SCM.

Abstract: Recent reasoning based medical MLLMs have made progress in generating step by step textual reasoning chains. However, they still struggle with complex tasks that necessitate dynamic and iterative focusing on fine-grained visual regions to achieve precise grounding and diagnosis. We introduce Ophiuchus, a versatile, tool-augmented framework that equips an MLLM to (i) decide when additional visual evidence is needed, (ii) determine where to probe and ground within the medical image, and (iii) seamlessly weave the relevant sub-image content back into an interleaved, multimodal chain of thought. In contrast to prior approaches limited by the performance ceiling of specialized tools, Ophiuchus integrates the model's inherent grounding and perception capabilities with external tools, thereby fostering higher-level reasoning. The core of our method is a three-stage training strategy: cold-start training with tool-integrated reasoning data to achieve basic tool selection and adaptation for inspecting key regions; self-reflection fine-tuning to strengthen reflective reasoning and encourage revisiting tool outputs; and Agentic Tool Reinforcement Learning to directly optimize task-specific rewards and emulate expert-like diagnostic behavior. Extensive experiments show that Ophiuchus consistently outperforms both closed-source and open-source SOTA methods across diverse medical benchmarks, including VQA, detection, and reasoning-based segmentation. Our approach illuminates a path toward medical AI agents that can genuinely "think with images" through tool-integrated reasoning. Datasets, codes, and trained models will be released publicly.

However, many location descriptions specify positions relatively with spatial relationships, making geocoding based solely on place names or geo-indicative words inaccurate. This issue frequently arises in biological specimen collection records, where locations are often described through narratives rather than coordinates if they pre-date GPS. Accurate georeferencing is vital for biodiversity studies, yet the process remains labour-intensive, leading to a demand for automated georeferencing solutions. This paper explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to georeference complex locality descriptions automatically, focusing on the biodiversity collections domain. We first identified effective prompting patterns, then fine-tuned an LLM using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) on biodiversity datasets from multiple regions and languages. Our approach outperforms existing baselines with an average, across datasets, of 65% of records within a 10 km radius, for a fixed amount of training data. The best results (New York state) were 85% within 10km and 67% within 1km. The selected LLM performs well for lengthy, complex descriptions, highlighting its potential for georeferencing intricate locality descriptions.

Abstract: Formal, automated theorem proving has long been viewed as a challenge to artificial intelligence. We introduce here a new approach to computer theorem proving, one that employs specialized language models for Lean4 proof generation combined with recursive decomposition of difficult theorems into simpler entailing propositions. These models are coordinated through a multi-agent architecture that orchestrates autoformalization (if required), proof generation, decomposition of difficult theorems into simpler entailing propositions, and recursive proof (and/or decomposition) of these propositions. Without decomposition, we achieve a 90.4% pass rate on miniF2F. With decomposition, this is significantly improved. A key technical contribution lies in our extension of the Kimina Lean Server with abstract syntax tree (AST) parsing capabilities to facilitate automated, recursive proof decomposition. The system is made available on PyPI as goedels-poetry (at https://pypi.org/project/goedels-poetry ), and the open-source implementation KellyJDavis/goedels-poetry (at https://github.com/KellyJDavis/goedels-poetry ) facilitates both adaptation to alternative language models and extension with custom functionality.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在帕金森病（PD）监测与警报本体工程中的应用，重点评估了单样本（OS）提示、思维链（CoT）提示、X-HCOME和SimX-HCOME+四种方法的效果，旨在确定仅靠LLMs是否能创建全面本体，以及人机协作是否能提高效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究的主要目标是确定LLMs在自动本体开发中的有效性，并评估通过人机协作所能实现的改进，特别是在复杂领域如PD监测中。

Method: 研究采用了四种方法：单样本（OS）提示、思维链（CoT）提示、X-HCOME和SimX-HCOME+。初始本体生成使用OS和CoT提示，X-HCOME结合人类专业知识和LLM能力，SimX-HCOME+强调持续的人类监督和迭代改进。

Result: OS和CoT提示展示了LLMs自主构建PD监测本体的能力，但输出不全面，需人工大量改进。X-HCOME显著提高了本体全面性，结果与专家构建的本体非常相似。SimX-HCOME+通过持续人类参与，产生了更全面和准确的本体。

Conclusion: 人机协作在本体工程中具有巨大潜力，特别是在复杂领域。研究结果为未来开发专门用于本体构建的GPT模型提供了有益方向。

Abstract: This paper explores the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the engineering of a Parkinson's Disease (PD) monitoring and alerting ontology through four key methodologies: One Shot (OS) prompt techniques, Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts, X-HCOME, and SimX-HCOME+. The primary objective is to determine whether LLMs alone can create comprehensive ontologies and, if not, whether human-LLM collaboration can achieve this goal. Consequently, the paper assesses the effectiveness of LLMs in automated ontology development and the enhancement achieved through human-LLM collaboration.
  Initial ontology generation was performed using One Shot (OS) and Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts, demonstrating the capability of LLMs to autonomously construct ontologies for PD monitoring and alerting. However, these outputs were not comprehensive and required substantial human refinement to enhance their completeness and accuracy.
  X-HCOME, a hybrid ontology engineering approach that combines human expertise with LLM capabilities, showed significant improvements in ontology comprehensiveness. This methodology resulted in ontologies that are very similar to those constructed by experts.
  Further experimentation with SimX-HCOME+, another hybrid methodology emphasizing continuous human supervision and iterative refinement, highlighted the importance of ongoing human involvement. This approach led to the creation of more comprehensive and accurate ontologies.
  Overall, the paper underscores the potential of human-LLM collaboration in advancing ontology engineering, particularly in complex domains like PD. The results suggest promising directions for future research, including the development of specialized GPT models for ontology construction.

Result: 在可靠性、通用性和局部性指标上优于现有方法，尤其局部性提升显著。

Conclusion: MeG方法在大规模知识编辑中具有明显优势。

Abstract: Knowledge Editing (KE) is a field that studies how to modify some knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs) at a low cost (compared to pre-training). Currently, performing large-scale edits on LLMs while ensuring the Reliability, Generality, and Locality metrics of the edits remain a challenge. This paper proposes a Massive editing approach for LLMs based on dynamic weight Generation (MeG). Our MeG involves attaching a dynamic weight neuron to specific layers of the LLMs and using a diffusion model to conditionally generate the weights of this neuron based on the input query required for the knowledge. This allows the use of adding a single dynamic weight neuron to achieve the goal of large-scale knowledge editing. Experiments show that our MeG can significantly improve the performance of large-scale KE in terms of Reliability, Generality, and Locality metrics compared to existing knowledge editing methods, particularly with a high percentage point increase in the absolute value index for the Locality metric, demonstrating the advantages of our proposed method.

Abstract: To address the steep learning curve and reliance on complex manual file editing and command-line operations in the traditional workflow of the mainstream open-source seismic wave simulation software SPECFEM, this paper proposes an intelligent, interactive workflow powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). We introduce the first Model Context Protocol (MCP) server suite for SPECFEM (supporting 2D, 3D Cartesian, and 3D Globe versions), which decomposes the entire simulation process into discrete, agent-executable tools spanning from parameter generation and mesh partitioning to solver execution and visualization. This approach enables a paradigm shift from file-driven to intent-driven conversational interactions. The framework supports both fully automated execution and human-in-the-loop collaboration, allowing researchers to guide simulation strategies in real time and retain scientific decision-making authority while significantly reducing tedious low-level operations. Validated through multiple case studies, the workflow operates seamlessly in both autonomous and interactive modes, yielding high-fidelity results consistent with standard baselines. As the first application of MCP technology to computational seismology, this study significantly lowers the entry barrier, enhances reproducibility, and offers a promising avenue for advancing computational geophysics toward AI-assisted and automated scientific research.

*Siyuan Zhu,Chengdong Xu,Kaiqiang Ke,Chao Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Context-Picker 是一种用于长上下文问答（LCQA）的推理感知框架，通过两阶段强化学习选择最小充分上下文子集，提高答案准确性并减少冗余。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在长上下文问答中，选择合适数量的上下文是一个挑战。过少的上下文可能遗漏关键信息，而过多的上下文会引入噪音，影响答案质量。传统方法在选择正确数量的上下文时存在困难，特别是对于需要少量证据的事实性问题。

Method: 引入了 Context-Picker 框架，将上下文选择视为决策过程，采用两阶段强化学习：首先是以召回为导向的阶段，优先覆盖推理链；其次是以精度为导向的阶段，剪枝冗余以提炼紧凑的证据集。还提出了一种离线证据蒸馏流程，通过 Leave-One-Out (LOO) 程序挖掘“最小充分集”，提供密集的任务对齐监督。

Result: 在五个长上下文和多跳问答基准上的实验表明，Context-Picker 显著优于强大的 RAG 基线，以相当或更短的上下文长度实现了更高的答案准确性。

Conclusion: Context-Picker 框架中的粗到细优化调度、冗余感知奖励塑造和基于理由的格式均对这些性能提升有显著贡献。

Abstract: In long-context question answering (LCQA), determining the optimal amount of context for a given query is a significant challenge. Including too few passages may omit critical information, while including too many can introduce noise and reduce the quality of the answer. Traditional approaches, such as fixed Top-$K$ retrieval and single-stage reranking, face the dilemma of selecting the right number of passages. This problem is particularly pronounced for factoid questions, which often require only a few specific pieces of evidence. To address this issue, we introduce \emph{Context-Picker}, a reasoning-aware framework that shifts the paradigm from similarity-based ranking to minimal sufficient subset selection. Context-Picker treats context selection as a decision-making process optimized via a human-inspired, two-stage reinforcement learning schedule: a \emph{recall-oriented} stage that prioritizes the coverage of reasoning chains, followed by a \emph{precision-oriented} stage that aggressively prunes redundancy to distill a compact evidence set. To resolve reward sparsity, we propose an offline evidence distillation pipeline that mines "minimal sufficient sets" via a Leave-One-Out (LOO) procedure, providing dense, task-aligned supervision. Experiments on five long-context and multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that Context-Picker significantly outperforms strong RAG baselines, achieving superior answer accuracy with comparable or reduced context lengths. Ablation studies indicate that the coarse-to-fine optimization schedule, the redundancy-aware reward shaping, and the rationale-guided format all contribute substantially to these gains.

Motivation: 尽管优化器训练取得了显著进展，但大多数研究仍使用常见的调度器，如余弦或指数衰减。本文旨在提出并验证一种新的自适应学习率调度器。

Method: 提出了GreedyLR调度器，根据当前损失自适应调整学习率，并在NLP、CV和LLM任务上进行了实验验证，包括微调和预训练。

Result: 在准确率、速度和收敛性方面，GreedyLR优于几种最先进的调度器，并提供了理论分析和对噪声环境的鲁棒性实验验证。

Conclusion: GreedyLR易于实现、计算高效，可作为训练的良好默认调度器。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in optimizers for training, most research works use common scheduler choices like Cosine or exponential decay. In this paper, we study \emph{GreedyLR}, a novel scheduler that adaptively adjusts the learning rate during training based on the current loss. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed scheduler, we conduct experiments on several NLP, CV, and LLM tasks with up to $7B$ parameters, including both fine-tuning and pre-training experiments. The results show that our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art schedulers in terms of accuracy, speed, and convergence. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the GreedyLR algorithm, including a proof of convergence and derivation of the optimal scaling factor $F$ that maximizes the convergence rate, along with experiments to show robustness of the algorithm to realistic noisy landscapes. Our scheduler is easy to implement, computationally efficient, and could be considered a good default scheduler for training.

Abstract: Universal transformers (UTs) have been widely used for complex reasoning tasks such as ARC-AGI and Sudoku, yet the specific sources of their performance gains remain underexplored. In this work, we systematically analyze UTs variants and show that improvements on ARC-AGI primarily arise from the recurrent inductive bias and strong nonlinear components of Transformer, rather than from elaborate architectural designs. Motivated by this finding, we propose the Universal Reasoning Model (URM), which enhances the UT with short convolution and truncated backpropagation. Our approach substantially improves reasoning performance, achieving state-of-the-art 53.8% pass@1 on ARC-AGI 1 and 16.0% pass@1 on ARC-AGI 2. Our code is avaliable at https://github.com/zitian-gao/URM.
