Although a few existing works\naddress this problem by leveraging physical simulation, they suffer from\nlimited accuracy or robustness to novel animation inputs. In this work, we\npresent MPMAvatar, a framework for creating 3D human avatars from multi-view\nvideos that supports highly realistic, robust animation, as well as\nphotorealistic rendering from free viewpoints. For accurate and robust dynamics\nmodeling, our key idea is to use a Material Point Method-based simulator, which\nwe carefully tailor to model garments with complex deformations and contact\nwith the underlying body by incorporating an anisotropic constitutive model and\na novel collision handling algorithm. We combine this dynamics modeling scheme\nwith our canonical avatar that can be rendered using 3D Gaussian Splatting with\nquasi-shadowing, enabling high-fidelity rendering for physically realistic\nanimations. In our experiments, we demonstrate that MPMAvatar significantly\noutperforms the existing state-of-the-art physics-based avatar in terms of (1)\ndynamics modeling accuracy, (2) rendering accuracy, and (3) robustness and\nefficiency. Additionally, we present a novel application in which our avatar\ngeneralizes to unseen interactions in a zero-shot manner-which was not\nachievable with previous learning-based methods due to their limited simulation\ngeneralizability.

Recent work on OST-AR depth\nperception shows that target opacity and tool visualization significantly\naffect accuracy and usability; opaque targets and rendering the real instrument\nreduce depth errors, whereas transparent targets and absent tools impair\nperformance. However, reliance on visual overlays may overload attention and\nleaves little room for depth cues when occlusion or lighting hampers\nperception. To address these limitations, we explore multimodal feedback that\ncombines OST-AR with wrist-based vibrotactile haptics. The past two years have\nseen rapid advances in haptic technology. Researchers have investigated\nskin-stretch and vibrotactile cues for conveying spatial information to blind\nusers, wearable ring actuators that support precise pinching in AR, cross-modal\naudio-haptic cursors that enable eyes-free object selection, and wrist-worn\nfeedback for teleoperated surgery that improves force awareness at the cost of\nlonger task times. Studies comparing pull versus push vibrotactile metaphors\nfound that pull cues yield faster gesture completion and lower cognitive load.\nThese findings motivate revisiting OST-AR guidance with a fresh perspective on\nwrist-based haptics. We design a custom wristband with six vibromotors\ndelivering directional and state cues, integrate it with a handheld tool and\nOST-AR, and assess its impact on cue recognition and depth guidance. Through a\nformative study and two experiments (N=21 and N=27), we show that participants\naccurately identify haptic patterns under cognitive load and that multimodal\nfeedback improves spatial precision and usability compared with visual-only or\nhaptic-only conditions."}

While high-quality vision-language data can enhance\nthese capabilities, its scarcity and limited scalability impose significant\nconstraints. To address this, we propose AGILE, an Agentic jiGsaw Interaction\nLearning for Enhancing visual perception and reasoning in VLMs. AGILE\nformulates jigsaw solving as an interactive process, enabling the model to\nprogressively engage with the environment. At each step, the model generates\nexecutable code to perform an action based on the current state, while the\nenvironment provides fine-grained visual feedback to guide task completion.\nThrough this iterative cycle of observation and interaction, the model\nincrementally improves its perceptual and reasoning capabilities via\nexploration and feedback. Experimental results show that AGILE not only\nsubstantially boosts performance on jigsaw tasks of varying complexity (e.g.,\nincreasing accuracy from 9.5% to 82.8% under the 2 $\\times$ 2 setting) but also\ndemonstrates strong generalization across 9 general vision tasks, achieving an\naverage improvement of 3.1%.

To solve these challenges, we\npropose AdvEvo-MARL, a co-evolutionary multi-agent reinforcement learning\nframework that internalizes safety into task agents. Rather than relying on\nexternal guards, AdvEvo-MARL jointly optimizes attackers (which synthesize\nevolving jailbreak prompts) and defenders (task agents trained to both\naccomplish their duties and resist attacks) in adversarial learning\nenvironments. To stabilize learning and foster cooperation, we introduce a\npublic baseline for advantage estimation: agents within the same functional\ngroup share a group-level mean-return baseline, enabling lower-variance updates\nand stronger intra-group coordination. Across representative attack scenarios,\nAdvEvo-MARL consistently keeps attack-success rate (ASR) below 20%, whereas\nbaselines reach up to 38.33%, while preserving-and sometimes improving-task\naccuracy (up to +3.67% on reasoning tasks). These results show that safety and\nutility can be jointly improved without relying on extra guard agents or added\nsystem overhead."}

Knowledge graphs address these challenges\nby structuring mass spectrometry data, metabolite information, and their\nrelationships into a connected network (Gaudry et al. 2024). However, effective\nuse of a knowledge graph demands an in-depth understanding of its ontology and\nits query language syntax. To overcome this, we designed MetaboT, an AI system\nutilizing large language models (LLMs) to translate user questions into SPARQL\nsemantic query language for operating on knowledge graphs (Steve Harris 2013).\nWe demonstrate its effectiveness using the Experimental Natural Products\nKnowledge Graph (ENPKG), a large-scale public knowledge graph for plant natural\nproducts (Gaudry et al. 2024).MetaboT employs specialized AI agents for\nhandling user queries and interacting with the knowledge graph by breaking down\ncomplex tasks into discrete components, each managed by a specialised agent\n(Fig. 1a). The multi-agent system is constructed using the LangChain and\nLangGraph libraries, which facilitate the integration of LLMs with external\ntools and information sources (LangChain, n.d.). The query generation process\nfollows a structured workflow. First, the Entry Agent determines if the\nquestion is new or a follow-up to previous interactions. New questions are\nforwarded to the Validator Agent, which verifies if the question is related to\nthe knowledge graph. Then, the valid question is sent to the Supervisor Agent,\nwhich identifies if the question requires chemical conversions or standardized\nidentifiers. In this case it delegates the question to the Knowledge Graph\nAgent, which can use tools to extract necessary details, such as URIs or\ntaxonomies of chemical names, from the user query. Finally, an agent\nresponsible for crafting the SPARQL queries equipped with the ontology of the\nknowledge graph uses the provided identifiers to generate the query. Then, the\nsystem executes the generated query against the metabolomics knowledge graph\nand returns structured results to the user (Fig. 1b). To assess the performance\nof MetaboT we have curated 50 metabolomics-related questions and their expected\nanswers. In addition to submitting these questions to MetaboT, we evaluated a\nbaseline by submitting them to a standard LLM (GPT-4o) with a prompt that\nincorporated the knowledge graph ontology but did not provide specific entity\nIDs. This baseline achieved only 8.16% accuracy, compared to MetaboT's 83.67%,\nunderscoring the necessity of our multi-agent system for accurately retrieving\nentities and generating correct SPARQL queries. MetaboT demonstrates promising\nperformance as a conversational question-answering assistant, enabling\nresearchers to retrieve structured metabolomics data through natural language\nqueries. By automating the generation and execution of SPARQL queries, it\nremoves technical barriers that have traditionally hindered access to knowledge\ngraphs. Importantly, MetaboT leverages the capabilities of LLMs while\nmaintaining experimentally grounded query generation, ensuring that outputs\nremain aligned with domain-specific standards and data structures. This\napproach facilitates data-driven discoveries by bridging the gap between\ncomplex semantic technologies and user-friendly interaction.

For instance, the model operates on the false assumption\nthat common insecticide locally known as Fiya-Fiya (Cyphermethrin) and\nrodenticide like Shinkafar Bera (a form of Aluminium Phosphide) are safe for\nhuman consumption. To contextualise the severity of this error and popularity\nof the substances, we conducted a survey (n=61) in which 98% of participants\nidentified them as toxic. Additional failures include an inability to\ndistinguish between raw and processed foods and the incorporation of demeaning\ncultural proverbs to build inaccurate arguments. We surmise that these issues\nmanifest through a form of linguistic reward hacking, where the model\nprioritises fluent, plausible-sounding output in the target language over\nsafety and truthfulness. We attribute the uncovered flaws primarily to\ninsufficient safety tuning in low-resource linguistic contexts. By\nconcentrating on a low-resource setting, our approach highlights a significant\ngap in current red-teaming effort and offer some recommendations."}

First, the system is able to simulate calibrated\neditorial judgment, with 'Revise' decisions consistently forming the majority\noutcome (>50%) across all disciplines, while 'Reject' rates dynamically adapt\nto field-specific norms, rising to 45% in Health Sciences. Second, it maintains\nunwavering procedural integrity, enforcing a stable 29% evidence-anchoring\ncompliance rate that remains invariant across diverse review tasks and\nscientific domains. These findings demonstrate a system that is predictably\nrule-bound, mitigating the stochasticity of generative AI. For the scientific\ncommunity, this provides a transparent tool to ensure fairness; for publishing\nstrategists, it offers a scalable instrument for auditing workflows, managing\nintegrity risks, and implementing evidence-based governance.

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a popular\nframework for question answering that is powered by two large language models\n(LLMs): an embedding model that retrieves context documents from a database\nthat are relevant to a given question, and a generator model that uses the\nretrieved context to generate an answer to the question. Both the embedding and\ngenerator models can be fine-tuned to increase performance of a RAG pipeline on\na new task, but multiple fine-tuning strategies exist with different costs and\nbenefits. In this paper, we evaluate and compare several RAG fine-tuning\nstrategies, including independent, joint, and two-phase fine-tuning. In our\nexperiments, we observe that all of these strategies achieve about equal\nimprovement in EM and F1 generation quality metrics, although they have\nsignificantly different computational costs. We conclude the optimal\nfine-tuning strategy to use depends on whether the training dataset includes\ncontext labels and whether a grid search over the learning rates for the\nembedding and generator models is required."}

This paper investigates the shrinkage issue of RLVR by\nanalyzing its learning dynamics and reveals two critical phenomena that explain\nthis failure. First, we expose negative interference in RLVR, where learning to\nsolve certain training problems actively reduces the likelihood of correct\nsolutions for others, leading to the decline of Pass@$k$ performance, or the\nprobability of generating a correct solution within $k$ attempts. Second, we\nuncover the winner-take-all phenomenon: RLVR disproportionately reinforces\nproblems with high likelihood, correct solutions, under the base model, while\nsuppressing other initially low-likelihood ones. Through extensive theoretical\nand empirical analysis on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we show\nthat this effect arises from the inherent on-policy sampling in standard RL\nobjectives, causing the model to converge toward narrow solution strategies.\nBased on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data curation\nalgorithm that focuses RLVR learning on low-likelihood problems, achieving\nnotable improvement in Pass@$k$ performance.

Although a few existing works\naddress this problem by leveraging physical simulation, they suffer from\nlimited accuracy or robustness to novel animation inputs. In this work, we\npresent MPMAvatar, a framework for creating 3D human avatars from multi-view\nvideos that supports highly realistic, robust animation, as well as\nphotorealistic rendering from free viewpoints. For accurate and robust dynamics\nmodeling, our key idea is to use a Material Point Method-based simulator, which\nwe carefully tailor to model garments with complex deformations and contact\nwith the underlying body by incorporating an anisotropic constitutive model and\na novel collision handling algorithm. We combine this dynamics modeling scheme\nwith our canonical avatar that can be rendered using 3D Gaussian Splatting with\nquasi-shadowing, enabling high-fidelity rendering for physically realistic\nanimations. In our experiments, we demonstrate that MPMAvatar significantly\noutperforms the existing state-of-the-art physics-based avatar in terms of (1)\ndynamics modeling accuracy, (2) rendering accuracy, and (3) robustness and\nefficiency. Additionally, we present a novel application in which our avatar\ngeneralizes to unseen interactions in a zero-shot manner-which was not\nachievable with previous learning-based methods due to their limited simulation\ngeneralizability.

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a popular\nframework for question answering that is powered by two large language models\n(LLMs): an embedding model that retrieves context documents from a database\nthat are relevant to a given question, and a generator model that uses the\nretrieved context to generate an answer to the question. Both the embedding and\ngenerator models can be fine-tuned to increase performance of a RAG pipeline on\na new task, but multiple fine-tuning strategies exist with different costs and\nbenefits. In this paper, we evaluate and compare several RAG fine-tuning\nstrategies, including independent, joint, and two-phase fine-tuning. In our\nexperiments, we observe that all of these strategies achieve about equal\nimprovement in EM and F1 generation quality metrics, although they have\nsignificantly different computational costs. We conclude the optimal\nfine-tuning strategy to use depends on whether the training dataset includes\ncontext labels and whether a grid search over the learning rates for the\nembedding and generator models is required."}

Measuring Knowledge-Aware Refusal in Factual Tasks", "comment": null, "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) should refuse to answer questions beyond their\nknowledge. This capability, which we term knowledge-aware refusal, is crucial\nfor factual reliability. However, existing metrics fail to faithfully measure\nthis ability. On the one hand, simple refusal-based metrics are biased by\nrefusal rates and yield inconsistent scores when models exhibit different\nrefusal tendencies. On the other hand, existing calibration metrics are\nproxy-based, capturing the performance of auxiliary calibration processes\nrather than the model's actual refusal behavior. In this work, we propose the\nRefusal Index (RI), a principled metric that measures how accurately LLMs\nrefuse questions they do not know. We define RI as Spearman's rank correlation\nbetween refusal probability and error probability. To make RI practically\nmeasurable, we design a lightweight two-pass evaluation method that efficiently\nestimates RI from observed refusal rates across two standard evaluation runs.\nExtensive experiments across 16 models and 5 datasets demonstrate that RI\naccurately quantifies a model's intrinsic knowledge-aware refusal capability in\nfactual tasks. Notably, RI remains stable across different refusal rates and\nprovides consistent model rankings independent of a model's overall accuracy\nand refusal rates. More importantly, RI provides insight into an important but\npreviously overlooked aspect of LLM factuality: while LLMs achieve high\naccuracy on factual tasks, their refusal behavior can be unreliable and\nfragile. This finding highlights the need to complement traditional accuracy\nmetrics with the Refusal Index for comprehensive factuality evaluation."}

TRACE quantifies effort by measuring how early a model's reasoning\nbecomes sufficient to pass a verifier. We progressively truncate a model's CoT\nat various lengths, force the model to answer, and measure the verifier-passing\nrate at each cutoff.

While CLIP exhibits strong zero-shot transfer, its reliance on coarse\nglobal features restricts its performance on fine-grained classification tasks.\nPrior efforts inject fine-grained knowledge by aligning large language model\n(LLM) descriptions with the CLIP $\\texttt{[CLS]}$ token; however, this approach\noverlooks spatial precision. We propose $\\textbf{microCLIP}$, a self-training\nframework that jointly refines CLIP's visual and textual representations using\nfine-grained cues. At its core is Saliency-Oriented Attention Pooling (SOAP)\nwithin a lightweight TokenFusion module, which builds a saliency-guided\n$\\texttt{[FG]}$ token from patch embeddings and fuses it with the global\n$\\texttt{[CLS]}$ token for coarse-fine alignment. To stabilize adaptation, we\nintroduce a two-headed LLM-derived classifier: a frozen classifier that, via\nmulti-view alignment, provides a stable text-based prior for pseudo-labeling,\nand a learnable classifier initialized from LLM descriptions and fine-tuned\nwith TokenFusion. We further develop Dynamic Knowledge Aggregation, which\nconvexly combines fixed LLM/CLIP priors with TokenFusion's evolving logits to\niteratively refine pseudo-labels. Together, these components uncover latent\nfine-grained signals in CLIP, yielding a consistent $2.90\\%$ average accuracy\ngain across 13 fine-grained benchmarks while requiring only light adaptation.\nOur code is available at https://github.com/sathiiii/microCLIP."}

However,\nexisting LLM agents rely heavily on open-web search, which exposes two\nfundamental weaknesses: online content is noisy and unreliable, and many\nreal-world tasks require precise, domain-specific knowledge unavailable from\nthe web. The emergence of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) now allows agents to\ninterface with thousands of specialized tools, seemingly resolving this\nlimitation. Yet it remains unclear whether agents can effectively leverage such\ntools -- and more importantly, whether they can integrate them with\ngeneral-purpose search to solve complex tasks. Therefore, we introduce\nInfoMosaic-Bench, the first benchmark dedicated to multi-source information\nseeking in tool-augmented agents. Covering six representative domains\n(medicine, finance, maps, video, web, and multi-domain integration),\nInfoMosaic-Bench requires agents to combine general-purpose search with\ndomain-specific tools. Tasks are synthesized with InfoMosaic-Flow, a scalable\npipeline that grounds task conditions in verified tool outputs, enforces\ncross-source dependencies, and filters out shortcut cases solvable by trivial\nlookup. This design guarantees both reliability and non-triviality. Experiments\nwith 14 state-of-the-art LLM agents reveal three findings: (i) web information\nalone is insufficient, with GPT-5 achieving only 38.2% accuracy and 67.5% pass\nrate; (ii) domain tools provide selective but inconsistent benefits, improving\nsome domains while degrading others; and (iii) 22.4% of failures arise from\nincorrect tool usage or selection, highlighting that current LLMs still\nstruggle with even basic tool handling."}

While existing work has\nprimarily focused on investigating its generalization across tasks or\nmodalities, this study proposes a novel cross-linguistic perspective to\ninvestigate reasoning generalization. This raises a crucial question:\n$\\textit{Does the reasoning capability achieved from English RPT effectively\ntransfer to other languages?}$ We address this by systematically evaluating\nEnglish-centric LRMs on multilingual reasoning benchmarks and introducing a\nmetric to quantify cross-lingual transferability. Our findings reveal that\ncross-lingual transferability varies significantly across initial model, target\nlanguage, and training paradigm. Through interventional studies, we find that\nmodels with stronger initial English capabilities tend to over-rely on\nEnglish-specific patterns, leading to diminished cross-lingual generalization.\nTo address this, we conduct a thorough parallel training study. Experimental\nresults yield three key findings: $\\textbf{First-Parallel Leap}$, a substantial\nleap in performance when transitioning from monolingual to just a single\nparallel language, and a predictable $\\textbf{Parallel Scaling Law}$, revealing\nthat cross-lingual reasoning transfer follows a power-law with the number of\ntraining parallel languages.

However, their reliance on transformer\narchitectures incurs prohibitively high computational costs, particularly when\nextending generation to long videos. Recent work has explored autoregressive\nformulations for long video generation, typically by distilling from\nshort-horizon bidirectional teachers. Nevertheless, given that teacher models\ncannot synthesize long videos, the extrapolation of student models beyond their\ntraining horizon often leads to pronounced quality degradation, arising from\nthe compounding of errors within the continuous latent space. In this paper, we\npropose a simple yet effective approach to mitigate quality degradation in\nlong-horizon video generation without requiring supervision from long-video\nteachers or retraining on long video datasets. Our approach centers on\nexploiting the rich knowledge of teacher models to provide guidance for the\nstudent model through sampled segments drawn from self-generated long videos.\nOur method maintains temporal consistency while scaling video length by up to\n20x beyond teacher's capability, avoiding common issues such as over-exposure\nand error-accumulation without recomputing overlapping frames like previous\nmethods. When scaling up the computation, our method shows the capability of\ngenerating videos up to 4 minutes and 15 seconds, equivalent to 99.9% of the\nmaximum span supported by our base model's position embedding and more than 50x\nlonger than that of our baseline model. Experiments on standard benchmarks and\nour proposed improved benchmark demonstrate that our approach substantially\noutperforms baseline methods in both fidelity and consistency.

Beyond their\ncreative potential, such models also hold promise as world simulators for\nrobotics and embodied decision making. Despite strong advances, however,\ncurrent approaches still struggle to generate physically plausible object\ninteractions and lack physics-grounded control mechanisms. To address this\nlimitation, we introduce KineMask, an approach for physics-guided video\ngeneration that enables realistic rigid body control, interactions, and\neffects. Given a single image and a specified object velocity, our method\ngenerates videos with inferred motions and future object interactions. We\npropose a two-stage training strategy that gradually removes future motion\nsupervision via object masks. Using this strategy we train video diffusion\nmodels (VDMs) on synthetic scenes of simple interactions and demonstrate\nsignificant improvements of object interactions in real scenes. Furthermore,\nKineMask integrates low-level motion control with high-level textual\nconditioning via predictive scene descriptions, leading to effective support\nfor synthesis of complex dynamical phenomena. Extensive experiments show that\nKineMask achieves strong improvements over recent models of comparable size.\nAblation studies further highlight the complementary roles of low- and\nhigh-level conditioning in VDMs. Our code, model, and data will be made\npublicly available."}

High-resolution text-to-image generators are\ncurrently unable to easily offer an out-of-the-box budget-efficient alternative\nto their users who might not need high-resolution images. We identify a key\ntechnical insight in diffusion models that when addressed can help tackle this\nlimitation: Noise schedulers have unequal perceptual effects across\nresolutions. The same level of noise removes disproportionately more signal\nfrom lower-resolution images than from high-resolution images, leading to a\ntrain-test mismatch. We propose NoiseShift, a training-free method that\nrecalibrates the noise level of the denoiser conditioned on resolution size.\nNoiseShift requires no changes to model architecture or sampling schedule and\nis compatible with existing models.
