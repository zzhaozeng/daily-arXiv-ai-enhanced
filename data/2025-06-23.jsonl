Namely, we build a test set for\nbenchmarking metric reliability using human annotations and show that\ntraditional metrics underperform compared to language model-based metrics,\nwhich prove to be strong evaluators. Using these metrics, we show that\nreranking-based methods yield strong results, and preference tuning with\nsynthetically generated and reranking-labeled data further boosts performance.\nOur findings aim to contribute to the reliable evaluation and development of\nperspective summarization methods."}

Through\nextensive experiments on $5$ LLMs from different families and $2$ recent\nbenchmarks, we demonstrate that Sysformer can significantly enhance the\nrobustness of LLMs, leading to upto $80\\%$ gain in the refusal rate on harmful\nprompts while enhancing the compliance with the safe prompts by upto $90\\%$.\nResults also generalize well to sophisticated jailbreaking attacks, making LLMs\nupto $100\\%$ more robust against different attack strategies.

However,\nstructured CoT prompting has received limited attention in prior work.\nFurthermore, the design of reasoning structures in structured CoT prompting is\noften based on heuristics from non-domain experts. In this study, we\ninvestigate each prompting approach in FinNLP. We evaluate the three main\nprompting styles and FinCoT on CFA-style questions spanning ten financial\ndomains. We observe that FinCoT improves performance from 63.2% to 80.5% and\nQwen-2.5-7B-Instruct from 69.7% to 74.2%, while reducing generated tokens\neight-fold compared to structured CoT prompting.

If, as linguistic relativity suggests, the structure\nof language shapes cognitive patterns, then large language models (LLMs)\ntrained on human language may also internalize the habitual logical structures\nembedded in different languages. To examine this hypothesis, we introduce\nBICAUSE, a structured bilingual dataset for causal reasoning, which includes\nsemantically aligned Chinese and English samples in both forward and reversed\ncausal forms. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) LLMs exhibit\ntypologically aligned attention patterns, focusing more on causes and\nsentence-initial connectives in Chinese, while showing a more balanced\ndistribution in English. (2) Models internalize language-specific preferences\nfor causal word order and often rigidly apply them to atypical inputs, leading\nto degraded performance, especially in Chinese. (3) When causal reasoning\nsucceeds, model representations converge toward semantically aligned\nabstractions across languages, indicating a shared understanding beyond surface\nform.

We propose a theoretical framework that distinguishes the failure modes\nof long context tasks into three categories: cross-chunk dependence (task\nnoise), confusion that grows with context size (model noise), and the imperfect\nintegration of partial results (aggregator noise). Under this view, we analyze\nwhen it is effective to use multi-agent chunking, i.e., dividing a length\nsequence into smaller chunks and aggregating the processed results of each\nchunk. Our experiments on tasks such as retrieval, question answering, and\nsummarization confirm both the theoretical analysis and the conditions that\nfavor multi-agent chunking. By exploring superlinear model noise growth with\ninput length, we also explain why, for large inputs, a weaker model configured\nwith chunk-based processing can surpass a more advanced model like GPT4o\napplied in a single shot.

We propose a formal framework for evaluating whether\nan LLM exhibits a sufficiently robust world model, defined as producing\nconsistent outputs across semantically equivalent prompts while distinguishing\nbetween prompts that express different intents. We introduce a new evaluation\napproach to measure this that decomposes model response variability into three\ncomponents: variability due to user purpose, user articulation, and model\ninstability. An LLM with a strong world model should attribute most of the\nvariability in its responses to changes in foundational purpose rather than\nsuperficial changes in articulation. This approach allows us to quantify how\nmuch of a model's behavior is semantically grounded rather than driven by model\ninstability or alternative wording. We apply this framework to evaluate LLMs\nacross diverse domains. Our results show how larger models attribute a greater\nshare of output variability to changes in user purpose, indicating a more\nrobust world model. This improvement is not uniform, however: larger models do\nnot consistently outperform smaller ones across all domains, and their\nadvantage in robustness is often modest.

Recent speech tokenization approaches aim\nto isolate semantic information from low-level acoustics to better align with\nlanguage models. In particular, previous methods use SSL teachers such as\nHuBERT to extract semantic representations, which are then distilled into a\nsemantic quantizer to suppress acoustic redundancy as well as capture\ncontent-related latent structures. However, they still produce speech token\nsequences significantly longer than their textual counterparts, creating\nchallenges for efficient speech-language modeling. Reducing the frame rate is a\nnatural solution, but standard techniques, such as rigid average pooling across\nframes, can distort or dilute the semantic structure required for effective LM\nalignment. To address this, we propose LM-SPT, a speech tokenization method\nthat introduces a novel semantic distillation. Instead of directly matching\nteacher and student features via pooling, we reconstruct speech solely from\nsemantic tokens and minimize the discrepancy between the encoded\nrepresentations of the original and reconstructed waveforms, obtained from a\nfrozen automatic speech recognition (ASR) encoder. This indirect yet\ndata-driven supervision enables the tokenizer to learn discrete units that are\nmore semantically aligned with language models. LM-SPT further incorporates\narchitectural improvements to the encoder and decoder for speech tokenization,\nand supports multiple frame rates, including 25Hz, 12.5Hz, and 6.25Hz.\nExperimental results show that LM-SPT achieves superior reconstruction fidelity\ncompared to baselines, and that SLMs trained with LM-SPT tokens achieve\ncompetitive performances on speech-to-text and consistently outperform\nbaselines on text-to-speech tasks."}

(2) Models internalize language-specific preferences\nfor causal word order and often rigidly apply them to atypical inputs, leading\nto degraded performance, especially in Chinese. (3) When causal reasoning\nsucceeds, model representations converge toward semantically aligned\nabstractions across languages, indicating a shared understanding beyond surface\nform. Overall, these results suggest that LLMs not only mimic surface\nlinguistic forms but also internalize the reasoning biases shaped by language.\nRooted in cognitive linguistic theory, this phenomenon is for the first time\nempirically verified through structural analysis of model internals."}

We propose a formal framework for evaluating whether\nan LLM exhibits a sufficiently robust world model, defined as producing\nconsistent outputs across semantically equivalent prompts while distinguishing\nbetween prompts that express different intents. We introduce a new evaluation\napproach to measure this that decomposes model response variability into three\ncomponents: variability due to user purpose, user articulation, and model\ninstability. An LLM with a strong world model should attribute most of the\nvariability in its responses to changes in foundational purpose rather than\nsuperficial changes in articulation. This approach allows us to quantify how\nmuch of a model's behavior is semantically grounded rather than driven by model\ninstability or alternative wording. We apply this framework to evaluate LLMs\nacross diverse domains.

However,\nquantifying epistemic uncertainty in such tasks is challenging due to the\npresence of aleatoric uncertainty, which arises from multiple valid answers.\nWhile bias can introduce noise into epistemic uncertainty estimation, it may\nalso reduce noise from aleatoric uncertainty. To investigate this trade-off, we\nconduct experiments on Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks and find that\nmitigating prompt-introduced bias improves uncertainty quantification in\nGPT-4o. Building on prior work showing that LLMs tend to copy input information\nwhen model confidence is low, we further analyze how these prompt biases affect\nmeasured epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty across varying bias-free\nconfidence levels with GPT-4o and Qwen2-VL. We find that all considered biases\ninduce greater changes in both uncertainties when bias-free model confidence is\nlower. Moreover, lower bias-free model confidence leads to greater\nunderestimation of epistemic uncertainty (i.e. overconfidence) due to bias,\nwhereas it has no significant effect on the direction of changes in aleatoric\nuncertainty estimation.

Through systematic\nanalysis of VLM behavior under attack, we identify a novel phenomenon termed\n``delayed safety awareness''.

We primarily approach\nthis problem from a data compression perspective to devise a nuanced training\nand modeling method which is attuned to the domain and range characteristics of\ndiffractive reflectance datasets. Importantly, our approach avoids over-fitting\nand has robust resampling behavior. Using Peak-Signal-to-Noise (PSNR),\nStructural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and a flipping difference evaluator\n(FLIP) as evaluation metrics, we demonstrate the high-quality reconstruction of\nthe ground-truth. In comparison to a recent state-of-the-art offline,\nwave-optical, forward modeling approach, our method reproduces subjectively\nsimilar results with significant performance gains. We reduce the memory\nfootprint of the raw datasets by two orders of magnitude in general. Lastly, we\ndepict the working of our method with actual surface renderings."}

Contemporary methods\ntypically address this challenge using a dual-strategy framework: performing\nconsistent 2D inpainting across all views guided by embedded priors either\nexplicitly in pixel space or implicitly in latent space; and conducting 3D\nreconstruction with additional consistency guidance. Previous strategies, in\nparticular, often require an initial 3D reconstruction phase to establish\ngeometric structure, introducing considerable computational overhead. Even with\nthe added cost, the resulting reconstruction quality often remains suboptimal.\nIn this paper, we present VEIGAR, a computationally efficient framework that\noutperforms existing methods without relying on an initial reconstruction\nphase. VEIGAR leverages a lightweight foundation model to reliably align priors\nexplicitly in the pixel space. In addition, we introduce a novel supervision\nstrategy based on scale-invariant depth loss, which removes the need for\ntraditional scale-and-shift operations in monocular depth regularization.\nThrough extensive experimentation, VEIGAR establishes a new state-of-the-art\nbenchmark in reconstruction quality and cross-view consistency, while achieving\na threefold reduction in training time compared to the fastest existing method,\nhighlighting its superior balance of efficiency and effectiveness."}

However,\nexisting static, non-interactive evaluation paradigms fail to adequately assess\nrisks within these interactive environments, since they cannot simulate dynamic\nrisks that emerge from an agent's actions and rely on unreliable post-hoc\nevaluations that ignore unsafe intermediate steps. To bridge this critical gap,\nwe propose evaluating an agent's interactive safety: its ability to perceive\nemergent risks and execute mitigation steps in the correct procedural order. We\nthus present IS-Bench, the first multi-modal benchmark designed for interactive\nsafety, featuring 161 challenging scenarios with 388 unique safety risks\ninstantiated in a high-fidelity simulator. Crucially, it facilitates a novel\nprocess-oriented evaluation that verifies whether risk mitigation actions are\nperformed before/after specific risk-prone steps. Extensive experiments on\nleading VLMs, including the GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5 series, reveal that current\nagents lack interactive safety awareness, and that while safety-aware\nChain-of-Thought can improve performance, it often compromises task completion.\nBy highlighting these critical limitations, IS-Bench provides a foundation for\ndeveloping safer and more reliable embodied AI systems."}

We present a curvature proxy that regularizes only the mixed\nsecond-order term (Weingarten term), allowing the two principal curvatures to\nadapt freely to data while suppressing unwanted warp. Two complementary\ninstantiations realize this idea: (i) a finite-difference proxy that replaces\neach Hessian entry with four forward SDF evaluations and a single first-order\ngradient, and (ii) an autodiff proxy that computes the same mixed derivative\nvia one Hessian-vector product, sidestepping explicit full Hessian assembly and\nremaining faster in practice. Both variants converge to the exact mixed second\nderivative, thus preserving the intended geometric bias without incurring full\nsecond-order graphs. On the ABC benchmarks, the proxies match or exceed the\nreconstruction fidelity of Hessian-based baselines while reducing GPU memory\nuse and wall-clock time by a factor of two.

We implement this PDE numerically through a GPU-accelerated custom\nLattice Boltzmann solver for fast evaluation. To induce realistic turbulence,\nwe generate stochastic velocity fields that introduce coherent motion and\ncapture multi-scale mixing. In the generative process, a neural network learns\nto reverse the advection-diffusion operator thus constituting a novel\ngenerative model.
