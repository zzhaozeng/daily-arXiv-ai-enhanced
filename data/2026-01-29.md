Abstract: Distinguishing human-written Korean text from fluent LLM outputs remains difficult even for linguistically trained readers, who can over-trust surface well-formedness. We study whether expert detection can be treated as a learnable skill and improved through structured calibration. We introduce LREAD, a rubric derived from national Korean writing standards and adapted to target micro-level artifacts (e.g., punctuation optionality, spacing behavior, and register shifts). In a three-phase longitudinal blind protocol with Korean linguistics majors, Phase 1 measures intuition-only detection, Phase 2 enforces criterion-level scoring with explicit justifications, and Phase 3 evaluates domain-focused mastery on held-out elementary essays. Across phases, majority-vote accuracy increases from 60% to 100%, accompanied by stronger inter-annotator agreement (Fleiss' kappa: -0.09 --> 0.82). Compared to state-of-the-art LLM detectors, calibrated humans rely more on language-specific micro-diagnostics that are not well captured by coarse discourse priors. Our findings suggest that rubric-scaffolded expert judgment can serve as an interpretable complement to automated detectors for non-English settings, and we release the full rubric and a taxonomy of calibrated detection signatures.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Synthetic data has proven itself to be a valuable resource for tuning smaller, cost-effective language models to handle the complexities of multi-turn tool calling conversations. While many frameworks and systems for producing synthetic multi-turn tool calling data have been proposed, prior works have frequently assumed that any tool calling interactions will take place in an execution environment that maintains state. When such an environment is available, this is advantageous as it allows for the validity of an interaction to be determined by whether or not the state of the execution environment matches to some prespecified objective. Unfortunately, this does not hold in many real-world tool use settings, e.g., in enterprise settings where data security is of the utmost importance or in cases where tool specifications are synthesized from multiple sources. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a data generation method, DiGiT-TC, that is designed to produce tool calling conversations that have the characteristics of conversations generated through search in a stateful environment. The key to our technique lies in a novel generation pattern that allows our approach to implicitly represent certain tool calls in the user request. We validate our approach on standard tool calling benchmarks and demonstrate that, even in stateful problem settings, our approach results in strong performance gains.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We introduce the \emph{Arrow Language Model}, a neural architecture derived from an intuitionistic-logic interpretation of next-token prediction. Instead of representing tokens as additive embeddings mixed by attention, we encode a prefix as a \emph{left-nested implication chain} whose structure preserves order through non-commutative composition. Next-token prediction corresponds to \emph{modus ponens}, and sequence processing becomes constructive proof extension under the Curry--Howard correspondence. Our Prolog-based specialized theorem provers validate fundamental properties of the neural models, among which relations between commutative vs. non-commutative sequencing and single-token vs. multi-token prediction choices. We show that a neural architecture equivalent to multiplicative RNNs arises naturally from a proof-theoretic interpretation of next-token prediction as nested intuitionistic implication, we present a practical low-rank neural realization and position the model relative to Transformers and state-space models.
  Keywords: logic-based derivation of neural architectures, intuitionistic implicational logic, token-as-operator neural models, state-space models, alternatives to transformer-based foundational models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models can generate fluent peer reviews, yet their assessments often lack sufficient critical rigor when substantive issues are subtle and distributed across a paper. In this paper, we introduce PaperAudit-Bench, which consists of two components: (1) PaperAudit-Dataset, an error dataset covering both errors identifiable within individual sections and those requiring cross-section reasoning, designed for controlled evaluation under long-context settings; and (2) PaperAudit-Review, an automated review framework that integrates structured error detection with evidence-aware review generation to support critical assessment. Experiments on PaperAudit-Bench reveal large variability in error detectability across models and detection depths, highlighting the difficulty of identifying such errors under long-context settings. Relative to representative automated reviewing baselines, incorporating explicit error detection into the review workflow produces systematically stricter and more discriminative evaluations, demonstrating its suitability for peer review. Finally, we show that the dataset supports training lightweight LLM detectors via SFT and RL, enabling effective error detection at reduced computational cost.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Strategic planning is critical for multi-step reasoning, yet compact Large Language Models (LLMs) often lack the capacity to formulate global strategies, leading to error propagation in long-horizon tasks. Our analysis reveals that LLMs possess latent reasoning capabilities that can be unlocked when conditioned on explicit plans from a teacher model; however, runtime reliance on external guidance is often impractical due to latency and availability constraints. To bridge this gap, we propose PILOT (Planning via Internalized Latent Optimization Trajectories), a non-invasive framework designed to internalize the strategic oversight of large models into intrinsic Latent Guidance. Instead of altering backbone weights, PILOT employs a lightweight Hyper-Network to synthesize a query-conditioned Latent Guidance vector. This vector acts as an internal steering mechanism, guiding the model's representations toward optimal reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on mathematical and coding benchmarks demonstrate that PILOT effectively stabilizes reasoning trajectories, consistently outperforming strong baselines (e.g., +8.9% on MATH500) with negligible inference latency.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs), i.e., the tendency to generate plausible but non-factual content, pose a significant challenge for their reliable deployment in high-stakes environments. However, existing hallucination detection methods generally operate under unrealistic assumptions, i.e., either requiring expensive intensive sampling strategies for consistency checks or white-box LLM states, which are unavailable or inefficient in common API-based scenarios. To this end, we propose a novel efficient zero-shot metric called Lowest Span Confidence (LSC) for hallucination detection under minimal resource assumptions, only requiring a single forward with output probabilities. Concretely, LSC evaluates the joint likelihood of semantically coherent spans via a sliding window mechanism. By identifying regions of lowest marginal confidence across variable-length n-grams, LSC could well capture local uncertainty patterns strongly correlated with factual inconsistency. Importantly, LSC can mitigate the dilution effect of perplexity and the noise sensitivity of minimum token probability, offering a more robust estimate of factual uncertainty. Extensive experiments across multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs and diverse benchmarks show that LSC consistently outperforms existing zero-shot baselines, delivering strong detection performance even under resource-constrained conditions.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is one of the most effective methods for model compression. Previous studies have focused on the student model effectively training the predictive distribution of the teacher model. However, during training, the student model may inherit the shortcomings of the teacher model, which can lead to a decline in generalization capacity. To mitigate this issue, we propose adaptive self-knowledge distillation (ASKD), which dynamically reduces the dependence of the teacher model to improve the self-training capacity, and performs the self-knowledge distillation method to improve the generalization capacity of the student model. We further distill the Whisper model into a smaller variant, called FastWhisper. In our post-training setting, FastWhisper achieved a word error rate of 1.07% lower than the teacher model Whisper, and its relative inference time was 5 times faster.

Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) is widely used to improve large language model (LLM) performance through test-time scaling, yet recent work shows that vanilla MAD often underperforms simple majority vote despite higher computational cost. Studies show that, under homogeneous agents and uniform belief updates, debate preserves expected correctness and therefore cannot reliably improve outcomes. Drawing on findings from human deliberation and collective decision-making, we identify two key mechanisms missing from vanilla MAD: (i) diversity of initial viewpoints and (ii) explicit, calibrated confidence communication. We propose two lightweight interventions. First, a diversity-aware initialisation that selects a more diverse pool of candidate answers, increasing the likelihood that a correct hypothesis is present at the start of debate. Second, a confidence-modulated debate protocol in which agents express calibrated confidence and condition their updates on others' confidence. We show theoretically that diversity-aware initialisation improves the prior probability of MAD success without changing the underlying update dynamics, while confidence-modulated updates enable debate to systematically drift to the correct hypothesis. Empirically, across six reasoning-oriented QA benchmarks, our methods consistently outperform vanilla MAD and majority vote. Our results connect human deliberation with LLM-based debate and demonstrate that simple, principled modifications can substantially enhance debate effectiveness.

Abstract: Supportive conversation depends on skills that go beyond language fluency, including reading emotions, adjusting tone, and navigating moments of resistance, frustration, or distress. Despite rapid progress in language models, we still lack a clear way to understand how their abilities in these interpersonal domains compare to those of humans. We introduce HEART, the first-ever framework that directly compares humans and LLMs on the same multi-turn emotional-support conversations. For each dialogue history, we pair human and model responses and evaluate them through blinded human raters and an ensemble of LLM-as-judge evaluators. All assessments follow a rubric grounded in interpersonal communication science across five dimensions: Human Alignment, Empathic Responsiveness, Attunement, Resonance, and Task-Following. HEART uncovers striking behavioral patterns. Several frontier models approach or surpass the average human responses in perceived empathy and consistency. At the same time, humans maintain advantages in adaptive reframing, tension-naming, and nuanced tone shifts, particularly in adversarial turns. Human and LLM-as-judge preferences align on about 80 percent of pairwise comparisons, matching inter-human agreement, and their written rationales emphasize similar HEART dimensions. This pattern suggests an emerging convergence in the criteria used to assess supportive quality. By placing humans and models on equal footing, HEART reframes supportive dialogue as a distinct capability axis, separable from general reasoning or linguistic fluency. It provides a unified empirical foundation for understanding where model-generated support aligns with human social judgment, where it diverges, and how affective conversational competence scales with model size.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve into autonomous agents, the capability to faithfully translate natural language into rigorous structured formats-essential for tool invocation-and to convert complex tabular information into machine-readable specifications has become paramount. However, current evaluations lack effective methodologies to measure this structural fidelity without costly human intervention, as traditional text metrics fail to detect semantic drift in code-like outputs. This paper proposes Table-BiEval, a novel approach based on a human-free, self-supervised evaluation framework, to assess LLMs performance quantitatively. By leveraging deterministic Intermediate Representations, our framework calculates Content Semantic Accuracy and Normalized Tree Edit Distance to decouple structure from content. Also, it empirically evaluates 15 state-of-the-art LLMs across dual topological dimensions-hierarchical structures and flat tables. The results reveal substantial variability, highlighting that mid-sized models can surprisingly outperform larger counterparts in structural efficiency and confirming that deep recursive nesting remains a universal bottleneck for current architectures.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive progress in optimization modeling, fostering a rapid expansion of new methodologies and evaluation benchmarks. However, the boundaries of their capabilities in automated formulation and problem solving remain poorly understood, particularly when extending to complex, real-world tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose OPT-ENGINE, an extensible benchmark framework designed to evaluate LLMs on optimization modeling with controllable and scalable difficulty levels. OPT-ENGINE spans 10 canonical tasks across operations research, with five Linear Programming and five Mixed-Integer Programming. Utilizing OPT-ENGINE, we conduct an extensive study of LLMs' reasoning capabilities, addressing two critical questions: 1.) Do LLMs' performance remain robust when generalizing to out-of-distribution optimization tasks that scale in complexity beyond current benchmark levels? and 2.) At what stage, from problem interpretation to solution generation, do current LLMs encounter the most significant bottlenecks? Our empirical results yield two key insights: first, tool-integrated reasoning with external solvers exhibits significantly higher robustness as task complexity escalates, while pure-text reasoning reaches a ceiling; second, the automated formulation of constraints constitutes the primary performance bottleneck. These findings provide actionable guidance for developing next-generation LLMs for advanced optimization. Our code is publicly available at \textcolor{blue}{https://github.com/Cardinal-Operations/OPTEngine}.

Abstract: Introduction: Large language models (LLMs) can process requests and generate texts, but their feasibility for assessing complex academic content needs further investigation. To explore LLM's potential in assisting scientific review, this study examined ChatGPT-5, Gemini-3-Pro, and Claude-Sonnet-4.5's consistency and reliability in evaluating abstracts compared to one another and to human reviewers. Methods: 160 abstracts from a local conference were graded by human reviewers and three LLMs using one rubric. Composite score distributions across three LLMs and fourteen reviewers were examined. Inter-rater reliability was calculated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for within-AI reliability and AI-human concordance. Bland-Altman plots were examined for visual agreement patterns and systematic bias. Results: LLMs achieved good-to-excellent agreement with each other (ICCs: 0.59-0.87). ChatGPT and Claude reached moderate agreement with human reviewers on overall quality and content-specific criteria, with ICCs ~.45-.60 for composite, impression, clarity, objective, and results. They exhibited fair agreement on subjective dimensions, with ICC ranging from 0.23-0.38 for impact, engagement, and applicability. Gemini showed fair agreement on half criteria and no reliability on impact and applicability. Three LLMs showed acceptable or negligible mean difference (ChatGPT=0.24, Gemini=0.42, Claude=-0.02) from the human mean composite scores. Discussion: LLMs could process abstracts in batches with moderate agreement with human experts on overall quality and objective criteria. With appropriate process architecture, they can apply a rubric consistently across volumes of abstracts exceeding feasibility for a human rater. The weaker performance on subjective dimensions indicates that AI should serve a complementary role in evaluation, while human expertise remains essential.

Abstract: We present a systematic review of 337 articles evaluating the syntactic abilities of Transformer-based language models, reporting on 1,015 model results from a range of syntactic phenomena and interpretability methods. Our analysis shows that the state of the art presents a healthy variety of methods and data, but an over-focus on a single language (English), a single model (BERT), and phenomena that are easy to get at (like part of speech and agreement). Results also suggest that TLMs capture these form-oriented phenomena well, but show more variable and weaker performance on phenomena at the syntax-semantics interface, like binding or filler-gap dependencies. We provide recommendations for future work, in particular reporting complete data, better aligning theoretical constructs and methods across studies, increasing the use of mechanistic methods, and broadening the empirical scope regarding languages and linguistic phenomena.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs)-based question answering (QA) systems play a critical role in modern AI, demonstrating strong performance across various tasks. However, LLM-generated responses often suffer from hallucinations, unfaithful statements lacking reliable references. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks enhance LLM responses by incorporating external references but also introduce new forms of hallucination due to complex interactions between the retriever and generator. To address these challenges, researchers have explored attribution-based techniques that ensure responses are verifiably supported by retrieved content. Despite progress, a unified pipeline for these techniques, along with a clear taxonomy and systematic comparison of their strengths and weaknesses, remains lacking. A well-defined taxonomy is essential for identifying specific failure modes within RAG systems, while comparative analysis helps practitioners choose appropriate solutions based on hallucination types and application context. This survey investigates how attribution-based techniques are used within RAG systems to mitigate hallucinations and addresses the gap by: (i) outlining a taxonomy of hallucination types in RAG systems, (ii) presenting a unified pipeline for attribution techniques, (iii) reviewing techniques based on the hallucinations they target, and (iv) discussing strengths and weaknesses with practical guidelines. This work offers insights for future research and practical use of attribution techniques in RAG systems.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has catalyzed the emergence of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) that have pushed reasoning capabilities to new heights. While their performance has garnered significant excitement, exploring the internal mechanisms driving these behaviors has become an equally critical research frontier. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the mechanistic understanding of LRMs, organizing recent findings into three core dimensions: 1) training dynamics, 2) reasoning mechanisms, and 3) unintended behaviors. By synthesizing these insights, we aim to bridge the gap between black-box performance and mechanistic transparency. Finally, we discuss under-explored challenges to outline a roadmap for future mechanistic studies, including the need for applied interpretability, improved methodologies, and a unified theoretical framework.

Abstract: We present a hybrid neuro-symbolic system for the SemEval-2026 Task 4 on Narrative Story Similarity. Our approach combines neural self-consistency voting with a novel Multi-Scale Narrative Analysis Ensemble that operates as a symbolic tiebreaker. The neural network component uses a large language model with multiple parallel votes, applying a supermajority threshold for confident decisions and escalating uncertain cases to additional voting rounds. When votes result in a perfect tie, a symbolic ensemble combining five narrative similarity signals (lexical overlap, semantic embeddings, story grammar structure, event chain alignment, and narrative tension curves) provides the final decision. Our cascade architecture achieves 81% accuracy on the development set, demonstrating that selective deferral to symbolic methods can enhance neural predictions on genuinely ambiguous narrative comparisons.

Abstract: Coded language is an important part of human communication. It refers to cases where users intentionally encode meaning so that the surface text differs from the intended meaning and must be decoded to be understood. Current language models handle coded language poorly. Progress has been limited by the lack of real-world datasets and clear taxonomies. This paper introduces CodedLang, a dataset of 7,744 Chinese Google Maps reviews, including 900 reviews with span-level annotations of coded language. We developed a seven-class taxonomy that captures common encoding strategies, including phonetic, orthographic, and cross-lingual substitutions. We benchmarked language models on coded language detection, classification, and review rating prediction. Results show that even strong models can fail to identify or understand coded language. Because many coded expressions rely on pronunciation-based strategies, we further conducted a phonetic analysis of coded and decoded forms. Together, our results highlight coded language as an important and underexplored challenge for real-world NLP systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Non-Resolution Reasoning (NRR) provides a formal framework for maintaining semantic ambiguity rather than forcing premature interpretation collapse. While the foundational architecture establishes state spaces and operators for ambiguity-preserving computation, the critical question of how natural language maps to these mathematical structures remains open. This paper introduces the text-to-state mapping function φ that transforms linguistic input into superposition states within the NRR framework. We formalize the Contradiction-Preservation Principle, which requires that genuinely ambiguous expressions maintain non-zero entropy in their state representations, and develop extraction protocols using existing Large Language Models as interpretation generators. Empirical validation across 68 test sentences spanning lexical, structural, and pragmatic ambiguity demonstrates that our mapping achieves mean Shannon entropy H(S) = 1.087 bits for ambiguous inputs while baseline single-interpretation approaches yield H(S) = 0.000. The framework provides the missing algorithmic bridge between raw text and the formal state spaces on which NRR operators act, enabling architectural collapse deferment in language model inference.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used for tasks ranging from summarisation to decision support. In practice, identical prompts do not always produce identical outputs, even when temperature and other decoding parameters are fixed. In this work, we conduct repeated-run experiments to empirically quantify baseline behavioural drift, defined as output variability observed when the same prompt is issued multiple times under operator-free conditions. We evaluate two publicly accessible models, gpt-4o-mini and llama3.1-8b, across five prompt categories using exact repeats, perturbed inputs, and reuse modes at temperatures of 0.0 and 0.7. Drift is measured using unique output fractions, lexical similarity, and word count statistics, enabling direct comparison across models, prompting modes, and deployment types. The results show that nondeterminism persists even at temperature 0.0, with distinct variability patterns by model size, deployment, and prompt type. We situate these findings within existing work on concept drift, behavioural drift, and infrastructure-induced nondeterminism, discuss the limitations of lexical metrics, and highlight emerging semantic approaches. By establishing a systematic empirical baseline in the absence of stabilisation techniques, this study provides a reference point for evaluating future drift mitigation and control methods.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly deployed for complex, tool-based tasks where long-term memory is critical to driving actions. Existing benchmarks, however, primarily test a angent's ability to passively retrieve isolated facts in response to explicit questions. They fail to evaluate the more crucial capability of actively applying memory to execute tasks. To address this gap, we introduce \textsc{Mem2ActBench}, a benchmark for evaluating whether agents can proactively leverage long-term memory to execute tool-based actions by selecting appropriate tools and grounding their parameters. The benchmark simulates persistent assistant usage, where users mention the same topic across long, interrupted interactions and expect previously established preferences and task states to be implicitly applied. We build the dataset with an automated pipeline that merges heterogeneous sources (ToolACE, BFCL, Oasst1), resolves conflicts via consistency modeling, and synthesizes 2,029 sessions with 12 user--assistant--tool turns on average. From these memory chains, a reverse-generation method produces 400 tool-use tasks, with human evaluation confirming 91.3\% are strongly memory-dependent. Experiments on seven memory frameworks show that current systems remain inadequate at actively utilizing memory for parameter grounding, highlighting the need for more effective approaches to evaluate and improve memory application in task execution.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) offers significant potential to reduce the workload of medical personnel, for example, through the automation of documentation tasks. While numerous benchmarks exist for the English language, specific evaluations for the German-speaking medical context are still lacking, particularly regarding the inclusion of dialects. In this article, we present a curated dataset of simulated doctor-patient conversations and evaluate a total of 29 different ASR models. The test field encompasses both open-weights models from the Whisper, Voxtral, and Wav2Vec2 families as well as commercial state-of-the-art APIs (AssemblyAI, Deepgram). For evaluation, we utilize three different metrics (WER, CER, BLEU) and provide an outlook on qualitative semantic analysis. The results demonstrate significant performance differences between the models: while the best systems already achieve very good Word Error Rates (WER) of partly below 3%, the error rates of other models, especially concerning medical terminology or dialect-influenced variations, are considerably higher.

Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models has enabled the generation of text that closely resembles human writing, creating challenges for authenticity verification in education, publishing, and digital security. Detecting AI-generated text has therefore become a crucial technical and ethical issue. This paper presents a comprehensive study of AI-generated text detection based on large-scale corpora and novel training strategies. We introduce a 1-billion-token corpus of human-authored texts spanning multiple genres and a 1.9-billion-token corpus of AI-generated texts produced by prompting a variety of LLMs across diverse domains. Using these resources, we develop and evaluate numerous detection models and propose two novel training paradigms: Per LLM and Per LLM family fine-tuning. Across a 100-million-token benchmark covering 21 large language models, our best fine-tuned detector achieves up to $99.6\%$ token-level accuracy, substantially outperforming existing open-source baselines.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong generative capabilities but remain vulnerable to confabulations, fluent yet unreliable outputs that vary arbitrarily even under identical prompts. Leveraging a quantum tensor network based pipeline, we propose a quantum physics inspired uncertainty quantification framework that accounts for aleatoric uncertainty in token sequence probability for semantic equivalence based clustering of LLM generations. This offers a principled and interpretable scheme for hallucination detection. We further introduce an entropy maximization strategy that prioritizes high certainty, semantically coherent outputs and highlights entropy regions where LLM decisions are likely to be unreliable, offering practical guidelines for when human oversight is warranted. We evaluate the robustness of our scheme under different generation lengths and quantization levels, dimensions overlooked in prior studies, demonstrating that our approach remains reliable even in resource constrained deployments. A total of 116 experiments on TriviaQA, NQ, SVAMP, and SQuAD across multiple architectures including Mistral-7B, Mistral-7B-instruct, Falcon-rw-1b, LLaMA-3.2-1b, LLaMA-2-13b-chat, LLaMA-2-7b-chat, LLaMA-2-13b, and LLaMA-2-7b show consistent improvements in AUROC and AURAC over state of the art baselines.

Abstract: Health influencers play a growing role in shaping public beliefs, yet their content is often conveyed through conversational narratives and rhetorical strategies rather than explicit factual claims. As a result, claim-centric verification methods struggle to capture the pragmatic meaning of influencer discourse. In this paper, we propose TAIGR (Takeaway Argumentation Inference with Grounded References), a structured framework designed to analyze influencer discourse, which operates in three stages: (1) identifying the core influencer recommendation--takeaway; (2) constructing an argumentation graph that captures influencer justification for the takeaway; (3) performing factor graph-based probabilistic inference to validate the takeaway. We evaluate TAIGR on a content validation task over influencer video transcripts on health, showing that accurate validation requires modeling the discourse's pragmatic and argumentative structure rather than treating transcripts as flat collections of claims.

Abstract: Engineering sustainable and equitable healthcare requires medical language models that do not change clinically correct diagnoses when presented with non-decisive cultural information. We introduce a counterfactual benchmark that expands 150 MedQA test items into 1650 variants by inserting culture-related (i) identifier tokens, (ii) contextual cues, or (iii) their combination for three groups (Indigenous Canadian, Middle-Eastern Muslim, Southeast Asian), plus a length-matched neutral control, where a clinician verified that the gold answer remains invariant in all variants. We evaluate GPT-5.2, Llama-3.1-8B, DeepSeek-R1, and MedGemma (4B/27B) under option-only and brief-explanation prompting. Across models, cultural cues significantly affect accuracy (Cochran's Q, $p<10^-14$), with the largest degradation when identifier and context co-occur (up to 3-7 percentage points under option-only prompting), while neutral edits produce smaller, non-systematic changes. A human-validated rubric ($κ=0.76$) applied via an LLM-as-judge shows that more than half of culturally grounded explanations end in an incorrect answer, linking culture-referential reasoning to diagnostic failure. We release prompts and augmentations to support evaluation and mitigation of culturally induced diagnostic errors.

Abstract: Figurative language, particularly fixed figurative expressions (FFEs) such as idioms and proverbs, poses persistent challenges for large language models (LLMs). Unlike literal phrases, FFEs are culturally grounded, largely non-compositional, and conventionally fixed, making them especially vulnerable to figurative hallucination. We define figurative hallucination as the generation or endorsement of expressions that sound idiomatic and plausible but do not exist as authentic figurative expressions in the target language. We introduce FFEHallu, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating figurative hallucination in LLMs, with a focus on Persian, a linguistically rich yet underrepresented language. FFEHallu consists of 600 carefully curated instances spanning three complementary tasks: (i) FFE generation from meaning, (ii) detection of fabricated FFEs across four controlled construction categories, and (iii) FFE to FFE translation from English to Persian. Evaluating six state of the art multilingual LLMs, we find systematic weaknesses in figurative competence and cultural grounding. While models such as GPT4.1 demonstrate relatively strong performance in rejecting fabricated FFEs and retrieving authentic ones, most models struggle to reliably distinguish real expressions from high quality fabrications and frequently hallucinate during cross lingual translation. These findings reveal substantial gaps in current LLMs handling of figurative language and underscore the need for targeted benchmarks to assess and mitigate figurative hallucination.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce hallucinated or unverifiable content, undermining their reliability in factual domains. This work investigates Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) as a training paradigm that explicitly rewards abstention ("I don't know") alongside correctness to promote intellectual humility. We fine-tune and evaluate Granite-3.3-2B-Instruct and Qwen-3-4B-Instruct on the MedMCQA and Hendrycks Math benchmarks using a ternary reward structure ($-1$, r_abs, 1) under varying abstention reward structures. We further study the effect of combining RLVR with supervised fine-tuning strategies that teach abstention prior to reinforcement learning. Our results show that moderate abstention rewards (r_abs $\approx -0.25$ to 0.3) consistently reduce incorrect responses without severe accuracy degradation on multiple-choice tasks, with larger models exhibiting greater robustness to abstention incentives. On open-ended question answering, we observe limitations due to insufficient exploration, which can be partially mitigated through supervised abstention training. Overall, these findings demonstrate the feasibility and flexibility of verifiable reward design as a practical approach for hallucination mitigation in language models. Reproducible code for our abstention training framework is available here https://github.com/Mystic-Slice/rl-abstention.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis for the Bengali language has attracted increasing research interest in recent years. However, progress remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale and diverse annotated datasets. Although several Bengali sentiment and hate speech datasets are publicly available, most are limited in size or confined to a single domain, such as social media comments. Consequently, these resources are often insufficient for training modern deep learning based models, which require large volumes of heterogeneous data to learn robust and generalizable representations. In this work, we introduce BengaliSent140, a large-scale Bengali binary sentiment dataset constructed by consolidating seven existing Bengali text datasets into a unified corpus. To ensure consistency across sources, heterogeneous annotation schemes are systematically harmonized into a binary sentiment formulation with two classes: Not Hate (0) and Hate (1). The resulting dataset comprises 139,792 unique text samples, including 68,548 hate and 71,244 not-hate instances, yielding a relatively balanced class distribution. By integrating data from multiple sources and domains, BengaliSent140 offers broader linguistic and contextual coverage than existing Bengali sentiment datasets and provides a strong foundation for training and benchmarking deep learning models. Baseline experimental results are also reported to demonstrate the practical usability of the dataset. The dataset is publicly available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akifislam/bengalisent140/

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) models have achieved impressive results across many speech tasks, yet child automatic speech recognition (ASR) remains challenging due to limited data and pretraining domain mismatch. Fine-tuning SSL models on child speech induces shifts in the representation space. We hypothesize that delta SSL embeddings, defined as the differences between embeddings from a finetuned model and those from its pretrained counterpart, encode task-specific information that complements finetuned features from another SSL model. We evaluate multiple fusion strategies on the MyST childrens corpus using different models. Results show that delta embedding fusion with WavLM yields up to a 10 percent relative WER reduction for HuBERT and a 4.4 percent reduction for W2V2, compared to finetuned embedding fusion. Notably, fusing WavLM with delta W2V2 embeddings achieves a WER of 9.64, setting a new state of the art among SSL models on the MyST corpus. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of delta embeddings and highlight feature fusion as a promising direction for advancing child ASR.

Abstract: Tool-calling agents are increasingly deployed in real-world customer-facing workflows. Yet most studies on tool-calling agents focus on idealized settings with general, fixed, and well-specified tasks. In real-world applications, user requests are often (1) ambiguous, (2) changing over time, or (3) infeasible due to policy constraints, and training and evaluation data that cover these diverse, complex interaction patterns remain under-represented. To bridge the gap, we present Trajectory2Task, a verifiable data generation pipeline for studying tool use at scale under three realistic user scenarios: ambiguous intent, changing intent, and infeasible intents. The pipeline first conducts multi-turn exploration to produce valid tool-call trajectories. It then converts these trajectories into user-facing tasks with controlled intent adaptations. This process yields verifiable task that support closed-loop evaluation and training. We benchmark seven state-of-the-art LLMs on the generated complex user scenario tasks and observe frequent failures. Finally, using successful trajectories obtained from task rollouts, we fine-tune lightweight LLMs and find consistent improvements across all three conditions, along with better generalization to unseen tool-use domains, indicating stronger general tool-calling ability.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based mobile agents have made significant performance advancements. However, these agents often follow explicit user instructions while overlooking personalized needs, leading to significant limitations for real users, particularly without personalized context: (1) inability to interpret ambiguous instructions, (2) lack of learning from user interaction history, and (3) failure to handle personalized instructions. To alleviate the above challenges, we propose Me-Agent, a learnable and memorable personalized mobile agent. Specifically, Me-Agent incorporates a two-level user habit learning approach. At the prompt level, we design a user preference learning strategy enhanced with a Personal Reward Model to improve personalization performance. At the memory level, we design a Hierarchical Preference Memory, which stores users' long-term memory and app-specific memory in different level memory. To validate the personalization capabilities of mobile agents, we introduce User FingerTip, a new benchmark featuring numerous ambiguous instructions for daily life. Extensive experiments on User FingerTip and general benchmarks demonstrate that Me-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance in personalization while maintaining competitive instruction execution performance.

Abstract: X-Codec-2.0 has shown strong performance in neural audio compression and multilingual speech modeling, operating at a 50 Hz latent rate and a 16 kHz sampling rate using frozen HuBERT features. While effective, this configuration limits temporal efficiency and audio fidelity. In this work, we explore a simple and effective modification by introducing additional pooling and increasing the decoder hop size. This reduces the latent rate from 50 Hz to 25 Hz and simultaneously raises the output sampling rate from 16 kHz to 24 kHz, improving efficiency and perceptual quality without altering the core architecture. Evaluated on the multilingual Common Voice 17 test set, the proposed configuration achieves a 0.29 MOS improvement over the original X-Codec-2.0 baseline based on UTMOSv2, and attains the best reported performance among all codecs operating at 25 Hz. The source code, checkpoints, and generation comparisons are released at \href{https://huggingface.co/Scicom-intl/xcodec2-25TPS-24k}{https://huggingface.co/Scicom-intl/xcodec2-25TPS-24k}.

Abstract: Full-duplex voice interaction is crucial for natural human computer interaction. We present a framework that decomposes complex dialogue into minimal conversational units, enabling the system to process each unit independently and predict when to transit to the next. This framework is instantiated as a semi-cascaded full-duplex dialogue system built around a multimodal large language model, supported by auxiliary modules such as voice activity detection (VAD) and text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. The resulting system operates in a train-free, plug-and-play manner. Experiments on the HumDial dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, which ranks second among all teams on the test set of the Human-like Spoken Dialogue Systems Challenge (Track 2: Full-Duplex Interaction).

Abstract: Open-ended question answering (QA) evaluates a model's ability to perform contextualized reasoning beyond factual recall. This challenge is especially acute in practice-based domains, where knowledge is procedural and grounded in professional judgment, while most existing LLM benchmarks depend on pre-existing human exam datasets that are often unavailable in such settings. We introduce a framework for automated benchmark generation from expert-authored guidelines informed by Bloom's Taxonomy. It converts expert practices into implicit violation-based scenarios and expands them into auto-graded multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and multi-turn dialogues across four cognitive levels, enabling deterministic, reproducible, and scalable evaluation. Applied to three applied domains: teaching, dietetics, and caregiving, we find differences between model and human-like reasoning: LLMs sometimes perform relatively better on higher-order reasoning (Analyze) but fail more frequently on lower-level items (Remember). We produce large-scale, psychometrically informed benchmarks that surface these non-intuitive model behaviors and enable evaluation of contextualized reasoning in real-world settings.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Online hate on social media ranges from overt slurs and threats (\emph{hard hate speech}) to \emph{soft hate speech}: discourse that appears reasonable on the surface but uses framing and value-based arguments to steer audiences toward blaming or excluding a target group. We hypothesize that current moderation systems, largely optimized for surface toxicity cues, are not robust to this reasoning-driven hostility, yet existing benchmarks do not measure this gap systematically. We introduce \textbf{\textsc{SoftHateBench}}, a generative benchmark that produces soft-hate variants while preserving the underlying hostile standpoint. To generate soft hate, we integrate the \emph{Argumentum Model of Topics} (AMT) and \emph{Relevance Theory} (RT) in a unified framework: AMT provides the backbone argument structure for rewriting an explicit hateful standpoint into a seemingly neutral discussion while preserving the stance, and RT guides generation to keep the AMT chain logically coherent. The benchmark spans \textbf{7} sociocultural domains and \textbf{28} target groups, comprising \textbf{4,745} soft-hate instances. Evaluations across encoder-based detectors, general-purpose LLMs, and safety models show a consistent drop from hard to soft tiers: systems that detect explicit hostility often fail when the same stance is conveyed through subtle, reasoning-based language. \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Disclaimer.} Contains offensive examples used solely for research.}

Abstract: Defining psycholinguistic characteristics in written texts is a task gaining increasing attention from researchers. One of the most widely used tools in the current field is Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) that originally was developed to analyze English texts and translated into multiple languages. Our approach offers the adaptation of LIWC methodology for the Russian language, considering its grammatical and cultural specificities. The suggested approach comprises 96 categories, integrating syntactic, morphological, lexical, general statistical features, and results of predictions obtained using pre-trained language models (LMs) for text analysis. Rather than applying direct translation to existing thesauri, we built the dictionary specifically for the Russian language based on the content from several lexicographic resources, semantic dictionaries and corpora. The paper describes the process of mapping lemmas to 42 psycholinguistic categories and the implementation of the analyzer as part of RusLICA web service.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Long-context LLM agents must access the right evidence from large environments and use it faithfully. However, the popular Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH) evaluation mostly measures benign span localization. The needle is near-unique, and the haystack is largely irrelevant. We introduce EverMemBench-S (EMB-S), an adversarial NIAH-style benchmark built on a 326M-token MemoryBank. While the full MemoryBank spans 326M tokens for retrieval-based (RAG) evaluation, we evaluate native long-context models only at scales that fit within each model's context window (up to 1M tokens in this work) to ensure a fair comparison. EMB-S pairs queries with collision-tested near-miss hard negatives and gold evidence sets spanning one or more documents, validated via human screening and LLM verification. We also propose a decoupled diagnostic protocol that reports evidence access (document-ID localization) separately from end-to-end QA quality under full-context prompting. This enables consistent diagnosis for both native long-context prompting and retrieval pipelines. Across a reference-corpus ladder from domain-isolated 64K contexts to a globally shared 326M-token environment, we observe a clear reality gap. Systems that saturate benign NIAH degrade sharply in evidence access under semantic interference. These results indicate that semantic discrimination, not context length alone, is the dominant bottleneck for long-context memory at scale.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has greatly advanced speech representation learning, but multilingual SSL models remain constrained to languages encountered during pretraining. Retraining from scratch to incorporate new languages is computationally expensive, while sequential training without migitation strategies often leads to catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose MiLorE-SSL, a lightweight framework that combines LoRA modules with a soft mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanism for efficient continual multilingual training. LoRA provides efficient low-rank adaptation, while soft MoE promotes flexible expert sharing across languages, reducing cross-lingual interference. To further mitigate forgetting, we introduce limited replay data from existing languages, avoiding reliance on large historical corpora. Experiments on ML-SUPERB demonstrate that MiLorE-SSL achieves strong performance in new languages and improves the ability in existing ones with only 2.14% trainable parameters.

Abstract: Existing self-evolution methods overlook the influence of fine-grained reasoning steps, which leads to the reasoner-verifier gap. The computational inefficiency of Monte Carlo (MC) process supervision further exacerbates the difficulty in mitigating the gap. Motivated by the Error-Related Negativity (ERN), which the reasoner can localize error following incorrect decisions, guiding rapid adjustments, we propose a Self-Adaptive Process Optimization (SAPO) method for self-improvement in Small Language Models (SLMs). SAPO adaptively and efficiently introduces process supervision signals by actively minimizing the reasoner-verifier gap rather than relying on inefficient MC estimations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms most existing self-evolution methods on two challenging task types: mathematics and code. Additionally, to further investigate SAPO's impact on verifier performance, this work introduces two new benchmarks for process reward models in both mathematical and coding tasks.

Abstract: KV caches, typically used only to speed up autoregressive decoding, encode contextual information that can be reused for downstream tasks at no extra cost. We propose treating the KV cache as a lightweight representation, eliminating the need to recompute or store full hidden states. Despite being weaker than dedicated embeddings, KV-derived representations are shown to be sufficient for two key applications: \textbf{(i) Chain-of-Embedding}, where they achieve competitive or superior performance on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen2-7B-Instruct; and \textbf{(ii) Fast/Slow Thinking Switching}, where they enable adaptive reasoning on Qwen3-8B and DeepSeek-R1-Distil-Qwen-14B, reducing token generation by up to $5.7\times$ with minimal accuracy loss. Our findings establish KV caches as a free, effective substrate for sampling and reasoning, opening new directions for representation reuse in LLM inference.

Abstract: Automatic evaluation is crucial yet challenging for open-ended natural language generation, especially when rule-based metrics are infeasible. Compared with traditional methods, the recent LLM-as-a-Judge paradigms enable better and more flexible evaluation, and show promise as generative reward models for reinforcement learning. However, prior work has revealed a notable gap between their seemingly impressive benchmark performance and actual effectiveness in RL practice. We attribute this issue to some limitations in existing studies, including the dominance of pairwise evaluation and inadequate optimization of evaluation criteria. Therefore, we propose CE-RM-4B, a pointwise generative reward model trained with a dedicated two-stage rollout method, and adopting unified query-based criteria.

Abstract: While large language models show promise in mental healthcare, evaluating their therapeutic competence remains challenging due to the unstructured and longitudinal nature of counseling. We argue that current evaluation paradigms suffer from an unanchored defect, leading to two forms of instability: process drift, where unsteered client simulation wanders away from specific counseling goals, and standard drift, where static pointwise scoring lacks the stability for reliable judgment. To address this, we introduce Ps, a unified framework that calibrates the therapeutic competence of LLMs via trajectory-anchored tournaments. We first anchor the interaction trajectory in simulation, where clients precisely control the fluid consultation process to probe multifaceted capabilities. We then anchor the battle trajectory in judgments through an efficient Swiss-system tournament, utilizing dynamic pairwise battles to yield robust Elo ratings. Beyond ranking, we demonstrate that tournament trajectories can be transformed into credible reward signals, enabling on-policy reinforcement learning to enhance LLMs' performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PsychePass and its strong consistency with human expert judgments.

Abstract: Recent advances in mobile Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents highlight the growing need for comprehensive evaluation benchmarks. While new online benchmarks offer more realistic testing than offline ones, they tend to focus on the agents' task instruction-following ability while neglecting their reasoning and exploration ability. Moreover, these benchmarks do not consider the random noise in real-world mobile environments. This leads to a gap between benchmarks and real-world environments. To addressing these limitations, we propose MobileBench-OL, an online benchmark with 1080 tasks from 80 Chinese apps. It measures task execution, complex reasoning, and noise robustness of agents by including 5 subsets, which set multiple evaluation dimensions. We also provide an auto-eval framework with a reset mechanism, enabling stable and repeatable real-world benchmarking. Evaluating 12 leading GUI agents on MobileBench-OL shows significant room for improvement to meet real-world requirements. Human evaluation further confirms that MobileBench-OL can reliably measure the performance of leading GUI agents in real environments. Our data and code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: This study applies Large Language Models (LLMs) to two foundational Electronic Health Record (EHR) data science tasks: structured data querying (using programmatic languages, Python/Pandas) and information extraction from unstructured clinical text via a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. We test the ability of LLMs to interact accurately with large structured datasets for analytics and the reliability of LLMs in extracting semantically correct information from free text health records when supported by RAG. To this end, we presented a flexible evaluation framework that automatically generates synthetic question and answer pairs tailored to the characteristics of each dataset or task. Experiments were conducted on a curated subset of MIMIC III, (four structured tables and one clinical note type), using a mix of locally hosted and API-based LLMs. Evaluation combined exact-match metrics, semantic similarity, and human judgment. Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs to support precise querying and accurate information extraction in clinical workflows.

Abstract: This paper examines how Large Language Models (LLMs) reproduce societal norms, particularly heterocisnormativity, and how these norms translate into measurable biases in their text generations. We investigate whether explicit information about a subject's gender or sexuality influences LLM responses across three subject categories: queer-marked, non-queer-marked, and the normalized "unmarked" category. Representational imbalances are operationalized as measurable differences in English sentence completions across four dimensions: sentiment, regard, toxicity, and prediction diversity. Our findings show that Masked Language Models (MLMs) produce the least favorable sentiment, higher toxicity, and more negative regard for queer-marked subjects. Autoregressive Language Models (ARLMs) partially mitigate these patterns, while closed-access ARLMs tend to produce more harmful outputs for unmarked subjects. Results suggest that LLMs reproduce normative social assumptions, though the form and degree of bias depend strongly on specific model characteristics, which may redistribute, but not eliminate, representational harms.

Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to use external tools unlocks powerful real-world interactions, making rigorous evaluation essential. However, current benchmarks primarily report final accuracy, revealing what models can do but obscuring the cognitive bottlenecks that define their true capability boundaries. To move from simple performance scoring to a diagnostic tool, we introduce a framework grounded in Cognitive Load Theory. Our framework deconstructs task complexity into two quantifiable components: Intrinsic Load, the inherent structural complexity of the solution path, formalized with a novel Tool Interaction Graph; and Extraneous Load, the difficulty arising from ambiguous task presentation. To enable controlled experiments, we construct ToolLoad-Bench, the first benchmark with parametrically adjustable cognitive load. Our evaluation reveals distinct performance cliffs as cognitive load increases, allowing us to precisely map each model's capability boundary. We validate that our framework's predictions are highly calibrated with empirical results, establishing a principled methodology for understanding an agent's limits and a practical foundation for building more efficient systems.

Abstract: Current speech LLMs bridge speech foundation models to LLMs using projection layers, training all of these components on speech instruction data. This strategy is computationally intensive and susceptible to task and prompt overfitting. We present SpeechMapper, a cost-efficient speech-to-LLM-embedding training approach that mitigates overfitting, enabling more robust and generalizable models. Our model is first pretrained without the LLM on inexpensive hardware, and then efficiently attached to the target LLM via a brief 1K-step instruction tuning (IT) stage. Through experiments on speech translation and spoken question answering, we demonstrate the versatility of SpeechMapper's pretrained block, presenting results for both task-agnostic IT, an ASR-based adaptation strategy that does not train in the target task, and task-specific IT. In task-agnostic settings, Speechmapper rivals the best instruction-following speech LLM from IWSLT25, despite never being trained on these tasks, while in task-specific settings, it outperforms this model across many datasets, despite requiring less data and compute. Overall, SpeechMapper offers a practical and scalable approach for efficient, generalizable speech-LLM integration without large-scale IT.

Abstract: Existing research often treats parliamentary discourse as a homogeneous whole, overlooking topic-specific patterns. Parliamentary speeches address a wide range of topics, some of which evoke stronger emotions than others. While everyone has intuitive assumptions about what the most emotive topics in a parliament may be, there has been little research into the emotions typically linked to different topics. This paper strives to fill this gap by examining emotion expression among the topics of parliamentary speeches delivered in Eduskunta, the Finnish Parliament, between 2000 and 2020. An emotion analysis model is used to investigate emotion expression in topics, from both synchronic and diachronic perspectives. The results strengthen evidence of increasing positivity in parliamentary speech and provide further insights into topic-specific emotion expression within parliamentary debate.

Abstract: Large Language Models show great potential with external tools, but face significant challenges in complex, multi-turn tool invocation. They often exhibit weak planning, tool hallucination, erroneous parameter generation, and struggle with robust interaction. To tackle these issues, we present PEARL, a novel framework to enhance LLM planning and execution for sophisticated tool use. PEARL adopts a two-stage approach: an offline phase where the agent explores tools to learn valid usage patterns and failure conditions, and an online reinforcement learning phase. In the online phase, a dedicated Planner is trained via group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a carefully designed reward function that provides distinct signals for planning quality. Experiments on the ToolHop and T-Eval benchmarks show PEARL significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a new state-of-the-art success rate of \textbf{56.5\%} on ToolHop while maintaining a low invocation error rate. Our work marks a key advance in addressing the complex planning challenges of tool use, contributing to the development of more robust and reliable LLM-based agents.

Abstract: The prevalence of sarcasm in multimodal dialogues on the social platforms presents a crucial yet challenging task for understanding the true intent behind online content. Comprehensive sarcasm analysis requires two key aspects: Multimodal Sarcasm Detection (MSD) and Multimodal Sarcasm Explanation (MuSE). Intuitively, the act of detection is the result of the reasoning process that explains the sarcasm. Current research predominantly focuses on addressing either MSD or MuSE as a single task. Even though some recent work has attempted to integrate these tasks, their inherent causal dependency is often overlooked. To bridge this gap, we propose MuVaC, a variational causal inference framework that mimics human cognitive mechanisms for understanding sarcasm, enabling robust multimodal feature learning to jointly optimize MSD and MuSE. Specifically, we first model MSD and MuSE from the perspective of structural causal models, establishing variational causal pathways to define the objectives for joint optimization. Next, we design an alignment-then-fusion approach to integrate multimodal features, providing robust fusion representations for sarcasm detection and explanation generation. Finally, we enhance the reasoning trustworthiness by ensuring consistency between detection results and explanations. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MuVaC in public datasets, offering a new perspective for understanding multimodal sarcasm.

Abstract: Language-model-based agents operating over extended interaction horizons face persistent challenges in preserving temporally grounded information and maintaining behavioral consistency across sessions, a failure mode we term soul erosion. We present BMAM (Brain-inspired Multi-Agent Memory), a general-purpose memory architecture that models agent memory as a set of functionally specialized subsystems rather than a single unstructured store. Inspired by cognitive memory systems, BMAM decomposes memory into episodic, semantic, salience-aware, and control-oriented components that operate at complementary time scales. To support long-horizon reasoning, BMAM organizes episodic memories along explicit timelines and retrieves evidence by fusing multiple complementary signals. Experiments on the LoCoMo benchmark show that BMAM achieves 78.45 percent accuracy under the standard long-horizon evaluation setting, and ablation analyses confirm that the hippocampus-inspired episodic memory subsystem plays a critical role in temporal reasoning.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has found a widespread use in computing education; at the same time, quality of generated materials raises concerns among educators and students. This study addresses this issue by introducing a novel method for diagram code generation with in-context examples based on the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST), which aims to improve diagram generation by aligning models' output with user expectations. Our approach is evaluated by computer science educators, who assessed 150 diagrams generated with large language models (LLMs) for logical organization, connectivity, layout aesthetic, and AI hallucination. The assessment dataset is additionally investigated for its utility in automated diagram evaluation. The preliminary results suggest that our method decreases the rate of factual hallucination and improves diagram faithfulness to provided context; however, due to LLMs' stochasticity, the quality of the generated diagrams varies. Additionally, we present an in-depth analysis and discussion on the connection between AI hallucination and the quality of generated diagrams, which reveals that text contexts of higher complexity lead to higher rates of hallucination and LLMs often fail to detect mistakes in their output.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in verbal creative tasks. However, previous assessments of the creative capabilities of LLMs remain weakly grounded in human creativity theory and are thus hard to interpret. The widely used Divergent Association Task (DAT) focuses on novelty, ignoring appropriateness, a core component of creativity. We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art LLMs on DAT and show that their scores on the task are lower than those of two baselines that do not possess any creative abilities, undermining its validity for model evaluation. Grounded in human creativity theory, which defines creativity as the combination of novelty and appropriateness, we introduce Conditional Divergent Association Task (CDAT). CDAT evaluates novelty conditional on contextual appropriateness, separating noise from creativity better than DAT, while remaining simple and objective. Under CDAT, smaller model families often show the most creativity, whereas advanced families favor appropriateness at lower novelty. We hypothesize that training and alignment likely shift models along this frontier, making outputs more appropriate but less creative. We release the dataset and code.

Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking in statistical mechanics primarily occurs during phase transitions at the thermodynamic limit where the Hamiltonian preserves inversion symmetry, yet the low-temperature free energy exhibits reduced symmetry. Herein, we demonstrate the emergence of spontaneous symmetry breaking in natural language processing (NLP) models during both pre-training and fine-tuning, even under deterministic dynamics and within a finite training architecture. This phenomenon occurs at the level of individual attention heads and is scaled-down to its small subset of nodes and also valid at a single-nodal level, where nodes acquire the capacity to learn a limited set of tokens after pre-training or labels after fine-tuning for a specific classification task. As the number of nodes increases, a crossover in learning ability occurs, governed by the tradeoff between a decrease following random-guess among increased possible outputs, and enhancement following nodal cooperation, which exceeds the sum of individual nodal capabilities. In contrast to spin-glass systems, where a microscopic state of frozen spins cannot be directly linked to the free-energy minimization goal, each nodal function in this framework contributes explicitly to the global network task and can be upper-bounded using convex hull analysis. Results are demonstrated using BERT-6 architecture pre-trained on Wikipedia dataset and fine-tuned on the FewRel classification task.

Abstract: We investigate structural traces of language contact in the intermediate representations of a monolingual language model. Focusing on Persian (Farsi) as a historically contact-rich language, we probe the representations of a Persian-trained model when exposed to languages with varying degrees and types of contact with Persian. Our methodology quantifies the amount of linguistic information encoded in intermediate representations and assesses how this information is distributed across model components for different morphosyntactic features. The results show that universal syntactic information is largely insensitive to historical contact, whereas morphological features such as Case and Gender are strongly shaped by language-specific structure, suggesting that contact effects in monolingual language models are selective and structurally constrained.

Abstract: The capacity of AI agents to effectively handle tasks of increasing duration and complexity continues to grow, demonstrating exceptional performance in coding, deep research, and complex problem-solving evaluations. However, in daily scenarios, the perception of these advanced AI capabilities among general users remains limited. We argue that current evaluations prioritize increasing task difficulty without sufficiently addressing the diversity of agentic tasks necessary to cover the daily work, life, and learning activities of a broad demographic. To address this, we propose AgentIF-OneDay, aimed at determining whether general users can utilize natural language instructions and AI agents to complete a diverse array of daily tasks. These tasks require not only solving problems through dialogue but also understanding various attachment types and delivering tangible file-based results. The benchmark is structured around three user-centric categories: Open Workflow Execution, which assesses adherence to explicit and complex workflows; Latent Instruction, which requires agents to infer implicit instructions from attachments; and Iterative Refinement, which involves modifying or expanding upon ongoing work. We employ instance-level rubrics and a refined evaluation pipeline that aligns LLM-based verification with human judgment, achieving an 80.1% agreement rate using Gemini-3-Pro. AgentIF-OneDay comprises 104 tasks covering 767 scoring points. We benchmarked four leading general AI agents and found that agent products built based on APIs and ChatGPT agents based on agent RL remain in the first tier simultaneously. Leading LLM APIs and open-source models have internalized agentic capabilities, enabling AI application teams to develop cutting-edge Agent products.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has advanced LLM reasoning in structured domains like mathematics and programming, its application to general-domain reasoning tasks remains challenging due to the absence of verifiable reward signals. To this end, methods like Reinforcement Learning with Reference Probability Reward (RLPR) have emerged, leveraging the probability of generating the final answer as a reward signal. However, these outcome-focused approaches neglect crucial step-by-step supervision of the reasoning process itself. To address this gap, we introduce Probabilistic Process Supervision (P2S), a novel self-supervision framework that provides fine-grained process rewards without requiring a separate reward model or human-annotated reasoning steps. During reinforcement learning, P2S synthesizes and filters a high-quality reference reasoning chain (gold-CoT). The core of our method is to calculate a Path Faithfulness Reward (PFR) for each reasoning step, which is derived from the conditional probability of generating the gold-CoT's suffix, given the model's current reasoning prefix. Crucially, this PFR can be flexibly integrated with any outcome-based reward, directly tackling the reward sparsity problem by providing dense guidance. Extensive experiments on reading comprehension and medical Question Answering benchmarks show that P2S significantly outperforms strong baselines.

Abstract: Assessing ways in which Language Models can reduce their hallucinations and improve the outputs' quality is crucial to ensure their large-scale use.
  However, methods such as fine-tuning on domain-specific data or the training of a separate \textit{ad hoc} verifier require demanding computational resources (not feasible for many user applications) and constrain the models to specific fields of knowledge.
  In this thesis, we propose a dialectic pipeline that preserves LLMs' generalization abilities while improving the quality of its answer via self-dialogue, enabling it to reflect upon and correct tentative wrong answers.
  We experimented with different pipeline settings, testing our proposed method on different datasets and on different families of models. All the pipeline stages are enriched with the relevant context (in an oracle-RAG setting) and a study on the impact of its summarization or its filtering is conducted.
  We find that our proposed dialectic pipeline is able to outperform by significative margins the standard model answers and that it consistently achieves higher performances than Chain-of-Thought only prompting.

Abstract: Visual Question-Answering (VQA) is a challenging multimodal task that requires integrating visual and textual information to generate accurate responses. While multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) has shown promise in enhancing VQA systems by providing more evidence on both image and text sides, the default procedure that addresses VQA queries, especially the knowledge-intensive ones, often relies on multi-stage pipelines of mRAG with inherent dependencies. To mitigate the inefficiency limitations while maintaining VQA task performance, this paper proposes a method that trains a multimodal planning agent, dynamically decomposing the mRAG pipeline to solve the VQA task. Our method optimizes the trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness by training the agent to intelligently determine the necessity of each mRAG step. In our experiments, the agent can help reduce redundant computations, cutting search time by over 60\% compared to existing methods and decreasing costly tool calls. Meanwhile, experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms all baselines, including a Deep Research agent and a carefully designed prompt-based method, on average over six various datasets. Code will be released.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in code generation, yet their potential for software protection remains largely untapped. Reverse engineering continues to threaten software security, while traditional virtual machine protection (VMP) relies on rigid, rule-based transformations that are costly to design and vulnerable to automated analysis. In this work, we present the first protection-aware framework that learns robust representations of VMP-protected code. Our approach builds large-scale paired datasets of source code and normalized VM implementations, and introduces hierarchical dependency modeling at intra-, preceding-, and inter-instruction levels. We jointly optimize language modeling with functionality-aware and protection-aware contrastive objectives to capture both semantic equivalence and protection strength. To further assess resilience, we propose a protection effectiveness optimization task that quantifies and ranks different VM variants derived from the same source. Coupled with a two-stage continual pre-training and fine-tuning pipeline, our method enables models to generate, compare, and reason over protected code. Extensive experiments show that our framework significantly improves robustness across diverse protection levels, opening a new research direction for learning-based software defense. In this work, we present ShieldedCode, the first protection-aware framework that learns robust representations of VMP-protected code. Our method achieves 26.95% Pass@1 on L0 VM code generation compared to 22.58% for GPT-4o., and improves binary similarity detection Recall@1 by 10% over state of art methods like jTrans.

Abstract: Automated narrative intelligence systems for social media monitoring face significant scalability challenges when processing continuous data streams using traditional batch clustering algorithms. We investigate the replacement of HDBSCAN (offline clustering) with online (streaming/incremental) clustering methods in a production narrative report generation pipeline. The proposed system employs a three-stage architecture (data collection, modeling, dashboard generation) that processes thousands of multilingual social media documents daily. While HDBSCAN excels at discovering hierarchical density-based clusters and handling noise, its batch-only nature necessitates complete retraining for each time window, resulting in memory constraints, computational inefficiency, and inability to adapt to evolving narratives in real-time. This work evaluates a bunch of online clustering algorithms across dimensions of cluster quality preservation, computational efficiency, memory footprint, and integration compatibility with existing workflows. We propose evaluation criteria that balance traditional clustering metrics (Silhouette Coefficient, Davies-Bouldin Index) with narrative metrics (narrative distinctness, contingency and variance). Our methodology includes sliding-window simulations on historical datasets from Ukraine information space, enabling comparative analysis of algorithmic trade-offs in realistic operational contexts. This research addresses a critical gap between batch-oriented topic modeling frameworks and the streaming nature of social media monitoring, with implications for computational social science, crisis informatics, and narrative surveillance systems.

Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) into autonomous agents necessitates the management of extensive, dynamic contexts. Current benchmarks, however, remain largely static, relying on passive retrieval tasks that fail to simulate the complexities of agent-environment interaction, such as non-linear reasoning and iterative feedback. To address this, we introduce \textbf{AgentLongBench}, which evaluates agents through simulated environment rollouts based on Lateral Thinking Puzzles. This framework generates rigorous interaction trajectories across knowledge-intensive and knowledge-free scenarios. Experiments with state-of-the-art models and memory systems (32K to 4M tokens) expose a critical weakness: while adept at static retrieval, agents struggle with the dynamic information synthesis essential for workflows. Our analysis indicates that this degradation is driven by the minimum number of tokens required to resolve a query. This factor explains why the high information density inherent in massive tool responses poses a significantly greater challenge than the memory fragmentation typical of long-turn dialogues.

We analyze 5,126 Reddit posts from 47 mental health communities describing experiential or exploratory use of AI for emotional support or therapy. Grounded in the Technology Acceptance Model and therapeutic alliance theory, we develop a theory-informed annotation framework and apply a hybrid LLM-human pipeline to analyze evaluative language, adoption-related attitudes, and relational alignment at scale. Our results show that engagement is shaped primarily by narrated outcomes, trust, and response quality, rather than emotional bond alone. Positive sentiment is most strongly associated with task and goal alignment, while companionship-oriented use more often involves misaligned alliances and reported risks such as dependence and symptom escalation. Overall, this work demonstrates how theory-grounded constructs can be operationalized in large-scale discourse analysis and highlights the importance of studying how users interpret language technologies in sensitive, real-world contexts.

Abstract: For socially sensitive tasks like hate speech detection, the quality of explanations from Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for factors like user trust and model alignment. While Persona prompting (PP) is increasingly used as a way to steer model towards user-specific generation, its effect on model rationales remains underexplored. We investigate how LLM-generated rationales vary when conditioned on different simulated demographic personas. Using datasets annotated with word-level rationales, we measure agreement with human annotations from different demographic groups, and assess the impact of PP on model bias and human alignment. Our evaluation across three LLMs results reveals three key findings: (1) PP improving classification on the most subjective task (hate speech) but degrading rationale quality. (2) Simulated personas fail to align with their real-world demographic counterparts, and high inter-persona agreement shows models are resistant to significant steering. (3) Models exhibit consistent demographic biases and a strong tendency to over-flag content as harmful, regardless of PP. Our findings reveal a critical trade-off: while PP can improve classification in socially-sensitive tasks, it often comes at the cost of rationale quality and fails to mitigate underlying biases, urging caution in its application.

Abstract: Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have made significant progress in the past few years but have only been loosely inter-connected. Based on a workshop held in August 2025, we identify current and future areas of synergism between these two fields. We focus on the subareas of embodiment, language and communication, robotics, learning in humans and machines and Neuromorphic engineering to take stock of the progress made so far, and possible promising new future avenues. Overall, we advocate for the development of NeuroAI, a type of Neuroscience-informed Artificial Intelligence that, we argue, has the potential for significantly improving the scope and efficiency of AI algorithms while simultaneously changing the way we understand biological neural computations. We include personal statements from several leading researchers on their diverse views of NeuroAI. Two Strength-Weakness-Opportunities-Threat (SWOT) analyses by researchers and trainees are appended that describe the benefits and risks offered by NeuroAI.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Inference-time planning with large language models frequently breaks under partial observability: when task-critical preconditions are not specified at query time, models tend to hallucinate missing facts or produce plans that violate hard constraints. We introduce \textbf{Self-Querying Bidirectional Categorical Planning (SQ-BCP)}, which explicitly represents precondition status (\texttt{Sat}/\texttt{Viol}/\texttt{Unk}) and resolves unknowns via (i) targeted self-queries to an oracle/user or (ii) \emph{bridging} hypotheses that establish the missing condition through an additional action. SQ-BCP performs bidirectional search and invokes a pullback-based verifier as a categorical certificate of goal compatibility, while using distance-based scores only for ranking and pruning. We prove that when the verifier succeeds and hard constraints pass deterministic checks, accepted plans are compatible with goal requirements; under bounded branching and finite resolution depth, SQ-BCP finds an accepting plan when one exists. Across WikiHow and RecipeNLG tasks with withheld preconditions, SQ-BCP reduces resource-violation rates to \textbf{14.9\%} and \textbf{5.8\%} (vs.\ \textbf{26.0\%} and \textbf{15.7\%} for the best baseline), while maintaining competitive reference quality.

Abstract: Natural-language planning often involves vague predicates (e.g., suitable substitute, stable enough) whose satisfaction is inherently graded. Existing category-theoretic planners provide compositional structure and pullback-based hard-constraint verification, but treat applicability as crisp, forcing thresholding that collapses meaningful distinctions and cannot track quality degradation across multi-step plans. We propose Fuzzy Category-theoretic Planning (FCP), which annotates each action (morphism) with a degree in [0,1], composes plan quality via a t-norm Lukasiewicz, and retains crisp executability checks via pullback verification. FCP grounds graded applicability from language using an LLM with k-sample median aggregation and supports meeting-in-the-middle search using residuum-based backward requirements. We evaluate on (i) public PDDL3 preference/oversubscription benchmarks and (ii) RecipeNLG-Subs, a missing-substitute recipe-planning benchmark built from RecipeNLG with substitution candidates from Recipe1MSubs and FoodKG. FCP improves success and reduces hard-constraint violations on RecipeNLG-Subs compared to LLM-only and ReAct-style baselines, while remaining competitive with classical PDDL3 planners.

Abstract: Today, E-commerce sellers face several key challenges, including difficulties in discovering and effectively utilizing available programs and tools, and struggling to understand and utilize rich data from various tools. We therefore aim to develop Insight Agents (IA), a conversational multi-agent Data Insight system, to provide E-commerce sellers with personalized data and business insights through automated information retrieval. Our hypothesis is that IA will serve as a force multiplier for sellers, thereby driving incremental seller adoption by reducing the effort required and increase speed at which sellers make good business decisions. In this paper, we introduce this novel LLM-backed end-to-end agentic system built on a plan-and-execute paradigm and designed for comprehensive coverage, high accuracy, and low latency. It features a hierarchical multi-agent structure, consisting of manager agent and two worker agents: data presentation and insight generation, for efficient information retrieval and problem-solving. We design a simple yet effective ML solution for manager agent that combines Out-of-Domain (OOD) detection using a lightweight encoder-decoder model and agent routing through a BERT-based classifier, optimizing both accuracy and latency. Within the two worker agents, a strategic planning is designed for API-based data model that breaks down queries into granular components to generate more accurate responses, and domain knowledge is dynamically injected to to enhance the insight generator. IA has been launched for Amazon sellers in US, which has achieved high accuracy of 90% based on human evaluation, with latency of P90 below 15s.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered agents can translate high-level user intents into plans and actions in an environment. Yet after observing an outcome, users may wonder: What if I had phrased my intent differently? We introduce a framework that enables such counterfactual reasoning in agentic LLM-driven control scenarios, while providing formal reliability guarantees. Our approach models the closed-loop interaction between a user, an LLM-based agent, and an environment as a structural causal model (SCM), and leverages test-time scaling to generate multiple candidate counterfactual outcomes via probabilistic abduction. Through an offline calibration phase, the proposed conformal counterfactual generation (CCG) yields sets of counterfactual outcomes that are guaranteed to contain the true counterfactual outcome with high probability. We showcase the performance of CCG on a wireless network control use case, demonstrating significant advantages compared to naive re-execution baselines.

Abstract: As an important part of urbanization, the development monitoring of newly constructed parks is of great significance for evaluating the effect of urban planning and optimizing resource allocation. However, traditional change detection methods based on remote sensing imagery have obvious limitations in high-level and intelligent analysis, and thus are difficult to meet the requirements of current urban planning and management. In face of the growing demand for complex multi-modal data analysis in urban park development monitoring, these methods often fail to provide flexible analysis capabilities for diverse application scenarios. This study proposes a multi-modal LLM agent framework, which aims to make full use of the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLM to meet the challenges in urban park development monitoring. In this framework, a general horizontal and vertical data alignment mechanism is designed to ensure the consistency and effective tracking of multi-modal data. At the same time, a specific toolkit is constructed to alleviate the hallucination issues of LLM due to the lack of domain-specific knowledge. Compared to vanilla GPT-4o and other agents, our approach enables robust multi-modal information fusion and analysis, offering reliable and scalable solutions tailored to the diverse and evolving demands of urban park development monitoring.

Abstract: Large language models have achieved strong performance on medical reasoning benchmarks, yet their deployment in clinical settings demands rigorous verification to ensure factual accuracy. While reward models offer a scalable approach for reasoning trace verification, existing methods face two limitations: they produce only scalar reward values without explicit justification, and they rely on single-pass retrieval that precludes adaptive knowledge access as verification unfolds. We introduce $\method$, an agentic framework that addresses these limitations by training medical reasoning verifiers to iteratively query external medical corpora during evaluation. Our approach combines tool-augmented verification with an iterative reinforcement learning paradigm that requires only trace-level supervision, alongside an adaptive curriculum mechanism that dynamically adjusts training data distribution. Across four medical reasoning benchmarks, $\method$ achieves substantial gains over existing methods, improving MedQA accuracy by 23.5% and MedXpertQA by 32.0% relative to the base generator in particular. Crucially, $\method$ demonstrates an $\mathbf{8\times}$ reduction in sampling budget requirement compared to prior reward model baselines. These findings establish that grounding verification in dynamically retrieved evidence offers a principled path toward more reliable medical reasoning systems.

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) exhibit strong understanding, yet this capability often fails to effectively guide generation. We identify this as a Cognitive Gap: the model lacks the understanding of how to enhance its own generation process. To bridge this gap, we propose Endogenous Reprompting, a mechanism that transforms the model's understanding from a passive encoding process into an explicit generative reasoning step by generating self-aligned descriptors during generation. To achieve this, we introduce SEER (Self-Evolving Evaluator and Reprompter), a training framework that establishes a two-stage endogenous loop using only 300 samples from a compact proxy task, Visual Instruction Elaboration. First, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) activates the model's latent evaluation ability via curriculum learning, producing a high-fidelity endogenous reward signal. Second, Reinforcement Learning with Model-rewarded Thinking (RLMT) leverages this signal to optimize the generative reasoning policy. Experiments show that SEER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in evaluation accuracy, reprompting efficiency, and generation quality, without sacrificing general multimodal capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models have rapidly expanded to electrocardiograms, focusing on classification, report generation, and single-turn QA tasks. However, these models fall short in real-world scenarios, lacking multi-turn conversational ability, on-device efficiency, and precise understanding of ECG measurements such as the PQRST intervals. To address these limitations, we introduce ECG-Agent, the first LLM-based tool-calling agent for multi-turn ECG dialogue. To facilitate its development and evaluation, we also present ECG-Multi-Turn-Dialogue (ECG-MTD) dataset, a collection of realistic user-assistant multi-turn dialogues for diverse ECG lead configurations. We develop ECG-Agents in various sizes, from on-device capable to larger agents. Experimental results show that ECG-Agents outperform baseline ECG-LLMs in response accuracy. Furthermore, on-device agents achieve comparable performance to larger agents in various evaluations that assess response accuracy, tool-calling ability, and hallucinations, demonstrating their viability for real-world applications.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Model (LLM) agents has necessitated robust memory systems to support cohesive long-term interaction and complex reasoning. Benefiting from the strong capabilities of LLMs, recent research focus has shifted from simple context extension to the development of dedicated agentic memory systems. However, existing approaches typically rely on rigid retrieval granularity, accumulation-heavy maintenance strategies, and coarse-grained update mechanisms. These design choices create a persistent mismatch between stored information and task-specific reasoning demands, while leading to the unchecked accumulation of logical inconsistencies over time. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Memory via Multi-Agent Collaboration (AMA), a novel framework that leverages coordinated agents to manage memory across multiple granularities. AMA employs a hierarchical memory design that dynamically aligns retrieval granularity with task complexity. Specifically, the Constructor and Retriever jointly enable multi-granularity memory construction and adaptive query routing. The Judge verifies the relevance and consistency of retrieved content, triggering iterative retrieval when evidence is insufficient or invoking the Refresher upon detecting logical conflicts. The Refresher then enforces memory consistency by performing targeted updates or removing outdated entries. Extensive experiments on challenging long-context benchmarks show that AMA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while reducing token consumption by approximately 80% compared to full-context methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in maintaining retrieval precision and long-term memory consistency.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with complex, long-horizon reasoning due to instability caused by their frozen policy assumption. Current test-time scaling methods treat execution feedback merely as an external signal for filtering or rewriting trajectories, without internalizing it to improve the underlying reasoning strategy. Inspired by Popper's epistemology of "conjectures and refutations," we argue that intelligence requires real-time evolution of the model's policy through learning from failed attempts. We introduce Policy of Thoughts (PoT), a framework that recasts reasoning as a within-instance online optimization process. PoT first generates diverse candidate solutions via an efficient exploration mechanism, then uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to update a transient LoRA adapter based on execution feedback. This closed-loop design enables dynamic, instance-specific refinement of the model's reasoning priors. Experiments show that PoT dramatically boosts performance: a 4B model achieves 49.71% accuracy on LiveCodeBench, outperforming GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 despite being over 50 smaller.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents show great potential for enabling foundation models to complete real-world tasks, revolutionizing human-computer interaction and improving human productivity. In this report, we present OmegaUse, a general-purpose GUI agent model for autonomous task execution on both mobile and desktop platforms, supporting computer-use and phone-use scenarios. Building an effective GUI agent model relies on two factors: (1) high-quality data and (2) effective training methods. To address these, we introduce a carefully engineered data-construction pipeline and a decoupled training paradigm. For data construction, we leverage rigorously curated open-source datasets and introduce a novel automated synthesis framework that integrates bottom-up autonomous exploration with top-down taxonomy-guided generation to create high-fidelity synthetic data. For training, to better leverage these data, we adopt a two-stage strategy: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to establish fundamental interaction syntax, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve spatial grounding and sequential planning. To balance computational efficiency with agentic reasoning capacity, OmegaUse is built on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) backbone. To evaluate cross-terminal capabilities in an offline setting, we introduce OS-Nav, a benchmark suite spanning multiple operating systems: ChiM-Nav, targeting Chinese Android mobile environments, and Ubu-Nav, focusing on routine desktop interactions on Ubuntu. Extensive experiments show that OmegaUse is highly competitive across established GUI benchmarks, achieving a state-of-the-art (SOTA) score of 96.3% on ScreenSpot-V2 and a leading 79.1% step success rate on AndroidControl. OmegaUse also performs strongly on OS-Nav, reaching 74.24% step success on ChiM-Nav and 55.9% average success on Ubu-Nav.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting improves LLM reasoning but incurs high latency and memory cost due to verbose traces, motivating CoT compression with preserved correctness. Existing methods either shorten CoTs at the semantic level, which is often conservative, or prune tokens aggressively, which can miss task-critical cues and degrade accuracy. Moreover, combining the two is non-trivial due to sequential dependency, task-agnostic pruning, and distribution mismatch. We propose \textbf{CtrlCoT}, a dual-granularity CoT compression framework that harmonizes semantic abstraction and token-level pruning through three components: Hierarchical Reasoning Abstraction produces CoTs at multiple semantic granularities; Logic-Preserving Distillation trains a logic-aware pruner to retain indispensable reasoning cues (e.g., numbers and operators) across pruning ratios; and Distribution-Alignment Generation aligns compressed traces with fluent inference-time reasoning styles to avoid fragmentation. On MATH-500 with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, CtrlCoT uses 30.7\% fewer tokens while achieving 7.6 percentage points higher than the strongest baseline, demonstrating more efficient and reliable reasoning. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/fanzhenxuan/Ctrl-CoT.

Abstract: The introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) agents into human group settings raises essential questions about how these novel participants influence cooperative social norms. While previous studies on human-AI cooperation have primarily focused on dyadic interactions, little is known about how integrating AI agents affects the emergence and maintenance of cooperative norms in small groups. This study addresses this gap through an online experiment using a repeated four-player Public Goods Game (PGG). Each group consisted of three human participants and one bot, which was framed either as human or AI and followed one of three predefined decision strategies: unconditional cooperation, conditional cooperation, or free-riding. In our sample of 236 participants, we found that reciprocal group dynamics and behavioural inertia primarily drove cooperation. These normative mechanisms operated identically across conditions, resulting in cooperation levels that did not differ significantly between human and AI labels. Furthermore, we found no evidence of differences in norm persistence in a follow-up Prisoner's Dilemma, or in participants' normative perceptions. Participants' behaviour followed the same normative logic across human and AI conditions, indicating that cooperation depended on group behaviour rather than partner identity. This supports a pattern of normative equivalence, in which the mechanisms that sustain cooperation function similarly in mixed human-AI and all human groups. These findings suggest that cooperative norms are flexible enough to extend to artificial agents, blurring the boundary between humans and AI in collective decision-making.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled automated heuristic design (AHD) for combinatorial optimization problems (COPs), but existing frameworks' reliance on fixed evolutionary rules and static prompt templates often leads to myopic heuristic generation, redundant evaluations, and limited reasoning about how new heuristics should be derived. We propose a novel multi-agent reasoning framework, referred to as Planning through World Model for Automated Heuristic Design via Self-Evolving LLMs (PathWise), which formulates heuristic generation as a sequential decision process over an entailment graph serving as a compact, stateful memory of the search trajectory. This approach allows the system to carry forward past decisions and reuse or avoid derivation information across generations. A policy agent plans evolutionary actions, a world model agent generates heuristic rollouts conditioned on those actions, and critic agents provide routed reflections summarizing lessons from prior steps, shifting LLM-based AHD from trial-and-error evolution toward state-aware planning through reasoning. Experiments across diverse COPs show that PathWise converges faster to better heuristics, generalizes across different LLM backbones, and scales to larger problem sizes.

Abstract: We study risk-sensitive planning under partial observability using the dynamic risk measure Iterated Conditional Value-at-Risk (ICVaR). A policy evaluation algorithm for ICVaR is developed with finite-time performance guarantees that do not depend on the cardinality of the action space. Building on this foundation, three widely used online planning algorithms--Sparse Sampling, Particle Filter Trees with Double Progressive Widening (PFT-DPW), and Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning with Observation Widening (POMCPOW)--are extended to optimize the ICVaR value function rather than the expectation of the return. Our formulations introduce a risk parameter $α$, where $α= 1$ recovers standard expectation-based planning and $α< 1$ induces increasing risk aversion. For ICVaR Sparse Sampling, we establish finite-time performance guarantees under the risk-sensitive objective, which further enable a novel exploration strategy tailored to ICVaR. Experiments on benchmark POMDP domains demonstrate that the proposed ICVaR planners achieve lower tail risk compared to their risk-neutral counterparts.

Abstract: This paper introduces a methodological framework for empirically testing AI alignment strategies through structured multi-model dialogue. Drawing on Peace Studies traditions - particularly interest-based negotiation, conflict transformation, and commons governance - we operationalize Viral Collaborative Wisdom (VCW), an approach that reframes alignment from a control problem to a relationship problem developed through dialogical reasoning.
  Our experimental design assigns four distinct roles (Proposer, Responder, Monitor, Translator) to different AI systems across six conditions, testing whether current large language models can engage substantively with complex alignment frameworks. Using Claude, Gemini, and GPT-4o, we conducted 72 dialogue turns totaling 576,822 characters of structured exchange.
  Results demonstrate that AI systems can engage meaningfully with Peace Studies concepts, surface complementary objections from different architectural perspectives, and generate emergent insights not present in initial framings - including the novel synthesis of "VCW as transitional framework." Cross-architecture patterns reveal that different models foreground different concerns: Claude emphasized verification challenges, Gemini focused on bias and scalability, and GPT-4o highlighted implementation barriers.
  The framework provides researchers with replicable methods for stress-testing alignment proposals before implementation, while the findings offer preliminary evidence about AI capacity for the kind of dialogical reasoning VCW proposes. We discuss limitations, including the observation that dialogues engaged more with process elements than with foundational claims about AI nature, and outline directions for future research including human-AI hybrid protocols and extended dialogue studies.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) offers a robust mechanism for enhancing mathematical reasoning in large models. However, we identify a systematic lack of emphasis on more challenging questions in existing methods from both algorithmic and data perspectives, despite their importance for refining underdeveloped capabilities. Algorithmically, widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffers from an implicit imbalance where the magnitude of policy updates is lower for harder questions. Data-wise, augmentation approaches primarily rephrase questions to enhance diversity without systematically increasing intrinsic difficulty. To address these issues, we propose a two-dual MathForge framework to improve mathematical reasoning by targeting harder questions from both perspectives, which comprises a Difficulty-Aware Group Policy Optimization (DGPO) algorithm and a Multi-Aspect Question Reformulation (MQR) strategy. Specifically, DGPO first rectifies the implicit imbalance in GRPO via difficulty-balanced group advantage estimation, and further prioritizes harder questions by difficulty-aware question-level weighting. Meanwhile, MQR reformulates questions across multiple aspects to increase difficulty while maintaining the original gold answer. Overall, MathForge forms a synergistic loop: MQR expands the data frontier, and DGPO effectively learns from the augmented data. Extensive experiments show that MathForge significantly outperforms existing methods on various mathematical reasoning tasks. The code and augmented data are all available at https://github.com/AMAP-ML/MathForge.

Abstract: We investigate whether \emph{LLM-based agents} can develop task-oriented communication protocols that differ from standard natural language in collaborative reasoning tasks. Our focus is on two core properties such task-oriented protocols may exhibit: Efficiency -- conveying task-relevant information more concisely than natural language, and Covertness -- becoming difficult for external observers to interpret, raising concerns about transparency and control. To investigate these aspects, we use a referential-game framework in which vision-language model (VLM) agents communicate, providing a controlled, measurable setting for evaluating language variants. Experiments show that VLMs can develop effective, task-adapted communication patterns. At the same time, they can develop covert protocols that are difficult for humans and external agents to interpret. We also observe spontaneous coordination between similar models without explicitly shared protocols. These findings highlight both the potential and the risks of task-oriented communication, and position referential games as a valuable testbed for future work in this area.

Abstract: We develop a computational approach to Metric Answer Set Programming (ASP) to allow for expressing quantitative temporal constraints, like durations and deadlines. A central challenge is to maintain scalability when dealing with fine-grained timing constraints, which can significantly exacerbate ASP's grounding bottleneck. To address this issue, we leverage extensions of ASP with difference constraints, a simplified form of linear constraints, to handle time-related aspects externally. Our approach effectively decouples metric ASP from the granularity of time, resulting in a solution that is unaffected by time precision.
