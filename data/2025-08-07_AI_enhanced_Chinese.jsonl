Despite its advantages,\ndeveloping VR applications for training remains a significant challenge due to\nthe time, expertise, and resources required to create accurate and engaging\ninstructional content. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a\nnovel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the\ngeneration of virtual instructions from textual input. The system comprises two\ncore components: an LLM module that extracts task-relevant information from the\ntext, and an intelligent module that transforms this information into animated\ndemonstrations and visual cues within a VR environment. The intelligent module\nreceives input from the LLM module and interprets the extracted information.\nBased on this, an instruction generator creates training content using relevant\ndata from a database. The instruction generator generates the instruction by\nchanging the color of virtual objects and creating animations to illustrate\ntasks. This approach enhances training effectiveness and reduces development\noverhead, making VR-based training more scalable and adaptable to evolving\nindustrial needs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u865a\u62df\u73b0\u5b9e\uff08VR\uff09\u57f9\u8bad\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5f00\u53d1VR\u57f9\u8bad\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "VR\u57f9\u8bad\u867d\u5177\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5f00\u53d1\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u8017\u65f6\u957f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u53d6\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u6a21\u5757\u5c06\u5176\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3aVR\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u753b\u6f14\u793a\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u57f9\u8bad\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u57f9\u8bad\u6548\u679c\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u5f00\u53d1\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7fVR\u57f9\u8bad\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u5de5\u4e1a\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

The Cases of Caste and Religion", "comment": "Accepted to AIES 2025", "summary": "Representational bias in large language models (LLMs) has predominantly been\nmeasured through single-response interactions and has focused on Global\nNorth-centric identities like race and gender. We expand on that research by\nconducting a systematic audit of GPT-4 Turbo to reveal how deeply encoded\nrepresentational biases are and how they extend to less-explored dimensions of\nidentity. We prompt GPT-4 Turbo to generate over 7,200 stories about\nsignificant life events (such as weddings) in India, using prompts designed to\nencourage diversity to varying extents. Comparing the diversity of religious\nand caste representation in the outputs against the actual population\ndistribution in India as recorded in census data, we quantify the presence and\n\"stickiness\" of representational bias in the LLM for religion and caste. We\nfind that GPT-4 responses consistently overrepresent culturally dominant groups\nfar beyond their statistical representation, despite prompts intended to\nencourage representational diversity. Our findings also suggest that\nrepresentational bias in LLMs has a winner-take-all quality that is more biased\nthan the likely distribution bias in their training data, and repeated\nprompt-based nudges have limited and inconsistent efficacy in dislodging these\nbiases. These results suggest that diversifying training data alone may not be\nsufficient to correct LLM bias, highlighting the need for more fundamental\nchanges in model development.

This\nstructured interaction broadens the search landscape and encourages the\ndiscovery of diverse, high-performing solutions.

We introduce GanitBench, a tough benchmark\nconsisting of 1527 vision-only questions covering several topics in Mathematics\n- available in languages English and Hindi. Collected from two major\nexaminations from India, the JEE Advanced and the CBSE Boards examinations,\nthis benchmark includes questions in the form of images comprising of figures\nessential to a question as well as text. We evaluate two closed source models\nfor the same, in zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and two-shot CoT settings.\nGPT-4o mini is found to be the more dominant model on the benchmark, with it's\nhighest average accuracy being 38.15%.

To reduce\nperceptual uncertainty, RecAgent employs a component recommendation mechanism\nthat identifies and focuses on the most relevant UI elements.

The fundamental difficulty in digitizing semantic features stems\nfrom the need to preserve continuity and context in inherently analog\nrepresentations during their compression into discrete symbols while ensuring\nrobustness to channel degradation. In this paper, we propose a vector quantized\n(VQ)-enabled digital semantic communication system with channel adaptive image\ntransmission, named VQ-DeepISC. Guided by deep joint source-channel coding\n(DJSCC), we first design a Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical semantic\nfeature extraction, followed by VQ modules projecting features into discrete\nlatent spaces. Consequently, it enables efficient index-based transmission\ninstead of raw feature transmission. To further optimize this process, we\ndevelop an attention mechanism-driven channel adaptation module to dynamically\noptimize index transmission. Secondly, to counteract codebook collapse during\ntraining process, we impose a distributional regularization by minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between codeword usage frequencies and a\nuniform prior. Meanwhile, exponential moving average (EMA) is employed to\nstabilize training and ensure balanced feature coverage during codebook\nupdates. Finally, digital communication is implemented using quadrature phase\nshift keying (QPSK) modulation alongside orthogonal frequency division\nmultiplexing (OFDM), adhering to the IEEE 802.11a standard.

To address this issue, watermarking techniques\nhave emerged as a promising solution by embedding identifiable binary messages\ninto generated text for origin verification and misuse tracing. While recent\nefforts have explored multi-bit watermarking schemes capable of embedding rich\ninformation such as user identifiers, they typically suffer from the\nfundamental trade-off between text quality and decoding accuracy: to ensure\nreliable message decoding, they have to restrict the size of preferred token\nsets during encoding, yet such restrictions reduce the quality of the generated\ncontent. In this work, we propose MajorMark, a novel watermarking method that\nimproves this trade-off through majority bit-aware encoding. MajorMark selects\npreferred token sets based on the majority bit of the message, enabling a\nlarger and more flexible sampling of tokens. In contrast to prior methods that\nrely on token frequency analysis for decoding, MajorMark employs a\nclustering-based decoding strategy, which maintains high decoding accuracy even\nwhen the preferred token set is large, thus preserving both content quality and\ndecoding accuracy. We further introduce MajorMark$^+$, which partitions the\nmessage into multiple blocks to independently encode and deterministically\ndecode each block, thereby further enhancing the quality of watermarked text\nand improving decoding accuracy.

However, sensing real-time crowding remains challenging\nand often depends on indirect proxies such as automatic fare collection data or\nstaff observations.

The presented study investigates this potential\nby comparing three state-of-the-art computer vision approaches for extracting\ncrowd-related features from platform CCTV imagery: (a) object detection and\ncounting using YOLOv11, RT-DETRv2, and APGCC; (b) crowd-level classification\nvia a custom-trained Vision Transformer, Crowd-ViT; and (c) semantic\nsegmentation using DeepLabV3. Additionally, we present a novel, highly\nefficient linear-optimization-based approach to extract counts from the\ngenerated segmentation maps while accounting for image object depth and, thus,\nfor passenger dispersion along a platform. Tested on a privacy-preserving\ndataset created in collaboration with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit\nAuthority (WMATA) that encompasses more than 600 hours of video material, our\nresults demonstrate that computer vision approaches can provide substantive\nvalue for crowd estimation.

In GeoSR, the reasoning process is decomposed\ninto three collaborating agents: (1) a variable-selection agent that selects\nrelevant covariates from the same location; (2) a point-selection agent that\nchooses reference predictions at nearby locations generated by the LLM in\nprevious rounds; and (3) a refine agent that coordinates the iterative\nrefinement process by evaluating prediction quality and triggering further\nrounds when necessary. This agentic loop progressively improves prediction\nquality by leveraging both spatial dependencies and inter-variable\nrelationships.

This hybrid approach allows the\nagent to bypass inefficient GUI action sequences for tasks like file management\nand data processing, while still leveraging visual interaction when necessary.\nWe evaluate our system on the challenging OSWorld benchmark, where CoAct-1\nachieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 60.76%, significantly\noutperforming prior methods. Furthermore, our approach dramatically improves\nefficiency, reducing the average number of steps required to complete a task to\njust 10.15, compared to 15 for leading GUI agents. Our results demonstrate that\nintegrating coding as a core action provides a more powerful, efficient, and\nscalable path toward generalized computer automation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408GUI\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0e\u7f16\u7a0b\u6267\u884c\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edfCoAct-1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709GUI\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e14\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "CoAct-1\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u7ed9GUI\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u6216\u7f16\u7a0b\u4ee3\u7406\uff08\u53ef\u7f16\u5199Python/Bash\u811a\u672c\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6df7\u5408\u6267\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u5728OSWorld\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cCoAct-1\u6210\u529f\u738760.76%\uff0c\u6b65\u9aa4\u6570\u964d\u81f310.15\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u7f16\u7a0b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u52a8\u4f5c\u80fd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5730\u5b9e\u73b0\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3002"}}

The challenges and cognitive load experienced by facilitators\ncreate a critical gap for an embodied technology that can interpret social\nexchanges while remaining aware of the needs of the individuals in the group\nand providing transparent recommendations that go beyond powerful but \"black\nbox\" foundation models (FMs) that identify social cues. We address this\nimportant demand with a social robot co-facilitator that analyzes multimodal\nmeeting data and provides discreet cues to the facilitator. The robot's\nreasoning is powered by an agentic concept bottleneck model (CBM), which makes\ndecisions based on human-interpretable concepts like participant engagement and\nsentiments, ensuring transparency and trustworthiness. Our core contribution is\na transfer learning framework that distills the broad social understanding of\nan FM into our specialized and transparent CBM. This concept-driven system\nsignificantly outperforms direct zero-shot FMs in predicting the need for\nintervention and enables real-time human correction of its reasoning.\nCritically, we demonstrate robust knowledge transfer: the model generalizes\nacross different groups and successfully transfers the expertise of senior\nhuman facilitators to improve the performance of novices.

Taking the locally segmented regions as an input for the next\nstep, this dynamic decision making process iterates until all cancers are best\nlocalised. We validate our method using a data set of 1325 labelled\nmultiparametric MRI images from prostate cancer patients, demonstrating its\npotential to improve annotation efficiency and segmentation accuracy,\nespecially when challenging pathology is present. Experimental results show\nthat our approach can surpass standard segmentation networks.

While RAG\nmethods have shown promise in mitigating factual inaccuracies in foundation\nmodels, they have primarily focused on text, leaving visual knowledge\nunderexplored. Meanwhile, existing detection methods, which struggle with\ngeneralization and robustness, often rely on low-level artifacts and\nmodel-specific features, limiting their adaptability. To address this, RAVID\ndynamically retrieves relevant images to enhance detection. Our approach\nutilizes a fine-tuned CLIP image encoder, RAVID CLIP, enhanced with\ncategory-related prompts to improve representation learning. We further\nintegrate a vision-language model (VLM) to fuse retrieved images with the\nquery, enriching the input and improving accuracy. Given a query image, RAVID\ngenerates an embedding using RAVID CLIP, retrieves the most relevant images\nfrom a database, and combines these with the query image to form an enriched\ninput for a VLM (e.g., Qwen-VL or Openflamingo).

However, existing\nmethods are trained for fixed activity sets and require costly retraining when\nnew behaviours or sensor setups appear. Recent attempts to use large language\nmodels (LLMs) for HAR, typically by converting signals into text or images,\nsuffer from limited accuracy and lack verifiable interpretability. We propose\nZARA, the first agent-based framework for zero-shot, explainable HAR directly\nfrom raw motion time-series. ZARA integrates an automatically derived pair-wise\nfeature knowledge base that captures discriminative statistics for every\nactivity pair, a multi-sensor retrieval module that surfaces relevant evidence,\nand a hierarchical agent pipeline that guides the LLM to iteratively select\nfeatures, draw on this evidence, and produce both activity predictions and\nnatural-language explanations. ZARA enables flexible and interpretable HAR\nwithout any fine-tuning or task-specific classifiers. Extensive experiments on\n8 HAR benchmarks show that ZARA achieves SOTA zero-shot performance, delivering\nclear reasoning while exceeding the strongest baselines by 2.53x in macro F1.\nAblation studies further confirm the necessity of each module, marking ZARA as\na promising step toward trustworthy, plug-and-play motion time-series analysis.\nOur codes are available at https://github.com/zechenli03/ZARA.", "AI": {"tldr": "ZARA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\uff08HAR\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u8fd0\u52a8\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709HAR\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u56fa\u5b9a\u6d3b\u52a8\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u65b0\u884c\u4e3a\u6216\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8bbe\u7f6e\u51fa\u73b0\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u6602\u8d35\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4f4e\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "ZARA\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u3001\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u4ee3\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u6307\u5bfcLLM\u8fed\u4ee3\u9009\u62e9\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u57288\u4e2aHAR\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cZARA\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672cSOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b8f\u89c2F1\u8d85\u8fc7\u6700\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf2.53\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6e05\u6670\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "ZARA\u662f\u8fc8\u5411\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u3001\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u8fd0\u52a8\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6709\u5e0c\u671b\u7684\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}

To bridge this evaluation chasm,\nwe introduce OmniPlay, a diagnostic benchmark designed not just to evaluate,\nbut to probe the fusion and reasoning capabilities of agentic models across the\nfull sensory spectrum.

However,\ncurrent RAG systems face two critical limitations: (1) they inefficiently\nretrieve information for every query, including simple questions that could be\nresolved using the LLM's parametric knowledge alone, and (2) they risk\nretrieving irrelevant documents when queries contain sparse information\nsignals. To address these gaps, we introduce Parametric-verified Adaptive\nInformation Retrieval and Selection (PAIRS), a training-free framework that\nintegrates parametric and retrieved knowledge to adaptively determine whether\nto retrieve and how to select external information. Specifically, PAIRS employs\na dual-path generation mechanism: First, the LLM produces both a direct answer\nand a context-augmented answer using self-generated pseudo-context. When these\noutputs converge, PAIRS bypasses external retrieval entirely, dramatically\nimproving the RAG system's efficiency. For divergent cases, PAIRS activates a\ndual-path retrieval (DPR) process guided by both the original query and\nself-generated contextual signals, followed by an Adaptive Information\nSelection (AIS) module that filters documents through weighted similarity to\nboth sources. This simple yet effective approach can not only enhance\nefficiency by eliminating unnecessary retrievals but also improve accuracy\nthrough contextually guided retrieval and adaptive information selection.\nExperimental results on six question-answering (QA) benchmarks show that PAIRS\nreduces retrieval costs by around 25% (triggering for only 75% of queries)\nwhile still improving accuracy-achieving +1.1% EM and +1.0% F1 over prior\nbaselines on average.", "AI": {"tldr": "PAIRS\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u51b3\u5b9a\u662f\u5426\u68c0\u7d22\u5916\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524dRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4fe1\u606f\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2aQA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u68c0\u7d22\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e25%\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53471.1% EM\u548c1.0% F1\u3002", "conclusion": "PAIRS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

These dialogues often involve scaffolding -- the process by\nwhich an expert supports a novice's thinking through questions, feedback, and\nstep-by-step guidance. However, such data are scarce due to privacy concerns in\nrecording and the vulnerability inherent in help-seeking. We present\nSimInstruct, a scalable, expert-in-the-loop tool for collecting scaffolding\ndialogues. Using teaching development coaching as an example domain,\nSimInstruct simulates novice instructors via LLMs, varying their teaching\nchallenges and LLM's persona traits, while human experts provide multi-turn\nfeedback, reasoning, and instructional support. This design enables the\ncreation of realistic, pedagogically rich dialogues without requiring real\nnovice participants. Our results reveal that persona traits, such as\nextroversion and introversion, meaningfully influence how experts engage.\nCompared to real mentoring recordings, SimInstruct dialogues demonstrate\ncomparable pedagogical relevance and cognitive depth. Experts also reported the\nprocess as engaging and reflective, improving both data quality and their own\nprofessional insight. We further fine-tuned a LLaMA model to be an expert model\nusing the augmented dataset, which outperformed GPT-4o in instructional\nquality.

However, its application to the downstream Image-Text\nRetrieval (ITR) task is more challenging. We find that the challenge lies in\ndiscriminating both fine-grained attributes and similar subcategories of the\ndownstream data. To address this challenge, we propose Dual prompt Learning\nwith Joint Category-Attribute Reweighting (DCAR), a novel dual-prompt learning\nframework to achieve precise image-text matching. The framework dynamically\nadjusts prompt vectors from both semantic and visual dimensions to improve the\nperformance of CLIP on the downstream ITR task. Based on the prompt paradigm,\nDCAR jointly optimizes attribute and class features to enhance fine-grained\nrepresentation learning. Specifically, (1) at the attribute level, it\ndynamically updates the weights of attribute descriptions based on text-image\nmutual information correlation; (2) at the category level, it introduces\nnegative samples from multiple perspectives with category-matching weighting to\nlearn subcategory distinctions. To validate our method, we construct the\nFine-class Described Retrieval Dataset (FDRD), which serves as a challenging\nbenchmark for ITR in downstream data domains. It covers over 1,500 downstream\nfine categories and 230,000 image-caption pairs with detailed attribute\nannotations.

A particular challenge arises in\nscenarios where pedestrians suddenly appear from between parked vehicles, as\nthese parked vehicles act as temporary spatial obstructions. Furthermore, since\nparked vehicles are dynamic and may relocate over time, spatial information\nobtained from satellite maps or other predefined sources may not accurately\nreflect real-time road conditions, leading to erroneous sensor interpretations.\nTo address this limitation, we propose an NLoS pedestrian localization\nframework that integrates monocular camera image with 2D radar point cloud\n(PCD) data. The proposed method initially detects parked vehicles through image\nsegmentation, estimates depth to infer approximate spatial characteristics, and\nsubsequently refines this information using 2D radar PCD to achieve precise\nspatial inference. Experimental evaluations conducted in real-world urban road\nenvironments demonstrate that the proposed approach enhances early pedestrian\ndetection and contributes to improved road safety.

While vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP offer strong\ngeneralization capabilities, their direct application to medical imaging\nanalysis is impeded by a significant domain gap. Existing approaches to bridge\nthis gap, including prompt learning and one-way modality interaction\ntechniques, typically focus on introducing domain knowledge to a single\nmodality.

In addition to this,\na key contribution of our work can also be attributed to formulating a means of\nencoding bounding box information as a binary mask, which can be fed to the\ndetection model to refine detection guidance. Through experiments on both\nwithin-dataset evaluation on the renowned SODA dataset and cross-dataset\nevaluation on the BDW and UAVVaste litter detection datasets, we demonstrate\nconsistent performance improvements across all models.

CDV-Captioner uses chain-of-thought\nprompting and visually similar reference images to reduce hallucination and\nenhance discrimination of generated captions.

Then, off-the-shelf vision and\ntext encoders embed query and template pairs, and FGVC is accomplished by\nretrieving the nearest template in the joint space. UniFGVC ensures broad\ncompatibility with diverse MLLMs and encoders, offering reliable generalization\nand adaptability across few-shot FGVC scenarios.

It\nhighlights the potential of Generative AI (GenAI) while acknowledging the\nsignificant challenges of ensuring factual accuracy and curriculum alignment,\nespecially for low-resource languages like Bahasa Melayu. This research\nintroduces and compares four incremental pipelines for generating Form 1\nMathematics multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in Bahasa Melayu using OpenAI's\nGPT-4o. The methods range from non-grounded prompting (structured and basic) to\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches (one using the LangChain\nframework, one implemented manually). The system is grounded in official\ncurriculum documents, including teacher-prepared notes and the yearly teaching\nplan (RPT). A dual-pronged automated evaluation framework is employed to assess\nthe generated questions. Curriculum alignment is measured using Semantic\nTextual Similarity (STS) against the RPT, while contextual validity is verified\nthrough a novel RAG-based Question-Answering (RAG-QA) method.

To\naddress this challenge, in this work, we introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset\nof 6,300 real-world meme-based posts annotated in two stages: (i) binary\nclassification into toxic and normal, and (ii) fine-grained labelling of toxic\nmemes as hateful, dangerous, or offensive. A key feature of this dataset is\nthat it is enriched with auxiliary metadata of socially relevant tags,\nenhancing the context of each meme. In addition, we propose a tag generation\nmodule that produces socially grounded tags, because most in-the-wild memes\noften do not come with tags. Experimental results show that incorporating these\ntags substantially enhances the performance of state-of-the-art VLMs detection\ntasks. Our contributions offer a novel and scalable foundation for improved\ncontent moderation in multimodal online environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5305\u542b6300\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u56e0\u5e16\u5b50\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6bd2\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6807\u7b7e\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u6a21\u56e0\u5e38\u4f20\u64ad\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4f46\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5185\u5bb9\u5ba1\u6838\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u6bd2\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6807\u6ce8\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6807\u7b7e\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u5757\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u52a0\u5165\u793e\u4f1a\u76f8\u5173\u6807\u7b7e\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5728\u7ebf\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u5ba1\u6838\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9896\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Pre-trained large segmentation models, especially\nSegment Anything Model (SAM), have sparked significant interest and inspired\nnew research directions in artificial intelligence.

However, continual fine-tuning\nLLMs across various domains often suffers from catastrophic forgetting,\ncharacterized by: 1) significant forgetting of their general capabilities, and\n2) sharp performance declines in previously learned tasks. To simultaneously\naddress both issues in a simple yet stable manner, we propose General Sample\nReplay (GeRe), a framework that use usual pretraining texts for efficient\nanti-forgetting. Beyond revisiting the most prevalent replay-based practices\nunder GeRe, we further leverage neural states to introduce a enhanced\nactivation states constrained optimization method using threshold-based margin\n(TM) loss, which maintains activation state consistency during replay learning.\nWe are the first to validate that a small, fixed set of pre-collected general\nreplay samples is sufficient to resolve both concerns--retaining general\ncapabilities while promoting overall performance across sequential tasks.\nIndeed, the former can inherently facilitate the latter.

Unlike traditional unimodal\ncontinual learning (CL), VLMs face unique challenges such as cross-modal\nfeature drift, parameter interference due to shared architectures, and\nzero-shot capability erosion. This survey offers the first focused and\nsystematic review of continual learning for VLMs (VLM-CL).

However, accurately forecasting crowd\ntrajectories remains a challenging task due to the inherently multimodal and\nuncertain nature of human motion. Recent diffusion-based models have shown\npromising results in capturing the stochasticity of pedestrian behavior for\ntrajectory prediction. However, few diffusion-based approaches explicitly\nincorporate the underlying motion intentions of pedestrians, which can limit\nthe interpretability and precision of prediction models. In this work, we\npropose a diffusion-based multimodal trajectory prediction model that\nincorporates pedestrians' motion intentions into the prediction framework. The\nmotion intentions are decomposed into lateral and longitudinal components, and\na pedestrian intention recognition module is introduced to enable the model to\neffectively capture these intentions.

However, when the 3D scene contains depth variations\nand the camera baseline is significant, noticeable parallax occurs-meaning the\nrelative positions of scene elements differ substantially between views. Most\nexisting stitching methods struggle to handle such images with large parallax\neffectively. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose an image\nstitching solution called PIS3R that is robust to very large parallax based on\nthe novel concept of deep 3D reconstruction. First, we apply visual geometry\ngrounded transformer to two input images with very large parallax to obtain\nboth intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, as well as the dense 3D scene\nreconstruction. Subsequently, we reproject reconstructed dense point cloud onto\na designated reference view using the recovered camera parameters, achieving\npixel-wise alignment and generating an initial stitched image. Finally, to\nfurther address potential artifacts such as holes or noise in the initial\nstitching, we propose a point-conditioned image diffusion module to obtain the\nrefined result.Compared with existing methods, our solution is very large\nparallax tolerant and also provides results that fully preserve the geometric\nintegrity of all pixels in the 3D photogrammetric context, enabling direct\napplicability to downstream 3D vision tasks such as SfM.

Recent\nadvancements in CSS have been largely driven by the adoption of Pre-trained\nVision Models (PVMs) as backbones. Among existing strategies, Direct\nFine-Tuning (DFT), which sequentially fine-tunes the model across classes,\nremains the most straightforward approach. Prior work often regards DFT as a\nperformance lower bound due to its presumed vulnerability to severe\ncatastrophic forgetting, leading to the development of numerous complex\nmitigation techniques. However, we contend that this prevailing assumption is\nflawed. In this paper, we systematically revisit forgetting in DFT across two\nstandard benchmarks, Pascal VOC 2012 and ADE20K, under eight CSS settings using\ntwo representative PVM backbones: ResNet101 and Swin-B. Through a detailed\nprobing analysis, our findings reveal that existing methods significantly\nunderestimate the inherent anti-forgetting capabilities of PVMs. Even under\nDFT, PVMs retain previously learned knowledge with minimal forgetting.

The\nVPT-Deep approach achieves a classification accuracy of 96.94% with just 0.322%\nof parameters fine-tuned, surpassing the traditional Full Fine Tuning (FFT)\nmethod by 0.61% and reducing training time by 45%.

Our key idea is to\ndecouple each line landmark into global and local components: a shared\nvanishing direction optimized on the unit sphere $\\mathcal{S}^2$, and scaled\nnormal vectors constrained on orthogonal subspaces, enabling compact encoding\nof structural regularities. For $n$ parallel lines, the proposed representation\nreduces the parameter space from $4n$ (orthonormal form) to $2n+2$, naturally\nembedding parallelism without explicit constraints. We further integrate this\nparameterization into a factor graph framework, allowing global direction\nalignment and local reprojection optimization within a unified manifold-based\nbundle adjustment.

As a solution, we propose our novel Deformable\nInter-Task Self-Attention for Multitask models that enables the much more\nefficient aggregation of information across the feature maps from different\ntasks. In our experiments on the NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context datasets, we\ndemonstrate an order-of-magnitude reduction in both FLOPs count and inference\nlatency.

In contrast, existing unsupervised temporal action\nsegmentation methods have focused primarily on video data, while skeleton\nsequences remain underexplored, despite their relevance to real-world\napplications, robustness, and privacy-preserving nature. In this paper, we\npropose a novel approach for unsupervised skeleton-based temporal action\nsegmentation. Our method utilizes a sequence-to-sequence temporal autoencoder\nthat keeps the information of the different joints disentangled in the\nembedding space. Latent skeleton sequences are then divided into\nnon-overlapping patches and quantized to obtain distinctive skeleton motion\nwords, driving the discovery of semantically meaningful action clusters.

Unlike regular video temporal grounding, OnVTG requires the\nmodel to make predictions without observing future frames. As online videos are\nstreaming inputs and can go on indefinitely, it is impractical and inefficient\nto store all historical inputs. The existing OnVTG models employ memory to\nstore recent historical video frame features and predict scores indicating\nwhether the current frame corresponds to the start or end time of the target\nevent. However, these methods lack effective event modeling and cannot retain\nlong-term historical information, leading to low performance. To tackle these\nchallenges, we propose a hierarchical event memory for OnVTG. We propose an\nevent-based OnVTG framework that makes predictions based on event proposals\nthat model event-level information with various durations.

On the other hand, to resolve the inherent mask\ndependency asymmetry between mask-guided VTON and mask-free VTOFF, we devise a\nphased training paradigm that progressively bridges this modality gap.\nExtensive qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted across the\nDressCode and VITON-HD datasets validate the efficacy and competitive edge of\nour proposed approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u5411\u670d\u88c5\u8f6c\u79fb\u6a21\u578b\uff08TWGTM\uff09\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u865a\u62df\u8bd5\u7a7f\uff08VTON\uff09\u548c\u865a\u62df\u8bd5\u8131\uff08VTOFF\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u7279\u5f81\u89e3\u8026\u548c\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e92\u8865\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u865a\u62df\u8bd5\u7a7f\u548c\u865a\u62df\u8bd5\u8131\u89c6\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5411\u7279\u5f81\u89e3\u8026\u548c\u53cc\u6761\u4ef6\u5f15\u5bfc\uff08\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u89e3\u51b3\u63a9\u6a21\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728DressCode\u548cVITON-HD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "TWGTM\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u51b3VTON\u548cVTOFF\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u53cc\u5411\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

However, most existing methods remain constrained by their reliance\non exhibition garments and segmentation masks, as well as their limited ability\nto handle flexible pose variations. These limitations reduce their practicality\nin real-world scenarios-for instance, users cannot easily transfer garments\nworn by one person onto another, and the generated try-on results are typically\nrestricted to the same pose as the reference image. In this paper, we introduce\n\\textbf{OMFA} (\\emph{One Model For All}), a unified diffusion framework for\nboth virtual try-on and try-off that operates without the need for exhibition\ngarments and supports arbitrary poses. For example, OMFA enables removing\ngarments from a source person (try-off) and transferring them onto a target\nperson (try-on), while also allowing the generated target to appear in novel\nposes-even without access to multi-pose images of that person. OMFA is built\nupon a novel \\emph{partial diffusion} strategy that selectively applies noise\nand denoising to individual components of the joint input-such as the garment,\nthe person image, or the face-enabling dynamic subtask control and efficient\nbidirectional garment-person transformation. The framework is entirely\nmask-free and requires only a single portrait and a target pose as input,\nmaking it well-suited for real-world applications. Additionally, by leveraging\nSMPL-X-based pose conditioning, OMFA supports multi-view and arbitrary-pose\ntry-on from just one image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OMFA\nachieves state-of-the-art results on both try-on and try-off tasks, providing a\npractical and generalizable solution for virtual garment synthesis.

Current\ndeep learning approaches predominantly concentrate on predicting transformation\nmatrices through imposing point-to-point geometric constraints for tooth\nalignment. Nevertheless, these matrices are likely associated with the\nanatomical structure of the human oral cavity and possess particular\ndistribution characteristics that the deterministic point-to-point geometric\nconstraints in prior work fail to capture. To address this, we introduce a new\nautomatic tooth alignment method named TAlignDiff, which is supported by\ndiffusion-based transformation learning. TAlignDiff comprises two main\ncomponents: a primary point cloud-based regression network (PRN) and a\ndiffusion-based transformation matrix denoising module (DTMD).\nGeometry-constrained losses supervise PRN learning for point cloud-level\nalignment.

In DDTracking, we introduce a\ndual-pathway encoding network that jointly models local spatial encoding\n(capturing fine-scale structural details at each streamline point) and global\ntemporal dependencies (ensuring long-range consistency across the entire\nstreamline). Furthermore, we design a conditional diffusion model module, which\nleverages the learned local and global embeddings to predict streamline\npropagation orientations for tractography in an end-to-end trainable manner. We\nconduct a comprehensive evaluation across diverse, independently acquired dMRI\ndatasets, including both synthetic and clinical data. Experiments on two\nwell-established benchmarks with ground truth (ISMRM Challenge and\nTractoInferno) demonstrate that DDTracking largely outperforms current\nstate-of-the-art tractography methods. Furthermore, our results highlight\nDDTracking's strong generalizability across heterogeneous datasets, spanning\nvarying health conditions, age groups, imaging protocols, and scanner types.\nCollectively, DDTracking offers anatomically plausible and robust tractography,\npresenting a scalable, adaptable, and end-to-end learnable solution for broad\ndMRI applications.

While generalist Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in natural\ngrounding tasks, they often struggle in the medical domain due to rare,\ncompositional, and domain-specific terms that are poorly aligned with visual\npatterns. Specialized medical VLMs address this challenge via large-scale\ndomain pretraining, but at the cost of substantial annotation and computational\nresources. To overcome these limitations, we propose \\textbf{Knowledge to Sight\n(K2Sight)}, a framework that introduces structured semantic supervision by\ndecomposing clinical concepts into interpretable visual attributes, such as\nshape, density, and anatomical location. These attributes are distilled from\ndomain ontologies and encoded into concise instruction-style prompts, which\nguide region-text alignment during training. Unlike conventional report-level\nsupervision, our approach explicitly bridges domain knowledge and spatial\nstructure, enabling data-efficient training of compact models. We train compact\nmodels with 0.23B and 2B parameters using only 1.5\\% of the data required by\nstate-of-the-art medical VLMs. Despite their small size and limited training\ndata, these models achieve performance on par with or better than 7B+ medical\nVLMs, with up to 9.82\\% improvement in $mAP_{50}$.

To address this limitation, we propose\nANPrompt, a novel prompt tuning framework designed to enhance robustness under\nsuch perturbations. ANPrompt first constructs weak noise text features by\nfusing original and noise-perturbed text embeddings, which are then clustered\nto form noise prompts. These noise prompts are integrated with learnable prompt\ntokens to generate anti-noise prompts, which are injected into the deeper\nlayers of both image and text encoders. To further capture the noise-aware\nvisual semantics, ANPrompt computes the Noise-Resistant Visual Prompt Prototype\n(NRVPP) by averaging the output prompt tokens from the vision encoder. Finally,\nANPrompt introduces alignment, robustness, and anti-noise objectives by\ncomputing a Weak semantic noise Alignment Loss (WALoss) alongside the standard\ncross-entropy and sim loss.

Project website:\n  https://matthew-leng.github.io/stocc", "summary": "3D occupancy becomes a promising perception representation for autonomous\ndriving to model the surrounding environment at a fine-grained scale. However,\nit remains challenging to efficiently aggregate 3D occupancy over time across\nmultiple input frames due to the high processing cost and the uncertainty and\ndynamics of voxels. To address this issue, we propose ST-Occ, a scene-level\noccupancy representation learning framework that effectively learns the\nspatiotemporal feature with temporal consistency. ST-Occ consists of two core\ndesigns: a spatiotemporal memory that captures comprehensive historical\ninformation and stores it efficiently through a scene-level representation and\na memory attention that conditions the current occupancy representation on the\nspatiotemporal memory with a model of uncertainty and dynamic awareness. Our\nmethod significantly enhances the spatiotemporal representation learned for 3D\noccupancy prediction tasks by exploiting the temporal dependency between\nmulti-frame inputs. Experiments show that our approach outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods by a margin of 3 mIoU and reduces the temporal\ninconsistency by 29%.", "AI": {"tldr": "ST-Occ\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e3D\u5360\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u4fe1\u606f\u6355\u83b7\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u5e27\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b3D\u5360\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u9ad8\u5904\u7406\u6210\u672c\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faST-Occ\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u65f6\u7a7a\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u5386\u53f2\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u57283D\u5360\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u53473 mIoU\uff0c\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u964d\u4f4e29%\u3002", "conclusion": "ST-Occ\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5efa\u6a21\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u5360\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}
