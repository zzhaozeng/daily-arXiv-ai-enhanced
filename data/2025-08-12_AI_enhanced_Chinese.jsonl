This paper introduces a\nCUDA-accelerated computational framework for simulating Pasur, emphasizing\nefficient memory management. We use our framework to compute near-Nash\nequilibria via Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR), a well-known algorithm\nfor solving large imperfect-information games.\n  Solving Pasur presents unique challenges due to its intricate rules and the\nlarge size of its game tree. We handle rule complexity using PyTorch CUDA\ntensors and to address the memory-intensive nature of the game, we decompose\nthe game tree into two key components: (1) actual game states, and (2)\ninherited scores from previous rounds. We construct the Full Game Tree by\npairing card states with accumulated scores in the Unfolding Process. This\ndesign reduces memory overhead by storing only essential strategy values and\nnode connections. To further manage computational complexity, we apply a\nround-by-round backward training strategy, starting from the final round and\nrecursively propagating average utilities to earlier stages. Our approach\nconstructs the complete game tree, which on average consists of over $10^9$\nnodes.

We further observe that replacing a large number of vision tokens\nwith only a few text tokens still enables LLaVA to generate similar answers,\nsuggesting that LMMs may rely primarily on a compact set of distilled textual\nrepresentations rather than raw vision features. Third, we show that a\ntraining-free connector can enhance LMM performance in fine-grained recognition\ntasks, without extensive feature-alignment training.

We break away from the typical generative approach that learns\nfrom a collection of 3D data. Instead, we reformulate shape generation as a\ncode-writing task, enabling greater modularity, editability, and integration\nwith artist workflows. Given a text prompt, LL3M coordinates a team of\nspecialized LLM agents to plan, retrieve, write, debug, and refine Blender\nscripts that generate and edit geometry and appearance. The generated code\nworks as a high-level, interpretable, human-readable, well-documented\nrepresentation of scenes and objects, making full use of sophisticated Blender\nconstructs (e.g. B-meshes, geometry modifiers, shader nodes) for diverse,\nunconstrained shapes, materials, and scenes. This code presents many avenues\nfor further agent and human editing and experimentation via code tweaks or\nprocedural parameters. This medium naturally enables a co-creative loop in our\nsystem: agents can automatically self-critique using code and visuals, while\niterative user instructions provide an intuitive way to refine assets. A shared\ncode context across agents enables awareness of previous attempts, and a\nretrieval-augmented generation knowledge base built from Blender API\ndocumentation, BlenderRAG, equips agents with examples, types, and functions\nempowering advanced modeling operations and code correctness.

However, these methods often struggle in challenging scenarios\ninvolving complex human poses or significant occlusions. Although some studies\naddress 3D human pose estimation under occlusion, they typically evaluate\nperformance on datasets that lack realistic or substantial occlusions, e.g.,\nmost existing datasets introduce occlusions with random patches over the human\nor clipart-style overlays, which may not reflect real-world challenges. To\nbridge this gap in realistic occlusion datasets, we introduce a novel benchmark\ndataset, VOccl3D, a Video-based human Occlusion dataset with 3D body pose and\nshape annotations. Inspired by works such as AGORA and BEDLAM, we constructed\nthis dataset using advanced computer graphics rendering techniques,\nincorporating diverse real-world occlusion scenarios, clothing textures, and\nhuman motions. Additionally, we fine-tuned recent HPS methods, CLIFF and\nBEDLAM-CLIFF, on our dataset, demonstrating significant qualitative and\nquantitative improvements across multiple public datasets, as well as on the\ntest split of our dataset, while comparing its performance with other\nstate-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we leveraged our dataset to enhance\nhuman detection performance under occlusion by fine-tuning an existing object\ndetector, YOLO11, thus leading to a robust end-to-end HPS estimation system\nunder occlusions. Overall, this dataset serves as a valuable resource for\nfuture research aimed at benchmarking methods designed to handle occlusions,\noffering a more realistic alternative to existing occlusion datasets.

Human evaluations reveal that LLMs achieve\naccuracy (meaning) more effectively than fluency (grammaticality).\n  These findings suggest LLM translation evaluation benefits from\nmultidimensional assessment beyond simple accuracy metrics, and that grammar\nalone, without parallel sentences, does not provide sufficient context for\neffective domain-specific translation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u8d44\u6e90\uff08\u5982\u8bed\u6cd5\u3001\u8bcd\u5178\u548c\u5e73\u884c\u53e5\u5b50\uff09\u63d0\u5347LLM\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982Kanuri\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5e73\u884c\u53e5\u5b50\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u800c\u8bed\u6cd5\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "Kanuri\u8bed\u8a00\u867d\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u4f17\u591a\u4f46\u6570\u5b57\u8d44\u6e90\u532e\u4e4f\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u8d44\u6e90\u63d0\u5347LLM\u5728\u8be5\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5065\u5eb7\u548c\u901a\u7528\u672f\u8bed\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u8d44\u6e90\u7ec4\u5408\uff08\u8bed\u6cd5\u3001\u8bcd\u5178\u3001\u5e73\u884c\u53e5\u5b50\uff09\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4LLM\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5e73\u884c\u53e5\u5b50\u6548\u679c\u6700\u597d\uff0c\u8bed\u6cd5\u867d\u4f18\u4e8e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4f46\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1bLLM\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u7ffb\u8bd1\u9700\u591a\u7ef4\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4ec5\u8bed\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0c\u5e73\u884c\u53e5\u5b50\u662f\u5173\u952e\u8d44\u6e90\u3002"}}

The most commonly used Polling-based Object Probing\nEvaluation (POPE) benchmark evaluates this issue by sampling negative\ncategories according to category-level statistics, \\textit{e.g.}, category\nfrequencies and co-occurrence. However, with the continuous advancement of\nLVLMs, the POPE benchmark has shown diminishing effectiveness in assessing\nobject hallucination, as it employs a simplistic sampling strategy that\noverlooks image-specific information and restricts distractors to negative\nobject categories only. In this paper, we introduce the Hallucination\nsearching-based Object Probing Evaluation (HOPE) benchmark, aiming to generate\nthe most misleading distractors (\\textit{i.e.}, non-existent objects or\nincorrect image descriptions) that can trigger hallucination in LVLMs, which\nserves as a means to more rigorously assess their immunity to hallucination. To\nexplore the image-specific information, the content-aware hallucination\nsearching leverages Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) to\napproximate the predictive behavior of LVLMs by selecting negative objects with\nthe highest predicted likelihood as distractors. To expand the scope of\nhallucination assessment, the description-based hallucination searching\nconstructs highly misleading distractors by pairing true objects with false\ndescriptions. Experimental results show that HOPE leads to a precision drop of\nat least 9\\% and up to 23\\% across various state-of-the-art LVLMs,\nsignificantly outperforming POPE in exposing hallucination vulnerabilities.

Effective\nand efficient analysis of their oral history archives can promote access and\nunderstanding of the oral histories. However, Large-scale analysis of these\narchives remains limited due to their unstructured format, emotional\ncomplexity, and high annotation costs. This paper presents a scalable framework\nto automate semantic and sentiment annotation for Japanese American\nIncarceration Oral History. Using LLMs, we construct a high-quality dataset,\nevaluate multiple models, and test prompt engineering strategies in\nhistorically sensitive contexts. Our multiphase approach combines expert\nannotation, prompt design, and LLM evaluation with ChatGPT, Llama, and Qwen. We\nlabeled 558 sentences from 15 narrators for sentiment and semantic\nclassification, then evaluated zero-shot, few-shot, and RAG strategies. For\nsemantic classification, ChatGPT achieved the highest F1 score (88.71%),\nfollowed by Llama (84.99%) and Qwen (83.72%). For sentiment analysis, Llama\nslightly outperformed Qwen (82.66%) and ChatGPT (82.29%), with all models\nshowing comparable results. The best prompt configurations were used to\nannotate 92,191 sentences from 1,002 interviews in the JAIOH collection. Our\nfindings show that LLMs can effectively perform semantic and sentiment\nannotation across large oral history collections when guided by well-designed\nprompts. This study provides a reusable annotation pipeline and practical\nguidance for applying LLMs in culturally sensitive archival analysis.

Utility Control for AI Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Training deep neural networks (DNNs) has become an increasingly\nresource-intensive task, requiring large volumes of labeled data, substantial\ncomputational power, and considerable fine-tuning efforts to achieve optimal\nperformance across diverse use cases. Although pre-trained models offer a\nuseful starting point, adapting them to meet specific user needs often demands\nextensive customization, and infrastructure overhead. This challenge grows when\na single model must support diverse appli-cations with differing requirements\nfor performance. Traditional solutions often involve training multiple model\nversions to meet varying requirements, which can be inefficient and difficult\nto maintain. In order to overcome this challenge, we propose NNObfuscator, a\nnovel utility control mechanism that enables AI models to dynamically modify\ntheir performance according to predefined conditions. It is different from\ntraditional methods that need separate models for each user. Instead,\nNNObfuscator allows a single model to be adapted in real time, giving you\ncontrolled access to multiple levels of performance. This mechanism enables\nmodel owners set up tiered access, ensuring that free-tier users receive a\nbaseline level of performance while premium users benefit from enhanced\ncapabilities. The approach improves resource allocation, reduces unnecessary\ncomputation, and supports sustainable business models in AI deployment. To\nvalidate our approach, we conducted experiments on multiple tasks, including\nimage classification, semantic segmentation, and text to image generation,\nusing well-established models such as ResNet, DeepLab, VGG16, FCN and Stable\nDiffusion.

However, these models face inherent limitations in handling\nmulti-modal reasoning, semantic abstraction, and interactive decision-making.\nWhile recent advances have introduced Large Language Models (LLMs) into remote\nsensing workflows, existing studies primarily focus on downstream applications,\nlacking a unified theoretical framework that explains the cognitive role of\nlanguage. This review advocates a paradigm shift from vision-centered to\nlanguage-centered remote sensing interpretation. Drawing inspiration from the\nGlobal Workspace Theory (GWT) of human cognition, We propose a\nlanguage-centered framework for remote sensing interpretation that treats LLMs\nas the cognitive central hub integrating perceptual, task, knowledge and action\nspaces to enable unified understanding, reasoning, and decision-making. We\nfirst explore the potential of LLMs as the central cognitive component in\nremote sensing interpretation, and then summarize core technical challenges,\nincluding unified multimodal representation, knowledge association, and\nreasoning and decision-making. Furthermore, we construct a global\nworkspace-driven interpretation mechanism and review how language-centered\nsolutions address each challenge. Finally, we outline future research\ndirections from four perspectives: adaptive alignment of multimodal data, task\nunderstanding under dynamic knowledge constraints, trustworthy reasoning, and\nautonomous interaction.

However, label errors, defined as missing labels,\nincorrect classification or inaccurate localization, often compromise the\nquality of these datasets. This can have a significant impact on the outcomes\nof training and benchmark evaluations. Although several methods now exist for\ndetecting label errors in object detection datasets, they are typically\nvalidated only on synthetic benchmarks or limited manual inspection. How to\ncorrect such errors systemically and at scale therefore remains an open\nproblem. We introduce a semi-automated framework for label-error correction\ncalled REC$\\checkmark$D (Rechecked). Building on existing detectors, the\nframework pairs their error proposals with lightweight, crowd-sourced\nmicrotasks. These tasks enable multiple annotators to independently verify each\ncandidate bounding box, and their responses are aggregated to estimate\nambiguity and improve label quality. To demonstrate the effectiveness of\nREC$\\checkmark$D, we apply it to the class pedestrian in the KITTI dataset. Our\ncrowdsourced review yields high-quality corrected annotations, which indicate a\nrate of at least 24% of missing and inaccurate annotations in original\nannotations. This validated set will be released as a new real-world benchmark\nfor label error detection and correction. We show that current label error\ndetection methods, when combined with our correction framework, can recover\nhundreds of errors in the time it would take a human to annotate bounding boxes\nfrom scratch.

Three core challenges impede the development\nof end-to-end AI severe weather system: (1) scarcity of severe weather event\nsamples; (2) imperfect alignment between high-dimensional meteorological data\nand textual warnings; (3) existing multimodal language models are unable to\nhandle high-dimensional meteorological data and struggle to fully capture the\ncomplex dependencies across temporal sequences, vertical pressure levels, and\nspatial dimensions. To address these challenges, we introduce MP-Bench, the\nfirst large-scale temporal multimodal dataset for severe weather events\nprediction, comprising 421,363 pairs of raw multi-year meteorological data and\ncorresponding text caption, covering a wide range of severe weather scenarios\nacross China. On top of this dataset, we develop a meteorology multimodal large\nmodel (MMLM) that directly ingests 4D meteorological inputs. In addition, it is\ndesigned to accommodate the unique characteristics of 4D meteorological data\nflow, incorporating three plug-and-play adaptive fusion modules that enable\ndynamic feature extraction and integration across temporal sequences, vertical\npressure layers, and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments on MP-Bench\ndemonstrate that MMLM performs exceptionally well across multiple tasks,\nhighlighting its effectiveness in severe weather understanding and marking a\nkey step toward realizing automated, AI-driven weather forecasting systems. Our\nsource code and dataset will be made publicly available.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684AI\u6c14\u8c61\u7ad9\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08MMLM\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6MP-Bench\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6c14\u8c61\u9884\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u3001\u6837\u672c\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5584\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6c14\u8c61\u9884\u8b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u4e13\u5bb6\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002AI\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u4e3a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6c14\u8c61\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u6837\u672c\u7a00\u7f3a\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaMP-Bench\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08421,363\u5bf9\u6c14\u8c61\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u6807\u6ce8\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1MMLM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u5904\u74064D\u6c14\u8c61\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eMMLM\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6c14\u8c61\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6c14\u8c61\u9884\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "MMLM\u548cMP-Bench\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6c14\u8c61\u9884\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\u548c\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5c06\u516c\u5f00\u3002"}}

While automated formalization\noffers a potential solution, it faces two major challenges: model hallucination\n(e.g., undefined predicates, symbol misuse, and version incompatibility) and\nthe semantic gap caused by ambiguous or missing premises in natural language\ndescriptions. To address these issues, we propose CRAMF, a Concept-driven\nRetrieval-Augmented Mathematical Formalization framework. CRAMF enhances\nLLM-based autoformalization by retrieving formal definitions of core\nmathematical concepts, providing contextual grounding during code generation.\nHowever, applying retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in this setting is\nnon-trivial due to the lack of structured knowledge bases, the polymorphic\nnature of mathematical concepts, and the high precision required in formal\nretrieval. We introduce a framework for automatically constructing a\nconcept-definition knowledge base from Mathlib4, the standard mathematical\nlibrary for the Lean 4 theorem prover, indexing over 26,000 formal definitions\nand 1,000+ core mathematical concepts.

We introduce DatasetResearch, the first comprehensive benchmark\nevaluating AI agents' ability to discover and synthesize datasets from 208\nreal-world demands across knowledge-intensive and reasoning-intensive tasks.\nOur tri-dimensional evaluation framework reveals a stark reality: even advanced\ndeep research systems achieve only 22% score on our challenging\nDatasetResearch-pro subset, exposing the vast gap between current capabilities\nand perfect dataset discovery. Our analysis uncovers a fundamental\ndichotomy-search agents excel at knowledge tasks through retrieval breadth,\nwhile synthesis agents dominate reasoning challenges via structured\ngeneration-yet both catastrophically fail on \"corner cases\" outside existing\ndistributions. These findings establish the first rigorous baseline for dataset\ndiscovery agents and illuminate the path toward AI systems capable of finding\nany dataset in the digital universe.

Unlike GAN-based methods, our approach integrates\ndiffusion models to learn the image translation process, allowing for more\ncoverable modeling of the data distribution and performance improvement of the\ncross-domain translation. However, incorporating the translation process within\nthe diffusion process is still challenging since the two processes are not\naligned exactly, i.e., the diffusion process is applied to the noisy signal\nwhile the translation process is conducted on the clean signal. As a result,\nrecent diffusion-based studies employ separate training or shallow integration\nto learn the two processes, yet this may cause the local minimal of the\ntranslation optimization, constraining the effectiveness of diffusion models.\nTo address the problem, we propose a novel joint learning framework that aligns\nthe diffusion and the translation process, thereby improving the global\noptimality.

We evaluate five\nrecently published LLMs and find confidence disparities as high as 40% along\nvarious demographic attributes including body type, sexual orientation and\nsocio-economic status, with models being most uncertain about\ndoubly-disadvantaged identities in anti-stereotypical settings.

With the reduced-sized micro-expression (ME) input that contains key\ninformation based on key-frame indexes, key-frame-based methods have\nsignificantly improved the performance of MER. However, most of these methods\nfocus on improving the performance with relatively accurate key-frame indexes,\nwhile ignoring the difficulty of obtaining accurate key-frame indexes and the\nobjective existence of key-frame index errors, which impedes them from moving\ntowards practical applications. In this paper, we propose CausalNet, a novel\nframework to achieve robust MER facing key-frame index errors while maintaining\naccurate recognition. To enhance robustness, CausalNet takes the representation\nof the entire ME sequence as the input. To address the information redundancy\nbrought by the complete ME range input and maintain accurate recognition,\nfirst, the Causal Motion Position Learning Module (CMPLM) is proposed to help\nthe model locate the muscle movement areas related to Action Units (AUs),\nthereby reducing the attention to other redundant areas. Second, the Causal\nAttention Block (CAB) is proposed to deeply learn the causal relationships\nbetween the muscle contraction and relaxation movements in MEs. Empirical\nexperiments have demonstrated that on popular ME benchmarks, the CausalNet has\nachieved robust MER under different levels of key-frame index noise.

AR models generate images by\nautoregressively predicting a sequence of visual tokens that are then decoded\ninto pixels using a vector-quantized decoder. Inspired by red-green watermarks\nfor large language models, we examine token-level watermarking schemes that\nbias the next-token prediction based on prior tokens. We find that a direct\ntransfer of these schemes works in principle, but the detectability of the\nwatermarks decreases considerably under common image perturbations. As a\nremedy, we propose two novel watermarking methods that rely on visual token\nclustering to assign similar tokens to the same set. Firstly, we investigate a\ntraining-free approach that relies on a cluster lookup table, and secondly, we\nfinetune VAE encoders to predict token clusters directly from perturbed images.\nOverall, our experiments show that cluster-level watermarks improve robustness\nagainst perturbations and regeneration attacks while preserving image quality.\nCluster classification further boosts watermark detectability, outperforming a\nset of baselines.

We introduce MAQuA, an adaptive\nquestion-asking framework for simultaneous, multidimensional mental health\nscreening. Combining multi-outcome modeling on language responses with item\nresponse theory (IRT) and factor analysis, MAQuA selects the questions with\nmost informative responses across multiple dimensions at each turn to optimize\ndiagnostic information, improving accuracy and potentially reducing response\nburden.

Recent works show that when labeled data\noriginates from several distinct sources (e.g., datasets and cameras),\nconsidering each source separately and applying multi-source domain adaptation\n(MSDA) typically yields higher accuracy and robustness compared to blending the\nsources and performing conventional UDA. However, state-of-the-art MSDA methods\nlearn domain-specific backbone models or require access to source domain data\nduring adaptation, resulting in significant growth in training parameters and\ncomputational cost. In this paper, a Source-free Adaptive Gated Experts\n(SAGE-reID) method is introduced for person reID. Our SAGE-reID is a\ncost-effective, source-free MSDA method that first trains individual\nsource-specific low-rank adapters (LoRA) through source-free UDA.

The subspace clustering, as a\nfundamental technique of MC, has attracted significant attention. In this\npaper, we propose a novel joint sparse self-representation learning model for\nMC, where a featured difference is the extraction of view-specific local\ninformation by introducing cardinality (i.e., $\\ell_0$-norm) constraints\ninstead of Graph-Laplacian regularization. Specifically, under each view,\ncardinality constraints directly restrict the samples used in the\nself-representation stage to extract reliable local and global structure\ninformation, while the low-rank constraint aids in revealing a global coherent\nstructure in the consensus affinity matrix during merging. The attendant\nchallenge is that Augmented Lagrange Method (ALM)-based alternating\nminimization algorithms cannot guarantee convergence when applied directly to\nour nonconvex, nonsmooth model, thus resulting in poor generalization ability.\nTo address it, we develop an alternating quadratic penalty (AQP) method with\nglobal convergence, where two subproblems are iteratively solved by closed-form\nsolutions.

Additionally, unlike existing tool-use benchmarks\nwith high success rates in functions like programming and math functions, the\nsuccess rate of real-world MCP tool is not guaranteed and varies across\ndifferent MCP servers. Furthermore, the LLMs' context window also limits the\nnumber of available tools that can be called in a single run, because the\ntextual descriptions of tool and the parameters have long token length for an\nLLM to process all at once.

Within this framework, a server extracts and transmits the\nsemantic information, i.e., the meaning of image data, to a user over several\ntime slots. An attacker seeks to detect and eavesdrop the semantic transmission\nto acquire details of the original image. To avoid data meaning being\neavesdropped by an attacker, a friendly jammer is deployed to transmit jamming\nsignals to interfere the attacker so as to hide the transmitted semantic\ninformation. Meanwhile, the server will strategically select time slots for\nsemantic information transmission. Due to limited energy, the jammer will not\ncommunicate with the server and hence the server does not know the transmit\npower of the jammer. Therefore, the server must jointly optimize the semantic\ninformation transmitted at each time slot and the corresponding transmit power\nto maximize the privacy and the semantic information transmission quality of\nthe user. To solve this problem, we propose a prioritised sampling assisted\ntwin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm to jointly determine\nthe transmitted semantic information and the transmit power per time slot\nwithout the communications between the server and the jammer. Compared to\nstandard reinforcement learning methods, the propose method uses an additional\nQ network to estimate Q values such that the agent can select the action with a\nlower Q value from the two Q networks thus avoiding local optimal action\nselection and estimation bias of Q values.

The inherent gap between visual and\ntextual modalities makes the embeddings from the vision projector critical for\nvisual comprehension. However, current alignment approaches treat visual\nembeddings as contextual cues and merely apply auto-regressive supervision to\ntextual outputs, neglecting the necessity of introducing equivalent direct\nvisual supervision, which hinders the potential finer alignment of visual\nembeddings. In this paper, based on our analysis of the refinement process of\nvisual embeddings in the LLM's shallow layers, we propose BASIC, a method that\nutilizes refined visual embeddings within the LLM as supervision to directly\nguide the projector in generating initial visual embeddings. Specifically, the\nguidance is conducted from two perspectives: (i) optimizing embedding\ndirections by reducing angles between initial and supervisory embeddings in\nsemantic space; (ii) improving semantic matching by minimizing disparities\nbetween the logit distributions of both visual embeddings. Without additional\nsupervisory models or artificial annotations, BASIC significantly improves the\nperformance of MLLMs across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating the\neffectiveness of our introduced direct visual supervision.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aBASIC\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u76d1\u7763\u89c6\u89c9\u5d4c\u5165\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "method": "BASIC\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528LLM\u6d45\u5c42\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5d4c\u5165\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u4ece\u4e24\u4e2a\u89d2\u5ea6\u6307\u5bfc\u89c6\u89c9\u6295\u5f71\u5668\u751f\u6210\u521d\u59cb\u5d4c\u5165\uff1a\u4f18\u5316\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u6539\u5584\u8bed\u4e49\u5339\u914d\u3002", "result": "BASIC\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86MLLMs\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76f4\u63a5\u89c6\u89c9\u76d1\u7763\u662f\u63d0\u5347MLLMs\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Prior work has identified positional biases, such as the\nLost in the Middle (LiM) effect, where models perform better when information\nappears at the beginning (primacy bias) or end (recency bias) of the input,\nrather than in the middle. However, long-context studies have not consistently\nreplicated these effects, raising questions about their intensity and the\nconditions under which they manifest. To address this, we conducted a\ncomprehensive analysis using relative rather than absolute input lengths,\ndefined with respect to each model's context window.

Furthermore, our results suggest\nthat successful retrieval is a prerequisite for reasoning in LLMs, and that the\nobserved positional biases in reasoning are largely inherited from retrieval.\nThese insights have implications for long-context tasks, the design of future\nLLM benchmarks, and evaluation methodologies for LLMs handling extended inputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u957f\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5982\u201c\u8ff7\u5931\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u201d\uff08LiM\uff09\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u5f53\u8f93\u5165\u5360\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u768450%\u4ee5\u5185\u65f6\uff0cLiM\u6548\u5e94\u6700\u5f3a\uff1b\u8d85\u8fc7\u540e\uff0c\u9996\u56e0\u6548\u5e94\u51cf\u5f31\uff0c\u800c\u8fd1\u56e0\u6548\u5e94\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u68c0\u7d22\u662fLLMs\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u524d\u63d0\uff0c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u5dee\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8LLMs\u5728\u957f\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u5dee\uff08\u5982LiM\u6548\u5e94\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u8868\u73b0\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u957f\u5ea6\uff08\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "LiM\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u5360\u7a97\u53e350%\u4ee5\u5185\u65f6\u6700\u5f3a\uff1b\u8d85\u8fc7\u540e\uff0c\u9996\u56e0\u6548\u5e94\u51cf\u5f31\uff0c\u8fd1\u56e0\u6548\u5e94\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u4e14\u63a8\u7406\u504f\u5dee\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u957f\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u5dee\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u57fa\u51c6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u542f\u793a\u3002"}}

Quality Estimation (QE) for Machine\nTranslation (MT), which assesses the quality of a source-target pair without\nrelying on reference translations, remains a challenging cross-lingual task for\nLLMs. The challenges stem from the inherent limitations of existing LLM-based\nQE systems, which are pre-trained for causal language modelling rather than\nregression-specific tasks, further elevated by the presence of low-resource\nlanguages given pre-training data distribution. This paper introduces ALOPE, an\nadaptive layer-optimization framework designed to enhance LLM-based QE by\nrestructuring Transformer representations through layer-wise adaptation for\nimproved regression-based prediction. Our framework integrates low-rank\nadapters (LoRA) with regression task heads, leveraging selected pre-trained\nTransformer layers for improved cross-lingual alignment. In addition to the\nlayer-specific adaptation, ALOPE introduces two strategies-dynamic weighting,\nwhich adaptively combines representations from multiple layers, and multi-head\nregression, which aggregates regression losses from multiple heads for QE. Our\nframework shows improvements over various existing LLM-based QE approaches.\nEmpirical evidence suggests that intermediate Transformer layers in LLMs\nprovide contextual representations that are more aligned with the cross-lingual\nnature of the QE task.

Furthermore, the prevalence of audio-visual\nco-expressions in SVs leads to the local biases and collective information gaps\ncaused by the inconsistencies in emotional expressions.

Talk2Image enables\nstep-by-step alignment with user intention and consistent image editing.\nExperiments demonstrate that Talk2Image outperforms existing baselines in\ncontrollability, coherence, and user satisfaction across iterative image\ngeneration and editing tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Talk2Image\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5355\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u610f\u56fe\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u4e0d\u8fde\u8d2f\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u8f6e\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u591a\u8f6e\u521b\u610f\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4e14\u5355\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bb9\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u610f\u56fe\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u4e0d\u8fde\u8d2f\u3002", "method": "Talk2Image\u901a\u8fc7\u610f\u56fe\u89e3\u6790\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u4e0e\u534f\u4f5c\u6267\u884c\u3001\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u53cd\u9988\u9a71\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTalk2Image\u5728\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3001\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u7528\u6237\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "Talk2Image\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u610f\u56fe\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u4e0d\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

If the uncertainty in the\nprobabilities is independent between the states, known as s-rectangularity,\nsuch optimal robust policies can be computed efficiently using robust value\niteration. However, there might still be multiple optimal robust policies,\nwhich, while equivalent with respect to the worst-case, reflect different\nexpected returns under non-adversarial choices of the transition probabilities.\nHence, we propose a refined policy selection criterion for RMDPs, drawing\ninspiration from the notions of dominance and best-effort in game theory.\nInstead of seeking a policy that only maximizes the worst-case expected return,\nwe additionally require the policy to achieve a maximal expected return under\ndifferent (i.e., not fully adversarial) transition probabilities. We call such\na policy an optimal robust best-effort (ORBE) policy. We prove that ORBE\npolicies always exist, characterize their structure, and present an algorithm\nto compute them with a small overhead compared to standard robust value\niteration.

To overcome this limitation, we introduce Grove MoE,\na novel architecture incorporating experts of varying sizes, inspired by the\nheterogeneous big.LITTLE CPU architecture. This architecture features novel\nadjugate experts with a dynamic activation mechanism, enabling model capacity\nexpansion while maintaining manageable computational overhead. Building on this\narchitecture, we present GroveMoE-Base and GroveMoE-Inst, 33B-parameter LLMs\ndeveloped by applying an upcycling strategy to the Qwen3-30B-A3B-Base model\nduring mid-training and post-training.

Most existing research focuses on\ncombining evidence within the same frame of discernment. However, in real-world\nscenarios, trained algorithms or data often originate from different regions or\norganizations, where data silos are prevalent. As a result, using different\ndata sources or models to generate basic probability assignments may lead to\nheterogeneous frames, for which traditional fusion methods often yield\nunsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, this study proposes an\nopen-world information fusion method, termed Full Negation Belief\nTransformation (FNBT), based on the Dempster-Shafer theory. More specially, a\ncriterion is introduced to determine whether a given fusion task belongs to the\nopen-world setting.

In this paper, we\ninvestigate: whether top-performing LLMs, which might be perceived as having\nexpert-level proficiency in academic and professional benchmarks, can serve as\ndirect alternatives to human expert annotators? To this end, we evaluate both\nindividual LLMs and multi-agent approaches across three highly specialized\ndomains: finance, biomedicine, and law. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent\ndiscussion framework to simulate a group of human annotators, where LLMs are\ntasked to engage in discussions by considering others' annotations and\njustifications before finalizing their labels. Additionally, we incorporate\nreasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) to enable a more comprehensive comparison. Our\nempirical results reveal that: (1) Individual LLMs equipped with inference-time\ntechniques (e.g., chain-of-thought (CoT), self-consistency) show only marginal\nor even negative performance gains, contrary to prior literature suggesting\ntheir broad effectiveness.

In contrast to approaches that rely solely on LLM to\nproduce solutions directly, the proposed method focuses on discovering a\nmathematically compatible formulation that can be efficiently solved by\noff-the-shelf optimization solvers. Directly using LLMs to produce solutions\noften leads to infeasible or suboptimal results, as these models lack the\nnumerical precision and constraint-handling capabilities of established\noptimization solvers.

However, the\naccuracy of clinical practice is often hindered by missing or unusable slices\ndue to various factors. Volumetric MRI synthesis methods have been developed to\naddress this issue by imputing missing slices from available ones. The inherent\n3D nature of volumetric MRI data, such as cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR),\nposes significant challenges for missing slice imputation approaches, including\n(1) the difficulty of modeling local inter-slice correlations and dependencies\nof volumetric slices, and (2) the limited exploration of crucial 3D spatial\ninformation and global context.

However, their\ndependence on large neural architectures and the restricted accessibility of\npretraining data significantly limits their practicality in real-world\napplications. To address this limitation, we propose Dynamic Pattern Alignment\nLearning (DPAL), a novel distillation-based pretraining framework that\nefficiently trains lightweight HVMs to acquire strong generalization from large\nHVMs. In particular, human-centric visual perception are highly dependent on\nthree typical visual patterns, including global identity pattern, local shape\npattern and multi-person interaction pattern. To achieve generalizable\nlightweight HVMs, we firstly design a dynamic pattern decoder (D-PaDe), acting\nas a dynamic Mixture of Expert (MoE) model. It incorporates three specialized\nexperts dedicated to adaptively extract typical visual patterns, conditioned on\nboth input image and pattern queries.

With these two deliberate designs, the DPAL\neffectively guides lightweight model to learn all typical human visual patterns\nfrom large HVMs, which can generalize to various human-centric vision tasks.\nExtensive experiments conducted on 15 challenging datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the DPAL.

A key challenge underlying this limitation is the\nmodality gap between speech and text representations. The high variability in\nspeech embeddings may allow SLMs to achieve strong in-domain performance by\nexploiting unintended speech variations, ultimately hindering generalization.\nTo mitigate this modality gap, we introduce Optimal Transport Regularization\n(OTReg), a method that formulates speech-text alignment as an optimal transport\nproblem and derives a regularization loss to improve SLM training. In each\ntraining iteration, OTReg first establishes a structured correspondence between\nspeech and transcript embeddings by determining the optimal transport plan,\nthen incorporates the regularization loss based on this transport plan to\noptimize SLMs in generating speech embeddings that align more effectively with\ntranscript embeddings. OTReg is lightweight, requiring no additional labels or\nlearnable parameters, and integrates seamlessly into existing SLM training\nprocedures. Extensive multilingual ASR experiments demonstrate that OTReg\nenhances speech-text alignment, mitigates the modality gap, and consequently\nimproves SLM generalization across diverse datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aOTReg\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u51cf\u5c11\u8bed\u97f3\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08SLMs\uff09\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8bed\u97f3\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u672a\u6309\u9884\u671f\u4ee5\u6587\u672c\u65b9\u5f0f\u5904\u7406\u8bed\u97f3\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u8bed\u97f3\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff08OTReg\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u8bed\u97f3\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u635f\u5931\u4f18\u5316SLMs\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cOTReg\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u97f3\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3aSLMs\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00ASR\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "OTReg\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u6807\u7b7e\u6216\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u53ef\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709SLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Current RVOS methods view referring\nexpressions as unstructured sequences, neglecting their crucial semantic\nstructure essential for referent reasoning. Besides, in contrast to\nimage-referring expressions whose semantics focus only on object attributes and\nobject-object relations, video-referring expressions also encompass event\nattributes and event-event temporal relations. This complexity challenges\ntraditional structured reasoning image approaches. In this paper, we propose\nthe Event Referential Reasoning (EventRR) framework. EventRR decouples RVOS\ninto object summarization part and referent reasoning part. The summarization\nphase begins by summarizing each frame into a set of bottleneck tokens, which\nare then efficiently aggregated in the video-level summarization step to\nexchange the global cross-modal temporal context. For reasoning part, EventRR\nextracts semantic eventful structure of a video-referring expression into\nhighly expressive Referential Event Graph (REG), which is a single-rooted\ndirected acyclic graph. Guided by topological traversal of REG, we propose\nTemporal Concept-Role Reasoning (TCRR) to accumulate the referring score of\neach temporal query from REG leaf nodes to root node.

However,\nexisting methods often neglect depth information, which hurts similarity\nmatching, results in attention distractions in shallow depth-of-field (DoF)\nscenarios, and excessive enhancement of background content in deep DoF\nsettings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Depth-Guided\nNetwork (DGN) for image restoration, together with a novel large-scale\nhigh-resolution dataset. Specifically, the network consists of two interactive\nbranches: a depth estimation branch that provides structural guidance, and an\nimage restoration branch that performs the core restoration task. In addition,\nthe image restoration branch exploits intra-object similarity through\nprogressive window-based self-attention and captures inter-object similarity\nvia sparse non-local attention.

In fact, the content semantics conveyed by real images often conform\nto human cognitive laws. However, image manipulation technology usually\ndestroys the internal relationship between content features, thus leaving\nsemantic clues for IML. In this paper, we propose a cognition-inspired\nmultimodal boundary-preserving network (CMB-Net). Specifically, CMB-Net\nutilizes large language models (LLMs) to analyze manipulated regions within\nimages and generate prompt-based textual information to compensate for the lack\nof semantic relationships in the visual information. Considering that the\nerroneous texts induced by hallucination from LLMs will damage the accuracy of\nIML, we propose an image-text central ambiguity module (ITCAM).

However, maintaining appearance\nconsistency with static input images and mitigating abrupt motion transitions\nin generated animations remain persistent challenges. While text-to-video (T2V)\ngeneration has demonstrated impressive performance with diffusion transformer\nmodels, the image animation field still largely relies on U-Net-based diffusion\nmodels, which lag behind the latest T2V approaches. Moreover, the quadratic\ncomplexity of vanilla self-attention mechanisms in Transformers imposes heavy\ncomputational demands, making image animation particularly resource-intensive.\nTo address these issues, we propose MiraMo, a framework designed to enhance\nefficiency, appearance consistency, and motion smoothness in image animation.\nSpecifically, MiraMo introduces three key elements: (1) A foundational\ntext-to-video architecture replacing vanilla self-attention with efficient\nlinear attention to reduce computational overhead while preserving generation\nquality; (2) A novel motion residual learning paradigm that focuses on modeling\nmotion dynamics rather than directly predicting frames, improving temporal\nconsistency; and (3) A DCT-based noise refinement strategy during inference to\nsuppress sudden motion artifacts, complemented by a dynamics control module to\nbalance motion smoothness and expressiveness. Extensive experiments against\nstate-of-the-art methods validate the superiority of MiraMo in generating\nconsistent, smooth, and controllable animations with accelerated inference\nspeed.

We cover two key aspects: (1) exploring different visual\ngrounding paradigms in MLLMs, identifying the most effective design, and\nproviding our insights; and (2) conducting ablation studies on the design of\ngrounding data to optimize MLLMs' fine-tuning for the VG task. Finally, our\nfindings contribute to a stronger MLLM for VG, achieving improvements of +5.6%\n/ +6.9% / +7.0% on RefCOCO/+/g over the LLaVA-1.5.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u63a5\u5730\uff08VG\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LLaVA-1.5\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728MLLMs\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u63a5\u5730\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528LLaVA-1.5\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89c9\u63a5\u5730\u8303\u5f0f\u548c\u6570\u636e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9VG\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684MLLM\u5728RefCOCO/+/g\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e865.6%\u81f37.0%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3aMLLMs\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u63a5\u5730\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To accurately generate descriptions related to\nthe image, a critical step in image captioning is to identify objects and\nunderstand their relations within the image. Modern approaches typically\ncapitalize on object detectors or combine detectors with Graph Convolutional\nNetwork (GCN). However, these models suffer from redundant detection\ninformation, difficulty in GCN construction, and high training costs. To\naddress these issues, a Retrieval-based Objects and Relations Prompt for Image\nCaptioning (RORPCap) is proposed, inspired by the fact that image-text\nretrieval can provide rich semantic information for input images. RORPCap\nemploys an Objects and relations Extraction Model to extract object and\nrelation words from the image. These words are then incorporate into predefined\nprompt templates and encoded as prompt embeddings. Next, a Mamba-based mapping\nnetwork is designed to quickly map image embeddings extracted by CLIP to\nvisual-text embeddings. Finally, the resulting prompt embeddings and\nvisual-text embeddings are concatenated to form textual-enriched feature\nembeddings, which are fed into a GPT-2 model for caption generation. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on the widely used MS-COCO dataset show that the RORPCap\nrequires only 2.6 hours under cross-entropy loss training, achieving 120.5%\nCIDEr score and 22.0% SPICE score on the \"Karpathy\" test split.

Our core idea is that effective restoration hinges on providing\nsemantic-oriented guidance to the pre-trained diffusion model, thereby fully\nleveraging its powerful generative prior.

Among these,\n2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) is particularly suitable for surface\nreconstruction due to its flattened Gaussian representation and integrated\nnormal regularization. However, its performance often degrades in large-scale\nand complex urban scenes with frequent occlusions, leading to incomplete\nbuilding reconstructions. We propose GS4Buildings, a novel prior-guided\nGaussian Splatting method leveraging the ubiquity of semantic 3D building\nmodels for robust and scalable building surface reconstruction. Instead of\nrelying on traditional Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines, GS4Buildings\ninitializes Gaussians directly from low-level Level of Detail (LoD)2 semantic\n3D building models. Moreover, we generate prior depth and normal maps from the\nplanar building geometry and incorporate them into the optimization process,\nproviding strong geometric guidance for surface consistency and structural\naccuracy. We also introduce an optional building-focused mode that limits\nreconstruction to building regions, achieving a 71.8% reduction in Gaussian\nprimitives and enabling a more efficient and compact representation.\nExperiments on urban datasets demonstrate that GS4Buildings improves\nreconstruction completeness by 20.5% and geometric accuracy by 32.8%.

However, existing PEFT-based approaches overlook their\nvulnerability to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we show that highly\ntransferable adversarial images can be crafted solely via the upstream model,\nwithout accessing the downstream model or training data, significantly\ndegrading the IFDL performance. To address this, we propose ForensicsSAM, a\nunified IFDL framework with built-in adversarial robustness. Our design is\nguided by three key ideas: (1) To compensate for the lack of forgery-relevant\nknowledge in the frozen image encoder, we inject forgery experts into each\ntransformer block to enhance its ability to capture forgery artifacts. These\nforgery experts are always activated and shared across any input images. (2) To\ndetect adversarial images, we design an light-weight adversary detector that\nlearns to capture structured, task-specific artifact in RGB domain, enabling\nreliable discrimination across various attack methods. (3) To resist\nadversarial attacks, we inject adversary experts into the global attention\nlayers and MLP modules to progressively correct feature shifts induced by\nadversarial noise. These adversary experts are adaptively activated by the\nadversary detector, thereby avoiding unnecessary interference with clean\nimages. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that\nForensicsSAM achieves superior resistance to various adversarial attack\nmethods, while also delivering state-of-the-art performance in image-level\nforgery detection and pixel-level forgery localization.

To mitigate this, we propose a two-stage framework that\nsystematically exploits inherent learning bias in models. The learning bias\nstems from: (1) the statistical dominance of normal samples, driving models to\nprioritize learning stable normal patterns over sparse anomalies, and (2)\nfeature-space divergence, where normal data exhibit high intra-class\nconsistency while anomalies display high diversity, leading to unstable model\nresponses. Leveraging the learning bias, stage 1 partitions the training set\ninto subsets, trains sub-models, and aggregates cross-model anomaly scores to\nfilter a purified dataset. Stage 2 trains the final detector on this dataset.\nExperiments on the Real-IAD benchmark demonstrate superior anomaly detection\nand localization performance under different noise conditions. Ablation studies\nfurther validate the framework's contamination resilience, emphasizing the\ncritical role of learning bias exploitation.

This makes it difficult to\ndistinguish genuine comprehension from correct answers derived through flawed\nreasoning or hallucinations. To address this, we introduce AURA (Audio-visual\nUnderstanding and Reasoning Assessment), a benchmark for evaluating the\ncross-modal reasoning capabilities of Audio-Visual Large Language Models\n(AV-LLMs) and Omni-modal Language Models (OLMs). AURA includes questions across\nsix challenging cognitive domains, such as causality, timbre and pitch, tempo\nand AV synchronization, unanswerability, implicit distractions, and skill\nprofiling, explicitly designed to be unanswerable from a single modality. This\nforces models to construct a valid logical path grounded in both audio and\nvideo, setting AURA apart from AV datasets that allow uni-modal shortcuts. To\nassess reasoning traces, we propose a novel metric, AuraScore, which addresses\nthe lack of robust tools for evaluating reasoning fidelity.

I\ncreated a dataset of images from a real-world scene and constructed 3D models\nusing both methods. To evaluate the performance, I compared the models using\nstructural similarity index (SSIM), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), learned\nperceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS), and lp/mm resolution based on the\nUSAF resolution chart. A significant contribution of this work is the\ndevelopment of a modified Gaussian Splatting repository, which I forked and\nenhanced to enable rendering images from novel camera poses generated in the\nBlender environment. This innovation allows for the synthesis of high-quality\nnovel views, showcasing the flexibility and potential of Gaussian Splatting. My\ninvestigation extends to an augmented dataset that includes both original\nground images and novel views synthesized via Gaussian Splatting. This\naugmented dataset was employed to generate a new photogrammetry model, which\nwas then compared against the original photogrammetry model created using only\nthe original images. The results demonstrate the efficacy of using Gaussian\nSplatting to generate novel high-quality views and its potential to improve\nphotogrammetry-based 3D reconstructions. The comparative analysis highlights\nthe strengths and limitations of both approaches, providing valuable\ninformation for applications in extended reality (XR), photogrammetry, and\nautonomous vehicle simulations.

We propose\nSOFA (Simulating and Optimizing Atrial Fibrillation Ablation), a novel\ndeep-learning framework that addresses these questions. SOFA first simulates\nthe outcome of an ablation strategy by generating a post-ablation image\ndepicting scar formation, conditioned on a patient's pre-ablation LGE-MRI and\nthe specific procedural parameters used (e.g., ablation locations, duration,\ntemperature, power, and force). During this simulation, it predicts AF\nrecurrence risk. Critically, SOFA then introduces an optimization scheme that\nrefines these procedural parameters to minimize the predicted risk. Our method\nleverages a multi-modal, multi-view generator that processes 2.5D\nrepresentations of the atrium. Quantitative evaluations show that SOFA\naccurately synthesizes post-ablation images and that our optimization scheme\nleads to a 22.18\\% reduction in the model-predicted recurrence risk.

Weakly supervised affordance\ngrounding (WSAG) seeks to imitate human learning from third-person\ndemonstrations, where humans intuitively grasp functional parts without needing\npixel-level annotations. To achieve this, grounding is typically learned using\na shared classifier across images from different perspectives, along with\ndistillation strategies incorporating part discovery process. However, since\naffordance-relevant parts are not always easily distinguishable, models\nprimarily rely on classification, often focusing on common class-specific\npatterns that are unrelated to affordance.

This approach enables adaptive, class-wise\ndecision boundaries, ensuring robust and accurate predictions across diverse\nvisual distributions. Extensive experiments on 15 diverse benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that ACE achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior\nrobustness and generalization compared to existing TTA methods in challenging\nout-of-distribution scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Adaptive Cache Enhancement (ACE)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u7f13\u5b58\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6216\u4f4e\u71b5\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u3002", "method": "ACE\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u9608\u503c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u5b58\u50a8\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6216\u4f4e\u71b5\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u6307\u6570\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u5747\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u66f4\u65b0\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u572815\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cACE\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "ACE\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7f13\u5b58\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

Although video generation models offer cost-efficient\nsolutions for VFX production, current methods are constrained by per-effect\nLoRA training, which limits generation to single effects. This fundamental\nlimitation impedes applications that require spatially controllable composite\neffects, i.e., the concurrent generation of multiple effects at designated\nlocations. However, integrating diverse effects into a unified framework faces\nmajor challenges: interference from effect variations and spatial\nuncontrollability during multi-VFX joint training. To tackle these challenges,\nwe propose Omni-Effects, a first unified framework capable of generating\nprompt-guided effects and spatially controllable composite effects. The core of\nour framework comprises two key innovations: (1) LoRA-based Mixture of Experts\n(LoRA-MoE), which employs a group of expert LoRAs, integrating diverse effects\nwithin a unified model while effectively mitigating cross-task interference.\n(2) Spatial-Aware Prompt (SAP) incorporates spatial mask information into the\ntext token, enabling precise spatial control.

To\nfurther enhance tracking robustness, our approach incorporates Depth-aware\nAdaptive Noise Compensation, which dynamically adjusts the Kalman filter\nprocess noise based on occlusion severity for more reliable state estimation.\nAdditionally, we propose a Depth-enhanced Observation-Centric Momentum, which\nextends the motion direction consistency from the image plane into 3D space to\nimprove motion-based association cues, particularly for objects with complex\ntrajectories. Extensive experiments on the MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance,\nsignificantly improving tracking robustness in complex scenes with frequent\nocclusions and intricate motion patterns.", "AI": {"tldr": "GRASPTrack\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u7684\u906e\u6321\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u7cca\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08TBD\uff09\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u906e\u6321\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u7cca\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "GRASPTrack\u5c06\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u6574\u5408\u5230TBD\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f3D\u70b9\u4e91\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f53\u7d20\u76843D IoU\u8fdb\u884c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u8054\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u566a\u58f0\u8865\u507f\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u52a8\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8ddf\u8e2a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728MOT17\u3001MOT20\u548cDanceTrack\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cGRASPTrack\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "GRASPTrack\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u6df1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u548c3D\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u906e\u6321\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u7cca\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Recent one-step Real-ISR models typically inject a\nLow-Quality (LQ) image latent distribution at the initial timestep. However, a\nfundamental gap exists between the LQ image latent distribution and the\nGaussian noisy latent distribution, limiting the effective utilization of\ngenerative priors.

However, their sequential nature leads to long inference\ntimes, limiting their practical scalability. In this work, we introduce Grouped\nSpeculative Decoding (GSD), a novel, training-free acceleration method for AR\nimage models. While recent studies have explored Speculative Decoding (SD) as a\nmeans to speed up AR image generation, existing approaches either provide only\nmodest acceleration or require additional training. Our in-depth analysis\nreveals a fundamental difference between language and image tokens: image\ntokens exhibit inherent redundancy and diversity, meaning multiple tokens can\nconvey valid semantics. However, traditional SD methods are designed to accept\nonly a single most-likely token, which fails to leverage this difference,\nleading to excessive false-negative rejections. To address this, we propose a\nnew SD strategy that evaluates clusters of visually valid tokens rather than\nrelying on a single target token. Additionally, we observe that static\nclustering based on embedding distance is ineffective, which motivates our\ndynamic GSD approach.

We propose modeling trajectories of noisy\npose estimates on the manifold of 3D rotations in a physically and\ngeometrically meaningful way by leveraging Neural Controlled Differential\nEquations guided with $SO(3)$ Savitzky-Golay paths. Existing extrapolation\nmethods often rely on energy conservation or constant velocity assumptions,\nlimiting their applicability in real-world scenarios involving non-conservative\nforces. In contrast, our approach is agnostic to energy and momentum\nconservation while being robust to input noise, making it applicable to\ncomplex, non-inertial systems.

We conduct a comprehensive\nstudy on a new task, power battery detection (PBD), which aims to localize the\ndense endpoints of cathode and anode plates from industrial X-ray images for\nquality inspection. Manual inspection is inefficient and error-prone, while\ntraditional vision algorithms struggle with densely packed plates, low\ncontrast, scale variation, and imaging artifacts. To address this issue and\ndrive more attention into this meaningful task, we present PBD5K, the first\nlarge-scale benchmark for this task, consisting of 5,000 X-ray images from nine\nbattery types with fine-grained annotations and eight types of real-world\nvisual interference. To support scalable and consistent labeling, we develop an\nintelligent annotation pipeline that combines image filtering, model-assisted\npre-labeling, cross-verification, and layered quality evaluation. We formulate\nPBD as a point-level segmentation problem and propose MDCNeXt, a model designed\nto extract and integrate multi-dimensional structure clues including point,\nline, and count information from the plate itself. To improve discrimination\nbetween plates and suppress visual interference, MDCNeXt incorporates two state\nspace modules.

For each\nregion, we teach a powerful Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to extract\ndescriptive content and perceive multi-dimensional distortions, enabling a\ncomprehensive understanding of both local semantics and quality degradations.\nTo effectively leverage this information, we introduce Region-Aware Semantic\nAttention (RSA) mechanism, which generates a global attention map by\naggregating fine-grained representations from local regions. In addition,\nRSFIQA is backbone-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into various deep\nneural network architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness\nand effectiveness of the proposed method, which achieves competitive quality\nprediction performance across multiple benchmark datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "RSFIQA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u5272\u8bed\u4e49\u533a\u57df\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u5c40\u90e8\u8d28\u91cf\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709NR-IQA\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u5173\u6ce8\u5168\u5c40\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u5bf9\u533a\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u8bed\u4e49\u663e\u8457\u533a\u57df\u6216\u5c40\u90e8\u8d28\u91cf\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528Segment Anything Model\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u5272\u56fe\u50cf\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u533a\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u8bed\u4e49\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eRSFIQA\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "RSFIQA\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u533a\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u591a\u7ef4\u8d28\u91cf\u5dee\u5f02\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

To overcome these limitations, we present\nBeing-M0.5, the first real-time, controllable VLMM that achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across multiple motion generation tasks. Our\napproach is built upon HuMo100M, the largest and most comprehensive human\nmotion dataset to date, comprising over 5 million self-collected motion\nsequences, 100 million multi-task instructional instances, and detailed\npart-level annotations that address a critical gap in existing datasets.

Most existing video matting datasets provide only\nhuman-annotated imperfect alpha and foreground annotations, which must be\ncomposited to background images or videos during the training stage. Thus, the\ngeneralization capability of previous methods in real-world scenarios is\ntypically poor. In this work, we propose to solve the problem from two\nperspectives. First, we emphasize the importance of large-scale pre-training by\npursuing diverse synthetic and pseudo-labeled segmentation datasets. We also\ndevelop a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline that can render diverse\nhuman bodies and fine-grained hairs, yielding around 200 video clips with a\n3-second duration for fine-tuning. Second, we introduce a novel video matting\napproach that can effectively leverage the rich priors from pre-trained video\ndiffusion models. This architecture offers two key advantages. First, strong\npriors play a critical role in bridging the domain gap between synthetic and\nreal-world scenes. Second, unlike most existing methods that process video\nmatting frame-by-frame and use an independent decoder to aggregate temporal\ninformation, our model is inherently designed for video, ensuring strong\ntemporal consistency. We provide a comprehensive quantitative evaluation across\nthree benchmark datasets, demonstrating our approach's superior performance,\nand present comprehensive qualitative results in diverse real-world scenes,\nillustrating the strong generalization capability of our method.

Modern facial recognition systems are trained using large\nface datasets collected from diverse individuals or public repositories.\nHowever, for training, these datasets are often replicated and stored in\nmultiple workstations, resulting in data replication, which complicates\ndatabase management and oversight. Currently, once a user submits their face\nfor dataset preparation, they lose control over how their data is used, raising\nsignificant privacy and ethical concerns. This paper introduces VOIDFace, a\nnovel framework for facial recognition systems that addresses two major issues.\nFirst, it eliminates the need of data replication and improves data control to\nsecurely store training face data by using visual secret sharing. Second, it\nproposes a patch-based multi-training network that uses this novel training\ndata storage mechanism to develop a robust, privacy-preserving facial\nrecognition system. By integrating these advancements, VOIDFace aims to improve\nthe privacy, security, and efficiency of facial recognition training, while\nensuring greater control over sensitive personal face data. VOIDFace also\nenables users to exercise their Right-To-Be-Forgotten property to control their\npersonal data. Experimental evaluations on the VGGFace2 dataset show that\nVOIDFace provides Right-To-Be-Forgotten, improved data control, security, and\nprivacy while maintaining competitive facial recognition performance.

Previous\nresearch on roots has been largely confined to 2D studies; however, exploring\nthe 3D architecture of roots is crucial in botany. Since roots grow in real 3D\nspace, 3D phenotypic information is more critical for studying genetic traits\nand their impact on root development. We have introduced a 3D root skeleton\nextraction method that efficiently derives the 3D architecture of plant roots\nfrom a few images. This method includes the detection and matching of lateral\nroots, triangulation to extract the skeletal structure of lateral roots, and\nthe integration of lateral and primary roots.

The other approach, pretraining a unified generative\narchitecture from scratch, is computationally expensive and prohibitive for\nmany researchers. To overcome these issues, our work explores a new paradigm.\nInstead of relying on a single output, we use representations from multiple,\ndiverse layers of the MLLM as generative conditions for the diffusion model.\nThis method treats the pre-trained generator as a ladder, receiving guidance\nfrom various depths of the MLLM's understanding process.

With these annotations, we propose PP-Motion,\na novel data-driven metric to evaluate both physical and perceptual fidelity of\nhuman motion. To effectively capture underlying physical priors, we employ\nPearson's correlation loss for the training of our metric. Additionally, by\nincorporating a human-based perceptual fidelity loss, our metric can capture\nfidelity that simultaneously considers both human perception and physical\nalignment. Experimental results demonstrate that our metric, PP-Motion, not\nonly aligns with physical laws but also aligns better with human perception of\nmotion fidelity than previous work.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7269\u7406\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6cd5PP-Motion\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4eba\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u7269\u7406\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e14\u4e3b\u89c2\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u6807\u6ce8\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6307\u6807\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u5b9a\u5f8b\u5bf9\u9f50\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u4fee\u6539\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7269\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u63d0\u51faPP-Motion\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u76ae\u5c14\u900a\u76f8\u5173\u635f\u5931\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660ePP-Motion\u5728\u7269\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "PP-Motion\u4e3a\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u3001\u5ba2\u89c2\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, their effectiveness\nis often limited by redundant token representations and a lack of multi-scale\nfeature modeling. Hyperspectral images exhibit intrinsic spectral priors (e.g.,\nabundance sparsity) and spatial priors (e.g., non-local similarity), which are\ncritical for accurate reconstruction. From a spectral-spatial perspective,\nVision Transformers (ViTs) face two major limitations: they struggle to\npreserve high-frequency components--such as material edges and texture\ntransitions--and suffer from attention dispersion across redundant tokens.\nThese issues stem from the global self-attention mechanism, which tends to\ndilute high-frequency signals and overlook localized details.

While existing approaches leverage large-scale\nmultimodal datasets for latent-space alignment to implicitly learn spatial\nrelationships, they overlook the 3D capabilities of MLLMs. However, this\napproach raises two issues: (1) Operating rooms typically lack multiple video\nand audio sensors, making multimodal 3D data difficult to obtain; (2) Training\nsolely on readily available 2D data fails to capture fine-grained details in\ncomplex scenes.
