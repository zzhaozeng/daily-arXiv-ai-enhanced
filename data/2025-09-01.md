Abstract: As the computer vision community advances autonomous driving algorithms,
integrating vision-based insights with sensor data remains essential for
improving perception, decision making, planning, prediction, simulation, and
control. Yet we must ask: Why don't we have entirely safe self-driving cars
yet? A key part of the answer lies in addressing novel scenarios, one of the
most critical barriers to real-world deployment. Our 2COOOL workshop provides a
dedicated forum for researchers and industry experts to push the state of the
art in novelty handling, including out-of-distribution hazard detection,
vision-language models for hazard understanding, new benchmarking and
methodologies, and safe autonomous driving practices. The 2nd Workshop on the
Challenge of Out-of-Label Hazards in Autonomous Driving (2COOOL) will be held
at the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025 in Honolulu,
Hawaii, on October 19, 2025. We aim to inspire the development of new
algorithms and systems for hazard avoidance, drawing on ideas from anomaly
detection, open-set recognition, open-vocabulary modeling, domain adaptation,
and related fields. Building on the success of its inaugural edition at the
Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2025, the workshop
will feature a mix of academic and industry participation.

*Alireza Golkarieh,Kiana Kiashemshaki,Sajjad Rezvani Boroujeni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了三种深度学习方法来分类全景X射线图像中的牙齿状况，发现结合CNN特征提取和随机森林的混合模型效果最佳，达到85.4%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发自动化牙齿状况分类系统，为牙科诊断提供可靠的技术支持，提高诊断效率和准确性。

Method: 使用1,512张全景X射线图像数据集，评估三种方法：自定义CNN、CNN与传统分类器混合模型、微调预训练架构。采用5折交叉验证，使用准确率、精确率、召回率和F1分数作为评估指标。

Result: 混合CNN-随机森林模型表现最佳（85.4%准确率），优于自定义CNN基线（74.3%）。预训练模型中VGG16表现最好（82.3%），其次是Xception和ResNet50。混合模型在形态相似状况的区分上表现更好。

Conclusion: CNN特征提取与集成分类器结合是自动化牙科诊断支持的有效途径，但需要更大数据集和进一步临床验证。

Abstract: This study investigates deep learning methods for automated classification of
dental conditions in panoramic X-ray images. A dataset of 1,512 radiographs
with 11,137 expert-verified annotations across four conditions fillings,
cavities, implants, and impacted teeth was used. After preprocessing and class
balancing, three approaches were evaluated: a custom convolutional neural
network (CNN), hybrid models combining CNN feature extraction with traditional
classifiers, and fine-tuned pre-trained architectures. Experiments employed 5
fold cross validation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score as
evaluation metrics. The hybrid CNN Random Forest model achieved the highest
performance with 85.4% accuracy, surpassing the custom CNN baseline of 74.3%.
Among pre-trained models, VGG16 performed best at 82.3% accuracy, followed by
Xception and ResNet50. Results show that hybrid models improve discrimination
of morphologically similar conditions and provide efficient, reliable
performance. These findings suggest that combining CNN-based feature extraction
with ensemble classifiers offers a practical path toward automated dental
diagnostic support, while also highlighting the need for larger datasets and
further clinical validation.

*Namu Kim,Wonbin Kweon,Minsoo Kim,Hwanjo Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Align通过Query-Query对齐解决零样本外观迁移中的注意力泄漏问题，在保持结构的同时显著提升外观保真度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模图像生成模型在零样本外观迁移中存在注意力泄漏问题，这是由于Query-Key对齐导致的语义映射挑战

Method: 提出Q-Align方法，包含三个核心贡献：1) Query-Query对齐实现精细空间语义映射；2) Key-Value重排增强特征对应；3) 使用重排后的键值进行注意力精化以保持语义一致性

Result: 通过大量实验验证，Q-Align在外观保真度方面优于最先进方法，同时保持竞争力的结构保持能力

Conclusion: Q-Align有效解决了注意力泄漏问题，为零样本外观迁移提供了更优的语义对齐解决方案

Abstract: We observe that zero-shot appearance transfer with large-scale image
generation models faces a significant challenge: Attention Leakage. This
challenge arises when the semantic mapping between two images is captured by
the Query-Key alignment. To tackle this issue, we introduce Q-Align, utilizing
Query-Query alignment to mitigate attention leakage and improve the semantic
alignment in zero-shot appearance transfer. Q-Align incorporates three core
contributions: (1) Query-Query alignment, facilitating the sophisticated
spatial semantic mapping between two images; (2) Key-Value rearrangement,
enhancing feature correspondence through realignment; and (3) Attention
refinement using rearranged keys and values to maintain semantic consistency.
We validate the effectiveness of Q-Align through extensive experiments and
analysis, and Q-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in appearance
fidelity while maintaining competitive structure preservation.

### [4] [ERTACache: Error Rectification and Timesteps Adjustment for Efficient Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21091)
*Xurui Peng,Hong Liu,Chenqian Yan,Rui Ma,Fangmin Chen,Xing Wang,Zhihua Wu,Songwei Liu,Mingbao Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ERTACache是一个针对扩散模型的缓存加速框架，通过分析缓存累积误差的两个主要成分（特征偏移误差和步长放大误差），采用离线残差分析、动态调整积分区间和闭式残差线性化模型，实现了2倍推理加速同时保持甚至提升视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型由于迭代推理过程导致计算开销巨大。特征缓存虽然是有前景的加速策略，但简单的重用会导致明显的质量下降。需要解决缓存引入的累积误差问题。

Method: 提出ERTACache框架：1）离线残差分析阶段识别可重用步骤；2）通过轨迹感知校正系数动态调整积分区间；3）使用闭式残差线性化模型近似分析缓存引起的误差。

Result: 在标准图像和视频生成基准测试中，ERTACache实现了高达2倍的推理加速，同时一致保持甚至改善了视觉质量。在Wan2.1视频扩散模型上，2倍加速的同时VBench退化最小，有效保持了基准保真度。

Conclusion: ERTACache通过联合校正两种误差类型，实现了准确高效的采样，在激进缓存重用下显著提高了扩散模型的推理效率，代码已开源。

Abstract: Diffusion models suffer from substantial computational overhead due to their
inherently iterative inference process. While feature caching offers a
promising acceleration strategy by reusing intermediate outputs across
timesteps, naive reuse often incurs noticeable quality degradation. In this
work, we formally analyze the cumulative error introduced by caching and
decompose it into two principal components: feature shift error, caused by
inaccuracies in cached outputs, and step amplification error, which arises from
error propagation under fixed timestep schedules. To address these issues, we
propose ERTACache, a principled caching framework that jointly rectifies both
error types. Our method employs an offline residual profiling stage to identify
reusable steps, dynamically adjusts integration intervals via a
trajectory-aware correction coefficient, and analytically approximates
cache-induced errors through a closed-form residual linearization model.
Together, these components enable accurate and efficient sampling under
aggressive cache reuse. Extensive experiments across standard image and video
generation benchmarks show that ERTACache achieves up to 2x inference speedup
while consistently preserving or even improving visual quality. Notably, on the
state-of-the-art Wan2.1 video diffusion model, ERTACache delivers 2x
acceleration with minimal VBench degradation, effectively maintaining baseline
fidelity while significantly improving efficiency. The code is available at
https://github.com/bytedance/ERTACache.

### [5] [Video-LLMs with Temporal Visual Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21094)
*Zheyu Fan,Jiateng Liu,Yuji Zhang,Zihan Wang,Yi R.,Fung,Manling Li,Heng Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了时间视觉筛选(TVS)方法，通过保留关键视频段落和重构查询，有效提升视频大语言模型的时间语义理解能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频大语言模型因为帧采样稀疏和跨帧推理监督不充分，无法抓取细粒度的时间语义信息

Method: 提出TVS方法：(1)保留重点关键视频段落 (2)同步重构查询到最直接形式 (3)保持答案一致性和不变性，并提出ReSimplifyIt基线模型

Result: 在视频剪辑任务上F-1分数提升0.47，查询重写性能竞争力强，训练阶段相对提升7.33%，推理阶段相对提升34.6%

Conclusion: TVS方法通过优化时间信息筛选，有效提升了视频-语言理解的性能，为视频大模型提供了可移植的前端处理方案

Abstract: Humans naturally perform temporal screening by dragging the progress bar and
focusing on salient temporal segments, but current Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs) struggle to capture fine-grained temporal semantics due to sparse
frame sampling and insufficient inter-frame reasoning supervision during their
training. To address this, Inspired by well-established cognitive science
principles, we propose Temporal Visual Screening (TVS), a new task that
universally pre-processes video question answering and instruction tuning data
by: (1) retaining focus-critical video segments, (2) synchronously
reconstructing queries to their most direct form while preserving answer
consistency, and (3) keeping the invariance and consistency for any possible
answer. TVS is formulated as a modular front-end adapter task that can be
seamlessly integrated into both Video Instruction Tuning (training) and Video
Question Answering (inference) pipelines. TVS optimizes distribution of
reasoning burden and cognitive load; during training, it aligns queries with
focus-critical visual information; at inference, it enables query-aware segment
focus and streamlined query representations. In particular, we curate the first
benchmark for TVS and propose ReSimplifyIt, a baseline outperforming prior
approaches on seemingly similar tasks by 0.47 in F-1 score on video trimming
while achieving competitive query rewriting performance. Experiments
demonstrate that incorporating TVS yields relative gains of 7.33% (training)
and 34.6% (inference), demonstrating the effectiveness of temporal information
screening for improving video-language understanding.

### [6] [ROBUST-MIPS: A Combined Skeletal Pose and Instance Segmentation Dataset for Laparoscopic Surgical Instruments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21096)
*Zhe Han,Charlie Budd,Gongyu Zhang,Huanyu Tian,Christos Bergeles,Tom Vercauteren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出使用骨骼姿态标注作为手术工具定位的更高效标注方法，并发布了ROBUST-MIPS数据集来促进这种标注方式的采用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于深度学习的手术工具分割方法受限于标注数据的多样性，骨骼姿态标注在语义信息丰富度和标注效率之间取得了更好平衡，可以加速标注数据的增长。

Method: 从现有的ROBUST-MIS数据集衍生出ROBUST-MIPS数据集，包含工具姿态和实例分割标注，建立了使用流行姿态估计方法的简单基准测试。

Result: 观察到使用姿态标注进行手术工具定位可以获得高质量结果，证明了这种标注方式的充分性。

Conclusion: 骨骼姿态标注是手术工具定位的有效方法，通过发布数据集、基准模型和标注软件来促进该方法的采用。

Abstract: Localisation of surgical tools constitutes a foundational building block for
computer-assisted interventional technologies. Works in this field typically
focus on training deep learning models to perform segmentation tasks.
Performance of learning-based approaches is limited by the availability of
diverse annotated data. We argue that skeletal pose annotations are a more
efficient annotation approach for surgical tools, striking a balance between
richness of semantic information and ease of annotation, thus allowing for
accelerated growth of available annotated data. To encourage adoption of this
annotation style, we present, ROBUST-MIPS, a combined tool pose and tool
instance segmentation dataset derived from the existing ROBUST-MIS dataset. Our
enriched dataset facilitates the joint study of these two annotation styles and
allow head-to-head comparison on various downstream tasks. To demonstrate the
adequacy of pose annotations for surgical tool localisation, we set up a simple
benchmark using popular pose estimation methods and observe high-quality
results. To ease adoption, together with the dataset, we release our benchmark
models and custom tool pose annotation software.

### [7] [Safe-Control: A Safety Patch for Mitigating Unsafe Content in Text-to-Image Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21099)
*Xiangtao Meng,Yingkai Dong,Ning Yu,Li Wang,Zheng Li,Shanqing Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Safe-Control是一种即插即用的安全补丁，用于减少文本到图像生成模型中的不安全内容生成，通过数据驱动策略和安全感知条件向锁定模型注入安全控制信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成模型安全机制容易受到分布偏移的规避攻击，或需要大量模型特定调整，需要一种更有效和灵活的安全解决方案。

Method: 使用数据驱动策略和安全感知条件，以补丁形式向锁定的T2I模型注入安全控制信号，支持构建多种安全补丁并灵活合并为统一补丁。

Result: 在六个不同的T2I模型上评估显示，Safe-Control将不安全内容生成概率降至7%，而基准方法约为20%，同时保持良性图像质量和文本对齐。

Conclusion: Safe-Control显著优于现有的七种最先进安全机制，在减少不安全内容生成方面表现优异，且具有即插即用的适配性。

Abstract: Despite the advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their
potential for misuse or even abuse raises serious safety concerns. Model
developers have made tremendous efforts to introduce safety mechanisms that can
address these concerns in T2I models. However, the existing safety mechanisms,
whether external or internal, either remain susceptible to evasion under
distribution shifts or require extensive model-specific adjustments. To address
these limitations, we introduce Safe-Control, an innovative plug-and-play
safety patch designed to mitigate unsafe content generation in T2I models.
Using data-driven strategies and safety-aware conditions, Safe-Control injects
safety control signals into the locked T2I model, acting as an update in a
patch-like manner. Model developers can also construct various safety patches
to meet the evolving safety requirements, which can be flexibly merged into a
single, unified patch. Its plug-and-play design further ensures adaptability,
making it compatible with other T2I models of similar denoising architecture.
We conduct extensive evaluations on six diverse and public T2I models.
Empirical results highlight that Safe-Control is effective in reducing unsafe
content generation across six diverse T2I models with similar generative
architectures, yet it successfully maintains the quality and text alignment of
benign images. Compared to seven state-of-the-art safety mechanisms, including
both external and internal defenses, Safe-Control significantly outperforms all
baselines in reducing unsafe content generation. For example, it reduces the
probability of unsafe content generation to 7%, compared to approximately 20%
for most baseline methods, under both unsafe prompts and the latest adversarial
attacks.

*Kei Katsumata,Yui Iioka,Naoki Hosomi,Teruhisa Misu,Kentaro Yamada,Komei Sugiura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GENNAV是一个用于从自然语言指令和前置摄像头图像中识别目标区域位置的新方法，特别擅长处理边界模糊的stuff-type目标区域，并在多目标和无目标情况下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理stuff-type目标区域（边界模糊）以及无目标或多目标情况时表现不佳，需要一种能够同时预测目标存在性和生成分割掩码的解决方案。

Method: 提出GENNAV方法，能够预测目标存在性并为多个stuff-type目标区域生成分割掩码。构建了GRiN-Drive基准数据集，包含无目标、单目标和多目标三种样本类型。

Result: GENNAV在标准评估指标上优于基线方法。在四个汽车于五个不同地理位置的城市场景进行的真实世界实验中，GENNAV展现出优异的零样本迁移性能和跨环境鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GENNAV成功解决了现有方法在处理stuff-type目标区域和无目标/多目标情况时的局限性，在真实世界环境中表现出强大的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: We focus on the task of identifying the location of target regions from a
natural language instruction and a front camera image captured by a mobility.
This task is challenging because it requires both existence prediction and
segmentation, particularly for stuff-type target regions with ambiguous
boundaries. Existing methods often underperform in handling stuff-type target
regions, in addition to absent or multiple targets. To overcome these
limitations, we propose GENNAV, which predicts target existence and generates
segmentation masks for multiple stuff-type target regions. To evaluate GENNAV,
we constructed a novel benchmark called GRiN-Drive, which includes three
distinct types of samples: no-target, single-target, and multi-target. GENNAV
achieved superior performance over baseline methods on standard evaluation
metrics. Furthermore, we conducted real-world experiments with four automobiles
operated in five geographically distinct urban areas to validate its zero-shot
transfer performance. In these experiments, GENNAV outperformed baseline
methods and demonstrated its robustness across diverse real-world environments.

### [9] [R-4B: Incentivizing General-Purpose Auto-Thinking Capability in MLLMs via Bi-Mode Annealing and Reinforce Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21113)
*Jie Jiang,Qi Yang,Bolin Ni,Shiming Xiang,Han Hu,Houwen Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: R-4B是一个自适应思维的多模态大语言模型，能够根据问题复杂度自动决定是否启用思维过程，在保持高性能的同时降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在处理简单问题时也会使用逐步思维过程，造成计算资源浪费，需要一种能够自适应决定是否思考的模型来提高效率。

Method: 采用双模式退火训练方法，让模型同时具备思维和非思维能力，并通过双模式策略优化(BPO)改进模型判断是否激活思维过程的准确性。训练分为两个阶段：首先在精心策划的数据集上训练，然后在改进的GRPO框架下进行第二阶段训练。

Result: R-4B在25个具有挑战性的基准测试中达到最先进性能，在大多数任务中优于Qwen2.5-VL-7B，在推理密集型基准测试中与更大的16B模型性能相当，但计算成本更低。

Conclusion: R-4B通过自适应思维机制成功解决了多模态大语言模型在处理简单问题时的不必要计算开销问题，实现了效率与性能的平衡。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) equipped with step-by-step thinking
capabilities have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning
problems. However, this thinking process is redundant for simple problems
solvable without complex reasoning. To address this inefficiency, we propose
R-4B, an auto-thinking MLLM, which can adaptively decide when to think based on
problem complexity. The central idea of R-4B is to empower the model with both
thinking and non-thinking capabilities using bi-mode annealing, and apply
Bi-mode Policy Optimization~(BPO) to improve the model's accuracy in
determining whether to activate the thinking process. Specifically, we first
train the model on a carefully curated dataset spanning various topics, which
contains samples from both thinking and non-thinking modes. Then it undergoes a
second phase of training under an improved GRPO framework, where the policy
model is forced to generate responses from both modes for each input query.
Experimental results show that R-4B achieves state-of-the-art performance
across 25 challenging benchmarks. It outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B in most tasks
and achieves performance comparable to larger models such as
Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 (16B) on reasoning-intensive benchmarks with lower
computational cost.

*Harris Song,Tuan-Anh Vu,Sanjith Menon,Sriram Narasimhan,M. Khalid Jawed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiddenObject是一个基于Mamba的多模态融合框架，整合RGB、热成像和深度数据，用于检测遮挡或伪装目标，在多个基准数据集上达到先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RGB检测方法在遮挡、伪装和光照变化等恶劣条件下性能受限，需要更鲁棒的模态无关方法来解决隐蔽物体检测的挑战。

Method: 提出Mamba-based融合机制，整合RGB、热成像和深度三种模态数据，捕获模态间的互补信号，通过识别模态特定特征并将其融合为统一表示。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上验证，相比现有方法达到state-of-the-art或竞争性性能，证明了融合设计的有效性。

Conclusion: Mamba-based融合架构能显著推进多模态目标检测领域发展，特别是在视觉退化或复杂条件下，暴露了当前单模态和简单融合策略的关键局限性。

Abstract: Detecting hidden or partially concealed objects remains a fundamental
challenge in multimodal environments, where factors like occlusion, camouflage,
and lighting variations significantly hinder performance. Traditional RGB-based
detection methods often fail under such adverse conditions, motivating the need
for more robust, modality-agnostic approaches. In this work, we present
HiddenObject, a fusion framework that integrates RGB, thermal, and depth data
using a Mamba-based fusion mechanism. Our method captures complementary signals
across modalities, enabling enhanced detection of obscured or camouflaged
targets. Specifically, the proposed approach identifies modality-specific
features and fuses them in a unified representation that generalizes well
across challenging scenarios. We validate HiddenObject across multiple
benchmark datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art or competitive performance
compared to existing methods. These results highlight the efficacy of our
fusion design and expose key limitations in current unimodal and na\"ive fusion
strategies. More broadly, our findings suggest that Mamba-based fusion
architectures can significantly advance the field of multimodal object
detection, especially under visually degraded or complex conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RadGS-Reg是一个新颖的框架，通过联合3D辐射高斯重建和3D/3D配准，实现椎体级别的CT/X射线配准，在噪声X射线条件下表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统'渲染比较'方法在CT/X射线配准中的空间信息丢失和域差距问题，以及现有双平面X射线3D重建方法对密集视图要求和噪声处理的局限性。

Method: 提出RadGS-Reg框架，包含基于学习的辐射高斯重建模块和反事实注意力学习机制，采用患者特异性预训练策略从模拟数据逐步适应到真实数据。

Result: 在内部数据集上的实验显示，该方法在两个任务上都达到了最先进的性能，超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: RadGS-Reg通过创新的联合重建和配准方法，有效解决了CT/X射线图像引导导航中的准确性和实时性挑战，为临床应用提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT)/X-ray registration in image-guided navigation
remains challenging because of its stringent requirements for high accuracy and
real-time performance. Traditional "render and compare" methods, relying on
iterative projection and comparison, suffer from spatial information loss and
domain gap. 3D reconstruction from biplanar X-rays supplements spatial and
shape information for 2D/3D registration, but current methods are limited by
dense-view requirements and struggles with noisy X-rays. To address these
limitations, we introduce RadGS-Reg, a novel framework for vertebral-level
CT/X-ray registration through joint 3D Radiative Gaussians (RadGS)
reconstruction and 3D/3D registration. Specifically, our biplanar X-rays
vertebral RadGS reconstruction module explores learning-based RadGS
reconstruction method with a Counterfactual Attention Learning (CAL) mechanism,
focusing on vertebral regions in noisy X-rays. Additionally, a patient-specific
pre-training strategy progressively adapts the RadGS-Reg from simulated to real
data while simultaneously learning vertebral shape prior knowledge. Experiments
on in-house datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance for both
tasks, surpassing existing methods. The code is available at:

Motivation: 由于缺乏大规模标注的3D建筑数据集，自动生成准确且语义丰富的3D建筑模型面临重大挑战。受计算机视觉中合成数据成功的启发，需要创建大规模合成数据集来推动3D建筑生成算法的发展。

Method: 创建SYNBUILD-3D数据集，包含超过620万个合成3D住宅建筑，每个建筑提供三种模态表示：LoD 4级别的语义丰富3D线框图、对应的平面图像和LiDAR式屋顶点云。语义标注从平面图像中提取，包含房间、门窗信息。

Result: 成功构建了大规模、多样化、多模态的合成3D建筑数据集，为开发新型生成式AI算法提供了基础，能够自动化创建具有语义几何一致性的LoD 4级别3D建筑模型。

Conclusion: SYNBUILD-3D数据集填补了3D建筑建模领域大规模标注数据的空白，为开发能够根据预设平面布局和屋顶几何生成语义一致3D建筑模型的生成算法提供了重要资源。

Abstract: 3D building models are critical for applications in architecture, energy
simulation, and navigation. Yet, generating accurate and semantically rich 3D
buildings automatically remains a major challenge due to the lack of
large-scale annotated datasets in the public domain. Inspired by the success of
synthetic data in computer vision, we introduce SYNBUILD-3D, a large, diverse,
and multi-modal dataset of over 6.2 million synthetic 3D residential buildings
at Level of Detail (LoD) 4. In the dataset, each building is represented
through three distinct modalities: a semantically enriched 3D wireframe graph
at LoD 4 (Modality I), the corresponding floor plan images (Modality II), and a
LiDAR-like roof point cloud (Modality III). The semantic annotations for each
building wireframe are derived from the corresponding floor plan images and
include information on rooms, doors, and windows. Through its tri-modal nature,
future work can use SYNBUILD-3D to develop novel generative AI algorithms that
automate the creation of 3D building models at LoD 4, subject to predefined
floor plan layouts and roof geometries, while enforcing semantic-geometric
consistency. Dataset and code samples are publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的方法来同时估计单应性变换和径向畸变，解决了三种不同的畸变配置情况，并开发了快速、稳定、准确的最小求解器。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个统一的框架来解决带有径向畸变的单应性估计问题，新求解器在速度和精度方面都优于现有方法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Homographies are among the most prevalent transformations occurring in
geometric computer vision and projective geometry, and homography estimation is
consequently a crucial step in a wide assortment of computer vision tasks. When
working with real images, which are often afflicted with geometric distortions
caused by the camera lens, it may be necessary to determine both the homography
and the lens distortion-particularly the radial component, called radial
distortion-simultaneously to obtain anything resembling useful estimates. When
considering a homography with radial distortion between two images, there are
three conceptually distinct configurations for the radial distortion; (i)
distortion in only one image, (ii) identical distortion in the two images, and
(iii) independent distortion in the two images. While these cases have been
addressed separately in the past, the present paper provides a novel and
unified approach to solve all three cases. We demonstrate how the proposed
approach can be used to construct new fast, stable, and accurate minimal
solvers for radially distorted homographies. In all three cases, our proposed
solvers are faster than the existing state-of-the-art solvers while maintaining
similar accuracy. The solvers are tested on well-established benchmarks

### [14] [GCAV: A Global Concept Activation Vector Framework for Cross-Layer Consistency in Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21197)
*Zhenghao He,Sanchit Sinha,Guangzhi Xiong,Aidong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了全局概念激活向量（GCAV）框架，通过对比学习和注意力融合机制统一不同层的CAV表示，解决了跨层概念不一致性问题，提高了概念归因的稳定性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概念激活向量（CAVs）在不同层独立计算时存在不一致性，导致跨层比较不可靠，需要一种统一的方法来确保概念表示的语义一致性。

Method: 使用对比学习对齐跨层概念表示，并采用基于注意力的融合机制构建全局集成的GCAV，同时提出了TGCAV方法来评估GCAV表示的效果。

Result: 实验表明，GCAV显著降低了TCAV分数的方差，保持了概念相关性，有效缓解了跨层概念不一致性，增强了概念定位能力，并提高了对抗扰动的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GCAV通过整合跨层信息提供了一个更全面、可解释的框架，有助于深入理解深度学习模型如何编码人类定义的概念。

Abstract: Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) provide a powerful approach for
interpreting deep neural networks by quantifying their sensitivity to
human-defined concepts. However, when computed independently at different
layers, CAVs often exhibit inconsistencies, making cross-layer comparisons
unreliable. To address this issue, we propose the Global Concept Activation
Vector (GCAV), a novel framework that unifies CAVs into a single, semantically
consistent representation. Our method leverages contrastive learning to align
concept representations across layers and employs an attention-based fusion
mechanism to construct a globally integrated CAV. By doing so, our method
significantly reduces the variance in TCAV scores while preserving concept
relevance, ensuring more stable and reliable concept attributions. To evaluate
the effectiveness of GCAV, we introduce Testing with Global Concept Activation
Vectors (TGCAV) as a method to apply TCAV to GCAV-based representations. We
conduct extensive experiments on multiple deep neural networks, demonstrating
that our method effectively mitigates concept inconsistency across layers,
enhances concept localization, and improves robustness against adversarial
perturbations. By integrating cross-layer information into a coherent
framework, our method offers a more comprehensive and interpretable
understanding of how deep learning models encode human-defined concepts. Code

### [15] [Generalizable Object Re-Identification via Visual In-Context Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21222)
*Zhizhong Huang,Xiaoming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VICP是一个无需参数调整的视觉上下文提示框架，通过结合大语言模型和视觉基础模型，实现从已见类别到未见类别的零样本对象重识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对象重识别方法需要针对特定领域训练模型，缺乏泛化能力且需要大量标注数据。自监督学习虽然减少标注需求，但难以捕捉身份敏感特征。

Method: VICP框架利用LLM从少量正负样本对中推断语义身份规则，通过任务特定提示指导VFM（如DINO）提取身份判别特征，使用动态视觉提示实现语义概念与预训练先验的对齐。

Result: 在ShopID10K数据集和多个ReID基准测试中，VICP在未见类别上的性能明显优于基线方法。

Conclusion: VICP通过视觉上下文提示实现了跨类别的零样本对象重识别，消除了数据集特定的重新训练需求，为通用对象重识别提供了新思路。

Abstract: Current object re-identification (ReID) methods train domain-specific models
(e.g., for persons or vehicles), which lack generalization and demand costly
labeled data for new categories. While self-supervised learning reduces
annotation needs by learning instance-wise invariance, it struggles to capture
\textit{identity-sensitive} features critical for ReID. This paper proposes
Visual In-Context Prompting~(VICP), a novel framework where models trained on
seen categories can directly generalize to unseen novel categories using only
\textit{in-context examples} as prompts, without requiring parameter
adaptation. VICP synergizes LLMs and vision foundation models~(VFM): LLMs infer
semantic identity rules from few-shot positive/negative pairs through
task-specific prompting, which then guides a VFM (\eg, DINO) to extract
ID-discriminative features via \textit{dynamic visual prompts}. By aligning
LLM-derived semantic concepts with the VFM's pre-trained prior, VICP enables
generalization to novel categories, eliminating the need for dataset-specific
retraining. To support evaluation, we introduce ShopID10K, a dataset of 10K
object instances from e-commerce platforms, featuring multi-view images and
cross-domain testing. Experiments on ShopID10K and diverse ReID benchmarks
demonstrate that VICP outperforms baselines by a clear margin on unseen
categories. Code is available at https://github.com/Hzzone/VICP.

*Keshav Jha,William Sharp,Dominic LaBella*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用SegResNet模型在MRI胰腺肿瘤分割任务中表现一般（Task 1 DSC 0.56，Task 2 DSC 0.33），显示小数据集下MRI序列差异带来的挑战，但证明了自动分割的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺肿瘤的精确分割对诊断和治疗规划至关重要，但由于解剖结构变异性和数据集有限，自动分割仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 采用SegResNet模型（Auto3DSeg架构），在PANTHER Challenge的两个MRI胰腺肿瘤分割任务上进行5折交叉验证和STAPLE集成，重点关注解剖相关感兴趣区域。

Result: Task 1（91例T1加权MRI）DSC 0.56，5mm DSC 0.73；Task 2（50例T2加权MR-Linac）性能下降，DSC仅0.33，5mm DSC 0.50。不同MRI序列导致性能显著差异。

Conclusion: 结果显示了小数据集下MRI胰腺肿瘤分割的挑战性，证明了自动分割的潜力，但需要更大、标准化的MRI数据集来提高模型鲁棒性和临床实用性。

Abstract: Accurate delineation of pancreatic tumors is critical for diagnosis,
treatment planning, and outcome assessment, yet automated segmentation remains
challenging due to anatomical variability and limited dataset availability. In
this study, SegResNet models, as part of the Auto3DSeg architecture, were
trained and evaluated on two MRI-based pancreatic tumor segmentation tasks as
part of the 2025 PANTHER Challenge. Algorithm methodology included 5-fold
cross-validation with STAPLE ensembling after focusing on an anatomically
relevant region-of-interest. The Pancreatic Tumor Segmentation on Diagnostic
MRI task 1 training set included 91 T1-weighted arterial contrast-enhanced MRI
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. The Pancreatic Tumor
Segmentation on MR-Linac task 2 training set used 50 T2-weighted MR-Linac cases
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. Algorithm-automated
segmentation performance of pancreatic tumor was assessed using Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC), 5 mm DSC, 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95), Mean
Average Surface Distance (MASD), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). For Task 1,
the algorithm achieved a DSC of 0.56, 5 mm DSC of 0.73, HD95 of 41.1 mm, MASD
of 26.0 mm, and RMSE of 5164 mm. For Task 2, performance decreased, with a DSC
of 0.33, 5 mm DSC of 0.50, HD95 of 20.1 mm, MASD of 7.2 mm, and RMSE of 17,203
mm. These findings illustrate the challenges of MRI-based pancreatic tumor
segmentation with small datasets, highlighting variability introduced by
different MRI sequences. Despite modest performance, the results demonstrate
potential for automated delineation and emphasize the need for larger,
standardized MRI datasets to improve model robustness and clinical utility.

*Yidong Zhao,Peter Kellman,Hui Xue,Tongyun Yang,Yi Zhang,Yuchi Han,Orlando Simonetti,Qian Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reverse Imaging是一种基于物理原理的心脏MRI数据增强方法，通过逆向推断底层自旋属性来解决不同成像序列间的泛化问题，显著提升分割模型的跨域性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的心脏MRI分割模型难以泛化到不同成像序列，因为图像对比度差异巨大。虽然成像协议不同，但所有图像都由相同的自旋属性（质子密度、T1、T2值）控制。

Method: 提出Reverse Imaging方法：1）从观测的MRI图像逆向推断底层自旋属性；2）通过求解非线性逆问题，使用自旋属性先验分布进行正则化；3）基于mSASHA数据集学习生成扩散模型获取自旋先验；4）实现任意新序列的图像合成。

Result: 该方法能够从MR图像获得有意义的自旋属性估计，作为可解释的潜在变量，实现高度灵活的图像合成。实验表明Reverse Imaging能够在完全不同图像对比度和成像协议下实现高精度分割。

Conclusion: Reverse Imaging从根本上解决了心脏MRI分割的泛化问题，实现了宽谱泛化能力，为跨域医学图像分析提供了物理驱动的解决方案。

Abstract: Pretrained segmentation models for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
struggle to generalize across different imaging sequences due to significant
variations in image contrast. These variations arise from changes in imaging
protocols, yet the same fundamental spin properties, including proton density,
T1, and T2 values, govern all acquired images. With this core principle, we
introduce Reverse Imaging, a novel physics-driven method for cardiac MRI data
augmentation and domain adaptation to fundamentally solve the generalization
problem. Our method reversely infers the underlying spin properties from
observed cardiac MRI images, by solving ill-posed nonlinear inverse problems
regularized by the prior distribution of spin properties. We acquire this "spin
prior" by learning a generative diffusion model from the multiparametric
SAturation-recovery single-SHot acquisition sequence (mSASHA) dataset, which
offers joint cardiac T1 and T2 maps. Our method enables approximate but
meaningful spin-property estimates from MR images, which provide an
interpretable "latent variable" that lead to highly flexible image synthesis of
arbitrary novel sequences. We show that Reverse Imaging enables highly accurate
segmentation across vastly different image contrasts and imaging protocols,
realizing wide-spectrum generalization of cardiac MRI segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHD是一种新颖的个性化3D人体网格恢复方法，通过用户特定的体型信息来提高视频姿态估计精度，使用点扩散变换器作为体型条件化的3D姿态先验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HMR方法追求通用性但忽略了用户特定体型信息，过度依赖2D约束会损害3D精度，需要同时考虑个性化体型和3D姿态合理性。

Method: 首先校准用户体型，然后基于该体型进行个性化姿态拟合，使用点扩散变换器实现体型条件化的3D姿态先验，通过点蒸馏采样损失迭代指导姿态拟合。

Result: 方法不仅提高了骨盆对齐的姿态精度，还改善了绝对姿态精度，仅需合成数据进行训练，可作为即插即用模块与现有3D姿态估计器集成。

Conclusion: PHD通过解耦体型校准和姿态拟合过程，有效减轻了对2D约束的过度依赖，在数据效率和性能提升方面表现出色。

Abstract: We introduce PHD, a novel approach for personalized 3D human mesh recovery
(HMR) and body fitting that leverages user-specific shape information to
improve pose estimation accuracy from videos. Traditional HMR methods are
designed to be user-agnostic and optimized for generalization. While these
methods often refine poses using constraints derived from the 2D image to
improve alignment, this process compromises 3D accuracy by failing to jointly
account for person-specific body shapes and the plausibility of 3D poses. In
contrast, our pipeline decouples this process by first calibrating the user's
body shape and then employing a personalized pose fitting process conditioned
on that shape. To achieve this, we develop a body shape-conditioned 3D pose
prior, implemented as a Point Diffusion Transformer, which iteratively guides
the pose fitting via a Point Distillation Sampling loss. This learned 3D pose
prior effectively mitigates errors arising from an over-reliance on 2D
constraints. Consequently, our approach improves not only pelvis-aligned pose
accuracy but also absolute pose accuracy -- an important metric often
overlooked by prior work. Furthermore, our method is highly data-efficient,
requiring only synthetic data for training, and serves as a versatile
plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated with existing 3D pose
estimators to enhance their performance. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的基于扩散模型的3D人体姿态估计框架，通过分层时序剪枝策略在保持运动动态的同时大幅降低计算成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然能生成高质量的3D人体姿态，但其迭代性和多假设需求导致计算成本过高，需要提高效率

Method: 采用分层时序剪枝(HTP)策略：1)时间相关性增强剪枝分析帧间运动相关性；2)稀疏聚焦时序MHSA减少注意力计算；3)掩码引导姿态令牌剪枝器进行细粒度语义剪枝

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP数据集上，训练MACs减少38.5%，推理MACs减少56.8%，推理速度平均提升81.1%，同时达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 提出的HTP策略有效解决了扩散模型在3D人体姿态估计中的计算效率问题，在显著降低计算成本的同时保持了优异的性能

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating
high-fidelity 3D human poses, yet their iterative nature and multi-hypothesis
requirements incur substantial computational cost. In this paper, we propose an
Efficient Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation framework with a
Hierarchical Temporal Pruning (HTP) strategy, which dynamically prunes
redundant pose tokens across both frame and semantic levels while preserving
critical motion dynamics. HTP operates in a staged, top-down manner: (1)
Temporal Correlation-Enhanced Pruning (TCEP) identifies essential frames by
analyzing inter-frame motion correlations through adaptive temporal graph
construction; (2) Sparse-Focused Temporal MHSA (SFT MHSA) leverages the
resulting frame-level sparsity to reduce attention computation, focusing on
motion-relevant tokens; and (3) Mask-Guided Pose Token Pruner (MGPTP) performs
fine-grained semantic pruning via clustering, retaining only the most
informative pose tokens. Experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP show that
HTP reduces training MACs by 38.5\%, inference MACs by 56.8\%, and improves
inference speed by an average of 81.1\% compared to prior diffusion-based
methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: Print2Volume是一个从2D指纹图像生成逼真合成OCT 3D指纹的框架，解决了OCT数据稀缺问题，显著提升了指纹识别性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OCT技术能获取高分辨率3D指纹数据，但数据采集成本高、耗时长，导致大规模数据集稀缺，阻碍了深度学习算法的发展

Method: 三阶段框架：1）2D风格转换模块将二值指纹转为灰度图像；2）3D结构扩展网络将2D图像外推为3D解剖体积；3）基于3D GAN的OCT真实感细化器添加纹理和噪声

Result: 生成了42万个合成样本，预训练模型在ZJUT-EIFD基准测试中将EER从15.62%显著降低至2.50%

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了OCT指纹数据稀缺问题，合成数据质量高，能显著提升识别性能，为生物识别领域提供了重要数据增强方案

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables the acquisition of
high-resolution, three-dimensional fingerprint data, capturing rich subsurface
structures for robust biometric recognition. However, the high cost and
time-consuming nature of OCT data acquisition have led to a scarcity of
large-scale public datasets, significantly hindering the development of
advanced algorithms, particularly data-hungry deep learning models. To address
this critical bottleneck, this paper introduces Print2Volume, a novel framework
for generating realistic, synthetic OCT-based 3D fingerprints from 2D
fingerprint image. Our framework operates in three sequential stages: (1) a 2D
style transfer module that converts a binary fingerprint into a grayscale
images mimicking the style of a Z-direction mean-projected OCT scan; (2) a 3D
Structure Expansion Network that extrapolates the 2D im-age into a plausible 3D
anatomical volume; and (3) an OCT Realism Refiner, based on a 3D GAN, that
renders the structural volume with authentic textures, speckle noise, and other
imaging characteristics. Using Print2Volume, we generated a large-scale
synthetic dataset of 420,000 samples. Quantitative experiments demonstrate the
high quality of our synthetic data and its significant impact on recognition
performance. By pre-training a recognition model on our synthetic data and
fine-tuning it on a small real-world dataset, we achieved a remarkable
reduction in the Equal Error Rate (EER) from 15.62% to 2.50% on the ZJUT-EIFD
benchmark, proving the effectiveness of our approach in overcoming data
scarcity.

Motivation: 妇科腹腔镜手术视频分析目前依赖人工处理，耗时且效率低，而医疗领域数据稀缺限制了计算机视觉和机器学习方法的发展

Method: 与领先医学专家合作创建了包含子宫内膜异位症区域注释的图像数据集GLENDA，这是该领域的首个此类数据集

Result: 成功构建了专门针对妇科腹腔镜子宫内膜异位症的数据集，为后续计算机视觉和机器学习研究提供了重要数据资源

Conclusion: GLENDA数据集的发布将促进妇科腹腔镜手术视频分析的自动化方法发展，支持治疗规划、病例记录和教育等术后活动

Abstract: Gynecologic laparoscopy as a type of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is
performed via a live feed of a patient's abdomen surveying the insertion and
handling of various instruments for conducting treatment. Adopting this kind of
surgical intervention not only facilitates a great variety of treatments, the
possibility of recording said video streams is as well essential for numerous
post-surgical activities, such as treatment planning, case documentation and
education. Nonetheless, the process of manually analyzing surgical recordings,
as it is carried out in current practice, usually proves tediously
time-consuming. In order to improve upon this situation, more sophisticated
computer vision as well as machine learning approaches are actively developed.
Since most of such approaches heavily rely on sample data, which especially in
the medical field is only sparsely available, with this work we publish the
Gynecologic Laparoscopy ENdometriosis DAtaset (GLENDA) - an image dataset
containing region-based annotations of a common medical condition named
endometriosis, i.e. the dislocation of uterine-like tissue. The dataset is the
first of its kind and it has been created in collaboration with leading medical
experts in the field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术视频记录已成为医学内窥镜领域的重要信息来源，但自动内容索引（基于内容的医学视频档案搜索基础）由于视频内容的特殊性仍然是一个巨大挑战。

Method: 使用基于区域的全卷积网络进行实例感知的（1）器械分割和（2）器械识别，分别处理二值分割（器械与背景区分）和多类器械识别（识别器械类型）。

Result: 即使训练样本数量适中，也能以相当高的准确率定位和分割器械区域；但确定具体器械类型仍然非常具有挑战性，因为手术器械本身具有高度相似性。

Conclusion: 手术器械分割技术已经相对成熟，但器械识别仍需要进一步研究改进，特别是在处理高度相似的手术器械方面。

Abstract: Recorded videos from surgeries have become an increasingly important
information source for the field of medical endoscopy, since the recorded
footage shows every single detail of the surgery. However, while video
recording is straightforward these days, automatic content indexing - the basis
for content-based search in a medical video archive - is still a great
challenge due to the very special video content. In this work, we investigate
segmentation and recognition of surgical instruments in videos recorded from
laparoscopic gynecology. More precisely, we evaluate the achievable performance
of segmenting surgical instruments from their background by using a
region-based fully convolutional network for instance-aware (1) instrument
segmentation as well as (2) instrument recognition. While the first part
addresses only binary segmentation of instances (i.e., distinguishing between
instrument or background) we also investigate multi-class instrument
recognition (i.e., identifying the type of instrument). Our evaluation results
show that even with a moderately low number of training examples, we are able
to localize and segment instrument regions with a pretty high accuracy.
However, the results also reveal that determining the particular instrument is
still very challenging, due to the inherently high similarity of surgical
instruments.

Result: 实现了不同目录之间的互操性，并在临床病理学领域进行了实践验证

Conclusion: 该标准化框架能够有效支持WSI目录管理、机器学习和图表示应用，提高大规模WSI集合的利用效率

Abstract: A Whole Slide Image (WSI) is a high-resolution digital image created by
scanning an entire glass slide containing a biological specimen, such as tissue
sections or cell samples, at multiple magnifications. These images can be
viewed, analyzed, shared digitally, and are used today for Artificial
Intelligence (AI) algorithm development. WSIs are used in a variety of fields,
including pathology for diagnosing diseases and oncology for cancer research.
They are also utilized in neurology, veterinary medicine, hematology,
microbiology, dermatology, pharmacology, toxicology, immunology, and forensic
science.
  When assembling cohorts for the training or validation of an AI algorithm, it
is essential to know what is present on such a WSI. However, there is currently
no standard for this metadata, so such selection has mainly been done through
manual inspection, which is not suitable for large collections with several
million objects.
  We propose a general framework to generate a 2D index map for WSI and a
profiling mechanism for specific application domains. We demonstrate this
approach in the field of clinical pathology, using common syntax and semantics
to achieve interoperability between different catalogs.
  Our approach augments each WSI collection with a detailed tissue map that
provides fine-grained information about the WSI content. The tissue map is
organized into three layers: source, tissue type, and pathological alterations,
with each layer assigning segments of the WSI to specific classes.
  We illustrate the advantages and applicability of the proposed standard
through specific examples in WSI catalogs, Machine Learning (ML), and
graph-based WSI representations.

Motivation: 现实场景中新类别不断出现，但现有增量学习方法假设数据完全标记，这在实践中不现实

Method: 提出ICPL方法，使用信心度基准的伪标签替代人工标注，并集成到各种CIL方法中，在细粒度数据集上验证

Result: ICPL在CIFAR100和ImageNet100上达到与监督方法竞争的结果，超过现有class-iNCD方法超过5%，同时兼顾计算复杂度

Conclusion: ICPL方法能够有效地实现无监督增量学习，在保持性能的同时适用于资源受限环境，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many
computer vision tasks. However, in real-world scenarios, novel classes that
were unseen during training often emerge, requiring models to acquire new
knowledge incrementally. Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) methods enable a
model to learn novel classes while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
However, these methods make the strong assumption that the incremental dataset
is fully labeled, which is unrealistic in practice. In this work, we propose an
unsupervised Incremental Learning method using Confidence-based Pseudo-labels
(ICPL), which replaces human annotations with pseudo-labels, enabling
incremental learning from unlabeled datasets. We integrate these pseudo-labels
into various CIL methods with confidence-based selection and evaluate
performance degradation on CIFAR100 and ImageNet100. Then, we compare our
approach to popular Class Incremental Novel Category Discovery (class-iNCD)
methods addressing similar challenges. Additionally, we apply our method to
fine-grained datasets to demonstrate its real-world practicality and measure
its computational complexity to validate its suitability for
resource-constrained environments. ICPL achieves competitive results compared
to supervised methods and outperforms state-of-the-art class-iNCD methods by
more than 5% in final accuracy.

high-fidelity, unpaired image translation across multiple domains. Unlike prior
approaches that require domain-specific training or rely on paired data,
MedShift learns a shared domain-agnostic latent space and supports seamless
translation between any pair of domains seen during training. We introduce
X-DigiSkull, a new dataset comprising aligned synthetic and real skull X-rays
under varying radiation doses, to benchmark domain translation models.
Experimental results demonstrate that, despite its smaller model size compared
to diffusion-based approaches, MedShift offers strong performance and remains
flexible at inference time, as it can be tuned to prioritize either perceptual
fidelity or structural consistency, making it a scalable and generalizable
solution for domain adaptation in medical imaging. The code and dataset are

Abstract: Trees are key components of the terrestrial biosphere, playing vital roles in
ecosystem function, climate regulation, and the bioeconomy. However,
large-scale monitoring of individual trees remains limited by inadequate
modelling. Available global products have focused on binary tree cover or
canopy height, which do not explicitely identify trees at individual level. In
this study, we present a deep learning approach for detecting large individual
trees in 3-m resolution PlanetScope imagery at a global scale. We simulate tree
crowns with Gaussian kernels of scalable size, allowing the extraction of crown
centers and the generation of binary tree cover maps. Training is based on
billions of points automatically extracted from airborne lidar data, enabling
the model to successfully identify trees both inside and outside forests. We
compare against existing tree cover maps and airborne lidar with
state-of-the-art performance (fractional cover R$^2 = 0.81$ against aerial
lidar), report balanced detection metrics across biomes, and demonstrate how
detection can be further improved through fine-tuning with manual labels. Our
method offers a scalable framework for global, high-resolution tree monitoring,
and is adaptable to future satellite missions offering improved imagery.

Method: 使用基于锚点的分层高斯球体结构，粗粒度高斯表示场景低分辨率结构，细粒度高斯负责高保真渲染；采用混合变形和生成策略建模帧间运动；引入双向自适应掩码机制去除静态区域并优先处理信息丰富的视角。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-fidelity real-time rendering, a key
requirement for immersive applications. However, the extension of 3DGS to
dynamic scenes remains limitations on the substantial data volume of dense
Gaussians and the prolonged training time required for each frame. This paper
presents \M, a scalable Gaussian Splatting framework designed for efficient
training in streaming tasks. Specifically, Gaussian spheres are hierarchically
organized by scale within an anchor-based structure. Coarser-level Gaussians
represent the low-resolution structure of the scene, while finer-level
Gaussians, responsible for detailed high-fidelity rendering, are selectively
activated by the coarser-level Gaussians. To further reduce computational
overhead, we introduce a hybrid deformation and spawning strategy that models
motion of inter-frame through Gaussian deformation and triggers Gaussian
spawning to characterize wide-range motion. Additionally, a bidirectional
adaptive masking mechanism enhances training efficiency by removing static
regions and prioritizing informative viewpoints. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that \M~ achieves superior visual quality while significantly
reducing training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于多模态大语言模型计算需求高，难以在本地设备部署图像描述应用，需要开发轻量级但性能相当的解决方案。

Method: 首先实现基于125M参数语言模型的专家模型，然后开发Sharp-Eyed Refinement框架，通过DeepLens组件提取详细视觉表示，专注于信息丰富的区域来改善视觉基础。

Result: 模型在单句和详细描述任务上表现与大型多模态通用模型相当，新框架有效缓解了视觉盲区问题，提升了描述质量。

Conclusion: 轻量级专家模型可以作为设备端应用的强大视觉专家，Sharp-Eyed Refinement框架通过改进视觉基础机制有效解决了语义描述错误问题。

Abstract: Image captioning is fundamental for applications like video instruction
systems and exploration robots, yet deploying such models on local devices is
challenging due to the high computational demands of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). To address this, we first explore lightweight captioning by
implementing a specialist based on a 125M-parameter language model, 56 times
smaller than LLaMA-7B, and evaluating its performance on both single-sentence
and detailed captioning tasks. Surprisingly, we find that our model can achieve
performance comparable to large multimodal generalists, suggesting its
potential to serve as a strong visual specialist for on-device applications.
While promising, our model also exhibits a limitation: like other MLLMs, it
suffers from visual blindness, occasionally resulting in semantic captioning
errors. We carry out toy experiments and investigate the underlying causes,
where we observe that the problems arise from ineffective attention mechanisms
and limited visual representations. To alleviate them, we develop a novel
captioning framework, Sharp-Eyed Refinement, which enhances caption quality
through improved visual grounding. At its core, our DeepLens extracts detailed
visual representations by concentrating on informative regions identified
during the initial glance. Our experiments confirm both the advantages of our
specialist over prior small captioning models and large generalists and the
effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: While foundation models (FMs) offer strong potential for AI-based dementia
diagnosis, their integration into federated learning (FL) systems remains
underexplored. In this benchmarking study, we systematically evaluate the
impact of key design choices: classification head architecture, fine-tuning
strategy, and aggregation method, on the performance and efficiency of
federated FM tuning using brain MRI data. Using a large multi-cohort dataset,
we find that the architecture of the classification head substantially
influences performance, freezing the FM encoder achieves comparable results to
full fine-tuning, and advanced aggregation methods outperform standard
federated averaging. Our results offer practical insights for deploying FMs in
decentralized clinical settings and highlight trade-offs that should guide
future method development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OOD检测方法通常只关注单一技术家族或在特定类型OOD数据集上评估，忽视了结合多种现有解决方案的潜力。

Method: 提出MME评分函数，统一了最先进的OOD检测器，结合特征截断技术和多种评分函数的聚合。

Result: 在大型和小型基准测试中，MME在所有基准上都显著优于最新方法，在ImageNet-1K基准上FPR95达到27.57%，比现有最佳基线提升6%。

Conclusion: 理论分析和实验证明，结合多种OOD检测技术可以显著提升检测性能，MME方法在各类OOD场景中都表现出色。

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential for neural networks
operating in open-world settings, particularly in safety-critical applications.
Existing methods have improved OOD detection by leveraging two main techniques:
feature truncation, which increases the separation between in-distribution (ID)
and OOD samples, and scoring functions, which assign scores to distinguish
between ID and OOD data. However, most approaches either focus on a single
family of techniques or evaluate their effectiveness on a specific type of OOD
dataset, overlooking the potential of combining multiple existing solutions.
Motivated by this observation, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate
that state-of-the-art feature truncation and scoring functions can be
effectively combined. Moreover, we show that aggregating multiple scoring
functions enhances robustness against various types of OOD samples. Based on
these insights, we propose the Multi-Method Ensemble (MME) score, which unifies
state-of-the-art OOD detectors into a single, more effective scoring function.
Extensive experiments on both large-scale and small-scale benchmarks, covering
near-OOD and far-OOD scenarios, show that MME significantly outperforms recent
state-of-the-art methods across all benchmarks. Notably, using the BiT model,
our method achieves an average FPR95 of 27.57% on the challenging ImageNet-1K
benchmark, improving performance by 6% over the best existing baseline.

Motivation: 传统数据变换方法过度增强图像背景或无关区域会引入干扰，导致误检测，这些错误并非由对抗补丁本身引起，而是背景和非目标区域的过度增强所致

Result: 在HRSC2016数据集上的实验表明，该方法有效提高了对抗补丁攻击的成功率并增强了其迁移性

Conclusion: 局部增强方法通过减少背景干扰，使对抗攻击更专注于目标区域，显著提升了攻击效果和迁移能力

Abstract: Current ship detection techniques based on remote sensing imagery primarily
rely on the object detection capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs).
However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, which can lead to
misclassification by the detection model or complete evasion of the targets.
Numerous studies have demonstrated that data transformation-based methods can
improve the transferability of adversarial examples. However, excessive
augmentation of image backgrounds or irrelevant regions may introduce
unnecessary interference, resulting in false detections of the object detection
model. These errors are not caused by the adversarial patches themselves but
rather by the over-augmentation of background and non-target areas. This paper
proposes a localized augmentation method that applies augmentation only to the
target regions, avoiding any influence on non-target areas. By reducing
background interference, this approach enables the loss function to focus more
directly on the impact of the adversarial patch on the detection model, thereby
improving the attack success rate. Experiments conducted on the HRSC2016
dataset demonstrate that the proposed method effectively increases the success
rate of adversarial patch attacks and enhances their transferability.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个专门针对长视频幻觉的基准ELV-Halluc，系统研究了语义聚合幻觉(SAH)，发现SAH随语义复杂性增加而增加，并提出了位置编码和DPO策略来缓解SAH，在基准测试中取得了显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频多模态大语言模型在视频理解方面取得了显著进展，但仍然容易产生与视频输入不一致或无关的幻觉内容。之前的视频幻觉基准主要关注短视频，将幻觉归因于语言先验、缺失帧或视觉编码器引入的视觉语言偏差，但这些原因过于简化了幻觉的成因。特别是在长视频中，语义复杂性增加，需要专门研究语义聚合幻觉(SAH)。

Method: 引入了首个专门针对长视频幻觉的基准ELV-Halluc，系统研究语义聚合幻觉(SAH)。通过实验确认SAH的存在，分析其与语义复杂性的关系。探讨了缓解SAH的潜在方法，包括位置编码策略和采用DPO策略来增强模型区分事件内和事件间语义的能力。为此策划了包含8K对抗数据对的数据集。

Result: 实验证实了SAH的存在，并显示SAH随语义复杂性增加而增加。发现模型在快速变化的语义上更容易产生SAH。通过位置编码策略和DPO策略的实施，在ELV-Halluc和Video-MME基准上都取得了改进，包括SAH比率大幅降低27.7%。

Conclusion: 该研究首次系统性地研究了长视频中的语义聚合幻觉问题，提出了有效的基准和方法来缓解SAH。结果表明通过适当的位置编码和DPO训练策略可以显著改善模型在复杂语义场景下的表现，为视频多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Video multimodal large language models (Video-MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in video understanding. However, they remain vulnerable to
hallucination-producing content inconsistent with or unrelated to video inputs.
Previous video hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on short-videos. They
attribute hallucinations to factors such as strong language priors, missing
frames, or vision-language biases introduced by the visual encoder. While these
causes indeed account for most hallucinations in short videos, they still
oversimplify the cause of hallucinations. Sometimes, models generate incorrect
outputs but with correct frame-level semantics. We refer to this type of
hallucination as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), which arises during
the process of aggregating frame-level semantics into event-level semantic
groups. Given that SAH becomes particularly critical in long videos due to
increased semantic complexity across multiple events, it is essential to
separate and thoroughly investigate the causes of this type of hallucination.
To address the above issues, we introduce ELV-Halluc, the first benchmark
dedicated to long-video hallucination, enabling a systematic investigation of
SAH. Our experiments confirm the existence of SAH and show that it increases
with semantic complexity. Additionally, we find that models are more prone to
SAH on rapidly changing semantics. Moreover, we discuss potential approaches to
mitigate SAH. We demonstrate that positional encoding strategy contributes to
alleviating SAH, and further adopt DPO strategy to enhance the model's ability
to distinguish semantics within and across events. To support this, we curate a
dataset of 8K adversarial data pairs and achieve improvements on both
ELV-Halluc and Video-MME, including a substantial 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio.

Method: 训练卷积神经网络，以输入图像为参考，对低分辨率（大patch尺寸）的基础模型特征进行上采样，无需额外训练即可应用于各种显微镜图像的特征提取和分割

Result: 上采样后的特征能够分离难以分割的相（如发丝裂纹），交互式分割使用这些深度特征能够以更少的标签和更快的速度产生高质量的分割结果

Conclusion: 该方法为显微镜图像分析提供了一种高效的特征增强解决方案，显著提升了分割质量和工作效率

Abstract: Feature foundation models - usually vision transformers - offer rich semantic
descriptors of images, useful for downstream tasks such as (interactive)
segmentation and object detection. For computational efficiency these
descriptors are often patch-based, and so struggle to represent the fine
features often present in micrographs; they also struggle with the large image
sizes present in materials and biological image analysis. In this work, we
train a convolutional neural network to upsample low-resolution (i.e, large
patch size) foundation model features with reference to the input image. We
apply this upsampler network (without any further training) to efficiently
featurise and then segment a variety of microscopy images, including plant
cells, a lithium-ion battery cathode and organic crystals. The richness of
these upsampled features admits separation of hard to segment phases, like
hairline cracks. We demonstrate that interactive segmentation with these deep
features produces high-quality segmentations far faster and with far fewer
labels than training or finetuning a more traditional convolutional network.

Conclusion: HCCM有效解决了无人机场景中的细粒度视觉语言理解问题，无需精确场景划分和严格约束，在检索和泛化能力方面表现优异。

Abstract: Natural Language-Guided Drones (NLGD) provide a novel paradigm for tasks such
as target matching and navigation. However, the wide field of view and complex
compositional semantics in drone scenarios pose challenges for vision-language
understanding. Mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs) emphasize global
alignment while lacking fine-grained semantics, and existing hierarchical
methods depend on precise entity partitioning and strict containment, limiting
effectiveness in dynamic environments. To address this, we propose the
Hierarchical Cross-Granularity Contrastive and Matching learning (HCCM)
framework with two components: (1) Region-Global Image-Text Contrastive
Learning (RG-ITC), which avoids precise scene partitioning and captures
hierarchical local-to-global semantics by contrasting local visual regions with
global text and vice versa; (2) Region-Global Image-Text Matching (RG-ITM),
which dispenses with rigid constraints and instead evaluates local semantic
consistency within global cross-modal representations, enhancing compositional
reasoning. Moreover, drone text descriptions are often incomplete or ambiguous,
destabilizing alignment. HCCM introduces a Momentum Contrast and Distillation
(MCD) mechanism to improve robustness. Experiments on GeoText-1652 show HCCM
achieves state-of-the-art Recall@1 of 28.8% (image retrieval) and 14.7% (text
retrieval). On the unseen ERA dataset, HCCM demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization with 39.93% mean recall (mR), outperforming fine-tuned
baselines.

Conclusion: 通过生成式方法有效解决了单图到全景重建的多重解释性问题，为高斯拱合技术提供了更强大的生成能力

Abstract: Gaussian splatting typically requires dense observations of the scene and can
fail to reconstruct occluded and unobserved areas. We propose a latent
diffusion model to reconstruct a complete 3D scene with Gaussian splats,
including the occluded parts, from only a single image during inference.
Completing the unobserved surfaces of a scene is challenging due to the
ambiguity of the plausible surfaces. Conventional methods use a
regression-based formulation to predict a single "mode" for occluded and
out-of-frustum surfaces, leading to blurriness, implausibility, and failure to
capture multiple possible explanations. Thus, they often address this problem
partially, focusing either on objects isolated from the background,
reconstructing only visible surfaces, or failing to extrapolate far from the
input views. In contrast, we propose a generative formulation to learn a
distribution of 3D representations of Gaussian splats conditioned on a single
input image. To address the lack of ground-truth training data, we propose a
Variational AutoReconstructor to learn a latent space only from 2D images in a
self-supervised manner, over which a diffusion model is trained. Our method
generates faithful reconstructions and diverse samples with the ability to
complete the occluded surfaces for high-quality 360-degree renderings.

Conclusion: 结合CLIP先验知识和不确定性感知采样，为成对排序提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Pairwise comparison is often favored over absolute rating or ordinal
classification in subjective or difficult annotation tasks due to its improved
reliability. However, exhaustive comparisons require a massive number of
annotations (O(n^2)). Recent work has greatly reduced the annotation burden
(O(n log n)) by actively sampling pairwise comparisons using a sorting
algorithm. We further improve annotation efficiency by (1) roughly pre-ordering
items using the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model
hierarchically without training, and (2) replacing easy, obvious human
comparisons with automated comparisons. The proposed EZ-Sort first produces a
CLIP-based zero-shot pre-ordering, then initializes bucket-aware Elo scores,
and finally runs an uncertainty-guided human-in-the-loop MergeSort. Validation
was conducted using various datasets: face-age estimation (FGNET), historical
image chronology (DHCI), and retinal image quality assessment (EyePACS). It
showed that EZ-Sort reduced human annotation cost by 90.5% compared to
exhaustive pairwise comparisons and by 19.8% compared to prior work (when n =
100), while improving or maintaining inter-rater reliability. These results
demonstrate that combining CLIP-based priors with uncertainty-aware sampling
yields an efficient and scalable solution for pairwise ranking.

Abstract: Modeling human-object interactions (HOI) from an egocentric perspective is a
largely unexplored yet important problem due to the increasing adoption of
wearable devices, such as smart glasses and watches. We investigate how much
information about interaction can be recovered from only head and wrists
tracking. Our answer is ECHO (Ego-Centric modeling of Human-Object
interactions), which, for the first time, proposes a unified framework to
recover three modalities: human pose, object motion, and contact from such
minimal observation. ECHO employs a Diffusion Transformer architecture and a
unique three-variate diffusion process, which jointly models human motion,
object trajectory, and contact sequence, allowing for flexible input
configurations. Our method operates in a head-centric canonical space,
enhancing robustness to global orientation. We propose a conveyor-based
inference, which progressively increases the diffusion timestamp with the frame
position, allowing us to process sequences of any length. Through extensive
evaluation, we demonstrate that ECHO outperforms existing methods that do not
offer the same flexibility, setting a state-of-the-art in egocentric HOI
reconstruction.

Abstract: Effectively understanding urban scenes requires fine-grained spatial
reasoning about objects, layouts, and depth cues. However, how well current
vision-language models (VLMs), pretrained on general scenes, transfer these
abilities to urban domain remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
conduct a comparative study of three off-the-shelf VLMs-BLIP-2, InstructBLIP,
and LLaVA-1.5-evaluating both zero-shot performance and the effects of
fine-tuning with a synthetic VQA dataset specific to urban scenes. We construct
such dataset from segmentation, depth, and object detection predictions of
street-view images, pairing each question with LLM-generated Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) answers for step-by-step reasoning supervision. Results show that while
VLMs perform reasonably well in zero-shot settings, fine-tuning with our

TL;DR: 提出了Temporal Flow Matching (TFM)方法，用于4D医学图像预测，能够学习时间分布并支持3D体积、多时间点和不规则采样，在三个公开数据集上超越了现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法大多只考虑单一时间上下文，或专注于分类回归任务，缺乏对细粒度空间预测的能力，且现有方法往往局限于单时间点、特定疾病或有其他技术限制。

Method: 提出了Temporal Flow Matching (TFM)生成轨迹方法，能够学习底层时间分布，支持3D体积、多个先验扫描和不规则采样，并能回退到最近图像预测器作为特殊情况。

Result: 在三个公开纵向数据集上的广泛基准测试表明，TFM始终超越自然成像中的时空方法，为4D医学图像预测建立了新的最先进和稳健基准。

Conclusion: TFM解决了医学成像中时间动态建模的基本差距，提供了一个统一的生成框架，在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Understanding temporal dynamics in medical imaging is crucial for
applications such as disease progression modeling, treatment planning and
anatomical development tracking. However, most deep learning methods either
consider only single temporal contexts, or focus on tasks like classification
or regression, limiting their ability for fine-grained spatial predictions.
While some approaches have been explored, they are often limited to single
timepoints, specific diseases or have other technical restrictions. To address
this fundamental gap, we introduce Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a unified
generative trajectory method that (i) aims to learn the underlying temporal
distribution, (ii) by design can fall back to a nearest image predictor, i.e.
predicting the last context image (LCI), as a special case, and (iii) supports
$3D$ volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling. Extensive
benchmarks on three public longitudinal datasets show that TFM consistently
surpasses spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging, establishing a new
state-of-the-art and robust baseline for $4D$ medical image prediction.

TL;DR: 该论文提出从基于单词的OCR转向基于行级别的OCR，以绕过单词分割错误并提供更大的上下文，从而提高准确性和效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OCR技术存在字符分割错误问题，现代技术转向单词级别OCR但带来了单词分割瓶颈。作者观察到需要进一步发展到行级别OCR来绕过单词检测错误并提供更大的句子上下文

Method: 提出从单词级别OCR到行级别OCR的自然逻辑演进，创建了包含251个英文页面图像的行级别标注数据集来训练和评估

Result: 实验显示端到端准确率显著提升5.4%，效率比基于单词的流程提高4倍

Conclusion: 向行级别OCR过渡具有显著优势，特别是对于文档图像，随着大语言模型的持续改进，该方法还有进一步利用这些进展的潜力

Abstract: Conventional optical character recognition (OCR) techniques segmented each
character and then recognized. This made them prone to error in character
segmentation, and devoid of context to exploit language models. Advances in
sequence to sequence translation in last decade led to modern techniques first
detecting words and then inputting one word at a time to a model to directly
output full words as sequence of characters. This allowed better utilization of
language models and bypass error-prone character segmentation step. We observe
that the above transition in style has moved the bottleneck in accuracy to word
segmentation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a natural and logical
progression from word level OCR to line-level OCR. The proposal allows to
bypass errors in word detection, and provides larger sentence context for
better utilization of language models. We show that the proposed technique not
only improves the accuracy but also efficiency of OCR. Despite our thorough
literature survey, we did not find any public dataset to train and benchmark
such shift from word to line-level OCR. Hence, we also contribute a
meticulously curated dataset of 251 English page images with line-level
annotations. Our experimentation revealed a notable end-to-end accuracy
improvement of 5.4%, underscoring the potential benefits of transitioning
towards line-level OCR, especially for document images. We also report a 4
times improvement in efficiency compared to word-based pipelines. With
continuous improvements in large language models, our methodology also holds
potential to exploit such advances. Project Website:

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了通过深度学习整合预前CT和术后病理全手片图像来提高清洁细胞胆癩癌复发风险预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Leibovich评分在复发风险分层方面有限，缺乏患者级别的分辨率并排除了形态学信息。需要开发更准确的多模态预测方法。

Method: 使用预训练编码器和Cox生存模型构建模块化深度学习框架，测试单模态、晚融合和中间融合等不同配置。

Result: 病理WSI模型表现优于CT模型，中间融合更优。最佳模型接近调整Leibovich评分。随机决策缩小了临床基线与学习模型的差距。

Conclusion: 基础模型多模态整合在个性化ccRCC风险预测中具有可行性，未来需探索更表达力的融合策略和更大多模态数据集。

Abstract: Recurrence risk estimation in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is
essential for guiding postoperative surveillance and treatment. The Leibovich
score remains widely used for stratifying distant recurrence risk but offers
limited patient-level resolution and excludes imaging information. This study
evaluates multimodal recurrence prediction by integrating preoperative computed
tomography (CT) and postoperative histopathology whole-slide images (WSIs). A
modular deep learning framework with pretrained encoders and Cox-based survival
modeling was tested across unimodal, late fusion, and intermediate fusion
setups. In a real-world ccRCC cohort, WSI-based models consistently
outperformed CT-only models, underscoring the prognostic strength of pathology.
Intermediate fusion further improved performance, with the best model
(TITAN-CONCH with ResNet-18) approaching the adjusted Leibovich score. Random
tie-breaking narrowed the gap between the clinical baseline and learned models,
suggesting discretization may overstate individualized performance. Using
simple embedding concatenation, radiology added value primarily through fusion.
These findings demonstrate the feasibility of foundation model-based multimodal
integration for personalized ccRCC risk prediction. Future work should explore
more expressive fusion strategies, larger multimodal datasets, and
general-purpose CT encoders to better match pathology modeling capacity.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法存在三个主要问题：端到端网络忽略物理关系降低可解释性，CNN方法感受野有限难以捕获长距离依赖，ASM方法局限于有限近场距离

Method: 深度展开网络将梯度下降分解为自适应带宽保持模型（ABPM）和相位域复值去噪器（PCD），其中PCD使用复值可变形自注意力模块捕获全局特征

Result: 实现了超过35dB的PSNR，在模拟和真实数据上均达到最先进的结果，ABPM相比ASM方法支持更宽的工作距离

Conclusion: 所提出的深度展开网络通过结合物理模型和深度学习，在保持可解释性的同时提升了计算机生成全息的重建精度和灵活性

Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) has gained wide attention with deep
learning-based algorithms. However, due to its nonlinear and ill-posed nature,
challenges remain in achieving accurate and stable reconstruction.
Specifically, ($i$) the widely used end-to-end networks treat the
reconstruction model as a black box, ignoring underlying physical
relationships, which reduces interpretability and flexibility. ($ii$) CNN-based
CGH algorithms have limited receptive fields, hindering their ability to
capture long-range dependencies and global context. ($iii$) Angular spectrum
method (ASM)-based models are constrained to finite near-fields.In this paper,
we propose a Deep Unfolding Network (DUN) that decomposes gradient descent into
two modules: an adaptive bandwidth-preserving model (ABPM) and a phase-domain
complex-valued denoiser (PCD), providing more flexibility. ABPM allows for
wider working distances compared to ASM-based methods. At the same time, PCD
leverages its complex-valued deformable self-attention module to capture global
features and enhance performance, achieving a PSNR over 35 dB. Experiments on
simulated and real data show state-of-the-art results.

Method: 扩展nnU-Net框架支持用户提示，将前景/背景点击编码为额外输入通道，系统测试欧几里得距离变换和高斯内核编码方案，采用在线用户交互模拟和自定义点采样策略

Conclusion: 可提示模型在多跟踪剂、多中心PET/CT中实现高效用户导航分割流程具有巨大潜力，代码已开源

Abstract: Whole-body PET/CT is a cornerstone of oncological imaging, yet accurate
lesion segmentation remains challenging due to tracer heterogeneity,
physiological uptake, and multi-center variability. While fully automated
methods have advanced substantially, clinical practice benefits from approaches
that keep humans in the loop to efficiently refine predicted masks. The
autoPET/CT IV challenge addresses this need by introducing interactive
segmentation tasks based on simulated user prompts. In this work, we present
our submission to Task 1. Building on the winning autoPET III nnU-Net pipeline,
we extend the framework with promptable capabilities by encoding user-provided
foreground and background clicks as additional input channels. We
systematically investigate representations for spatial prompts and demonstrate
that Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT) encodings consistently outperform
Gaussian kernels. Furthermore, we propose online simulation of user
interactions and a custom point sampling strategy to improve robustness under
realistic prompting conditions. Our ensemble of EDT-based models, trained with
and without external data, achieves the strongest cross-validation performance,
reducing both false positives and false negatives compared to baseline models.
These results highlight the potential of promptable models to enable efficient,
user-guided segmentation workflows in multi-tracer, multi-center PET/CT. Code

Motivation: 现有HD地图构建方法使用基于注意力的标准映射技术，存在泛化问题，容易产生虚假道路元素，需要更精确的图像到BEV空间映射

Method: 基于相机参数的几何映射，结合新颖的概率投影机制和置信度评分，选择性积累时间信息，过滤无关元素

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse2数据集的新划分上表现优于最先进方法，特别是在nuScenes和长感知距离场景中改进显著

Conclusion: 提出的概率投影机制通过几何映射和置信度过滤有效提高了HD地图构建的准确性和泛化能力

Abstract: Constructing high-definition (HD) maps from sensory input requires accurately
mapping the road elements in image space to the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space.
The precision of this mapping directly impacts the quality of the final
vectorized HD map. Existing HD mapping approaches outsource the projection to
standard mapping techniques, such as attention-based ones. However, these
methods struggle with accuracy due to generalization problems, often
hallucinating non-existent road elements. Our key idea is to start with a
geometric mapping based on camera parameters and adapt it to the scene to
extract relevant map information from camera images. To implement this, we
propose a novel probabilistic projection mechanism with confidence scores to
(i) refine the mapping to better align with the scene and (ii) filter out
irrelevant elements that should not influence HD map generation. In addition,
we improve temporal processing by using confidence scores to selectively
accumulate reliable information over time. Experiments on new splits of the
nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate improved performance over
state-of-the-art approaches, indicating better generalization. The improvements
are particularly pronounced on nuScenes and in the challenging long perception
range. Our code and model checkpoints are available at

Result: 在7个目标检测数据集上，仅用500张合成图像就比ODGEN基线5000张图像的mAP@.50:.95提升高达21.3%

Conclusion: 质量优先的效率导向方法比暴力生成更有效，使先进合成数据生成更实用和易于获取

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated
significant potential in augmenting scarce datasets for object detection tasks.
Nevertheless, most recent models rely on resource-intensive full fine-tuning of
large-scale diffusion models, requiring enterprise-grade GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA
V100) and thousands of synthetic images. To address these limitations, we
propose Flux LoRA Augmentation (FLORA), a lightweight synthetic data generation
pipeline. Our approach uses the Flux 1.1 Dev diffusion model, fine-tuned
exclusively through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This dramatically reduces
computational requirements, enabling synthetic dataset generation with a
consumer-grade GPU (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090). We empirically evaluate our
approach on seven diverse object detection datasets. Our results demonstrate
that training object detectors with just 500 synthetic images generated by our
approach yields superior detection performance compared to models trained on
5000 synthetic images from the ODGEN baseline, achieving improvements of up to
21.3% in mAP@.50:.95. This work demonstrates that it is possible to surpass
state-of-the-art performance with far greater efficiency, as FLORA achieves
superior results using only 10% of the data and a fraction of the computational
cost. This work demonstrates that a quality and efficiency-focused approach is
more effective than brute-force generation, making advanced synthetic data
creation more practical and accessible for real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 现有对抗样本检测方法需要重新训练、修改网络结构或影响原始模型性能，而对抗扰动会在CNN激活中产生可检测的熵特征

Method: 在VGG-16上并行监测激活熵，发现对抗输入在早期卷积层中使激活熵产生7%的偏移

Result: 实现90%的检测准确率，假阳性和假阴性率低于20%，清洁和对抗输入的熵分布完全分离

Conclusion: CNN可靠性可以通过激活熵单独评估，实现实时检测对抗样本的自诊断视觉系统，且不影响原始模型性能

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the foundation of modern
computer vision, achieving unprecedented accuracy across diverse image
recognition tasks. While these networks excel on in-distribution data, they
remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations imperceptible input
modifications that cause misclassification with high confidence. However,
existing detection methods either require expensive retraining, modify network
architecture, or degrade performance on clean inputs. Here we show that
adversarial perturbations create immediate, detectable entropy signatures in
CNN activations that can be monitored without any model modification. Using
parallel entropy monitoring on VGG-16, we demonstrate that adversarial inputs
consistently shift activation entropy by 7% in early convolutional layers,
enabling 90% detection accuracy with false positives and false negative rates
below 20%. The complete separation between clean and adversarial entropy
distributions reveals that CNNs inherently encode distribution shifts in their
activation patterns. This work establishes that CNN reliability can be assessed
through activation entropy alone, enabling practical deployment of
self-diagnostic vision systems that detect adversarial inputs in real-time
without compromising original model performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities across various multimodal tasks. They continue,
however, to struggle with trivial scenarios such as reading values from Digital
Measurement Devices (DMDs), particularly in real-world conditions involving
clutter, occlusions, extreme viewpoints, and motion blur; common in
head-mounted cameras and Augmented Reality (AR) applications. Motivated by
these limitations, this work introduces CAD2DMD-SET, a synthetic data
generation tool designed to support visual question answering (VQA) tasks
involving DMDs. By leveraging 3D CAD models, advanced rendering, and
high-fidelity image composition, our tool produces diverse, VQA-labelled
synthetic DMD datasets suitable for fine-tuning LVLMs. Additionally, we present
DMDBench, a curated validation set of 1,000 annotated real-world images
designed to evaluate model performance under practical constraints.
Benchmarking three state-of-the-art LVLMs using Average Normalised Levenshtein
Similarity (ANLS) and further fine-tuning LoRA's of these models with
CAD2DMD-SET's generated dataset yielded substantial improvements, with InternVL
showcasing a score increase of 200% without degrading on other tasks. This
demonstrates that the CAD2DMD-SET training dataset substantially improves the
robustness and performance of LVLMs when operating under the previously stated
challenging conditions. The CAD2DMD-SET tool is expected to be released as
open-source once the final version of this manuscript is prepared, allowing the
community to add different measurement devices and generate their own datasets.

Abstract: Visual sound source localization is a fundamental perception task that aims
to detect the location of sounding sources in a video given its audio. Despite
recent progress, we identify two shortcomings in current methods: 1) most
approaches perform poorly in cases with low audio-visual semantic
correspondence such as silence, noise, and offscreen sounds, i.e. in the
presence of negative audio; and 2) most prior evaluations are limited to
positive cases, where both datasets and metrics convey scenarios with a single
visible sound source in the scene. To address this, we introduce three key
contributions. First, we propose a new training strategy that incorporates
silence and noise, which improves performance in positive cases, while being
more robust against negative sounds. Our resulting self-supervised model,
SSL-SaN, achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other
self-supervised models, both in sound localization and cross-modal retrieval.
Second, we propose a new metric that quantifies the trade-off between alignment
and separability of auditory and visual features across positive and negative
audio-visual pairs. Third, we present IS3+, an extended and improved version of
the IS3 synthetic dataset with negative audio.

Abstract: GUI agent aims to enable automated operations on Mobile/PC devices, which is
an important task toward achieving artificial general intelligence. The rapid
advancement of VLMs accelerates the development of GUI agents, owing to their
powerful capabilities in visual understanding and task planning. However,
building a GUI agent remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of
operation trajectories, the availability of interactive infrastructure, and the
limitation of initial capabilities in foundation models. In this work, we
introduce UItron, an open-source foundational model for automatic GUI agents,
featuring advanced GUI perception, grounding, and planning capabilities. UItron
highlights the necessity of systemic data engineering and interactive
infrastructure as foundational components for advancing GUI agent development.
It not only systematically studies a series of data engineering strategies to
enhance training effects, but also establishes an interactive environment
connecting both Mobile and PC devices. In training, UItron adopts supervised
finetuning over perception and planning tasks in various GUI scenarios, and
then develop a curriculum reinforcement learning framework to enable complex
reasoning and exploration for online environments. As a result, UItron achieves
superior performance in benchmarks of GUI perception, grounding, and planning.
In particular, UItron highlights the interaction proficiency with top-tier
Chinese mobile APPs, as we identified a general lack of Chinese capabilities
even in state-of-the-art solutions. To this end, we manually collect over one
million steps of operation trajectories across the top 100 most popular apps,
and build the offline and online agent evaluation environments. Experimental
results demonstrate that UItron achieves significant progress in Chinese app
scenarios, propelling GUI agents one step closer to real-world application.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前域泛化评估对基础模型如CLIP不够挑战性，因为其预训练数据可能已覆盖现有基准。需要更好地评估CLIP在真实未见数据场景下的性能

Method: CLIP-DCA方法：1）使用单独领域头识别和增强CLIP编码器中的领域感知；2）通过合成生成多样化领域数据；3）鼓励从领域特征中分离实现领域不变分类

Result: CLIP-DCA相比现有方法在更具挑战性的评估中显示出显著改进，特别是在更OOD的数据集上性能提升明显

Conclusion: 增强领域感知是基础模型实现有效领域不变分类的前提，CLIP-DCA通过分离分类和增强领域感知表示的方法有效解决了CLIP在域泛化中的性能退化问题

Abstract: Evaluating domain generalization (DG) for foundational models like CLIP is
challenging, as web-scale pretraining data potentially covers many existing
benchmarks. Consequently, current DG evaluation may neither be sufficiently
challenging nor adequately test genuinely unseen data scenarios. To better
assess the performance of CLIP on DG in-the-wild, a scenario where CLIP
encounters challenging unseen data, we consider two approaches: (1) evaluating
on 33 diverse datasets with quantified out-of-distribution (OOD) scores after
fine-tuning CLIP on ImageNet, and (2) using unlearning to make CLIP `forget'
some domains as an approximation. We observe that CLIP's performance
deteriorates significantly on more OOD datasets. To address this, we present
CLIP-DCA (Disentangling Classification from enhanced domain Aware
representations). Our approach is motivated by the observation that while
standard domain invariance losses aim to make representations domain-invariant,
this can be harmful to foundation models by forcing the discarding of
domain-aware representations beneficial for generalization. We instead
hypothesize that enhancing domain awareness is a prerequisite for effective
domain-invariant classification in foundation models. CLIP-DCA identifies and
enhances domain awareness within CLIP's encoders using a separate domain head
and synthetically generated diverse domain data. Simultaneously, it encourages
domain-invariant classification through disentanglement from the domain
features. CLIP-DCA shows significant improvements within this challenging
evaluation compared to existing methods, particularly on datasets that are more
OOD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类在开放世界中面对不常见新概念时表现出卓越的泛化和发现能力，而现有研究主要关注封闭集中的典型数据。本文旨在探索非典型异常视频数据对开放世界学习的潜在益处。

Method: 收集包含各种非典型数据（如科幻、动画等）的新视频数据集，将其用于模型训练过程中的表示学习，并在三个关键任务上进行评估：OOD检测、新类别发现和零样本动作识别。

Result: 实验表明，即使使用简单的学习方法，非典型数据也能在各种设置下持续提升性能。增加非典型样本的类别多样性可进一步提升OOD检测性能；在新类别发现任务中，使用较小但语义更多样的非典型数据集比使用更大但更典型的数据集效果更好；在零样本动作识别中，非典型视频的语义多样性有助于模型更好地泛化到未见过的动作类别。

Conclusion: 非典型视频对开放世界中的视觉表示学习具有显著益处，新提出的数据集鼓励该方向的进一步研究。

Abstract: Humans usually show exceptional generalisation and discovery ability in the
open world, when being shown uncommon new concepts. Whereas most existing
studies in the literature focus on common typical data from closed sets,
open-world novel discovery is under-explored in videos. In this paper, we are
interested in asking: \textit{What if atypical unusual videos are exposed in
the learning process?} To this end, we collect a new video dataset consisting
of various types of unusual atypical data (\eg sci-fi, animation, \etc). To
study how such atypical data may benefit open-world learning, we feed them into
the model training process for representation learning. Focusing on three key
tasks in open-world learning: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, novel
category discovery (NCD), and zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR), we found
that even straightforward learning approaches with atypical data consistently
improve performance across various settings. Furthermore, we found that
increasing the categorical diversity of the atypical samples further boosts OOD
detection performance. Additionally, in the NCD task, using a smaller yet more
semantically diverse set of atypical samples leads to better performance
compared to using a larger but more typical dataset. In the ZSAR setting, the
semantic diversity of atypical videos helps the model generalise better to
unseen action classes. These observations in our extensive experimental
evaluations reveal the benefits of atypical videos for visual representation
learning in the open world, together with the newly proposed dataset,
encouraging further studies in this direction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了无监督视频持续学习(uVCL)的新场景，使用核密度估计和视频transformer网络进行非参数化学习，通过新颖性检测动态扩展记忆集群，在多个视频数据集上取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频数据具有丰富的时空信息，但在无监督持续学习领域尚未充分探索。现有研究主要依赖标签和任务边界的有监督学习，而获取标注数据成本高昂且不实用。

Method: 使用无监督视频transformer网络提取深度嵌入特征，采用核密度估计作为数据的非参数概率表示。引入新颖性检测标准动态扩展记忆集群，并利用先前任务的迁移学习作为知识传递的初始状态。

Result: 在UCF101、HMDB51和Something-to-Something V2三个标准视频动作识别数据集上进行了深入评估，不使用任何标签或类别边界，所提方法在连续学习多个任务时显著提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: 提出的无监督视频持续学习方法有效解决了视频数据处理的计算和内存挑战，为非参数化学习提供了可行的解决方案，在无标签和任务边界的情况下实现了良好的持续学习效果。

Abstract: We propose a realistic scenario for the unsupervised video learning where
neither task boundaries nor labels are provided when learning a succession of
tasks. We also provide a non-parametric learning solution for the
under-explored problem of unsupervised video continual learning. Videos
represent a complex and rich spatio-temporal media information, widely used in
many applications, but which have not been sufficiently explored in
unsupervised continual learning. Prior studies have only focused on supervised
continual learning, relying on the knowledge of labels and task boundaries,
while having labeled data is costly and not practical. To address this gap, we
study the unsupervised video continual learning (uVCL). uVCL raises more
challenges due to the additional computational and memory requirements of
processing videos when compared to images. We introduce a general benchmark
experimental protocol for uVCL by considering the learning of unstructured
video data categories during each task. We propose to use the Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE) of deep embedded video features extracted by unsupervised
video transformer networks as a non-parametric probabilistic representation of
the data. We introduce a novelty detection criterion for the incoming new task
data, dynamically enabling the expansion of memory clusters, aiming to capture
new knowledge when learning a succession of tasks. We leverage the use of
transfer learning from the previous tasks as an initial state for the knowledge
transfer to the current learning task. We found that the proposed methodology
substantially enhances the performance of the model when successively learning
many tasks. We perform in-depth evaluations on three standard video action
recognition datasets, including UCF101, HMDB51, and Something-to-Something V2,
without using any labels or class boundaries.

TL;DR: 基于nnU-Net框架，采用多阶段级联预训练策略，通过数据增强和模型集成方法，在胰腺导管腺癌MRI分割任务中取得了优异性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺导管腺癌MRI自动分割面临肿瘤组织对比度差和标注数据稀缺的挑战，需要开发在有限数据下高性能的专门化模型

Method: 使用nnU-Net框架，采用深度多阶段级联预训练策略：从通用解剖基础模型开始，依次在CT胰腺病变数据集和目标MRI模态上微调。通过五折交叉验证评估数据增强方案，构建定制化异构集成模型

Result: Task 1获得0.661的Tumor Dice分数，Task 2获得0.523的Tumor Dice分数。Task 1达到最先进的MASD 5.46 mm和HD95 17.33 mm边界精度

Conclusion: 提出了一种在有限数据和复杂医学成像任务中开发专门化高性能模型的稳健方法，通过度量感知集成策略有效解决了数据增强的权衡问题

Abstract: Automated segmentation of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from MRI is
critical for clinical workflows but is hindered by poor tumor-tissue contrast
and a scarcity of annotated data. This paper details our submission to the
PANTHER challenge, addressing both diagnostic T1-weighted (Task 1) and
therapeutic T2-weighted (Task 2) segmentation. Our approach is built upon the
nnU-Net framework and leverages a deep, multi-stage cascaded pre-training
strategy, starting from a general anatomical foundation model and sequentially
fine-tuning on CT pancreatic lesion datasets and the target MRI modalities.
Through extensive five-fold cross-validation, we systematically evaluated data
augmentation schemes and training schedules. Our analysis revealed a critical
trade-off, where aggressive data augmentation produced the highest volumetric
accuracy, while default augmentations yielded superior boundary precision
(achieving a state-of-the-art MASD of 5.46 mm and HD95 of 17.33 mm for Task 1).
For our final submission, we exploited this finding by constructing custom,
heterogeneous ensembles of specialist models, essentially creating a mix of
experts. This metric-aware ensembling strategy proved highly effective,
achieving a top cross-validation Tumor Dice score of 0.661 for Task 1 and 0.523
for Task 2. Our work presents a robust methodology for developing specialized,
high-performance models in the context of limited data and complex medical
imaging tasks (Team MIC-DKFZ).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPT-5在放射肿瘤学领域表现优异，在多项选择题测试中准确率达92.8%，显著超越GPT-4和GPT-3.5，在真实病例治疗建议生成中也获得较高评分，但仍需专家监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型GPT-5在临床决策支持，特别是放射肿瘤学领域的应用潜力，验证其在该专业领域的性能表现。

Method: 使用两个基准测试：300道多项选择题的ACR放射肿瘤学培训考试，以及60个真实放射肿瘤病例的治疗方案生成评估，由4名认证放射肿瘤学家进行评分。

Result: GPT-5在多项选择题测试中准确率92.8%，显著优于GPT-4(78.8%)和GPT-3.5(62.1%)；在病例评估中正确性评分3.24/4，全面性评分3.59/4，幻觉现象罕见。

Conclusion: GPT-5在放射肿瘤学领域表现优异，但仍存在改进空间，生成的建议需要严格的专家监督才能临床使用，特别是在复杂场景中容易出错。

Abstract: Introduction: Large language models (LLM) have shown great potential in
clinical decision support. GPT-5 is a novel LLM system that has been
specifically marketed towards oncology use.
  Methods: Performance was assessed using two complementary benchmarks: (i) the
ACR Radiation Oncology In-Training Examination (TXIT, 2021), comprising 300
multiple-choice items, and (ii) a curated set of 60 authentic radiation
oncologic vignettes representing diverse disease sites and treatment
indications. For the vignette evaluation, GPT-5 was instructed to generate
concise therapeutic plans. Four board-certified radiation oncologists rated
correctness, comprehensiveness, and hallucinations. Inter-rater reliability was
quantified using Fleiss' \k{appa}.
  Results: On the TXIT benchmark, GPT-5 achieved a mean accuracy of 92.8%,
outperforming GPT-4 (78.8%) and GPT-3.5 (62.1%). Domain-specific gains were
most pronounced in Dose and Diagnosis. In the vignette evaluation, GPT-5's
treatment recommendations were rated highly for correctness (mean 3.24/4, 95%
CI: 3.11-3.38) and comprehensiveness (3.59/4, 95% CI: 3.49-3.69).
Hallucinations were rare with no case reaching majority consensus for their
presence. Inter-rater agreement was low (Fleiss' \k{appa} 0.083 for
correctness), reflecting inherent variability in clinical judgment. Errors
clustered in complex scenarios requiring precise trial knowledge or detailed
clinical adaptation.
  Discussion: GPT-5 clearly outperformed prior model variants on the radiation
oncology multiple-choice benchmark. Although GPT-5 exhibited favorable
performance in generating real-world radiation oncology treatment
recommendations, correctness ratings indicate room for further improvement.
While hallucinations were infrequent, the presence of substantive errors
underscores that GPT-5-generated recommendations require rigorous expert
oversight before clinical implementation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TMUAD是一个统一的结构和逻辑异常检测框架，通过三类互补的记忆库（文本、对象、补丁级）实现多级异常检测，在工业和医疗数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖精心设计的图像特征提取器和记忆库来捕捉对象间逻辑关系，但在正常数据有限的情况下，异常检测仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 提出三记忆库框架：1）类级文本记忆库用于逻辑异常检测；2）对象级图像记忆库保持完整对象轮廓；3）补丁级记忆库用于结构异常检测。通过多级检索和比较计算异常分数。

Result: 在7个公开数据集（工业和医疗领域）上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过协作记忆库统一结构和逻辑异常检测，TMUAD框架有效解决了正常数据有限情况下的异常检测问题，并在多个领域数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: Anomaly detection, which aims to identify anomalies deviating from normal
patterns, is challenging due to the limited amount of normal data available.
Unlike most existing unified methods that rely on carefully designed image
feature extractors and memory banks to capture logical relationships between
objects, we introduce a text memory bank to enhance the detection of logical
anomalies. Specifically, we propose a Three-Memory framework for Unified
structural and logical Anomaly Detection (TMUAD). First, we build a class-level
text memory bank for logical anomaly detection by the proposed logic-aware text
extractor, which can capture rich logical descriptions of objects from input
images. Second, we construct an object-level image memory bank that preserves
complete object contours by extracting features from segmented objects. Third,
we employ visual encoders to extract patch-level image features for
constructing a patch-level memory bank for structural anomaly detection. These
three complementary memory banks are used to retrieve and compare normal images
that are most similar to the query image, compute anomaly scores at multiple
levels, and fuse them into a final anomaly score. By unifying structural and
logical anomaly detection through collaborative memory banks, TMUAD achieves
state-of-the-art performance across seven publicly available datasets involving
industrial and medical domains. The model and code are available at
https://github.com/SIA-IDE/TMUAD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VoCap是一个灵活的视频模型，能够处理视频和多种模态提示（文本、框或掩码），生成时空掩码和对应的物体中心描述，同时解决可提示视频物体分割、参考表达分割和物体描述任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频理解需要细粒度定位掩码和详细语义属性，但获取此类数据既繁琐又昂贵。

Method: 通过在现有大规模分割数据集（SAV）上使用伪物体描述进行标注，利用带真实掩码的视频预处理突出目标物体，并输入大型视觉语言模型生成描述。训练时混合使用SAV-Caption和其他图像视频数据集。

Result: 在参考表达视频物体分割任务上达到最先进水平，在半监督视频物体分割上具有竞争力，并为视频物体描述建立了基准。

Conclusion: VoCap模型通过创新的数据标注方法和多任务训练策略，在多个视频理解任务上取得了优异性能，相关数据集将公开提供。

Abstract: Understanding objects in videos in terms of fine-grained localization masks
and detailed semantic properties is a fundamental task in video understanding.
In this paper, we propose VoCap, a flexible video model that consumes a video
and a prompt of various modalities (text, box or mask), and produces a
spatio-temporal masklet with a corresponding object-centric caption. As such
our model addresses simultaneously the tasks of promptable video object
segmentation, referring expression segmentation, and object captioning. Since
obtaining data for this task is tedious and expensive, we propose to annotate
an existing large-scale segmentation dataset (SAV) with pseudo object captions.
We do so by preprocessing videos with their ground-truth masks to highlight the
object of interest and feed this to a large Vision Language Model (VLM). For an
unbiased evaluation, we collect manual annotations on the validation set. We
call the resulting dataset SAV-Caption. We train our VoCap model at scale on a
SAV-Caption together with a mix of other image and video datasets. Our model
yields state-of-the-art results on referring expression video object
segmentation, is competitive on semi-supervised video object segmentation, and
establishes a benchmark for video object captioning. Our dataset will be made
available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/vocap.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将动词分类视为单标签问题，但视觉事件识别存在固有歧义性，同一图像可能被多个动词类别合理描述，需要多标签方法来解决语义重叠问题

Method: 提出单正例多标签学习(SPMLL)框架，设计Graph Enhanced Verb Multilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP)，结合图神经网络捕捉标签相关性，使用对抗训练优化决策边界

Result: 在真实数据集上实验显示，方法在MAP指标上获得超过3%的提升，同时在传统top-1和top-5准确率指标上保持竞争力

Conclusion: 动词分类本质上是多标签问题，提出的SPMLL框架和GE-VerbMLP模型有效解决了单正例标注下的多标签学习挑战，为场景识别任务提供了更准确的动词分类能力

Abstract: Context recognition (SR) is a fundamental task in computer vision that aims
to extract structured semantic summaries from images by identifying key events
and their associated entities. Specifically, given an input image, the model
must first classify the main visual events (verb classification), then identify
the participating entities and their semantic roles (semantic role labeling),
and finally localize these entities in the image (semantic role localization).
Existing methods treat verb classification as a single-label problem, but we
show through a comprehensive analysis that this formulation fails to address
the inherent ambiguity in visual event recognition, as multiple verb categories
may reasonably describe the same image. This paper makes three key
contributions: First, we reveal through empirical analysis that verb
classification is inherently a multi-label problem due to the ubiquitous
semantic overlap between verb categories. Second, given the impracticality of
fully annotating large-scale datasets with multiple labels, we propose to
reformulate verb classification as a single positive multi-label learning
(SPMLL) problem - a novel perspective in SR research. Third, we design a
comprehensive multi-label evaluation benchmark for SR that is carefully
designed to fairly evaluate model performance in a multi-label setting. To
address the challenges of SPMLL, we futher develop the Graph Enhanced Verb
Multilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP), which combines graph neural networks to
capture label correlations and adversarial training to optimize decision
boundaries. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach
achieves more than 3\% MAP improvement while remaining competitive on
traditional top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics.

TL;DR: DriveQA是一个全面的开源文本和视觉基准测试，用于评估LLM和MLLM在驾驶知识测试中的表现，发现现有模型在数值推理、复杂路权场景等方面存在显著弱点，但通过微调和预训练可以显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶基准测试主要关注空间和视觉问答任务，但缺乏对交通规则、标志和路权原则的全面理解评估。人类驾驶员需要识别现实数据集中罕见的边缘案例，因此需要构建一个全面的驾驶知识测试基准。

Method: 开发了DriveQA基准测试，包含文本和视觉版本(DriveQA-V)，涵盖交通法规和场景的各个方面。通过实验评估最先进的LLM和MLLM模型，并进行微调和预训练实验。

Result: 1) SOTA模型在基本交通规则上表现良好，但在数值推理、复杂路权场景、交通标志变体和空间布局方面存在显著弱点；2) 在DriveQA上微调可提高多个类别的准确性；3) DriveQA-V揭示了模型对环境因素的敏感性；4) 预训练可提升下游驾驶任务性能。

Conclusion: DriveQA为评估驾驶AI系统提供了全面的基准，揭示了当前模型的局限性，同时证明通过适当的训练可以显著提升模型在复杂驾驶场景中的理解和推理能力，有助于推动更安全的自动驾驶系统发展。

Abstract: If a Large Language Model (LLM) were to take a driving knowledge test today,
would it pass? Beyond standard spatial and visual question-answering (QA) tasks
on current autonomous driving benchmarks, driving knowledge tests require a
complete understanding of all traffic rules, signage, and right-of-way
principles. To pass this test, human drivers must discern various edge cases
that rarely appear in real-world datasets. In this work, we present DriveQA, an
extensive open-source text and vision-based benchmark that exhaustively covers
traffic regulations and scenarios. Through our experiments using DriveQA, we
show that (1) state-of-the-art LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) perform well on
basic traffic rules but exhibit significant weaknesses in numerical reasoning
and complex right-of-way scenarios, traffic sign variations, and spatial
layouts, (2) fine-tuning on DriveQA improves accuracy across multiple
categories, particularly in regulatory sign recognition and intersection
decision-making, (3) controlled variations in DriveQA-V provide insights into
model sensitivity to environmental factors such as lighting, perspective,
distance, and weather conditions, and (4) pretraining on DriveQA enhances
downstream driving task performance, leading to improved results on real-world
datasets such as nuScenes and BDD, while also demonstrating that models can
internalize text and synthetic traffic knowledge to generalize effectively
across downstream QA tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型容易学习训练数据中的伪相关性，利用这些非目标特征进行预测，导致性能下降和泛化能力差。需要一种方法同时处理多种偏见并增强分布外鲁棒性。

Method: CoBA框架：1）将文本分解为主谓宾三元组；2）选择性修改三元组以破坏伪相关性；3）从调整后的三元组重构文本生成反偏见数据。

Result: 实验表明CoBA不仅提升下游任务性能，还能有效减少偏见并增强分布外鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CoBA提供了一个通用且鲁棒的解决方案，能够有效应对伪相关性带来的挑战。

Abstract: Deep learning models often learn and exploit spurious correlations in
training data, using these non-target features to inform their predictions.
Such reliance leads to performance degradation and poor generalization on
unseen data. To address these limitations, we introduce a more general form of
counterfactual data augmentation, termed counterbias data augmentation, which
simultaneously tackles multiple biases (e.g., gender bias, simplicity bias) and
enhances out-of-distribution robustness. We present CoBA: CounterBias
Augmentation, a unified framework that operates at the semantic triple level:
first decomposing text into subject-predicate-object triples, then selectively
modifying these triples to disrupt spurious correlations. By reconstructing the
text from these adjusted triples, CoBA generates counterbias data that
mitigates spurious patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
CoBA not only improves downstream task performance, but also effectively
reduces biases and strengthens out-of-distribution resilience, offering a
versatile and robust solution to the challenges posed by spurious correlations.

Result: 16.7%的评论被标记为有问题，发现年轻用户偏好表达性语言，年长用户更常参与虚假信息和贬低行为

Conclusion: 该数据集为研究跨人口统计的语言变异提供了新机会，支持开发更公平和年龄感知的内容审核系统

Abstract: A lack of demographic context in existing toxic speech datasets limits our
understanding of how different age groups communicate online. In collaboration
with funk, a German public service content network, this research introduces
the first large-scale German dataset annotated for toxicity and enriched with
platform-provided age estimates. The dataset includes 3,024 human-annotated and
30,024 LLM-annotated anonymized comments from Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube.
To ensure relevance, comments were consolidated using predefined toxic
keywords, resulting in 16.7\% labeled as problematic. The annotation pipeline
combined human expertise with state-of-the-art language models, identifying key
categories such as insults, disinformation, and criticism of broadcasting fees.
The dataset reveals age-based differences in toxic speech patterns, with
younger users favoring expressive language and older users more often engaging
in disinformation and devaluation. This resource provides new opportunities for
studying linguistic variation across demographics and supports the development
of more equitable and age-aware content moderation systems.

Motivation: 误导性可视化图表是社交媒体和网络上错误信息的重要来源，违反图表设计原则会扭曲数据并导致读者得出错误结论。现有AI模型训练和评估缺乏大型、多样化、公开可用的数据集。

Method: 创建Misviz真实数据集和Misviz-synth合成数据集，使用最先进的多模态大语言模型、基于规则的系统以及微调分类器进行全面评估。

Result: 任务仍然极具挑战性，检测误导性可视化图表和识别违规设计规则对现有模型来说难度很大。

Conclusion: 发布了Misviz基准数据集、合成数据集和相关代码，为检测误导性可视化图表和减少错误信息传播提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Misleading visualizations are a potent driver of misinformation on social
media and the web. By violating chart design principles, they distort data and
lead readers to draw inaccurate conclusions. Prior work has shown that both
humans and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are frequently deceived by
such visualizations. Automatically detecting misleading visualizations and
identifying the specific design rules they violate could help protect readers
and reduce the spread of misinformation. However, the training and evaluation
of AI models has been limited by the absence of large, diverse, and openly
available datasets. In this work, we introduce Misviz, a benchmark of 2,604
real-world visualizations annotated with 12 types of misleaders. To support
model training, we also release Misviz-synth, a synthetic dataset of 81,814
visualizations generated using Matplotlib and based on real-world data tables.
We perform a comprehensive evaluation on both datasets using state-of-the-art
MLLMs, rule-based systems, and fine-tuned classifiers. Our results reveal that
the task remains highly challenging. We release Misviz, Misviz-synth, and the
accompanying code.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose TrInk, a Transformer-based model for ink

facilitate the alignment between the input text and generated stroke points, we

Abstract: Cognitive biases, well-studied in humans, can also be observed in LLMs,
affecting their reliability in real-world applications. This paper investigates
the anchoring effect in LLM-driven price negotiations. To this end, we
instructed seller LLM agents to apply the anchoring effect and evaluated
negotiations using not only an objective metric but also a subjective metric.
Experimental results show that LLMs are influenced by the anchoring effect like
humans. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between the anchoring
effect and factors such as reasoning and personality. It was shown that
reasoning models are less prone to the anchoring effect, suggesting that the
long chain of thought mitigates the effect. However, we found no significant
correlation between personality traits and susceptibility to the anchoring
effect. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of cognitive biases
in LLMs and to the realization of safe and responsible application of LLMs in
society.

TL;DR: Percept-V数据集包含7200张程序生成的图像，测试多模态大语言模型在基本视觉感知任务上的表现，发现模型性能随问题复杂度增加而显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在复杂任务上表现优异，但在基本视觉感知任务上的表现缺乏系统评估，需要构建专门的测试数据集。

Method: 创建Percept-V数据集，包含30个类别、7200张程序生成的图像，测试不同复杂度的基本视觉感知技能，并在GPT-4o、Gemini、Claude等先进模型上进行评估。

Result: 实验结果显示，所有测试模型在基本视觉感知任务上的性能都随问题复杂度增加而显著下降，且不同模型在各类别上表现出相似的趋势模式。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型在复杂任务上表现出色，但在基本视觉感知能力方面存在明显不足，需要进一步改进模型的底层视觉理解能力。

Abstract: The reasoning abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
garnered a lot of attention in recent times, with advances made in frontiers
like coding, mathematics, and science. However, very limited experiments have
been done to assess their performance in simple perception tasks performed over
uncontaminated, generated images containing basic shapes and structures. To
address this issue, the paper introduces a dataset, Percept-V, containing a
total of 7200 program-generated images equally divided into 30 categories, each
testing a combination of visual perception skills. Unlike previously proposed
datasets, Percept-V comprises very basic tasks of varying complexity that test
the perception abilities of MLLMs. This dataset is then tested on
state-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude as well as Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) like OpenAI o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 to gauge their
performance. Contrary to the evidence that MLLMs excel in many complex tasks,
our experiments show a significant drop in the models' performance with
increasing problem complexity across all categories. An analysis of the
performances also reveals that the tested MLLMs exhibit a similar trend in
accuracy across categories, testing a particular cognitive skill and find some
skills to be more difficult than others.

Abstract: Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) are transforming how knowledge is
represented, integrated, and applied in scientific research, yet their progress
is shaped by the complex nature of scientific data. This survey presents a
comprehensive, data-centric synthesis that reframes the development of Sci-LLMs
as a co-evolution between models and their underlying data substrate. We
formulate a unified taxonomy of scientific data and a hierarchical model of
scientific knowledge, emphasizing the multimodal, cross-scale, and
domain-specific challenges that differentiate scientific corpora from general
natural language processing datasets. We systematically review recent Sci-LLMs,
from general-purpose foundations to specialized models across diverse
scientific disciplines, alongside an extensive analysis of over 270
pre-/post-training datasets, showing why Sci-LLMs pose distinct demands --
heterogeneous, multi-scale, uncertainty-laden corpora that require
representations preserving domain invariance and enabling cross-modal
reasoning. On evaluation, we examine over 190 benchmark datasets and trace a
shift from static exams toward process- and discovery-oriented assessments with
advanced evaluation protocols. These data-centric analyses highlight persistent
issues in scientific data development and discuss emerging solutions involving
semi-automated annotation pipelines and expert validation. Finally, we outline
a paradigm shift toward closed-loop systems where autonomous agents based on
Sci-LLMs actively experiment, validate, and contribute to a living, evolving
knowledge base. Collectively, this work provides a roadmap for building
trustworthy, continually evolving artificial intelligence (AI) systems that
function as a true partner in accelerating scientific discovery.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM评估存在显著标签偏见：Claude标签总能提升评分，Gemini标签总是降低评分，错误标签经常导致排名反转，评分差异可达50个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型越来越多地被用于评估输出，需要研究其判断是否受到模型标签偏见的影响，以确保评估的公平性。

Method: 使用ChatGPT、Gemini和Claude三种模型，在无标签、真实标签和两种错误标签条件下，通过整体偏好投票和三个质量维度（连贯性、信息性、简洁性）的百分比评分进行自评和交叉评估。

Result: 发现明显的非对称偏见：Claude标签始终提高分数，Gemini标签始终降低分数，与内容无关。错误标签经常反转排名，偏好投票差异达50个百分点，质量评分差异达12个百分点。

Conclusion: 感知到的模型身份会严重扭曲高级判断并微妙影响详细质量评分，强调需要盲评或多模型评估协议来确保LLM基准测试的公平性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate outputs, yet
their judgments may be influenced. This study examines bias in self- and
cross-model evaluations by ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude under four conditions:
no labels, true labels, and two false-label scenarios. Blog posts authored by
each model were evaluated by all three using both overall preference voting and
quality ratings for Coherence, Informativeness, and Conciseness, with all
scores expressed as percentages for direct comparison. Results reveal striking
asymmetries: the "Claude" label consistently boosts scores, while the "Gemini"
label consistently depresses them, regardless of actual content. False labels
frequently reversed rankings, producing shifts of up to 50 percentage points in
preference votes and up to 12 percentage points in converted quality ratings.
Gemini's self-scores collapsed under true labels, while Claude's
self-preference intensified. These findings show that perceived model identity
can heavily distort high-level judgments and subtly influence detailed quality
ratings, underscoring the need for blind or multimodel evaluation protocols to
ensure fairness in LLM benchmarking.

TL;DR: BED-LLM方法通过贝叶斯实验设计框架，让大语言模型能够智能地选择最大化信息增益的问题，显著提升了多轮对话中的信息收集能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升大语言模型在对话中智能收集信息的能力，使其能够作为有效的多轮对话代理与外部环境交互

Method: 基于序列贝叶斯实验设计框架，迭代选择最大化期望信息增益的问题，使用从LLM信念分布导出的概率模型，并设计了专门的EIG估计器和候选查询策略

Result: 在20个问题游戏和用户偏好推断测试中，相比直接提示和其他自适应策略，BED-LLM取得了显著的性能提升

Conclusion: BED-LLM为LLM提供了原则性的信息收集框架，通过贝叶斯实验设计显著增强了模型的多轮对话和交互能力

Abstract: We propose a general-purpose approach for improving the ability of Large
Language Models (LLMs) to intelligently and adaptively gather information from
a user or other external source using the framework of sequential Bayesian
experimental design (BED). This enables LLMs to act as effective multi-turn
conversational agents and interactively interface with external environments.
Our approach, which we call BED-LLM (Bayesian Experimental Design with Large
Language Models), is based on iteratively choosing questions or queries that
maximize the expected information gain (EIG) about the task of interest given
the responses gathered previously. We show how this EIG can be formulated in a
principled way using a probabilistic model derived from the LLM's belief
distribution and provide detailed insights into key decisions in its
construction. Further key to the success of BED-LLM are a number of specific
innovations, such as a carefully designed estimator for the EIG, not solely
relying on in-context updates for conditioning on previous responses, and a
targeted strategy for proposing candidate queries. We find that BED-LLM
achieves substantial gains in performance across a wide range of tests based on
the 20-questions game and using the LLM to actively infer user preferences,
compared to direct prompting of the LLM and other adaptive design strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HFACS分析方法存在可扩展性和一致性问题，需要自动化解决方案来提升航空事故人为因素分析的效率和准确性。

Method: 采用强化学习GRPO微调Llama-3.1 8B语言模型，结合多组件奖励系统和合成数据生成技术处理类别不平衡问题。

Result: 模型性能显著提升：精确匹配准确率从0.0400提高到0.1800（提升350%），部分匹配准确率达到0.8800，超越GPT-5-mini和Gemini-2.5-fiash等先进模型。

Conclusion: 领域优化的小型模型能够为关键安全分析提供计算效率更高、性能更好的解决方案，并支持在资源受限的边缘设备上进行低延迟部署。

Abstract: Analyzing the human factors behind aviation accidents is crucial for
preventing future incidents, yet traditional methods using the Human Factors
Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) are limited by scalability and
consistency. To address this, we introduce an automated HFACS classification
framework for aviation safety analysis that utilizes Reinforcement Learning
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune a Llama-3.1 8B
language model. Our approach incorporates a multi-component reward system
tailored for aviation safety analysis and integrates synthetic data generation
to overcome class imbalance in accident datasets. The resulting GRPO-optimized
model achieved noticeable performance gains, including a 350% increase in exact
match accuracy (from 0.0400 to 0.1800) and an improved partial match accuracy
of 0.8800. Significantly, our specialized model outperforms state-of-the-art
LLMs (Large Language Models), including GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-fiash, on key
metrics. This research also proposes exact match accuracy in multi-label HFACS
classification problem as a new benchmarking methodology to evaluate the
advanced reasoning capabilities of language models. Ultimately, our work
validates that smaller, domain-optimized models can provide a computationally
efficient and better solution for critical safety analysis. This approach makes
powerful, low-latency deployment on resource-constrained edge devices feasible.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于像素的生成语言模型，通过将单词渲染为图像来解决自回归语言模型对多语言字符攻击的脆弱性问题，在多个数据集上验证了其鲁棒性和多语言有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归语言模型容易受到多语言字符的正字法攻击，导致性能显著下降，这主要源于子词分词器及其嵌入的词汇表外问题。

Method: 提出像素基生成语言模型，用基于像素的表示替代基于文本的嵌入，将单词渲染为单个图像，从而增强对噪声输入的鲁棒性并扩展多语言兼容性。

Result: 在多语言LAMBADA数据集、WMT24数据集和SST-2基准测试中评估，证明了该方法对正字法噪声的韧性和在多语言环境中的有效性。

Conclusion: 像素基表示方法为解决语言模型的正字法攻击脆弱性提供了有效解决方案，同时增强了多语言文本处理能力。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models are vulnerable to orthographic attacks, where
input text is perturbed with characters from multilingual alphabets, leading to
substantial performance degradation. This vulnerability primarily stems from
the out-of-vocabulary issue inherent in subword tokenizers and their
embeddings. To address this limitation, we propose a pixel-based generative
language model that replaces the text-based embeddings with pixel-based
representations by rendering words as individual images. This design provides
stronger robustness to noisy inputs, while an extension of compatibility to
multilingual text across diverse writing systems. We evaluate the proposed
method on the multilingual LAMBADA dataset, WMT24 dataset and the SST-2
benchmark, demonstrating both its resilience to orthographic noise and its
effectiveness in multilingual settings.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨自监督语音模型是否表现出人类语言习得中的关键期效应，发现这些模型在音位习得方面并未显示明确的关键期效应证据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 关键期效应指第二语言习得难度随接触时间延迟而增加，第一语言保持能力随接触时间延长而增强。先前研究主要基于文本语言模型，而语音在人类语言习得中的核心作用使得探索语音模型中的这些效应具有重要意义。

Method: 在儿童导向语音数据上训练自监督语音模型，设置不同的第二语言训练起始时间和第一语言训练结束时间，评估模型的音位辨别性能。

Result: 自监督语音模型未显示出明确的音位习得关键期效应。延迟第二语言接触起始的模型在第二语言上表现更好，延迟第一语言接触结束会导致第一语言遗忘。

Conclusion: 自监督语音模型在音位层面不重现人类语言习得的关键期效应模式，表明当前模型架构与人类语言学习机制存在重要差异。

Abstract: This paper investigates whether the Critical Period (CP) effects in human
language acquisition are observed in self-supervised speech models (S3Ms). CP
effects refer to greater difficulty in acquiring a second language (L2) with
delayed L2 exposure onset, and greater retention of their first language (L1)
with delayed L1 exposure offset. While previous work has studied these effects
using textual language models, their presence in speech models remains
underexplored despite the central role of spoken language in human language
acquisition. We train S3Ms with varying L2 training onsets and L1 training
offsets on child-directed speech and evaluate their phone discrimination
performance. We find that S3Ms do not exhibit clear evidence of either CP
effects in terms of phonological acquisition. Notably, models with delayed L2
exposure onset tend to perform better on L2 and delayed L1 exposure offset
leads to L1 forgetting.

Motivation: 现有的幻觉检测方法在句子级判断上表现差强，而自我一致性方法虽然有效但计算成本高。论文发现自我一致性方法中存在大量冗余的共享前缀令牌，这些非准确答案令牌对语义贡献很小。

Method: 提出了解码内存管道（DMP）方法，通过选择性推理和逆变温度解码来加速生成过程。该方法识别并避免重复生成共享的前缀令牌，减少计算消耗。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在保持AUROC性能的同时实现了较快的生成速度，最高可达3倍的加速效果。

Conclusion: DMP方法能够有效提高自我一致性方法的效率，减少计算成本而不影响性能，并且具有扩展到对齐和推理任务的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in both
research and real-world applications, but they still struggle with
hallucination. Existing hallucination detection methods often perform poorly on
sentence-level generation or rely heavily on domain-specific knowledge. While
self-consistency approaches help address these limitations, they incur high
computational costs due to repeated generation. In this paper, we conduct the
first study on identifying redundancy in self-consistency methods, manifested
as shared prefix tokens across generations, and observe that non-exact-answer
tokens contribute minimally to the semantic content. Based on these insights,
we propose a novel Decoding Memory Pipeline (DMP) that accelerates generation
through selective inference and annealed decoding. Being orthogonal to the
model, dataset, decoding strategy, and self-consistency baseline, our DMP
consistently improves the efficiency of multi-response generation and holds
promise for extension to alignment and reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments
show that our method achieves up to a 3x speedup without sacrificing AUROC
performance.

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过统计学上的正态性概念重新解读图灵测试，认为图灵测试测试的是普通而非特别人类智力，并需要通过多个判官的统计平均来判断。论文指出像ChatGPT这样的大语言模型彻底通过图灵测试的可能性不大，因为它们目标是优秀而非普通人类智力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新考虑图灵测试的理论基础，通过统计学上的正态性概念来理解测试的本质，并分析当代大语言模型在通过图灵测试方面的局限性。

Method: 使用统计学中的正态性概念（平均值和规范性）来分析图灵测试的设计理念，重点关注测试对象的普通性和判官组的统计平均判断。

Result: 得出两个主要结论：1）大语言模型彻底通过图灵测试的可能性不大，因为它们模拟的是优秀而非普通人类智力；2）图灵测试是否能够揭示人类认知的本质，取决于人类智力是否真的可以通过统计平均来揭示。

Conclusion: 图灵测试实质上是一种对普通智力的测试，由普通判官组的统计平均来判断。论文指出以ChatGPT为代表的现代AI模型趋向于建模优秀智力，因此彻底通过图灵测试的可能性不大，它们更像是人工智能而非人工智力。

Abstract: This paper proposes to revisit the Turing test through the concept of
normality. Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the
normal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense
of the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two
ways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather
than exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test
requires building machines that "make mistakes" and display imperfect behavior
just like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a
statistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a
single "average" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As
such, the notion of "average human interrogator" that Turing talks about in his
original paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical
abstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of
multiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of
normal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average
judgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First,
it argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the
Turing test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than
normal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it
proposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per
se. Second, it argues that the core question of whether the Turing test can
contribute anything to the understanding of human cognition is that of whether
the human mind is really reducible to the normal/average mind--a question which
largely extends beyond the Turing test itself and questions the conceptual
underpinnings of the normalist paradigm it belongs to.

the SummEval dataset and designed to support fair and transparent comparison of
evaluation metrics. Our results reveal a structural trade-off: metrics with the
highest alignment with human judgments tend to be computationally intensive and
less stable across runs. Beyond comparative analysis, this study highlights key
concerns about relying on LLMs for evaluation, stressing their randomness,
technical dependencies, and limited reproducibility. We advocate for more
robust evaluation protocols including exhaustive documentation and
methodological standardization to ensure greater reliability in automatic
summarization assessment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs作为自动审稿生成器在检测研究逻辑缺陷方面表现不佳，即使论文存在明显逻辑错误，其生成的审稿意见也没有显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs越来越多地被用作全自动审稿生成器，需要了解其在检测研究逻辑缺陷这一核心审稿技能上的具体能力和局限性，以避免对科学诚信造成风险。

Method: 开发了一个全自动的反事实评估框架，在受控条件下隔离和测试LLMs检测研究逻辑缺陷的能力，测试了多种ARG方法。

Result: 与预期相反，研究发现研究逻辑中的缺陷对LLMs生成的审稿输出没有显著影响，表明当前ARG在检测逻辑错误方面存在严重不足。

Conclusion: 基于研究发现提出了三项可操作的建议，并公开了反事实数据集和评估框架，以促进未来相关工作的发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have great potential to accelerate and support
scholarly peer review and are increasingly used as fully automatic review
generators (ARGs). However, potential biases and systematic errors may pose
significant risks to scientific integrity; understanding the specific
capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art ARGs is essential. We focus on
a core reviewing skill that underpins high-quality peer review: detecting
faulty research logic. This involves evaluating the internal consistency
between a paper's results, interpretations, and claims. We present a fully
automated counterfactual evaluation framework that isolates and tests this
skill under controlled conditions. Testing a range of ARG approaches, we find
that, contrary to expectation, flaws in research logic have no significant
effect on their output reviews. Based on our findings, we derive three
actionable recommendations for future work and release our counterfactual
dataset and evaluation framework publicly.

Conclusion: Med-RewardBench填补了医疗奖励模型评估的空白，为医疗多模态大语言模型的可靠评估提供了重要基准，揭示了当前模型在医疗专业对齐方面的不足。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold significant potential in
medical applications, including disease diagnosis and clinical decision-making.
However, these tasks require highly accurate, context-sensitive, and
professionally aligned responses, making reliable reward models and judges
critical. Despite their importance, medical reward models (MRMs) and judges
remain underexplored, with no dedicated benchmarks addressing clinical
requirements. Existing benchmarks focus on general MLLM capabilities or
evaluate models as solvers, neglecting essential evaluation dimensions like
diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance. To address this, we introduce
Med-RewardBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate MRMs and
judges in medical scenarios. Med-RewardBench features a multimodal dataset
spanning 13 organ systems and 8 clinical departments, with 1,026
expert-annotated cases. A rigorous three-step process ensures high-quality
evaluation data across six clinically critical dimensions. We evaluate 32
state-of-the-art MLLMs, including open-source, proprietary, and
medical-specific models, revealing substantial challenges in aligning outputs
with expert judgment. Additionally, we develop baseline models that demonstrate
substantial performance improvements through fine-tuning.

Motivation: 现有语义表征方法多依赖预定义的粗粗绵度维度，忽视了更细微的概念区分。需要一种能够探索粗粗绵度语义维度下深层子维度的方法。

Method: 提出解漏连续语义表征模型(DCSRM)，将大语言模型中的词向量分解为多个子向量，每个子向量编码特定的语义信息。使用此方法识别可解释的语义子维度，并通过脑激活映射模型验证其神经可行性。

Result: 成功识别了一组可解释的细粒度语义子维度。分析显示语义维度按特定原则结构，极性是驱动分解的关键因素。子维度的神经关联支持其认知和神经科学可行性。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了更细粒度可解释的概念语义子维度，为理解语言和大脑中意义组织方式提供了新的视角和方法。

Abstract: Understanding the core dimensions of conceptual semantics is fundamental to
uncovering how meaning is organized in language and the brain. Existing
approaches often rely on predefined semantic dimensions that offer only broad
representations, overlooking finer conceptual distinctions. This paper proposes
a novel framework to investigate the subdimensions underlying coarse-grained
semantic dimensions. Specifically, we introduce a Disentangled Continuous
Semantic Representation Model (DCSRM) that decomposes word embeddings from
large language models into multiple sub-embeddings, each encoding specific
semantic information. Using these sub-embeddings, we identify a set of
interpretable semantic subdimensions. To assess their neural plausibility, we
apply voxel-wise encoding models to map these subdimensions to brain
activation. Our work offers more fine-grained interpretable semantic
subdimensions of conceptual meaning. Further analyses reveal that semantic
dimensions are structured according to distinct principles, with polarity
emerging as a key factor driving their decomposition into subdimensions. The
neural correlates of the identified subdimensions support their cognitive and
neuroscientific plausibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大语言模型意识形态倾向的稳定性和深度，验证其是否具有连贯的内在政治立场而非表面回应

Method: 采用双重方法：1) 通过指令提示和激活引导测量模型的可操控性；2) 使用稀疏自编码器探测模型内部机制和政治特征

Result: 发现不同模型在意识形态深度上差异显著，一个模型的政治特征数量是相似规模模型的7.3倍。深度模型具有更抽象明确的政治特征，针对性消融能导致跨主题的连贯推理变化

Conclusion: 意识形态深度是大语言模型的可量化属性，可操控性可作为探测其潜在政治架构的重要指标

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated pronounced ideological
leanings, yet the stability and depth of these positions remain poorly
understood. Surface-level responses can often be manipulated through simple
prompt engineering, calling into question whether they reflect a coherent
underlying ideology. This paper investigates the concept of "ideological depth"
in LLMs, defined as the robustness and complexity of their internal political
representations. We employ a dual approach: first, we measure the
"steerability" of two well-known open-source LLMs using instruction prompting
and activation steering. We find that while some models can easily switch
between liberal and conservative viewpoints, others exhibit resistance or an
increased rate of refusal, suggesting a more entrenched ideological structure.
Second, we probe the internal mechanisms of these models using Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs). Preliminary analysis reveals that models with lower
steerability possess more distinct and abstract ideological features. Our
evaluations reveal that one model can contain 7.3x more political features than
another model of similar size. This allows targeted ablation of a core
political feature in an ideologically "deep" model, leading to consistent,
logical shifts in its reasoning across related topics, whereas the same
intervention in a "shallow" model results in an increase in refusal outputs.
Our findings suggest that ideological depth is a quantifiable property of LLMs
and that steerability serves as a valuable window into their latent political
architecture.

Motivation: 大语言模型计算需求高，小语言模型在创意写作方面表现不足，现有方法如SFT缺乏新颖性，RLHF成本高昂，需要更高效可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 采用RLAIF框架，探索两种AI奖励策略：1）基于多智能体拒绝采样框架训练的奖励模型；2）通过对抗训练优化的原则引导LLM-as-a-Judge直接提供奖励信号。

Result: 两种方法都显著超越基线，原则引导的LLM-as-a-Judge方法生成质量更优，训练效率更高，减少对人类标注数据的依赖，自动化评估与人工判断高度一致。

Conclusion: 原则引导的LLM-as-a-Judge方法为创意小语言模型提供了更可扩展和有效的路径，在质量和效率方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable creative writing
capabilities, yet their substantial computational demands hinder widespread
use. Enhancing Small Language Models (SLMs) offers a promising alternative, but
current methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) struggle with novelty, and
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is costly. This paper
explores two distinct AI-driven reward strategies within a Reinforcement
Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to ignite the creative writing of a
7B-parameter SLM, specifically for generating Chinese greetings. The first
strategy employs a RM trained on high-quality preference data curated by a
novel multi-agent rejection sampling framework designed for creative tasks. The
second, more novel strategy utilizes a principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge, whose
reward function is optimized via an adversarial training scheme with a
reflection mechanism, to directly provide reward signals. Comprehensive
experiments reveal that while both approaches significantly enhance creative
output over baselines, the principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge demonstrably yields
superior generation quality. Furthermore, it offers notable advantages in
training efficiency and reduced dependency on human-annotated data, presenting
a more scalable and effective path towards creative SLMs. Our automated
evaluation methods also exhibit strong alignment with human judgments. Our code

Motivation: 心理偏见使人们容易相信和传播假新闻，集成学习方法虽然有效但性能严重依赖分类器的多样性，而选择真正多样化的模型仍然是一个关键挑战

Method: 首先计算分类器间的成对多样性，应用层次聚类将其组织成不同粒度的组，然后通过HierarchySelect探索层次级别为每个级别选择一个分类器池，最后选择最具多样性的池用于集成构建

Conclusion: 该方法通过优先考虑多样性并扩展性能指标，有效改进了集成学习在假新闻检测中的表现，为自动选择多样化分类器提供了新思路

Abstract: Psychological biases, such as confirmation bias, make individuals
particularly vulnerable to believing and spreading fake news on social media,
leading to significant consequences in domains such as public health and
politics. Machine learning-based fact-checking systems have been widely studied
to mitigate this problem. Among them, ensemble methods are particularly
effective in combining multiple classifiers to improve robustness. However,
their performance heavily depends on the diversity of the constituent
classifiers-selecting genuinely diverse models remains a key challenge,
especially when models tend to learn redundant patterns. In this work, we
propose a novel automatic classifier selection approach that prioritizes
diversity, also extended by performance. The method first computes pairwise
diversity between classifiers and applies hierarchical clustering to organize
them into groups at different levels of granularity. A HierarchySelect then
explores these hierarchical levels to select one pool of classifiers per level,
each representing a distinct intra-pool diversity. The most diverse pool is
identified and selected for ensemble construction from these. The selection
process incorporates an evaluation metric reflecting each classifiers's
performance to ensure the ensemble also generalises well. We conduct
experiments with 40 heterogeneous classifiers across six datasets from
different application domains and with varying numbers of classes. Our method
is compared against the Elbow heuristic and state-of-the-art baselines. Results
show that our approach achieves the highest accuracy on two of six datasets.

Conclusion: 建立了通过数据和模型动态人机协同进化的可持续LLM训练新范式

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Large Language Models (LLM) fundamentally rely
on high-quality training data. While data selection and data synthesis are two
common strategies to improve data quality, existing approaches often face
limitations in static dataset curation that fail to adapt to evolving model
capabilities. In this paper, we introduce Middo, a self-evolving Model-informed
dynamic data optimization framework that uses model-aware data selection and
context-preserving data refinement. Unlike conventional one-off
filtering/synthesis methods, our framework establishes a closed-loop
optimization system: (1) A self-referential diagnostic module proactively
identifies suboptimal samples through tri-axial model signals - loss patterns
(complexity), embedding cluster dynamics (diversity), and self-alignment scores
(quality); (2) An adaptive optimization engine then transforms suboptimal
samples into pedagogically valuable training points while preserving semantic
integrity; (3) This optimization process continuously evolves with model
capability through dynamic learning principles. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our \method consistently enhances the quality of
seed data and boosts LLM's performance with improving accuracy by 7.15% on
average while maintaining the original dataset scale. This work establishes a
new paradigm for sustainable LLM training through dynamic human-AI co-evolution
of data and models. Our datasets, models, and code are coming soon.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly integrate into everyday
workflows, where users shape outcomes through multi-turn collaboration, a
critical question emerges: do users with different personality traits
systematically prefer certain LLMs over others? We conducted a study with 32
participants evenly distributed across four Keirsey personality types,
evaluating their interactions with GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 across four
collaborative tasks: data analysis, creative writing, information retrieval,
and writing assistance. Results revealed significant personality-driven
preferences: Rationals strongly preferred GPT-4, particularly for goal-oriented
tasks, while idealists favored Claude 3.5, especially for creative and
analytical tasks. Other personality types showed task-dependent preferences.
Sentiment analysis of qualitative feedback confirmed these patterns. Notably,
aggregate helpfulness ratings were similar across models, showing how
personality-based analysis reveals LLM differences that traditional evaluations
miss.

Abstract: We present QZhou-Embedding, a general-purpose contextual text embedding model
with exceptional text representation capabilities. Built upon the

The data transformation scheme enables the incorporation of more diverse

LLM API, incorporating techniques such as paraphrasing, augmentation, and hard
negative example generation to improve the semantic richness and sample
difficulty of the training set. Additionally, we employ a two-stage training
strategy, comprising initial retrieval-focused pretraining followed by
full-task fine-tuning, enabling the embedding model to extend its capabilities
based on robust retrieval performance. Our model achieves state-of-the-art
results on the MTEB and CMTEB benchmarks, ranking first on both leaderboards

Motivation: 监督微调(SFT)在适应大语言模型时存在'跷跷板现象'，即某些任务性能提升以其他任务性能下降为代价

Method: 1) 独立微调每个任务识别核心参数区域；2) 基于区域重叠进行任务分组；3) 核心参数直接移植，非核心参数通过SLERP融合；4) 冻结先前任务核心区域进行轻量级流水线训练

Result: 在多个公开基准测试中显著减轻任务干扰和遗忘，持续优于普通多任务和多阶段微调基线

Conclusion: CPI-FT框架有效解决了多任务微调中的性能冲突问题，为LLM的下游任务适配提供了新思路

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a pivotal approach to adapting large language
models (LLMs) for downstream tasks; however, performance often suffers from the
``seesaw phenomenon'', where indiscriminate parameter updates yield progress on
certain tasks at the expense of others. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel \emph{Core Parameter Isolation Fine-Tuning} (CPI-FT) framework.
Specifically, we first independently fine-tune the LLM on each task to identify
its core parameter regions by quantifying parameter update magnitudes. Tasks
with similar core regions are then grouped based on region overlap, forming
clusters for joint modeling. We further introduce a parameter fusion technique:
for each task, core parameters from its individually fine-tuned model are
directly transplanted into a unified backbone, while non-core parameters from
different tasks are smoothly integrated via Spherical Linear Interpolation
(SLERP), mitigating destructive interference. A lightweight, pipelined SFT
training phase using mixed-task data is subsequently employed, while freezing
core regions from prior tasks to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Extensive
experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
significantly alleviates task interference and forgetting, consistently
outperforming vanilla multi-task and multi-stage fine-tuning baselines.

Motivation: 传统语言模型在处理需要深度文本分析的推理密集型回归任务（如评分、检索等）时表现不佳，特别是在训练数据和计算资源有限的情况下。

Method: 提出MENTAT方法，结合批量反射提示优化和神经集成学习，无需大量训练数据和计算资源即可提升模型性能。

Result: MENTAT在三个真实RiR任务上相比冻结LLM和微调Transformer编码器基线方法，取得了最高65%的性能提升。

Conclusion: MENTAT为推理密集型回归任务提供了有效的解决方案，但该领域仍有很大的改进空间，需要进一步研究。

Abstract: AI researchers and practitioners increasingly apply large language models
(LLMs) to what we call reasoning-intensive regression (RiR), i.e. deducing
subtle numerical properties from text. Unlike standard language regression
tasks, e.g. for sentiment or similarity, RiR often appears instead in ad-hoc
problems like rubric-based scoring or domain-specific retrieval, where much
deeper analysis of text is required while only limited task-specific training
data and computation are available. We cast three realistic problems as RiR
tasks to establish an initial benchmark, and use that to test our hypothesis
that prompting frozen LLMs and finetuning Transformer encoders via gradient
descent will both often struggle in RiR. We then propose MENTAT, a simple and
lightweight method that combines batch-reflective prompt optimization with
neural ensemble learning. MENTAT achieves up to 65% improvement over both
baselines, though substantial room remains for future advances in RiR.

Conclusion: 正确推理链展现出显著更高的推理和答案置信度，验证了PiCSAR方法的有效性

Abstract: Best-of-n sampling improves the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) and
large reasoning models (LRMs) by generating multiple candidate solutions and
selecting the one with the highest reward. The key challenge for reasoning
tasks is designing a scoring function that can identify correct reasoning
chains without access to ground-truth answers. We propose Probabilistic
Confidence Selection And Ranking (PiCSAR): a simple, training-free method that
scores each candidate generation using the joint log-likelihood of the
reasoning and final answer. The joint log-likelihood of the reasoning and final
answer naturally decomposes into reasoning confidence and answer confidence.
PiCSAR achieves substantial gains across diverse benchmarks (+10.18 on MATH500,
+9.81 on AIME2025), outperforming baselines with at least 2x fewer samples in
16 out of 20 comparisons. Our analysis reveals that correct reasoning chains
exhibit significantly higher reasoning and answer confidence, justifying the
effectiveness of PiCSAR.

Method: 开发基于ElasticSearch的索引分析流水线，应用于1.5TB的多语言FineWeb-2语料库

Result: 实现了快速查询性能（大多数搜索在毫秒内完成，全部在2秒内），展示了实时数据集分析能力

Conclusion: 该框架为构建更安全、更负责任的AI系统提供了实用工具，能够有效处理大规模LLM训练数据集的分析需求

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely heavily on web-scale datasets like Common
Crawl, which provides over 80\% of training data for some modern models.
However, the indiscriminate nature of web crawling raises challenges in data
quality, safety, and ethics. Despite the critical importance of training data
quality, prior research on harmful content has been limited to small samples
due to computational constraints. This project presents a framework for
indexing and analyzing LLM training datasets using an ElasticSearch-based
pipeline. We apply it to SwissAI's FineWeb-2 corpus (1.5TB, four languages),
achieving fast query performance--most searches in milliseconds, all under 2
seconds. Our work demonstrates real-time dataset analysis, offering practical
tools for safer, more accountable AI systems.

Motivation: 未注册表面网格和原始3D扫描数据缺乏点对应关系且存在噪声，导致自动计算可靠变形遇到重大挑战

Method: 结合稳健的运动嵌入网络和学习的每顶点特征场，生成时空变形场来驱动网格变形

Conclusion: 该框架为处理未注册表面网格提供了一种新的、数据驱动的解决方案，能够有效地预测和传输运动

Abstract: Unregistered surface meshes, especially raw 3D scans, present significant
challenges for automatic computation of plausible deformations due to the lack
of established point-wise correspondences and the presence of noise in the
data. In this paper, we propose a new, rig-free, data-driven framework for
motion prediction and transfer on such body meshes. Our method couples a robust
motion embedding network with a learned per-vertex feature field to generate a
spatio-temporal deformation field, which drives the mesh deformation. Extensive
evaluations, including quantitative benchmarks and qualitative visuals on tasks
such as walking and running, demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of
our approach on challenging unregistered meshes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前从3D高斯拖散(3DGS)重建高质量3D网格和视觉效果仍面临挑战，虽然SuGaR等模型提供了有效渲染解决方案，但在视觉保真度和场景一致性方面仍有改进空间。

Method: 1. 有效秩正则化：避免极端各异性的"针状"形状，促进更平衡的"盘状"形式，提高表面重建稳定性
2. 神经SDF集成：通过Eikonal损失正则化SDF，提供连续全局表面先验信息，指导高斯分布与基础几何更好对齐

Result: 该模型能够从3DGS数据中生成更准确和一致的视视效果，提高了单个高斯元语的保真度和它们的集体表面行为。

Conclusion: 通过结合有效秩正则化和神经SDF指导的两种补充正则化策略，显著提升了3D高斯拖散的网格重建质量和场景一致性，为计算机图形学领域的高质量3D重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing high-quality 3D meshes and visuals from 3D Gaussian
Splatting(3DGS) still remains a central challenge in computer graphics.
Although existing models such as SuGaR offer effective solutions for rendering,
there is is still room to improve improve both visual fidelity and scene
consistency. This work builds upon SuGaR by introducing two complementary
regularization strategies that address common limitations in both the shape of
individual Gaussians and the coherence of the overall surface. The first
strategy introduces an effective rank regularization, motivated by recent
studies on Gaussian primitive structures. This regularization discourages
extreme anisotropy-specifically, "needle-like" shapes-by favoring more
balanced, "disk-like" forms that are better suited for stable surface
reconstruction. The second strategy integrates a neural Signed Distance
Function (SDF) into the optimization process. The SDF is regularized with an
Eikonal loss to maintain proper distance properties and provides a continuous
global surface prior, guiding Gaussians toward better alignment with the
underlying geometry. These two regularizations aim to improve both the fidelity
of individual Gaussian primitives and their collective surface behavior. The
final model can make more accurate and coherent visuals from 3DGS data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型架构中的归纳偏置如何影响其在教学对话中的认知行为，特别是如何通过架构设计来促进自适应、结构化的苏格拉底式辅导推理。

Method: 引入符号支架机制和短期记忆模式，通过五个系统变体的对照消融实验，使用专家设计的评分标准评估模型输出，并采用基于LLM的评估框架进行可扩展的系统比较。

Result: 完整系统在所有评估维度上一致优于基线变体，移除记忆或符号结构会降低关键认知行为（抽象、自适应探测和概念连续性）的表现。

Conclusion: 架构支架能够可靠地塑造大语言模型中涌现的教学策略，支持处理层面的解释，表明架构设计对模型认知行为具有重要影响。

Abstract: We study how architectural inductive biases influence the cognitive behavior
of large language models (LLMs) in instructional dialogue. We introduce a
symbolic scaffolding mechanism paired with a short-term memory schema designed
to promote adaptive, structured reasoning in Socratic tutoring. Using
controlled ablation across five system variants, we evaluate model outputs via
expert-designed rubrics covering scaffolding, responsiveness, symbolic
reasoning, and conversational memory. We present preliminary results using an
LLM-based evaluation framework aligned to a cognitively grounded rubric. This
enables scalable, systematic comparisons across architectural variants in
early-stage experimentation. The preliminary results show that our full system
consistently outperforms baseline variants. Analysis reveals that removing
memory or symbolic structure degrades key cognitive behaviors, including
abstraction, adaptive probing, and conceptual continuity. These findings
support a processing-level account in which architectural scaffolds can
reliably shape emergent instructional strategies in LLMs.

Abstract: In the past two years, large language model (LLM)-based chatbots, such as
ChatGPT, have revolutionized various domains by enabling diverse task
completion and question-answering capabilities. However, their application in
scientific research remains constrained by challenges such as hallucinations,
limited domain-specific knowledge, and lack of explainability or traceability
for the response. Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has
emerged as a promising approach to improving chatbot reliability by integrating
domain-specific contextual information before response generation, addressing
some limitations of standard LLMs. Despite its potential, there are only
limited studies that evaluate GraphRAG on specific domains that require
intensive knowledge, like Alzheimer's disease or other biomedical domains. In
this paper, we assess the quality and traceability of two popular GraphRAG
systems. We compile a database of 50 papers and 70 expert questions related to
Alzheimer's disease, construct a GraphRAG knowledge base, and employ GPT-4o as
the LLM for answering queries. We then compare the quality of responses
generated by GraphRAG with those from a standard GPT-4o model. Additionally, we
discuss and evaluate the traceability of several Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) and GraphRAG systems. Finally, we provide an easy-to-use interface with a
pre-built Alzheimer's disease database for researchers to test the performance
of both standard RAG and GraphRAG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 1) 使用LLM通过包含概念描述和本体上下文的工程提示提供图检索增强的初始化；2) 在双轴进行知识传播：本体内部垂直传播和本体间水平传播；3) 作为插件编码器与现有EHR预测模型兼容。

Result: 在两个公共数据集上的广泛实验验证了LINKO优于最先进基线方法的性能，在数据有限和罕见疾病预测场景中表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LINKO框架通过整合多个本体系统和双轴知识传播，有效提升了医学概念表示学习的效果，特别是在数据稀缺和罕见病例场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Medical ontology graphs map external knowledge to medical codes in electronic
health records via structured relationships. By leveraging domain-approved
connections (e.g., parent-child), predictive models can generate richer medical
concept representations by incorporating contextual information from related
concepts. However, existing literature primarily focuses on incorporating
domain knowledge from a single ontology system, or from multiple ontology
systems (e.g., diseases, drugs, and procedures) in isolation, without
integrating them into a unified learning structure. Consequently, concept
representation learning often remains limited to intra-ontology relationships,
overlooking cross-ontology connections. In this paper, we propose LINKO, a
large language model (LLM)-augmented integrative ontology learning framework
that leverages multiple ontology graphs simultaneously by enabling dual-axis
knowledge propagation both within and across heterogeneous ontology systems to
enhance medical concept representation learning. Specifically, LINKO first
employs LLMs to provide a graph-retrieval-augmented initialization for ontology
concept embedding, through an engineered prompt that includes concept
descriptions, and is further augmented with ontology context. Second, our
method jointly learns the medical concepts in diverse ontology graphs by
performing knowledge propagation in two axes: (1) intra-ontology vertical
propagation across hierarchical ontology levels and (2) inter-ontology
horizontal propagation within every level in parallel. Last, through extensive
experiments on two public datasets, we validate the superior performance of
LINKO over state-of-the-art baselines. As a plug-in encoder compatible with
existing EHR predictive models, LINKO further demonstrates enhanced robustness
in scenarios involving limited data availability and rare disease prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在复杂推理任务表现出色但在简单交互任务中表现不佳的问题，弥合陈述性知识和程序性知识之间的差距

Method: 将基于强化学习的决策重新构建为语言建模任务，通过语言引导的策略生成和基于环境反馈的在线强化学习进行迭代优化

Result: TiG成功弥合了陈述性和程序性知识之间的差距，以显著更低的数据和计算需求实现了与传统RL方法相竞争的性能，并提供逐步自然语言解释

Conclusion: TiG框架有效结合了LLMs的世界知识和推理能力与RL的交互学习优势，为复杂交互任务提供了透明和可解释的决策方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks such as
mathematics and coding, yet they frequently struggle with simple interactive
tasks that young children perform effortlessly. This discrepancy highlights a
critical gap between declarative knowledge (knowing about something) and
procedural knowledge (knowing how to do something). Although traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) agents can acquire procedural knowledge through
environmental interaction, they often operate as black boxes and require
substantial training data. In contrast, LLMs possess extensive world knowledge
and reasoning capabilities, but are unable to effectively convert this static
knowledge into dynamic decision-making in interactive settings. To address this
challenge, we propose Think in Games (TiG), a novel framework that empowers
LLMs to develop procedural understanding through direct interaction with game
environments, while retaining their inherent reasoning and explanatory
abilities. Specifically, TiG reformulates RL-based decision-making as a
language modeling task: LLMs generate language-guided policies, which are
refined iteratively through online reinforcement learning based on
environmental feedback. Our experimental results show that TiG successfully
bridges the gap between declarative and procedural knowledge, achieving
competitive performance with dramatically lower data and computational demands
compared to conventional RL methods. Moreover, TiG provides step-by-step
natural language explanations for its decisions, greatly improving transparency
and interpretability in complex interactive tasks.

TL;DR: AHELM是一个新的音频-语言模型基准测试，整合了多个数据集来全面评估10个重要方面，包括感知、推理、公平性等，并标准化了评估方法。测试了14个模型，发现Gemini 2.5 Pro在多个方面表现最佳但存在公平性问题，基线系统表现也较好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前音频-语言模型评估缺乏标准化基准，大多数基准只测试一两个能力，且忽略了公平性、安全性等重要方面，不同评估之间难以进行模型比较。

Method: 开发AHELM基准，整合各种数据集（包括新的合成数据集PARADE和CoRe-Bench），标准化提示词、推理参数和评估指标，测试14个开放权重和闭源API模型以及3个基线系统。

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro在10个方面中的5个排名第一，但在ASR任务中表现出群体不公平性（p=0.01）。基线系统表现良好，其中一个仅具备语音转文本能力的系统总体排名第五。

Conclusion: AHELM提供了一个全面的音频-语言模型评估框架，揭示了当前模型的优势和局限性，特别是公平性问题，并展示了简单基线系统的竞争力。该基准将持续更新，促进该领域的发展。

Abstract: Evaluations of audio-language models (ALMs) -- multimodal models that take
interleaved audio and text as input and output text -- are hindered by the lack
of standardized benchmarks; most benchmarks measure only one or two
capabilities and omit evaluative aspects such as fairness or safety.
Furthermore, comparison across models is difficult as separate evaluations test
a limited number of models and use different prompting methods and inference
parameters. To address these shortfalls, we introduce AHELM, a benchmark that
aggregates various datasets -- including 2 new synthetic audio-text datasets
called PARADE, which evaluates the ALMs on avoiding stereotypes, and
CoRe-Bench, which measures reasoning over conversational audio through
inferential multi-turn question answering -- to holistically measure the
performance of ALMs across 10 aspects we have identified as important to the
development and usage of ALMs: audio perception, knowledge, reasoning, emotion
detection, bias, fairness, multilinguality, robustness, toxicity, and safety.
We also standardize the prompts, inference parameters, and evaluation metrics
to ensure equitable comparisons across models. We test 14 open-weight and
closed-API ALMs from 3 developers and 3 additional simple baseline systems each
consisting of an automatic speech recognizer and a language model. Our results
show that while Gemini 2.5 Pro ranks top in 5 out of 10 aspects, it exhibits
group unfairness ($p=0.01$) on ASR tasks whereas most of the other models do
not. We also find that the baseline systems perform reasonably well on AHELM,
with one ranking 5th overall despite having only speech-to-text capabilities.
For transparency, all raw prompts, model generations, and outputs are available
on our website at https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/audio/v1.0.0. AHELM is
intended to be a living benchmark and new datasets and models will be added
over time.

Motivation: 现有的遗忘操作主要基于经典逻辑，如变量消除和AGM信念修正理论中的收缩操作，但缺乏在更丰富语义结构的认知状态中的系统研究。本文旨在从认知角度探索遗忘操作，建立与命题逻辑的清晰联系。

Method: 采用认知视角，在具有丰富语义结构但保持与命题逻辑清晰联系的认知状态中研究遗忘操作。提出了五种通用类型的认知遗忘，并在Spohn排序函数中实例化了七种具体遗忘操作。借鉴逻辑编程和AGM理论中的遗忘公理，提出了丰富的公理体系来评估遗忘操作。

Conclusion: 本文通过将遗忘操作提升到认知层面，为知识管理中的遗忘操作提供了更深入的理论基础，建立了逻辑编程、AGM理论和认知状态中遗忘操作之间的联系框架。

Abstract: Forgetting as a knowledge management operation deliberately ignores parts of
the knowledge and beliefs of an agent, for various reasons. Forgetting has many
facets, one may want to forget parts of the syntax, a proposition, or a
conditional. In the literature, two main operators suitable for performing
forgetting have been proposed and investigated in depth: First, variable
elimination is a syntactical method that blends out certain atomic variables to
focus on the rest of the language. It has been mainly used in the area of logic
programming and answer set programming. Second, contraction in AGM belief
revision theory effectively removes propositions from belief sets under logical
deduction. Both operations rely mainly on classical logics. In this article, we
take an epistemic perspective and study forgetting operations in epistemic
states with richer semantic structures, but with clear links to propositional
logic. This allows us to investigate what forgetting in the epistemic
background means, thereby lifting well-known and novel forgetting operations to
the epistemic level. We present five general types of epistemic forgetting and
instantiate them with seven concrete forgetting operations for Spohn's ranking
functions. We take inspiration from postulates of forgetting both from logic
programming and AGM theory to propose a rich landscape of axioms for evaluating
forgetting operations. Finally, we evaluate all concrete forgetting operations
according to all postulates, leading to a novel comprehensive overview
highlighting differences and commonalities among the forgetting operators.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种从状态-动作轨迹中学习STRIPS+模型的新方法SYNTH，用于解决滑动拼图等领域的模型学习问题，其中状态和动作信息都不完整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的模型学习方法大多假设动作是完整的STRIPS动作或所有谓词都可观察，但在实际应用中，状态可能缺少某些谓词（如空白位置），动作也不包含所有需要的参数。需要一种更现实的学习方法。

Method: 引入STRIPS+变体，允许动作参数在前提条件中隐式存在并支持有限形式的存在量化。SYNTH算法为每个动作构建分层序列的前提条件表达式（查询），用于识别状态中的唯一对象并接地隐式参数。

Result: SYNTH算法被证明具有正确性和完备性，并在从现有STRIPS领域衍生的STRIPS+模型生成的状态-动作轨迹上测试了可扩展性。

Conclusion: SYNTH算法能够有效学习STRIPS+模型，解决了在状态和动作信息不完整情况下的模型学习问题，为更现实的学习场景提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Consider the problem of learning a lifted STRIPS model of the sliding-tile
puzzle from random state-action traces where the states represent the location
of the tiles only, and the actions are the labels up, down, left, and right,
with no arguments. Two challenges are involved in this problem. First, the
states are not full STRIPS states, as some predicates are missing, like the
atoms representing the position of the ``blank''. Second, the actions are not
full STRIPS either, as they do not reveal all the objects involved in the
actions effects and preconditions. Previous approaches have addressed different
versions of this model learning problem, but most assume that actions in the
traces are full STRIPS actions or that the domain predicates are all
observable. The new setting considered in this work is more ``realistic'', as
the atoms observed convey the state of the world but not full STRIPS states,
and the actions reveal the arguments needed for selecting the action but not
the ones needed for modeling it in STRIPS. For formulating and addressing the
learning problem, we introduce a variant of STRIPS, which we call STRIPS+,
where certain STRIPS action arguments can be left implicit in preconditions
which can also involve a limited form of existential quantification. The
learning problem becomes the problem of learning STRIPS+ models from STRIPS+
state-action traces. For this, the proposed learning algorithm, called SYNTH,
constructs a stratified sequence (conjunction) of precondition expressions or
``queries'' for each action, that denote unique objects in the state and ground
the implicit action arguments in STRIPS+. The correctness and completeness of
SYNTH is established, and its scalability is tested on state-action traces
obtained from STRIPS+ models derived from existing STRIPS domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态浏览基准测试往往可以通过浅层、固定的工作流程解决，无法真正测试多模态理解能力。需要创建一个更真实的基准来评估模型在复杂多模态任务中的表现。

Method: 采用时空外推法构建问题，要求从空间线索（微文本、局部外观、布局、标识）和时间痕迹（广播叠加、季节上下文）推断出图像外的事实。提供模型无关的代理框架和浏览工具进行评估。

Conclusion: 该基准测试揭示了现有模型在来源验证、基于部件的推理和长时程规划方面的显著不足，为多模态语言模型的进一步发展提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Large multimodal language models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed as web

verification, and long-horizon tool use. We introduce MMSearch-Plus, a
benchmark of 311 tasks that highly demand multimodal understanding while
preserving the difficulty profile of strong text-only browsing suites. Each
item is constructed to contain multiple weak, localized visual signals that
must be extracted, propagated through iterative text-image search, and
cross-validated under retrieval noise before answering. Our curation procedure,
Spatial-Temporal Extrapolation, seeds questions whose answers require
extrapolating from spatial cues (micro-text, part-level appearance, layouts,
signage) and temporal traces (broadcast overlays, seasonal context) to
out-of-image facts such as events, dates, and venues. We provide a
model-agnostic agent framework with browsing tools and evaluate a range of
closed and open MLLMs. The strongest agent (o3) attains 15.1% without search
and 36.0% accuracy with rollout under our framework, while a strong open-source
model (Qwen-2.5-VL-72B-Instruct) achieves 0.0% without search and 6.9% after 20
rounds of search. Beyond answer accuracy, we assess bounding-box production and
cropped-image search, and conduct an error analysis that surfaces failures in
source verification, part-based reasoning, and long-horizon planning.

### [107] [Modeling Wise Decision Making: A Z-Number Fuzzy Framework Inspired by Phronesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21517)
*Sweta Kaman,Ankita Sharma,Romi Banerjee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于Z数的模糊推理系统，用于计算智慧评分，同时考虑智慧的多维性和不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前智慧测量依赖自我报告，缺乏对谦虚和不确定性的考量。需要一种计算框架来改善心理学测量，并支持人道主义AI系统的发展。

Method: 使用Z数模糊推理系统，每个决策都包含智慧分数（限制）和信心分数（确定性）。通过文化中立图片道德困境任务收集语言响应，映射到5个智慧组成要素，使用21条规则和高斯核密度估计进行结合。

Result: 在概念验证研究中，系统产生的双属性智慧表征与现有量表显示中等但显著相关，与无关特质的关联微小，支持了聚合效度和区别效度。

Conclusion: 该研究将智慧形式化为一种多维度、考虑不确定性的构念，通过Z数进行操作化。除了推动心理学测量外，还为AI系统提供了可解释、信心敏感的推理能力，在严格计算与类人判断之间找到安全的中间地带。

Abstract: Background: Wisdom is a superordinate construct that embraces perspective
taking, reflectiveness, prosocial orientation, reflective empathetic action,
and intellectual humility. Unlike conventional models of reasoning that are
rigidly bound by binary thinking, wisdom unfolds in shades of ambiguity,
requiring both graded evaluation and self-reflective humility. Current measures
depend on self-reports and seldom reflect the humility and uncertainty inherent
in wise reasoning. A computational framework that takes into account both
multidimensionality and confidence has the potential to improve psychological
science and allow humane AI. Method: We present a fuzzy inference system with Z
numbers, each of the decisions being expressed in terms of a wisdom score
(restriction) and confidence score (certainty). As part of this study,
participants (N = 100) were exposed to culturally neutral pictorial moral
dilemma tasks to which they generated think-aloud linguistic responses, which
were mapped into five theoretically based components of wisdom. The scores of
each individual component were combined using a base of 21 rules, with
membership functions tuned via Gaussian kernel density estimation. Results: In
a proof of concept study, the system produced dual attribute wisdom
representations that correlated modestly but significantly with established
scales while showing negligible relations with unrelated traits, supporting
convergent and divergent validity. Contribution: The contribution is to
formalize wisdom as a multidimensional, uncertainty-conscious construct,
operationalized in the form of Z-numbers. In addition to progressing
measurement in psychology, it calculates how fuzzy Z numbers can provide AI
systems with interpretable, confidence-sensitive reasoning that affords a safe,
middle ground between rigorous computation and human-like judgment.

*Nicola Gigante,Francesco Leofante,Andrea Micheli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于反事实场景的新型解释范式，用于自动规划领域，通过最小化修改规划问题来生成满足特定属性要求的计划解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的反事实解释仅关注对现有计划的最小修改，无法捕捉问题的高层特性。为了解决这一局限性，需要一种能够识别规划问题本身最小修改的方法，以产生满足期望属性的计划。

Method: 提出了两种基于显式量化必须满足特定属性计划的定性反事实场景实例化方法，并分析了在不同类型修改允许下的计算复杂度。

Result: 研究表明生成反事实场景的计算成本通常与计算规划问题的计划相当，证明了该方法的实际可行性。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建实用算法提供了基础，能够有效解释规划问题的高层特性，具有重要的理论和实践价值。

Abstract: Counterfactual Explanations (CEs) are a powerful technique used to explain
Machine Learning models by showing how the input to a model should be minimally
changed for the model to produce a different output. Similar proposals have
been made in the context of Automated Planning, where CEs have been
characterised in terms of minimal modifications to an existing plan that would
result in the satisfaction of a different goal. While such explanations may
help diagnose faults and reason about the characteristics of a plan, they fail
to capture higher-level properties of the problem being solved. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel explanation paradigm that is based on
counterfactual scenarios. In particular, given a planning problem $P$ and an
\ltlf formula $\psi$ defining desired properties of a plan, counterfactual
scenarios identify minimal modifications to $P$ such that it admits plans that
comply with $\psi$. In this paper, we present two qualitative instantiations of
counterfactual scenarios based on an explicit quantification over plans that
must satisfy $\psi$. We then characterise the computational complexity of
generating such counterfactual scenarios when different types of changes are
allowed on $P$. We show that producing counterfactual scenarios is often only
as expensive as computing a plan for $P$, thus demonstrating the practical
viability of our proposal and ultimately providing a framework to construct
practical algorithms in this area.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过程挖掘在健康领域应用面临技术复杂性、缺乏标准化方法和训练资源有限等障碍，需要一种更易于访问的解决方案。

Method: 开发HealthProcessAI框架，包装Python(PM4PY)和R(bupaR)库，集成多个LLM模型进行自动化过程地图解释和报告生成，使用肺烯毛球菌感染数据验证框架功能。

Result: 框架成功处理四个测试场景，Claude Sonnet-4和Gemini 2.5-Pro获得最高一致性分数(3.79/4.0和3.65/4.0)，显示了潜在的可行动洞察能力。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合结构化分析和AI驱动解释，为将复杂的过程挖掘结果转换为健康领域可行动洞察提供了新的方法论进步。

Abstract: Process mining has emerged as a powerful analytical technique for
understanding complex healthcare workflows. However, its application faces
significant barriers, including technical complexity, a lack of standardized
approaches, and limited access to practical training resources. We introduce
HealthProcessAI, a GenAI framework designed to simplify process mining
applications in healthcare and epidemiology by providing a comprehensive
wrapper around existing Python (PM4PY) and R (bupaR) libraries. To address
unfamiliarity and improve accessibility, the framework integrates multiple
Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated process map interpretation and
report generation, helping translate technical analyses into outputs that
diverse users can readily understand. We validated the framework using sepsis
progression data as a proof-of-concept example and compared the outputs of five
state-of-the-art LLM models through the OpenRouter platform. To test its
functionality, the framework successfully processed sepsis data across four
proof-of-concept scenarios, demonstrating robust technical performance and its
capability to generate reports through automated LLM analysis. LLM evaluation
using five independent LLMs as automated evaluators revealed distinct model
strengths: Claude Sonnet-4 and Gemini 2.5-Pro achieved the highest consistency
scores (3.79/4.0 and 3.65/4.0) when evaluated by automated LLM assessors. By
integrating multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated interpretation
and report generation, the framework addresses widespread unfamiliarity with
process mining outputs, making them more accessible to clinicians, data
scientists, and researchers. This structured analytics and AI-driven
interpretation combination represents a novel methodological advance in
translating complex process mining results into potentially actionable insights
for healthcare applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统重要野标提取算法在某些规划问题中效果不佳，需要一种能够泛化到整个域范的重要野标发现方法，以描述规划问题中的中间目标。

Method: 使用独立于具体问题对象的状态函数来学习泛化重要野标，构建有向泛化重要野标图，包括支持循环重复子计划的循环可能性，并将该图用于解决新问题实例的启发式算法中。

Result: 实验结果显示，从少量小规模实例学习到的泛化重要野标图在同一域范的更大实例中也有效。如果识别出表示重复的循环，启发式算法的性能比基准方法有显著提升。

Conclusion: 泛化重要野标能够从少量计划中发现可解释且有用的域信息，为自动规划器提供了价值。

Abstract: We propose a new framework for discovering landmarks that automatically
generalize across a domain. These generalized landmarks are learned from a set
of solved instances and describe intermediate goals for planning problems where
traditional landmark extraction algorithms fall short. Our generalized
landmarks extend beyond the predicates of a domain by using state functions
that are independent of the objects of a specific problem and apply to all
similar objects, thus capturing repetition. Based on these functions, we
construct a directed generalized landmark graph that defines the landmark
progression, including loop possibilities for repetitive subplans. We show how
to use this graph in a heuristic to solve new problem instances of the same
domain. Our results show that the generalized landmark graphs learned from a
few small instances are also effective for larger instances in the same domain.
If a loop that indicates repetition is identified, we see a significant
improvement in heuristic performance over the baseline. Generalized landmarks
capture domain information that is interpretable and useful to an automated
planner. This information can be discovered from a small set of plans for the
same domain.

Motivation: 许多高级多代理规划问题（如多机器人导航和路径规划）可以通过确定性动作和观测来有效模型化，但现有的Dec-POMDP求解器无法高效处理大规模问题。

Method: 首先定义了确定性分布式POMDPs(Det-Dec-POMDPs)子类，具有确定性过渡和观测特征。然后提出IDPP方法，基于经典联合均衡策略搜索框架，专门优化处理大规模Det-Dec-POMDPs。

Result: 该方法能够有效处理当前Dec-POMDP求解器无法高效解决的大规模确定性分布式POMDP问题。

Conclusion: IDPP方法为大规模多机器人导航等确定性多代理规划问题提供了一种实用的解决方案，充实了分布式POMDP理论在实际应用中的能力。

Abstract: Many high-level multi-agent planning problems, including multi-robot
navigation and path planning, can be effectively modeled using deterministic
actions and observations.
  In this work, we focus on such domains and introduce the class of
Deterministic Decentralized POMDPs (Det-Dec-POMDPs). This is a subclass of
Dec-POMDPs characterized by deterministic transitions and observations
conditioned on the state and joint actions.
  We then propose a practical solver called Iterative Deterministic POMDP
Planning (IDPP). This method builds on the classic Joint Equilibrium Search for
Policies framework and is specifically optimized to handle large-scale
Det-Dec-POMDPs that current Dec-POMDP solvers are unable to address
efficiently.

Abstract: This paper presents an integrated framework that combines traditional network
optimization models with large language models (LLMs) to deliver interactive,
explainable, and role-aware decision support for supply chain planning. The
proposed system bridges the gap between complex operations research outputs and
business stakeholder understanding by generating natural language summaries,
contextual visualizations, and tailored key performance indicators (KPIs). The
core optimization model addresses tactical inventory redistribution across a
network of distribution centers for multi-period and multi-item, using a
mixed-integer formulation. The technical architecture incorporates AI agents,
RESTful APIs, and a dynamic user interface to support real-time interaction,
configuration updates, and simulation-based insights. A case study demonstrates
how the system improves planning outcomes by preventing stockouts, reducing
costs, and maintaining service levels. Future extensions include integrating
private LLMs, transfer learning, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian neural
networks to enhance explainability, adaptability, and real-time
decision-making.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了A-MHA*算法，将多启发式A*（MHA*）扩展为随时算法，能够快速找到可行次优解并持续改进，直到时间耗尽。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MHA*虽然利用多个不可采纳启发式函数来加速搜索，但它是单次算法，无法随时间改进解质量，且需要仔细设置膨胀因子。

Method: 受ARA*算法启发，将ARA*的概念精确适配到MHA*框架中，开发了随时版本A-MHA*，保持原有的次优性和完备性保证。

Result: 在3D路径规划和滑块拼图领域的实验表明，A-MHA*相比MHA*和其他随时算法具有更好的性能。

Conclusion: A-MHA*成功将MHA*扩展为随时算法，能够在保持理论保证的同时持续改进解质量，为实际应用提供了更灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Designing good heuristic functions for graph search requires adequate domain
knowledge. It is often easy to design heuristics that perform well and
correlate with the underlying true cost-to-go values in certain parts of the
search space but these may not be admissible throughout the domain thereby
affecting the optimality guarantees of the search. Bounded suboptimal search
using several such partially good but inadmissible heuristics was developed in
Multi-Heuristic A* (MHA*). Although MHA* leverages multiple inadmissible
heuristics to potentially generate a faster suboptimal solution, the original
version does not improve the solution over time. It is a one shot algorithm
that requires careful setting of inflation factors to obtain a desired one time
solution. In this work, we tackle this issue by extending MHA* to an anytime
version that finds a feasible suboptimal solution quickly and continually
improves it until time runs out. Our work is inspired from the Anytime
Repairing A* (ARA*) algorithm. We prove that our precise adaptation of ARA*
concepts in the MHA* framework preserves the original suboptimal and
completeness guarantees and enhances MHA* to perform in an anytime fashion.
Furthermore, we report the performance of A-MHA* in 3-D path planning domain
and sliding tiles puzzle and compare against MHA* and other anytime algorithms.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MEDLEY是一个医疗AI框架，通过保留多个AI模型的多样性输出而非强制达成共识，将模型偏见视为潜在优势，幻觉视为待验证假设，增强医疗推理透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为AI偏见是需要消除的缺陷，但人类推理本身就包含教育、文化和经验塑造的偏见，这些偏见可能不可避免且有价值。

Method: 开发MEDLEY概念框架，协调30多个大型语言模型，保留共识和少数观点，将模型特定偏见记录为优势，幻觉作为临床验证的临时假设。

Result: 概念验证演示器在合成病例中成功保留了共识和少数观点，使诊断不确定性和潜在偏见对临床监督透明可见。

Conclusion: MEDLEY通过重新定义AI不完美性为资源，为开发可信医疗AI系统开辟了新的监管、伦理和创新途径，在临床监督下增强医疗推理。

Abstract: Bias in medical artificial intelligence is conventionally viewed as a defect
requiring elimination. However, human reasoning inherently incorporates biases
shaped by education, culture, and experience, suggesting their presence may be
inevitable and potentially valuable. We propose MEDLEY (Medical Ensemble
Diagnostic system with Leveraged diversitY), a conceptual framework that
orchestrates multiple AI models while preserving their diverse outputs rather
than collapsing them into a consensus. Unlike traditional approaches that
suppress disagreement, MEDLEY documents model-specific biases as potential
strengths and treats hallucinations as provisional hypotheses for clinician
verification. A proof-of-concept demonstrator was developed using over 30 large
language models, creating a minimum viable product that preserved both
consensus and minority views in synthetic cases, making diagnostic uncertainty
and latent biases transparent for clinical oversight. While not yet a validated
clinical tool, the demonstration illustrates how structured diversity can
enhance medical reasoning under clinician supervision. By reframing AI
imperfection as a resource, MEDLEY offers a paradigm shift that opens new
regulatory, ethical, and innovation pathways for developing trustworthy medical
AI systems.

Motivation: 现有方法大多忽视科学文档的层次结构和文本视觉元素的语义整合，需要一种能够直接解决这两个挑战的自动化海报生成方法。

Method: 引入Poster Tree分层中间表示来编码文档结构和视觉文本关系，采用多智能体协作策略，内容摘要和布局规划智能体迭代协调并提供相互反馈。

Result: 在多学术领域的广泛实验中，该方法在定性和定量评估中均优于现有基线，生成的海报质量最接近专家设计水平，具有更好的信息保存、结构清晰度和用户偏好。

Conclusion: PosterForest框架通过分层表示和多智能体协作，成功实现了科学海报的自动化生成，在逻辑一致性、内容保真度和视觉连贯性方面表现出色。

Abstract: We present a novel training-free framework, \textit{PosterForest}, for
automated scientific poster generation. Unlike prior approaches, which largely
neglect the hierarchical structure of scientific documents and the semantic
integration of textual and visual elements, our method addresses both
challenges directly. We introduce the \textit{Poster Tree}, a hierarchical
intermediate representation that jointly encodes document structure and
visual-textual relationships at multiple levels. Our framework employs a
multi-agent collaboration strategy, where agents specializing in content
summarization and layout planning iteratively coordinate and provide mutual
feedback. This approach enables the joint optimization of logical consistency,
content fidelity, and visual coherence. Extensive experiments on multiple
academic domains show that our method outperforms existing baselines in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The resulting posters achieve quality
closest to expert-designed ground truth and deliver superior information
preservation, structural clarity, and user preference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统变分量子算法在旅行商问题中需要大量量子比特和重复结构搜索的问题，旨在开发一种适合NISQ硬件的快速解决方案。

Method: 结合紧凑排列编码减少量子比特需求，采用优化-冻结-重用策略：首先通过模拟退火优化训练实例的电路拓扑，然后冻结结构并在新实例上仅重新优化电路参数。

Result: 在4-7个城市的随机对称实例上，4城市达到100%最优路径采样概率，5城市90%，6城市80%，7城市降至约20%，显示出良好的泛化能力但可扩展性有限。

Conclusion: 该方法在中等问题规模上表现出强大的泛化能力，冻结Ansatz能显著减少求解时间而不降低解质量，但需要解决可扩展性限制问题。

Abstract: In this paper we present a variational algorithm for the Traveling Salesman
Problem (TSP) that combines (i) a compact encoding of permutations, which
reduces the qubit requirement too, (ii) an optimize-freeze-reuse strategy:
where the circuit topology (``Ansatz'') is first optimized on a training
instance by Simulated Annealing (SA), then ``frozen'' and re-used on novel
instances, limited to a rapid re-optimization of only the circuit parameters.
This pipeline eliminates costly structural research in testing, making the
procedure immediately implementable on NISQ hardware.
  On a set of $40$ randomly generated symmetric instances that span $4 - 7$
cities, the resulting Ansatz achieves an average optimal trip sampling
probability of $100\%$ for 4 city cases, $90\%$ for 5 city cases and $80\%$ for
6 city cases. With 7 cities the success rate drops markedly to an average of
$\sim 20\%$, revealing the onset of scalability limitations of the proposed
method.
  The results show robust generalization ability for moderate problem sizes and
indicate how freezing the Ansatz can dramatically reduce time-to-solution
without degrading solution quality. The paper also discusses scalability
limitations, the impact of ``warm-start'' initialization of parameters, and
prospects for extension to more complex problems, such as Vehicle Routing and
Job-Shop Scheduling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列分析中理解变量间因果关系是一个核心挑战，特别是当完整因果结构未知时。专家通常能提供高层摘要因果图来捕捉主要因果关系，但如何利用这种知识来指导微观层面的因果发现需要理论支持。

Method: 提出了在给定摘要因果图和假设存在忠实且因果充分的分布条件下，保证微观层面边可定向性的理论条件。这些条件即使在宏观层面存在循环或双向边的情况下也适用。

Result: 建立了微观层面边定向的理论保证条件，证明了在特定条件下可以确定微观因果边的方向，即使宏观层面存在复杂的因果结构。

Conclusion: 研究结果为利用摘要因果图指导复杂时序系统中的因果发现提供了实用指导，强调了整合专家知识来改进从观测时间序列数据中进行因果推断的价值。

Abstract: Understanding causal relations between temporal variables is a central
challenge in time series analysis, particularly when the full causal structure
is unknown. Even when the full causal structure cannot be fully specified,
experts often succeed in providing a high-level abstraction of the causal
graph, known as a summary causal graph, which captures the main causal
relations between different time series while abstracting away micro-level
details. In this work, we present conditions that guarantee the orientability
of micro-level edges between temporal variables given the background knowledge
encoded in a summary causal graph and assuming having access to a faithful and
causally sufficient distribution with respect to the true unknown graph. Our
results provide theoretical guarantees for edge orientation at the micro-level,
even in the presence of cycles or bidirected edges at the macro-level. These
findings offer practical guidance for leveraging SCGs to inform causal
discovery in complex temporal systems and highlight the value of incorporating
expert knowledge to improve causal inference from observational time series
data.

TL;DR: 提出Tree-guided Diffusion Planner (TDP)，一种零样本测试时规划框架，通过树搜索和双层采样过程解决扩散模型规划中的梯度引导局限性，在多个任务上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准梯度引导在非凸、不可微分和多奖励结构的真实场景中效果有限，现有监督规划方法需要任务特定训练，限制了测试时灵活性和零样本泛化能力。

Method: 将测试时规划构建为树搜索问题，采用双层采样：1) 通过无训练粒子引导生成多样化父轨迹进行探索；2) 通过任务目标引导的快速条件去噪精炼子轨迹。

Result: 在迷宫金币收集、机械臂方块操作和AntMaze多目标探索三个任务上，TDP始终优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: TDP通过探索多样化轨迹区域并利用梯度信息，仅使用预训练模型和测试时奖励信号，有效解决了梯度引导的局限性，实现了优异的零样本规划性能。

Abstract: Planning with pretrained diffusion models has emerged as a promising approach
for solving test-time guided control problems. However, standard gradient
guidance typically performs optimally under convex and differentiable reward
landscapes, showing substantially reduced effectiveness in real-world scenarios
involving non-convex objectives, non-differentiable constraints, and
multi-reward structures. Furthermore, recent supervised planning approaches
require task-specific training or value estimators, which limits test-time
flexibility and zero-shot generalization. We propose a Tree-guided Diffusion
Planner (TDP), a zero-shot test-time planning framework that balances
exploration and exploitation through structured trajectory generation. We frame
test-time planning as a tree search problem using a bi-level sampling process:
(1) diverse parent trajectories are produced via training-free particle
guidance to encourage broad exploration, and (2) sub-trajectories are refined
through fast conditional denoising guided by task objectives. TDP addresses the
limitations of gradient guidance by exploring diverse trajectory regions and
harnessing gradient information across this expanded solution space using only
pretrained models and test-time reward signals. We evaluate TDP on three
diverse tasks: maze gold-picking, robot arm block manipulation, and AntMaze
multi-goal exploration. TDP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on all tasks. The project page can be found at:

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种协作式多代理系统(MAS)，模拟临床诊疗团队进行临床问题识别，在SOAP病历的S和O部分进行诊断推理，显著提高了识别出心力衰竭、急性肾伤害和感染性伤害的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床故事的准确解释对患者护理至关重要，但单一模型方法缺乏高风险临床任务所需的稳健性。需要更准确、稳健且可解释的临床决策支持工具。

Method: 设计了一个协作式多代理系统，包含一个管理代理和动态分配的专业代理团队。系统通过层次迭代辩论达成共识，模拟临床诊断团队的推理过程。

Result: 在420份MIMIC-III病历数据集上评估，动态多代理配置在识别心力衰竭、急性肾伤害和感染性伤害方面都显示出持续改善的性能。质性分析显示该结构能有效地揭示和重新考量冲突证据。

Conclusion: 通过模拟临床团队的推理过程，该系统为实现更准确、稳健且可解释的临床决策支持工具提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of clinical narratives is critical for patient care,
but the complexity of these notes makes automation challenging. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) show promise, single-model approaches can lack the
robustness required for high-stakes clinical tasks. We introduce a
collaborative multi-agent system (MAS) that models a clinical consultation team
to address this gap. The system is tasked with identifying clinical problems by
analyzing only the Subjective (S) and Objective (O) sections of SOAP notes,
simulating the diagnostic reasoning process of synthesizing raw data into an
assessment. A Manager agent orchestrates a dynamically assigned team of
specialist agents who engage in a hierarchical, iterative debate to reach a
consensus. We evaluated our MAS against a single-agent baseline on a curated
dataset of 420 MIMIC-III notes. The dynamic multi-agent configuration
demonstrated consistently improved performance in identifying congestive heart
failure, acute kidney injury, and sepsis. Qualitative analysis of the agent
debates reveals that this structure effectively surfaces and weighs conflicting
evidence, though it can occasionally be susceptible to groupthink. By modeling
a clinical team's reasoning process, our system offers a promising path toward
more accurate, robust, and interpretable clinical decision support tools.
