In recent decades, DEM has found widespread applications in fields\nsuch as data visualization, geometry processing, and medical imaging.\nTraditional approaches to DEM primarily rely on iterative numerical solvers for\ndiffusion equations or optimization-based methods that minimize handcrafted\nenergy functionals. However, these conventional techniques often face several\nchallenges: they may suffer from limited accuracy, produce overlapping\nartifacts in extreme cases, and require substantial algorithmic redesign when\nextended from 2D to 3D, due to the derivative-dependent nature of their energy\nformulations. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based\ndensity-equalizing mapping framework (LDEM) using deep neural networks.\nSpecifically, we introduce a loss function that enforces density uniformity and\ngeometric regularity, and utilize a hierarchical approach to predict the\ntransformations at both the coarse and dense levels. Our method demonstrates\nsuperior density-equalizing and bijectivity properties compared to prior\nmethods for a wide range of simple and complex density distributions, and can\nbe easily applied to surface remeshing with different effects. Also, it\ngeneralizes seamlessly from 2D to 3D domains without structural changes to the\nmodel architecture or loss formulation.

This\ncomputational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms\npossess meaning in and of themselves is flawed.

Across several independent experiments, we\nfound average CHSH expectation values ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, with several\nruns yielding values (e.g., 2.3-2.4) that significantly violate the classical\nboundary ($|S|\\leq2$). This demonstrates that linguistic interpretation under\nambiguity can exhibit non-classical contextuality, consistent with results from\nhuman cognition experiments. These results inherently imply that classical\nfrequentist-based analytical approaches for natural language are necessarily\nlossy. Instead, we propose that Bayesian-style repeated sampling approaches can\nprovide more practically useful and appropriate characterizations of linguistic\nmeaning in context.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u9000\u5316\u5bf9\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u610f\u4e49\u662f\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u91ca\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bed\u4e49\u9000\u5316\u5bf9\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982LLMs\uff09\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4f20\u7edf\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u4e2d\u5f62\u5f0f\u672c\u8eab\u5177\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Kolmogorov\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u8d1d\u5c14\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u8ba4\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u7cca\u8bcd\u5bf9\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aCHSH\u671f\u671b\u503c\u663e\u8457\u8fdd\u53cd\u7ecf\u5178\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u91ca\u5177\u6709\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u9891\u7387\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u91c7\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u91cd\u590d\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u5730\u8868\u5f81\u8bed\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

We introduce DeepTraverse, a novel vision\narchitecture directly inspired by algorithmic search strategies, enabling it to\nlearn features through a process of systematic elucidation and adaptive\nrefinement distinct from conventional approaches.

The\nresulting algorithmic interplay allows DeepTraverse to intelligently construct\nand refine feature patterns.

Specifically, we achieve\nreal-time estimation of RG'G and RBS under two relaxed assumptions: i) the\nmatrices change negligibly in a short time window; ii) the human movements/IMU\nreadings are diverse in such a time window. Intuitively, the first assumption\nreduces the number of candidate matrices, and the second assumption provides\ndiverse constraints, which greatly reduces the solution space and allows for\naccurate estimation of RG'G and RBS from a short history of IMU readings in\nreal time. To achieve this, we created synthetic datasets of paired RG'G, RBS\nmatrices and IMU readings, and learned their mappings using a Transformer-based\nmodel. We also designed a calibration trigger based on the diversity of IMU\nreadings to ensure that assumption ii) is met before applying our method.

However, few studies have looked into the\npractical challenge of deployment across domains (e.g., cities). Although\nseveral works have incorporated Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage their\nopen-world knowledge, LLMs do not guarantee cross-domain driving performance\nand may incur prohibitive retraining costs during domain adaptation. In this\npaper, we propose RoCA, a novel framework for robust cross-domain E2E\nautonomous driving. RoCA formulates the joint probabilistic distribution over\nthe tokens that encode ego and surrounding vehicle information in the E2E\npipeline. Instantiating with a Gaussian process (GP), RoCA learns a set of\nbasis tokens with corresponding trajectories, which span diverse driving\nscenarios. Then, given any driving scene, it is able to probabilistically infer\nthe future trajectory.

However, ensuring adequate\ndiversity in generated samples of prompt-guided diffusion models remains a\nchallenge, particularly when the prompts span a broad semantic spectrum and the\ndiversity of generated data needs to be evaluated in a prompt-aware fashion\nacross semantically similar prompts. Recent methods have introduced guidance\nvia diversity measures to encourage more varied generations. In this work, we\nextend the diversity measure-based approaches by proposing the Scalable\nPrompt-Aware R\\'eny Kernel Entropy Diversity Guidance (SPARKE) method for\nprompt-aware diversity guidance. SPARKE utilizes conditional entropy for\ndiversity guidance, which dynamically conditions diversity measurement on\nsimilar prompts and enables prompt-aware diversity control. While the\nentropy-based guidance approach enhances prompt-aware diversity, its reliance\non the matrix-based entropy scores poses computational challenges in\nlarge-scale generation settings. To address this, we focus on the special case\nof Conditional latent RKE Score Guidance, reducing entropy computation and\ngradient-based optimization complexity from the $O(n^3)$ of general entropy\nmeasures to $O(n)$. The reduced computational complexity allows for\ndiversity-guided sampling over potentially thousands of generation rounds on\ndifferent prompts. We numerically test the SPARKE method on several\ntext-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the proposed method improves\nthe prompt-aware diversity of the generated data without incurring significant\ncomputational costs.

Deviations from this baseline\ncan then be used to detect cloud presence and guide radiative transfer models\nin inferring atmospheric attenuation. Operational retrieval algorithms\ntypically approximate background reflectance using monthly statistics, assuming\nsurface properties vary slowly relative to atmospheric conditions.

Built on the Temporo-Spatial Vision\nTransformer, our approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted features such as\nexplicit albedo maps or cloud masks. The emulator is trained on instantaneous\nSSR estimates from the HelioMont algorithm over Switzerland, a region\ncharacterized by complex terrain and dynamic snow cover. Inputs include\nmulti-spectral SEVIRI imagery from the Meteosat Second Generation platform,\naugmented with static topographic features and solar geometry.

This task is challenging because it\nrequires not only learning a new concept from a few images, but also\nintegrating the personal and general knowledge together to recognize the\nconcept in different contexts. In this paper, we show how to effectively adapt\nthe internal representation of a vision-language dual encoder model for\npersonalized vision-language retrieval. We find that regularized low-rank\nadaption of a small set of parameters in the language encoder's final layer\nserves as a highly effective alternative to textual inversion for recognizing\nthe personal concept while preserving general knowledge.

While self-training methods have proven effective in\nsemi-supervised learning, they remain vulnerable to errors from noisy pseudo\nlabels. Moreover, most recent approaches to the few-label classification\nproblem are either designed for resource-rich languages such as English or\ninvolve complex cascading models that are prone to overfitting. To address the\npersistent challenge of few-label text classification in truly low-resource\nlinguistic contexts, where existing methods often struggle with noisy\npseudo-labels and domain adaptation, we propose Flick. Unlike prior methods\nthat rely on generic multi-cluster pseudo-labelling or complex cascading\narchitectures, Flick leverages the fundamental insight that distilling\nhigh-confidence pseudo-labels from a broader set of initial clusters can\ndramatically improve pseudo-label quality, particularly for linguistically\ndiverse, low-resource settings. Flick introduces a novel pseudo-label\nrefinement component, a departure from traditional pseudo-labelling strategies\nby identifying and leveraging top-performing pseudo-label clusters.

Deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in\nautomating skin cancer classification, but their performance can be limited by\ndata scarcity and a lack of uncertainty awareness. In this study, we present a\ncomprehensive evaluation of DL-based skin lesion classification using transfer\nlearning and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on the HAM10000 dataset. In the\nfirst phase, we benchmarked several pre-trained feature extractors-including\nContrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) variants, Residual Network-50\n(ResNet50), Densely Connected Convolutional Network (DenseNet121), Visual\nGeometry Group network (VGG16), and EfficientNet-V2-Large-combined with a range\nof traditional classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), eXtreme\nGradient Boosting (XGBoost), and logistic regression. Our results show that\nCLIP-based vision transformers, particularly LAION CLIP ViT-H/14 with SVM,\ndeliver the highest classification performance.

The contributions of this study are\nas follows: First, we construct UrbanDiffBench, a curated dataset of urban\nstreetscapes containing architectural images from different periods and\nregions. Second, we develop UrbanSense, the first vision-language-model-based\nframework for urban streetscape analysis, enabling the quantitative generation\nand comparison of urban style representations. Third, experimental results show\nthat Over 80% of generated descriptions pass the t-test (p less than 0.05).\nHigh Phi scores (0.912 for cities, 0.833 for periods) from subjective\nevaluations confirm the method's ability to capture subtle stylistic\ndifferences. These results highlight the method's potential to quantify and\ninterpret urban style evolution, offering a scientifically grounded lens for\nfuture design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7814\u7a76\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5206\u6790\u57ce\u5e02\u8857\u666f\u98ce\u683c\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6UrbanDiffBench\u548c\u6846\u67b6UrbanSense\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u98ce\u683c\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u57ce\u5e02\u6587\u5316\u548c\u5efa\u7b51\u98ce\u683c\u56e0\u5730\u7406\u3001\u5386\u53f2\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u653f\u6cbb\u56e0\u7d20\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u5bb6\u89e3\u8bfb\u548c\u5386\u53f2\u6587\u6863\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u96c6UrbanDiffBench\u548c\u6846\u67b6UrbanSense\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u57ce\u5e02\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c80%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u901a\u8fc7t\u68c0\u9a8c\uff08p<0.05\uff09\uff0c\u4e3b\u89c2\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u9ad8Phi\u5206\u6570\uff08\u57ce\u5e020.912\uff0c\u65f6\u671f0.833\uff09\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u79d1\u5b66\u91cf\u5316\u57ce\u5e02\u98ce\u683c\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

This is suboptimal because resampling can\nintroduce artifacts due to interpolation. To address this, we present\nRealKeyMorph (RKM), a resolution-agnostic method for image registration. RKM is\nan extension of KeyMorph, a registration framework which works by training a\nnetwork to learn corresponding keypoints for a given pair of images, after\nwhich a closed-form keypoint matching step is used to derive the transformation\nthat aligns them. To avoid resampling and enable operating on the raw data, RKM\noutputs keypoints in real-world coordinates of the scanner. To do this, we\nleverage the affine matrix produced by the scanner (e.g., MRI machine) that\nencodes the mapping from voxel coordinates to real world coordinates. By\ntransforming keypoints into real-world space and integrating this into the\ntraining process, RKM effectively enables the extracted keypoints to be\nresolution-agnostic.

To address this,\nwe introduce a fully differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer (DART),\nwhich adaptively partitions images into content-dependent patches of varying\nsizes.

Conventional methods\nface challenges due to sparse data, algorithmic complexity, and high\ncomputational costs, while increasing usage of machine learning (ML) method\nremains limited to reconstruction problems at the sea surface and local\nregions, struggling with issues like cloud occlusion. To address these\nlimitations, this paper proposes ReconMOST, a data-driven guided diffusion\nmodel framework for multi-layer sea temperature reconstruction. Specifically,\nwe first pre-train an unconditional diffusion model using a large collection of\nhistorical numerical simulation data, enabling the model to attain physically\nconsistent distribution patterns of ocean temperature fields. During the\ngeneration phase, sparse yet high-accuracy in-situ observational data are\nutilized as guidance points for the reverse diffusion process, generating\naccurate reconstruction results. Importantly, in regions lacking direct\nobservational data, the physically consistent spatial distribution patterns\nlearned during pre-training enable implicitly guided and physically plausible\nreconstructions. Our method extends ML-based SST reconstruction to a global,\nmulti-layer setting, handling over 92.5% missing data while maintaining\nreconstruction accuracy, spatial resolution, and superior generalization\ncapability. We pre-train our model on CMIP6 numerical simulation data and\nconduct guided reconstruction experiments on CMIP6 and EN4 analysis data. The\nresults of mean squared error (MSE) values achieve 0.049 on guidance, 0.680 on\nreconstruction, and 0.633 on total, respectively, demonstrating the\neffectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework.

Existing methods often rely on specific models or introduce\nexcessive parameters, which limits their practicality. To address these issues,\nwe propose a novel robust MER framework, Causal Inference Distiller (CIDer),\nand introduce a new task, Random Modality Feature Missing (RMFM), to generalize\nthe definition of modality missing. CIDer integrates two key components: a\nModel-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) module and a Model-Agnostic Causal\nInference (MACI) module. MSSD enhances robustness under the RMFM task through a\nweight-sharing self-distillation approach applied across low-level features,\nattention maps, and high-level representations. Additionally, a Word-level\nSelf-aligned Attention Module (WSAM) reduces computational complexity, while a\nMultimodal Composite Transformer (MCT) facilitates efficient multimodal fusion.\nTo tackle OOD challenges, MACI employs a tailored causal graph to mitigate\nlabel and language biases using a Multimodal Causal Module (MCM) and\nfine-grained counterfactual texts. Notably, MACI can independently enhance OOD\ngeneralization with minimal additional parameters. Furthermore, we also\nintroduce the new repartitioned MER OOD datasets.

Code available at:\n  https://github.com/pkargupta/claimspect", "summary": "Claims made by individuals or entities are oftentimes nuanced and cannot be\nclearly labeled as entirely \"true\" or \"false\" -- as is frequently the case with\nscientific and political claims. However, a claim (e.g., \"vaccine A is better\nthan vaccine B\") can be dissected into its integral aspects and sub-aspects\n(e.g., efficacy, safety, distribution), which are individually easier to\nvalidate. This enables a more comprehensive, structured response that provides\na well-rounded perspective on a given problem while also allowing the reader to\nprioritize specific angles of interest within the claim (e.g., safety towards\nchildren).

In the domain of natural images, numerous transfer-based\nadversarial attack methods have been studied. However, HSIs differ from natural\nimages due to their high-dimensional and rich spectral information. Current\nresearch on HSI adversarial examples remains limited and faces challenges in\nfully utilizing the structural and feature information of images. To address\nthese issues, this paper proposes a novel method to enhance the transferability\nof the adversarial examples for HSI classification models. First, while keeping\nthe image structure unchanged, the proposed method randomly divides the image\ninto blocks in both spatial and spectral dimensions. Then, various\ntransformations are applied on a block by block basis to increase input\ndiversity and mitigate overfitting. Second, a feature distancing loss targeting\nintermediate layers is designed, which measures the distance between the\namplified features of the original examples and the features of the adversarial\nexamples as the primary loss, while the output layer prediction serves as the\nauxiliary loss. This guides the perturbation to disrupt the features of the\ntrue class in adversarial examples, effectively enhancing transferability.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that the adversarial examples generated by\nthe proposed method achieve effective transferability to black-box models on\ntwo public HSI datasets.

OMR-NED builds upon the widely-used\nSymbol Error Rate (SER), offering a fine-grained and detailed error analysis\nthat covers individual musical elements such as note heads, beams, pitches,\naccidentals, and other critical notation features. The resulting numeric score\nprovided by OMR-NED facilitates clear comparisons, enabling researchers and\nend-users alike to identify optimal OMR approaches.

While surface defect\ndetection is feasible for human inspectors, manual methods face critical\nlimitations in scalability, efficiency, and consistency due to the vast surface\narea, structural complexity, and operational demands of aircraft maintenance.\nWe propose a smart surface damage detection and localization system for fighter\naircraft, termed J-DDL. J-DDL integrates 2D images and 3D point clouds of the\nentire aircraft surface, captured using a combined system of laser scanners and\ncameras, to achieve precise damage detection and localization. Central to our\nsystem is a novel damage detection network built on the YOLO architecture,\nspecifically optimized for identifying surface defects in 2D aircraft images.\nKey innovations include lightweight Fasternet blocks for efficient feature\nextraction, an optimized neck architecture incorporating Efficient Multiscale\nAttention (EMA) modules for superior feature aggregation, and the introduction\nof a novel loss function, Inner-CIOU, to enhance detection accuracy. After\ndetecting damage in 2D images, the system maps the identified anomalies onto\ncorresponding 3D point clouds, enabling accurate 3D localization of defects\nacross the aircraft surface. Our J-DDL not only streamlines the inspection\nprocess but also ensures more comprehensive and detailed coverage of large and\ncomplex aircraft exteriors.

Understanding Out-of-Context Reasoning in Transformers", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) can acquire new knowledge through fine-tuning,\nbut this process exhibits a puzzling duality: models can generalize remarkably\nfrom new facts, yet are also prone to hallucinating incorrect information.\nHowever, the reasons for this phenomenon remain poorly understood. In this\nwork, we argue that both behaviors stem from a single mechanism known as\nout-of-context reasoning (OCR): the ability to deduce implications by\nassociating concepts, even those without a causal link. Our experiments across\nfive prominent LLMs confirm that OCR indeed drives both generalization and\nhallucination, depending on whether the associated concepts are causally\nrelated. To build a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon, we\nthen formalize OCR as a synthetic factual recall task. We empirically show that\na one-layer single-head attention-only transformer with factorized output and\nvalue matrices can learn to solve this task, while a model with combined\nweights cannot, highlighting the crucial role of matrix factorization. Our\ntheoretical analysis shows that the OCR capability can be attributed to the\nimplicit bias of gradient descent, which favors solutions that minimize the\nnuclear norm of the combined output-value matrix.

While recent advances using large language models (LLMs) have shown\npromising results, methods for automatically evaluating autoformalization\nremain underexplored. As one moves to more complex domains (e.g., advanced\nmathematics), human evaluation requires significant time and domain expertise,\nespecially as the complexity of the underlying statements and background\nknowledge increases. LLM-as-a-judge presents a promising approach for\nautomating such evaluation. However, existing methods typically employ\ncoarse-grained and generic evaluation criteria, which limit their effectiveness\nfor advanced formal mathematical reasoning, where quality hinges on nuanced,\nmulti-granular dimensions. In this work, we take a step toward addressing this\ngap by introducing a systematic, automatic method to evaluate autoformalization\ntasks. The proposed method is based on an epistemically and formally grounded\nensemble (EFG) of LLM judges, defined on criteria encompassing logical\npreservation (LP), mathematical consistency (MC), formal validity (FV), and\nformal quality (FQ), resulting in a transparent assessment that accounts for\ndifferent contributing factors.

While early work focused on individual neurons, evidence that\nneurons often encode multiple concepts has motivated a shift toward analyzing\ndirections in activation space. A key question is how to find directions that\ncapture interpretable features in an unsupervised manner. Current methods rely\non dictionary learning with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), commonly trained over\nresidual stream activations to learn directions from scratch. However, SAEs\noften struggle in causal evaluations and lack intrinsic interpretability, as\ntheir learning is not explicitly tied to the computations of the model. Here,\nwe tackle these limitations by directly decomposing MLP activations with\nsemi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF), such that the learned features\nare (a) sparse linear combinations of co-activated neurons, and (b) mapped to\ntheir activating inputs, making them directly interpretable.

Despite recent progress, significant challenges remain due to\nthe semantic gap between music and dance motion, as music offers only abstract\ncues, such as melody, groove, and emotion, without explicitly specifying the\nphysical movements. Moreover, a single piece of music can produce multiple\nplausible dance interpretations. This one-to-many mapping demands additional\nguidance, as music alone provides limited information for generating diverse\ndance movements.

In this paper, we introduce DanceChat, a Large Language\nModel (LLM)-guided music-to-dance generation approach. We use an LLM as a\nchoreographer that provides textual motion instructions, offering explicit,\nhigh-level guidance for dance generation. This approach goes beyond implicit\nlearning from music alone, enabling the model to generate dance that is both\nmore diverse and better aligned with musical styles. Our approach consists of\nthree components: (1) an LLM-based pseudo instruction generation module that\nproduces textual dance guidance based on music style and structure, (2) a\nmulti-modal feature extraction and fusion module that integrates music, rhythm,\nand textual guidance into a shared representation, and (3) a diffusion-based\nmotion synthesis module together with a multi-modal alignment loss, which\nensures that the generated dance is aligned with both musical and textual cues.\nExtensive experiments on AIST++ and human evaluations show that DanceChat\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.", "AI": {"tldr": "DanceChat\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u821e\u8e48\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u97f3\u4e50\u98ce\u683c\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u821e\u8e48\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u821e\u8e48\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u97f3\u4e50\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u97f3\u4e50\u4e0e\u821e\u8e48\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u97f3\u4e50\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u62bd\u8c61\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u4e14\u5355\u4e00\u97f3\u4e50\u53ef\u5bf9\u5e94\u591a\u79cd\u821e\u8e48\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u97f3\u4e50\u4fe1\u606f\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u7b26\u5408\u97f3\u4e50\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u821e\u8e48\u3002", "method": "1.

While CLIP is capable of making image\nfeatures to be similar to the corresponding text features, the modality gap\nremains a nontrivial issue and limits image recognition performance of TaI.\nUsing multi-label image recognition (MLR) as an example, we present a novel\nmethod, called T2I-PAL to tackle the modality gap issue when using only text\ncaptions for PEFT. The core design of T2I-PAL is to leverage pre-trained\ntext-to-image generation models to generate photo-realistic and diverse images\nfrom text captions, thereby reducing the modality gap. To further enhance MLR,\nT2I-PAL incorporates a class-wise heatmap and learnable prototypes. This\naggregates local similarities, making the representation of local visual\nfeatures more robust and informative for multi-label recognition. For better\nPEFT, we further combine both prompt tuning and adapter learning to enhance\nclassification performance. T2I-PAL offers significant advantages: it\neliminates the need for fully semantically annotated training images, thereby\nreducing the manual annotation workload, and it preserves the intrinsic mode of\nthe CLIP model, allowing for seamless integration with any existing CLIP\nframework.

Standard diffusion models rely on isotropic Gaussian noise\nin the forward process, inherently favoring Euclidean spaces. However, many\nreal-world problems involve non-Euclidean distributions, such as hyperspherical\nmanifolds, where class-specific patterns are governed by angular geometry\nwithin hypercones. When modeled in Euclidean space, these angular subtleties\nare lost, leading to suboptimal generative performance.

However, recent studies have raised concerns that\nindiscriminate random masking may inadvertently eliminate critical semantic\ninformation, motivating the development of more informed masking strategies. In\nthis study, we explore the role of random masking in the self-distillation\nsetting, focusing on the DINO framework. Specifically, we apply random masking\nexclusively to the student's global view, while preserving the student's local\nviews and the teacher's global view in their original, unmasked forms. This\ndesign leverages DINO's multi-view augmentation scheme to retain clean\nsupervision while inducing robustness through masked inputs. We evaluate our\napproach using DINO-Tiny on the mini-ImageNet dataset and show that random\nmasking under this asymmetric setup yields more robust and fine-grained\nattention maps, ultimately enhancing downstream performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u81ea\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u5982DINO\uff09\u4e2d\u968f\u673a\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u63a9\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ec5\u5bf9\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u89c6\u56fe\u5e94\u7528\u968f\u673a\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u5c40\u90e8\u89c6\u56fe\u548c\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u89c6\u56fe\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u673a\u63a9\u7801\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u610f\u4e2d\u6d88\u9664\u5173\u952e\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u5728DINO\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ec5\u5bf9\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u89c6\u56fe\u5e94\u7528\u968f\u673a\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u5c40\u90e8\u89c6\u56fe\u548c\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u89c6\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u5728mini-ImageNet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u968f\u673a\u63a9\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u81ea\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Existing text-to-texture synthesis\napproaches utilize depth-aware diffusion models to progressively generate\nimages and synthesize textures across predefined multiple viewpoints. However,\nthese approaches lead to a gradual shift in texture properties across\nviewpoints due to (1) insufficient integration of previously synthesized\ntextures at each viewpoint during the diffusion process and (2) the\nautoregressive nature of the texture synthesis process. Moreover, the\npredefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the\nobject's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized\nfrom different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency. In\nTexTailor, we address these issues by (1) applying a resampling scheme that\nrepeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within\nthe diffusion process, and (2) fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on\nthese resampled textures.

Leveraging a vision transformer (ViT), PiPViT captures\nlong-range dependencies among patches to learn robust, human-interpretable\nprototypes that approximate lesion extent only using image-level labels.\nAdditionally, PiPViT benefits from contrastive learning and multi-resolution\ninput processing, which enables effective localization of biomarkers across\nscales.\n  Results: We evaluated PiPViT on retinal OCT image classification across four\ndatasets, where it achieved competitive quantitative performance compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods while delivering more meaningful explanations.\nMoreover, quantitative evaluation on a hold-out test set confirms that the\nlearned prototypes are semantically and clinically relevant.

To mirror real-life\nscenarios, we introduce the task of continual learning of instances and\nclasses, at the same time. This task challenges models to adapt to multiple\nlevels of granularity over time, which requires balancing fine-grained instance\nrecognition with coarse-grained class generalization. In this paper, we\nidentify that classes and instances naturally form a hierarchical structure. To\nmodel these hierarchical relationships, we propose HyperCLIC, a continual\nlearning algorithm that leverages hyperbolic space, which is uniquely suited\nfor hierarchical data due to its ability to represent tree-like structures with\nlow distortion and compact embeddings. Our framework incorporates hyperbolic\nclassification and distillation objectives, enabling the continual embedding of\nhierarchical relations.

Quantization is a key\ntechnique for model compression and acceleration. As an efficient approach,\nPost-Training Quantization (PTQ) is still in its nascent stages for video\nmatting, facing significant hurdles in maintaining accuracy and temporal\ncoherence. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel and general\nPTQ framework specifically designed for video matting models, marking, to the\nbest of our knowledge, the first systematic attempt in this domain. Our\ncontributions include: (1) A two-stage PTQ strategy that combines\nblock-reconstruction-based optimization for fast, stable initial quantization\nand local dependency capture, followed by a global calibration of quantization\nparameters to minimize accuracy loss. (2) A Statistically-Driven Global Affine\nCalibration (GAC) method that enables the network to compensate for cumulative\nstatistical distortions arising from factors such as neglected BN layer\neffects, even reducing the error of existing PTQ methods on video matting tasks\nup to 20%. (3) An Optical Flow Assistance (OFA) component that leverages\ntemporal and semantic priors from frames to guide the PTQ process, enhancing\nthe model's ability to distinguish moving foregrounds in complex scenes and\nultimately achieving near full-precision performance even under ultra-low-bit\nquantization. Comprehensive quantitative and visual results show that our\nPTQ4VM achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy performance across different\nbit-widths compared to the existing quantization methods.

We analyze existing methods and find they fail to detect\nhigh-quality videos generated by world models (i.e., Cosmos), revealing\npotential drawbacks of ignoring real-world clues. To address this, we propose a\nsimple yet effective model, SpannDetector, to leverage multi-view consistency\nas a strong criterion for real-world AI-generated video detection. Experiments\nshow that our method achieves superior results, highlighting a promising\ndirection for explainable AI-generated video detection based on physical\nplausibility. We believe that GenWorld will advance the field of AI-generated\nvideo detection.

In this paper, we propose SceneCompleter, a novel framework that\nachieves 3D-consistent generative novel view synthesis through dense 3D scene\ncompletion. SceneCompleter achieves both visual coherence and 3D-consistent\ngenerative scene completion through two key components: (1) a\ngeometry-appearance dual-stream diffusion model that jointly synthesizes novel\nviews in RGBD space; (2) a scene embedder that encodes a more holistic scene\nunderstanding from the reference image. By effectively fusing structural and\ntextural information, our method demonstrates superior coherence and\nplausibility in generative novel view synthesis across diverse datasets.\nProject Page: https://chen-wl20.github.io/SceneCompleter", "AI": {"tldr": "SceneCompleter\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bc6\u96c63D\u573a\u666f\u8865\u5168\u5b9e\u73b03D\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u57283D\u7ed3\u6784\u63a8\u65ad\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u57282D\u8865\u5168\u540e\u901a\u8fc73D\u6062\u590d\u6280\u672f\u91cd\u5efa\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u8868\u9762\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u5931\u771f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4eceRGB\u6570\u636e\u63a8\u65ad3D\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "SceneCompleter\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a(1)\u51e0\u4f55-\u5916\u89c2\u53cc\u6d41\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u5408\u6210RGBD\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff1b(2)\u573a\u666f\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u4ece\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7f16\u7801\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6837\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SceneCompleter\u901a\u8fc73D\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u573a\u666f\u8865\u5168\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c3D\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}
