However, obtaining high-quality\nmeshes of engineering microstructures using these approaches remains an open\nquestion. In harmonic approaches, we usually reconstruct surfaces by evaluating\nthe harmonic bases on equidistantly sampled simplicial complexes of the base\ndomains (e.g., triangular spheroids and disks). However, this traditional\nsampling does not account for local changes in the Jacobian of the basis\nfunctions, resulting in nonuniform discretization after reconstruction or\ngeneration. As it impacts the accuracy and time step, high-quality\ndiscretization of microstructures is crucial for efficient numerical\nsimulations (e.g., finite element and discrete element methods). To circumvent\nthis issue, we propose an efficient hierarchical diffusion-based approach for\nresampling the surface-i.e., performing a reparameterization-to yield an\nequalized mesh triangulation. Analogous to heat problems, we use nonlinear\ndiffusion to resample the curvilinear coordinates of the analysis domain,\nthereby enlarging small triangles at the expense of large triangles on\nsurfaces. We tested isotropic and anisotropic diffusion schemes on the recent\nspheroidal and hemispheroidal harmonics methods. The results show a substantial\nimprovement in the quality metrics for surface triangulation. Unlike\ntraditional surface reconstruction and meshing techniques, this approach\npreserves surface morphology, along with the areas and volumes of surfaces. We\ndiscuss the results and the associated computational costs for large 2D and 3D\nmicrostructures, such as digital twins of concrete and stone masonry, and their\nfuture applications."}

While cameras offer\nsufficient spatial resolution, they introduce optical, sampling, and\nphotometric distortions. Furthermore, the physical measurement must be combined\nwith a model of a visual system to assess whether the distortions are going to\nbe visible. To enable perceptual assessment of displays, we propose a\ncombination of a camera-based reconstruction pipeline with a visual difference\npredictor, which account for both the inaccuracy of camera measurements and\nvisual difference prediction.

This\ncore association remains decisive under multiple dependence-aware statistical\ntests, including Rao-Scott adjustment and cluster permutation tests.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that SPICE provides a distinct signal from abuse\nclassification. In trials where a model failed to identify abuse, it still\noverwhelmingly stated a preference not to continue the interaction (81% of the\ntime). An exploratory analysis also reveals a significant interaction effect: a\npreamble describing the study context significantly impacts SPICE under\nambiguity, but only when transcripts are presented as a single block of text\nrather than a multi-turn chat. The results validate SPICE as a robust,\nlow-overhead, and reproducible tool for auditing model dispositions,\ncomplementing existing metrics by offering a direct, relational signal of a\nmodel's state.

The MFRM enhances intra- and\ninter-modal feature representations by modeling their relationships, thereby\nimproving cross-modal alignment and discriminative power.Inspired by feedback\ndifferential amplifiers, the DFFM dynamically computes inter-modal differential\nfeatures as guidance signals and feeds them back to the MFRM, enabling adaptive\nfusion of complementary information while suppressing common-mode noise across\nmodalities. To enable robust feature learning, the MFRM and DFFM are integrated\ninto a unified framework, which is formally formulated as an Iterative\nRelation-Map Differential Guided Feature Fusion mechanism, termed IRDFusion.\nIRDFusion enables high-quality cross-modal fusion by progressively amplifying\nsalient relational signals through iterative feedback, while suppressing\nfeature noise, leading to significant performance gains.In extensive\nexperiments on FLIR, LLVIP and M$^3$FD datasets, IRDFusion achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance and consistently outperforms existing methods\nacross diverse challenging scenarios, demonstrating its robustness and\neffectiveness.

Real-world value often stems from the length of task an agent can\ncomplete. We start this work by observing the simple but counterintuitive fact\nthat marginal gains in single-step accuracy can compound into exponential\nimprovements in the length of a task a model can successfully complete. Then,\nwe argue that failures of LLMs when simple tasks are made longer arise from\nmistakes in execution, rather than an inability to reason. We propose isolating\nexecution capability, by explicitly providing the knowledge and plan needed to\nsolve a long-horizon task. We find that larger models can correctly execute\nsignificantly more turns even when small models have 100\\% single-turn\naccuracy. We observe that the per-step accuracy of models degrades as the\nnumber of steps increases. This is not just due to long-context limitations --\ncuriously, we observe a self-conditioning effect -- models become more likely\nto make mistakes when the context contains their errors from prior turns.\nSelf-conditioning does not reduce by just scaling the model size. In contrast,\nrecent thinking models do not self-condition, and can also execute much longer\ntasks in a single turn. We conclude by benchmarking frontier thinking models on\nthe length of task they can execute in a single turn. Overall, by focusing on\nthe ability to execute, we hope to reconcile debates on how LLMs can solve\ncomplex reasoning problems yet fail at simple tasks when made longer, and\nhighlight the massive benefits of scaling model size and sequential test-time\ncompute for long-horizon tasks."}

Methods In this study, a novel hybrid model named\nCoAtNeXt was proposed for the classification of gastric tissue images. The\nmodel is built upon the CoAtNet architecture by replacing its MBConv layers\nwith enhanced ConvNeXtV2 blocks. Additionally, the Convolutional Block\nAttention Module (CBAM) is integrated to improve local feature extraction\nthrough channel and spatial attention mechanisms. The architecture was scaled\nto achieve a balance between computational efficiency and classification\nperformance. CoAtNeXt was evaluated on two publicly available datasets,\nHMU-GC-HE-30K for eight-class classification and GasHisSDB for binary\nclassification, and was compared against 10 Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNNs) and ten Vision Transformer (ViT) models. Results CoAtNeXt achieved\n96.47% accuracy, 96.60% precision, 96.47% recall, 96.45% F1 score, and 99.89%\nAUC on HMU-GC-HE-30K. On GasHisSDB, it reached 98.29% accuracy, 98.07%\nprecision, 98.41% recall, 98.23% F1 score, and 99.90% AUC. It outperformed all\nCNN and ViT models tested and surpassed previous studies in the literature.\nConclusion Experimental results show that CoAtNeXt is a robust architecture for\nhistopathological classification of gastric tissue images, providing\nperformance on binary and multiclass. Its highlights its potential to assist\npathologists by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and reducing workload."}

A common approach is\nTrie-based biasing, which gives \"bonus scores\" to partial hypothesis (e.g.\n\"Bon\") that may lead to the generation of the rare word (e.g. \"Bonham\"). If the\nfull word (\"Bonham\") isn't ultimately recognized, the system revokes those\nearlier bonuses. This revocation is limited to beam search and is\ncomputationally expensive, particularly for models with large decoders. To\novercome these limitations, we propose adapting ASR models to look ahead and\npredict multiple steps at once. This avoids the revocation step entirely by\nbetter estimating whether a partial hypothesis will lead to the generation of\nthe full rare word. By fine-tuning Whisper with only 10 hours of synthetic\ndata, our method reduces the word error rate on the NSC Part 2 test set from\n30.86% to 12.19%."}

Our parallel architecture also enables fast and\nstable generation of long-duration videos, making it suitable for real-world\napplications such as digital human livestreaming and vlogging. To\ncomprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a benchmark of 375 curated\nsamples covering diverse instructions and challenging scenarios.

To implement this, we propose UAE,\na novel framework for unified multimodal learning. We begin by pre-training the\ndecoder with large-scale long-context image captions to capture fine-grained\nsemantic and complex spatial relationships. We then propose Unified-GRPO via\nreinforcement learning (RL), which covers three stages: (1) A cold-start phase\nto gently initialize both encoder and decoder with a semantic reconstruction\nloss; (2) Generation for Understanding, where the encoder is trained to\ngenerate informative captions that maximize the decoder's reconstruction\nquality, enhancing its visual understanding; (3) Understanding for Generation,\nwhere the decoder is refined to reconstruct from these captions, forcing it to\nleverage every detail and improving its long-context instruction following and\ngeneration fidelity.

The best-performing method\nhypothesizes that shift equivariance and locality inductive biases of\nconvolutional neural networks are the cause of the performance gap, hence\nincorporating these assumptions into its analytical model. In this work, we\npresent evidence that the locality in deep diffusion models emerges as a\nstatistical property of the image dataset, not due to the inductive bias of\nconvolutional neural networks.
