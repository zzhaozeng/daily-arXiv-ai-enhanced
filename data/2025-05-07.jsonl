For more details:\n  https://suikei-wang.github.io/RESAnything/", "summary": "We present an open-vocabulary and zero-shot method for arbitrary referring\nexpression segmentation (RES), targeting input expressions that are more\ngeneral than what prior works were designed to handle. Specifically, our inputs\nencompass both object- and part-level labels as well as implicit references\npointing to properties or qualities of object/part function, design, style,\nmaterial, etc. Our model, coined RESAnything, leverages Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT)\nreasoning, where the key idea is attribute prompting. We generate detailed\ndescriptions of object/part attributes including shape, color, and location for\npotential segment proposals through systematic prompting of a large language\nmodel (LLM), where the proposals are produced by a foundational image\nsegmentation model. Our approach encourages deep reasoning about object or part\nattributes related to function, style, design, etc., enabling the system to\nhandle implicit queries without any part annotations for training or\nfine-tuning. As the first zero-shot and LLM-based RES method, RESAnything\nachieves clearly superior performance among zero-shot methods on traditional\nRES benchmarks and significantly outperforms existing methods on challenging\nscenarios involving implicit queries and complex part-level relations. Finally,\nwe contribute a new benchmark dataset to offer ~3K carefully curated RES\ninstances to assess part-level, arbitrary RES solutions."}

Constructing such paired datasets requires\naccess to high-quality, relatively artifact-free motion clips, which often\nnecessitates laborious manual cleanup. In this work, we present StableMotion, a\nsimple yet effective method for training motion cleanup models directly from\nunpaired corrupted datasets that need cleanup. The core component of our method\nis the introduction of motion quality indicators, which can be easily annotated\nthrough manual labeling or heuristic algorithms and enable training of\nquality-aware motion generation models on raw motion data with mixed quality.\nAt test time, the model can be prompted to generate high-quality motions using\nthe quality indicators. Our method can be implemented through a simple\ndiffusion-based framework, leading to a unified motion generate-discriminate\nmodel, which can be used to both identify and fix corrupted frames. We\ndemonstrate that our proposed method is effective for training motion cleanup\nmodels on raw mocap data in production scenarios by applying StableMotion to\nSoccerMocap, a 245-hour soccer mocap dataset containing real-world motion\nartifacts.

To address this limitation,\nwe propose constructing a large-scale language-guided open-set aerial detection\ndataset, encompassing three levels of language guidance: from words to phrases,\nand ultimately to sentences. Centered around an open-source large\nvision-language model and integrating image-operation-based preprocessing with\nBERT-based postprocessing, we present the OS-W2S Label Engine, an automatic\nannotation pipeline capable of handling diverse scene annotations for aerial\nimages. Using this label engine, we expand existing aerial detection datasets\nwith rich textual annotations and construct a novel benchmark dataset, called\nMulti-instance Open-set Aerial Dataset (MI-OAD), addressing the limitations of\ncurrent remote sensing grounding data and enabling effective open-set aerial\ndetection. Specifically, MI-OAD contains 163,023 images and 2 million\nimage-caption pairs, approximately 40 times larger than comparable datasets. We\nalso employ state-of-the-art open-set methods from the natural image domain,\ntrained on our proposed dataset, to validate the model's open-set detection\ncapabilities. For instance, when trained on our dataset, Grounding DINO\nachieves improvements of 29.5 AP_{50} and 33.7 Recall@10 for sentence inputs\nunder zero-shot transfer conditions. Both the dataset and the label engine will\nbe released publicly."}

The key novelty of\nlingual-backdoor attacks is that the language itself serves as the trigger to\nhijack the infected LLMs to generate inflammatory speech. They enable the\nprecise targeting of a specific language-speaking group, exacerbating racial\ndiscrimination by malicious entities. We first implement a baseline\nlingual-backdoor attack, which is carried out by poisoning a set of training\ndata for specific downstream tasks through translation into the trigger\nlanguage. However, this baseline attack suffers from poor task generalization\nand is impractical in real-world settings. To address this challenge, we design\nBadLingual, a novel task-agnostic lingual-backdoor, capable of triggering any\ndownstream tasks within the chat LLMs, regardless of the specific questions of\nthese tasks. We design a new approach using PPL-constrained Greedy Coordinate\nGradient-based Search (PGCG) based adversarial training to expand the decision\nboundary of lingual-backdoor, thereby enhancing the generalization ability of\nlingual-backdoor across various tasks. We perform extensive experiments to\nvalidate the effectiveness of our proposed attacks. Specifically, the baseline\nattack achieves an ASR of over 90% on the specified tasks.

To evaluate the performance of our proposed\nsystem, we present an experimental study that includes various input patterns,\nsuch as positional codes, bars with different orientations, and a digit\nrecognition task. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using biological\nneural networks to perform tasks traditionally handled by artificial neural\nnetworks, paving the way for further exploration of biologically-inspired\ncomputing systems, with potential applications in neuromorphic engineering and\nbio-hybrid computing."}

AE robustness is characterized by the\nLipschitz bounds of its components. Existing robustness evaluation frameworks\nbased on white-box attacks do not fully exploit the vulnerabilities of\nintermediate ill-conditioned layers in AEs. In the context of optimizing\nimperceptible norm-bounded additive perturbations to maximize output damage,\nexisting methods struggle to effectively propagate adversarial loss gradients\nthroughout the network, often converging to less effective perturbations. To\naddress this, we propose a novel layer-conditioning-based adversarial\noptimization objective that effectively guides the adversarial map toward\nregions of local Lipschitz bounds by enhancing loss gradient information\npropagation during attack optimization. We demonstrate through extensive\nexperiments on state-of-the-art AEs that our adversarial objective results in\nstronger attacks, outperforming existing methods in both universal and\nsample-specific scenarios. As a defense method against this attack, we\nintroduce an inference-time adversarially trained defense plugin that mitigates\nthe effects of adversarial examples."}

We propose a novel hybrid geometric-neural approach for autonomous leaf\ngrasping that combines traditional computer vision with neural networks through\nself-supervised learning. Our method integrates YOLOv8 for instance\nsegmentation and RAFT-Stereo for 3D depth estimation to build rich leaf\nrepresentations, which feed into both a geometric feature scoring pipeline and\na neural refinement module (GraspPointCNN). The key innovation is our\nconfidence-weighted fusion mechanism that dynamically balances the contribution\nof each approach based on prediction certainty. Our self-supervised framework\nuses the geometric pipeline as an expert teacher to automatically generate\ntraining data. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves an 88.0%\nsuccess rate in controlled environments and 84.7% in real greenhouse\nconditions, significantly outperforming both purely geometric (75.3%) and\nneural (60.2%) methods. This work establishes a new paradigm for agricultural\nrobotics where domain expertise is seamlessly integrated with machine learning\ncapabilities, providing a foundation for fully automated crop monitoring\nsystems."}

Arguably, the simplest way is to just show\nthem-casually capture a human motion video and feed it to humanoids. We\nintroduce VIDEOMIMIC, a real-to-sim-to-real pipeline that mines everyday\nvideos, jointly reconstructs the humans and the environment, and produces\nwhole-body control policies for humanoid robots that perform the corresponding\nskills. We demonstrate the results of our pipeline on real humanoid robots,\nshowing robust, repeatable contextual control such as staircase ascents and\ndescents, sitting and standing from chairs and benches, as well as other\ndynamic whole-body skills-all from a single policy, conditioned on the\nenvironment and global root commands. VIDEOMIMIC offers a scalable path towards\nteaching humanoids to operate in diverse real-world environments."}
