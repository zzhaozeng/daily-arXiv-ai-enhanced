Our approach comprises two key components.\nFirst, Dynamic Token Merging (DToMe) reduces the number of visual token\nembeddings by merging similar tokens based on image complexity, addressing the\ninherent inefficiency of fixed-length outputs in vision transformers. Second,\nVirtual Token Unmerging (VTU) simulates the expected token sequence for large\nlanguage models (LLMs) by efficiently reconstructing the attention dynamics of\na full sequence, thus preserving the downstream performance without additional\nfine-tuning. Unlike previous approaches, our method dynamically adapts token\ncompression to the content of the image and operates completely training-free,\nmaking it readily applicable to most state-of-the-art VLM architectures.\nExtensive experiments on image and video understanding tasks demonstrate that\nDyMU can reduce the average visual token count by 32%-85% while achieving\ncomparable performance to full-length models across diverse VLM architectures,\nincluding the recently popularized AnyRes-based visual encoders. Furthermore,\nthrough qualitative analyses, we demonstrate that DToMe effectively adapts\ntoken reduction based on image complexity and, unlike existing systems,\nprovides users more control over computational costs.

Perspective-taking, the\nability to perceive an environment or situation from an alternative viewpoint,\nis a key benchmark for human-level visual understanding, essential for\nenvironmental interaction and collaboration with autonomous agents. Despite\nadvancements in spatial reasoning within VLMs, recent research has shown that\nmodern VLMs significantly lack perspective-aware reasoning capabilities and\nexhibit a strong bias toward egocentric interpretations. To bridge the gap\nbetween VLMs and human perception, we focus on the role of mental imagery,\nwhere humans perceive the world through abstracted representations that\nfacilitate perspective shifts.

Our experiments on synthetic and real-image\nbenchmarks, compared with various VLMs, demonstrate significant improvements in\nperspective-aware reasoning with our framework, further outperforming\nfine-tuned spatial reasoning models and novel-view-synthesis-based approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fc3\u7406\u610f\u8c61\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff08APC\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u8f6c\u6362\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89d2\u611f\u77e5\u662f\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u5173\u952e\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6b64\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u62bd\u8c61\u89c6\u89d2\u53d8\u6362\uff08APC\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5206\u5272\u548c\u65b9\u5411\u4f30\u8ba1\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u573a\u666f\u62bd\u8c61\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c6\u89d2\u8f6c\u6362\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cAPC\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u89d2\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "APC\u6846\u67b6\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89d2\u611f\u77e5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3a\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\u534f\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

PaperCoder operates in three stages: planning,\nwhere it constructs a high-level roadmap, designs the system architecture with\ndiagrams, identifies file dependencies, and generates configuration files;\nanalysis, which focuses on interpreting implementation-specific details; and\ngeneration, where modular, dependency-aware code is produced. Moreover, each\nphase is instantiated through a set of specialized agents designed to\ncollaborate effectively across the pipeline. We then evaluate PaperCoder on\ngenerating code implementations from machine learning papers based on both\nmodel-based and human evaluations, specifically from the original paper\nauthors, with author-released repositories as ground truth if available. Our\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of PaperCoder in creating high-quality,\nfaithful implementations. Furthermore, it consistently shows strengths in the\nrecently released PaperBench benchmark, surpassing strong baselines by\nsubstantial margins.", "AI": {"tldr": "PaperCoder\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LLM\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u8bba\u6587\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u4ee3\u7801\u4ed3\u5e93\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u5206\u6790\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f80\u5f80\u7f3a\u5931\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u590d\u73b0\u548c\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u5229\u7528LLM\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u79d1\u5b66\u6587\u6863\u548c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4ee3\u7801\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0cPaperCoder\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "PaperCoder\u5206\u4e3a\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u89c4\u5212\uff08\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\uff09\u3001\u5206\u6790\uff08\u89e3\u6790\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u8282\uff09\u548c\u751f\u6210\uff08\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\uff09\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u7531\u4e13\u95e8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u5b8c\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPaperCoder\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4e14\u5fe0\u5b9e\u4e8e\u539f\u6587\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5728PaperBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "PaperCoder\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u8bba\u6587\u4ee3\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u7f3a\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose an effective learnable adaptive neural\nnetwork quantization method, called Adaptive Step Size Quantization (ASQ), to\nresolve this conflict. Specifically, the proposed ASQ method first dynamically\nadjusts quantization scaling factors through a trained module capable of\naccommodating different activations. Then, to address the rigid resolution\nissue inherent in Power of Two (POT) quantization, we propose an efficient\nnon-uniform quantization scheme. We utilize the Power Of Square root of Two\n(POST) as the basis for exponential quantization, effectively handling the\nbell-shaped distribution of neural network weights across various bit-widths\nwhile maintaining computational efficiency through a Look-Up Table method\n(LUT). Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ASQ method\nis superior to the state-of-the-art QAT approaches. Notably that the ASQ is\neven competitive compared to full precision baselines, with its 4-bit quantized\nResNet34 model improving accuracy by 1.2\\% on ImageNet.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6b65\u957f\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08ASQ\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u91cf\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u975e\u5747\u5300\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08QAT\uff09\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08QAT\uff09\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u4f1a\u727a\u7272\u63a8\u7406\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5904\u7406\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u503c\u65f6\u3002", "method": "ASQ\u65b9\u6cd5\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u91cf\u5316\u7f29\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e73\u65b9\u6839\u4e8c\u7684\u6307\u6570\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff08POST\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u67e5\u627e\u8868\uff08LUT\uff09\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "ASQ\u57284\u4f4d\u91cf\u5316ResNet34\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cImageNet\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53471.2%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709QAT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u63a5\u8fd1\u5168\u7cbe\u5ea6\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "ASQ\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86QAT\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Existing\nmethods struggle to generate high-quality and temporally consistent results\nwhen handling complex clothing patterns and diverse body poses. We present\n3DV-TON, a novel diffusion-based framework for generating high-fidelity and\ntemporally consistent video try-on results. Our approach employs generated\nanimatable textured 3D meshes as explicit frame-level guidance, alleviating the\nissue of models over-focusing on appearance fidelity at the expanse of motion\ncoherence. This is achieved by enabling direct reference to consistent garment\ntexture movements throughout video sequences. The proposed method features an\nadaptive pipeline for generating dynamic 3D guidance: (1) selecting a keyframe\nfor initial 2D image try-on, followed by (2) reconstructing and animating a\ntextured 3D mesh synchronized with original video poses. We further introduce a\nrobust rectangular masking strategy that successfully mitigates artifact\npropagation caused by leaking clothing information during dynamic human and\ngarment movements.

Each iteration improves both the predictive model\nand the optimized motion trajectory, creating a virtuous cycle that bootstraps\nits own training data to learn about the pose configurations of an object.

Our evaluation focuses on the extent to which LLMs ground\ntheir programs to math rules, and how that affects their end performance. For\nthis purpose, we assess the generations of five different LLMs, on two\ndifferent math datasets, both manually and automatically. Our results reveal\nthat the distribution of grounding depends on LLMs' capabilities and the\ndifficulty of math problems. Furthermore, mathematical grounding is more\neffective for closed-source models, while open-source models fail to employ\nmath rules in their solutions correctly. On MATH500, the percentage of grounded\nprograms decreased to half, while the ungrounded generations doubled in\ncomparison to ASDiv grade-school problems. Our work highlights the need for\nin-depth evaluation beyond execution accuracy metrics, toward a better\nunderstanding of code-assisted LLMs' capabilities and limits in the math\ndomain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u8f85\u52a9LLMs\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u8868\u73b0\u53d7\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u96be\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u6267\u884c\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u4e94\u79cdLLMs\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u751f\u6210\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8fdb\u884c\u624b\u52a8\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8\u5176\u6570\u5b66\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u8fd0\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u5b66\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5ea6\u56e0\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u96be\u5ea6\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8d85\u8d8a\u6267\u884c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u6df1\u5165\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee3\u7801\u8f85\u52a9LLMs\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9650\u5236\u3002"}}

Recent\nworks extend these models to long inputs, including multi-page documents and\nlong videos. However, the model size and performance of these long context\nmodels are still limited due to the computational cost in both training and\ninference. In this work, we explore an orthogonal direction and process long\ninputs without long context LMMs. We propose Frame Selection Augmented\nGeneration (FRAG), where the model first selects relevant frames within the\ninput, and then only generates the final outputs based on the selected frames.\nThe core of the selection process is done by scoring each frame independently,\nwhich does not require long context processing. The frames with the highest\nscores are then selected by a simple Top-K selection. We show that this\nfrustratingly simple framework is applicable to both long videos and multi-page\ndocuments using existing LMMs without any fine-tuning. We consider two models,\nLLaVA-OneVision and InternVL2, in our experiments and show that FRAG\nconsistently improves the performance and achieves state-of-the-art\nperformances for both long video and long document understanding. For videos,\nFRAG substantially improves InternVL2-76B by 5.8% on MLVU and 3.7% on\nVideo-MME.

However, some correctly labeled samples are\ninherently difficult for the model to learn and can exhibit high loss similar\nto mislabeled samples in the early stages of training. Consequently, setting a\nthreshold on per-sample loss to select correct labels results in a trade-off\nbetween precision and recall in sample selection: a lower threshold may miss\nmany correctly labeled hard-to-learn samples (low recall), while a higher\nthreshold may include many mislabeled samples (low precision). To address this\nissue, our goal is to accurately distinguish correctly labeled yet\nhard-to-learn samples from mislabeled ones, thus alleviating the trade-off\ndilemma.

The success of Mamba is primarily owing to its ability to capture\nlong-range dependencies while keeping linear complexity with input sequence\nlength, making it a promising alternative to CNNs and ViTs. Inspired by the\nsuccess, in the paper, we explore the potential of the Mamba architecture to\naddress distribution shifts in DG for medical image segmentation. Specifically,\nwe propose a novel Mamba-based framework, Mamba-Sea, incorporating\nglobal-to-local sequence augmentation to improve the model's generalizability\nunder domain shift issues. Our Mamba-Sea introduces a global augmentation\nmechanism designed to simulate potential variations in appearance across\ndifferent sites, aiming to suppress the model's learning of domain-specific\ninformation. At the local level, we propose a sequence-wise augmentation along\ninput sequences, which perturbs the style of tokens within random continuous\nsub-sequences by modeling and resampling style statistics associated with\ndomain shifts. To our best knowledge, Mamba-Sea is the first work to explore\nthe generalization of Mamba for medical image segmentation, providing an\nadvanced and promising Mamba-based architecture with strong robustness to\ndomain shifts. Remarkably, our proposed method is the first to surpass a Dice\ncoefficient of 90% on the Prostate dataset, which exceeds previous SOTA of\n88.61%.

Traditional methods primarily utilize information from adjacent\npixels for reconstructing missing areas, while they struggle to preserve\ncomplex details and structures. Simultaneously, models based on deep learning\nnecessitate substantial amounts of training data. To address this challenge, an\nencoding strategy-inspired diffusion model with few-shot learning for color\nimage inpainting is proposed in this paper. The main idea of this novel\nencoding strategy is the deployment of a \"virtual mask\" to construct\nhigh-dimensional objects through mutual perturbations between channels.

Inspired by the\nclassical Gold-Angluin framework for language identification and its recent\nadaptation to language generation by Kleinberg and Mullainathan, we investigate\nwhether an algorithm, trained on examples drawn from an unknown target language\n$K$ (selected from a countable collection) and given access to an LLM, can\nreliably determine whether the LLM's outputs are correct or constitute\nhallucinations.\n  First, we establish an equivalence between hallucination detection and the\nclassical task of language identification. We prove that any hallucination\ndetection method can be converted into a language identification method, and\nconversely, algorithms solving language identification can be adapted for\nhallucination detection. Given the inherent difficulty of language\nidentification, this implies that hallucination detection is fundamentally\nimpossible for most language collections if the detector is trained using only\ncorrect examples from the target language.\n  Second, we show that the use of expert-labeled feedback, i.e., training the\ndetector with both positive examples (correct statements) and negative examples\n(explicitly labeled incorrect statements), dramatically changes this\nconclusion. Under this enriched training regime, automated hallucination\ndetection becomes possible for all countable language collections.\n  These results highlight the essential role of expert-labeled examples in\ntraining hallucination detectors and provide theoretical support for\nfeedback-based methods, such as reinforcement learning with human feedback\n(RLHF), which have proven critical for reliable LLM deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6b63\u786e\u6837\u672c\u8bad\u7ec3\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u65f6\uff0c\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u57fa\u672c\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\uff1b\u4f46\u52a0\u5165\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u540e\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u53d8\u5f97\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4bLLM\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u9760\u90e8\u7f72LLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eGold-Angluin\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u7b49\u4ef7\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff08\u4ec5\u6b63\u786e\u6837\u672c vs. \u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u6b63\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\uff09\u5bf9\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u4ec5\u7528\u6b63\u786e\u6837\u672c\u65f6\uff0c\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\uff1b\u52a0\u5165\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u540e\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u6570\u8bed\u8a00\u96c6\u5408\u5747\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u5bf9\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982RLHF\uff09\u3002"}}

However, we observe that RGB images\noften lead to conflicting training objectives and lack the necessary clarity\nfor geometry reconstruction. In this paper, we revisit the inductive biases\nassociated with mesh reconstruction and introduce DiMeR, a novel disentangled\ndual-stream feed-forward model for sparse-view mesh reconstruction. The key\nidea is to disentangle both the input and framework into geometry and texture\nparts, thereby reducing the training difficulty for each part according to the\nPrinciple of Occam's Razor. Given that normal maps are strictly consistent with\ngeometry and accurately capture surface variations, we utilize normal maps as\nexclusive input for the geometry branch to reduce the complexity between the\nnetwork's input and output.

Thus, past work requires controlled settings such\nas known object shapes and contacts, and tackles only limited object classes.\nInstead, we need methods that generalize to natural images and novel object\nclasses. We tackle this in two main ways: (1) We collect PICO-db, a new dataset\nof natural images uniquely paired with dense 3D contact on both body and object\nmeshes. To this end, we use images from the recent DAMON dataset that are\npaired with contacts, but these contacts are only annotated on a canonical 3D\nbody. In contrast, we seek contact labels on both the body and the object. To\ninfer these given an image, we retrieve an appropriate 3D object mesh from a\ndatabase by leveraging vision foundation models. Then, we project DAMON's body\ncontact patches onto the object via a novel method needing only 2 clicks per\npatch. This minimal human input establishes rich contact correspondences\nbetween bodies and objects. (2) We exploit our new dataset of contact\ncorrespondences in a novel render-and-compare fitting method, called PICO-fit,\nto recover 3D body and object meshes in interaction. PICO-fit infers contact\nfor the SMPL-X body, retrieves a likely 3D object mesh and contact from PICO-db\nfor that object, and uses the contact to iteratively fit the 3D body and object\nmeshes to image evidence via optimization. Uniquely, PICO-fit works well for\nmany object categories that no existing method can tackle. This is crucial to\nenable HOI understanding to scale in the wild.

Existing approaches typically rely on\nDegradation-specific models or coarse-grained degradation prompts to guide\nimage restoration. However, they lack fine-grained modeling of degradation\ninformation and face limitations in balancing multi-task conflicts. To overcome\nthese limitations, we propose DPMambaIR, a novel All-in-One image restoration\nframework. By integrating a Degradation-Aware Prompt State Space Model (DP-SSM)\nand a High-Frequency Enhancement Block (HEB), DPMambaIR enables fine-grained\nmodeling of complex degradation information and efficient global integration,\nwhile mitigating the loss of high-frequency details caused by task competition.\nSpecifically, the DP-SSM utilizes a pre-trained degradation extractor to\ncapture fine-grained degradation features and dynamically incorporates them\ninto the state space modeling process, enhancing the model's adaptability to\ndiverse degradation types.

Leveraging this, we consider two key\noperations: token-shuffle, which merges spatially local tokens along channel\ndimension to decrease the input token number, and token-unshuffle, which\nuntangles the inferred tokens after Transformer blocks to restore the spatial\narrangement for output. Jointly training with textual prompts, our strategy\nrequires no additional pretrained text-encoder and enables MLLMs to support\nextremely high-resolution image synthesis in a unified next-token prediction\nway while maintaining efficient training and inference. For the first time, we\npush the boundary of AR text-to-image generation to a resolution of 2048x2048\nwith gratifying generation performance. In GenAI-benchmark, our 2.7B model\nachieves 0.77 overall score on hard prompts, outperforming AR models LlamaGen\nby 0.18 and diffusion models LDM by 0.15. Exhaustive large-scale human\nevaluations also demonstrate our prominent image generation ability in terms of\ntext-alignment, visual flaw, and visual appearance. We hope that Token-Shuffle\ncan serve as a foundational design for efficient high-resolution image\ngeneration within MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Token-Shuffle\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11Transformer\u4e2d\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b02048x2048\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u4e2d\u56e0\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u91cf\u591a\u800c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0cToken-Shuffle\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u53ca\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faToken-Shuffle\u548cToken-Unshuffle\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u5e76\u548c\u6062\u590d\u56fe\u50cf\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8f93\u5165\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728GenAI-benchmark\u4e2d\uff0c2.7B\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u5f97\u52060.77\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eLlamaGen\u548cLDM\uff0c\u652f\u63012048x2048\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u751f\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "Token-Shuffle\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

By leveraging OUI as a reliable indicator, we can\ndetermine early in training whether the chosen WD value leads the model to\nunderfit the training data, overfit, or strike a well-balanced trade-off that\nmaximizes validation scores. This enables more precise WD tuning for optimal\nperformance on the tested datasets and DNNs.

This setup allows us to systematically examine how\ncalibration choices influence the trade-off between reliability and efficiency.\nOur findings demonstrate that even with relatively small labeled samples and\nsimple nonconformity scores, conformal prediction can yield valuable\nuncertainty estimates for complex tasks.

These forces scale\nwith plasma current and magnetic field strength, making disruptions one of the\nkey challenges for future devices. Unfortunately, disruptions are not fully\nunderstood, with many different underlying causes that are difficult to\nanticipate. Data-driven models have shown success in predicting them, but they\nonly provide limited interpretability. On the other hand, large-scale\nstatistical analyses have been a great asset to understanding disruptive\npatterns. In this paper, we leverage data-driven methods to find an\ninterpretable representation of the plasma state for disruption\ncharacterization. Specifically, we use a latent variable model to represent\ndiagnostic measurements as a low-dimensional, latent representation. We build\nupon the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework, and extend it for (1)\ncontinuous projections of plasma trajectories; (2) a multimodal structure to\nseparate operating regimes; and (3) separation with respect to disruptive\nregimes. Subsequently, we can identify continuous indicators for the disruption\nrate and the disruptivity based on statistical properties of measurement data.\nThe proposed method is demonstrated using a dataset of approximately 1600 TCV\ndischarges, selecting for flat-top disruptions or regular terminations. We\nevaluate the method with respect to (1) the identified disruption risk and its\ncorrelation with other plasma properties; (2) the ability to distinguish\ndifferent types of disruptions; and (3) downstream analyses. For the latter, we\nconduct a demonstrative study on identifying parameters connected to\ndisruptions using counterfactual-like analysis. Overall, the method can\nadequately identify distinct operating regimes characterized by varying\nproximity to disruptions in an interpretable manner.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08VAE\uff09\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8868\u5f81\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u533a\u5206\u6258\u5361\u9a6c\u514b\u4e2d\u7684\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u7834\u88c2\u3002", "motivation": "\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u7834\u88c2\u662f\u6258\u5361\u9a6c\u514b\u672a\u6765\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u5bf9\u5176\u7406\u89e3\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86VAE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u6295\u5f71\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u8f68\u8ff9\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u79bb\u64cd\u4f5c\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u533a\u5206\u7834\u88c2\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ea61600\u6b21TCV\u653e\u7535\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u540c\u64cd\u4f5c\u533a\u57df\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u7834\u88c2\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4ee5\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u63a5\u8fd1\u7834\u88c2\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u64cd\u4f5c\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u540e\u7eed\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}
