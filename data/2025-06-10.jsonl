Significant efforts have been\ndedicated to advancing such a system identification problem in this area.\nPrevious methods often rely on heavy optimization pipelines with a\ndifferentiable simulator and renderer to estimate physical parameters. However,\nthese approaches frequently necessitate extensive hyperparameter tuning for\neach scene and involve a costly optimization process, which limits both their\npracticality and generalizability. In this work, we propose a novel framework,\nVid2Sim, a generalizable video-based approach for recovering geometry and\nphysical properties through a mesh-free reduced simulation based on Linear\nBlend Skinning (LBS), offering high computational efficiency and versatile\nrepresentation capability. Specifically, Vid2Sim first reconstructs the\nobserved configuration of the physical system from video using a feed-forward\nneural network trained to capture physical world knowledge. A lightweight\noptimization pipeline then refines the estimated appearance, geometry, and\nphysical properties to closely align with video observations within just a few\nminutes.

Existing methods mainly focus on 3D surface reconstruction or local\ngeometric feature extraction of targets, neglecting the role of structural\nmodeling in capturing semantic information. This paper proposes a novel task:\nSAR target structure recovery, which aims to infer the components of a target\nand the structural relationships between its components, specifically symmetry\nand adjacency, from a single-view SAR image. Through learning the structural\nconsistency and geometric diversity across the same type of targets as observed\nin different SAR images, it aims to derive the semantic representation of\ntarget directly from its 2D SAR image. To solve this challenging task, a\ntwo-step algorithmic framework based on structural descriptors is developed.\nSpecifically, in the training phase, it first detects 2D keypoints from real\nSAR images, and then learns the mapping from these keypoints to 3D hierarchical\nstructures using simulated data. During the testing phase, these two steps are\nintegrated to infer the 3D structure from real SAR images.

Prior\nmethods, which mainly focus on training domain-specific models on numerical\ndata, lack the visual-temporal reasoning capacity that human experts have to\nidentify contextual anomalies. To fill this gap, we explore a solution based on\nvision language models (VLMs). Recent studies have shown the ability of VLMs\nfor visual reasoning tasks, yet their direct application to time series has\nfallen short on both accuracy and efficiency. To harness the power of VLMs for\nTSAD, we propose a two-stage solution, with (1) ViT4TS, a vision-screening\nstage built on a relatively lightweight pretrained vision encoder, which\nleverages 2-D time-series representations to accurately localize candidate\nanomalies; (2) VLM4TS, a VLM-based stage that integrates global temporal\ncontext and VLM reasoning capacity to refine the detection upon the candidates\nprovided by ViT4TS. We show that without any time-series training, VLM4TS\noutperforms time-series pretrained and from-scratch baselines in most cases,\nyielding a 24.6 percent improvement in F1-max score over the best baseline.\nMoreover, VLM4TS also consistently outperforms existing language-model-based\nTSAD methods and is on average 36 times more efficient in token usage."}

A conditional diffusion decoder then reconstructs\nvideos by combining hierarchical global and detailed motions, enabling\nhigh-fidelity video reconstructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nHi-VAE achieves a high compression factor of 1428$\\times$, almost 30$\\times$\nhigher than baseline methods (e.g., Cosmos-VAE at 48$\\times$), validating the\nefficiency of our approach. Meanwhile, Hi-VAE maintains high reconstruction\nquality at such high compression rates and performs effectively in downstream\ngenerative tasks. Moreover, Hi-VAE exhibits interpretability and scalability,\nproviding new perspectives for future exploration in video latent\nrepresentation and generation."}

Motivated by these limitations, we investigate how LLMs\nperform when exposed to temporal text corpora, or documents that reflect\nevolving knowledge over time, such as sports biographies where facts like a\nplayer's \"current team\" change year by year. To this end, we introduce two new\nbenchmarks: Temporal Wiki, which captures factual drift across historical\nWikipedia snapshots, and Unified Clark, which aggregates timestamped news\narticles to simulate real-world information accumulation. Our analysis reveals\nthat LLMs often struggle to reconcile conflicting or outdated facts and can be\nmisled when multiple versions of a fact appear in context.

Relying on manual delineation introduces\nsignificant errors and is time-consuming. However, existing segmentation models\nare designed based on objects in natural scenes, making them difficult to adapt\nto ultrasound objects with high noise and high similarity. This is particularly\nevident in small object segmentation, where a pronounced jagged effect occurs.\nTherefore, this paper proposes a fetal femur and cranial ultrasound image\nsegmentation model based on feature perception and Mamba enhancement to address\nthese challenges. Specifically, a longitudinal and transverse independent\nviewpoint scanning convolution block and a feature perception module were\ndesigned to enhance the ability to capture local detail information and improve\nthe fusion of contextual information. Combined with the Mamba-optimized\nresidual structure, this design suppresses the interference of raw noise and\nenhances local multi-dimensional scanning.

Existing approaches, such as quantization, have demonstrated\npromising results in reducing memory usage. However, current quantization\nmethods cannot take both effectiveness and efficiency into account. In this\npaper, we propose MoQAE, a novel mixed-precision quantization method via\nmixture of quantization-aware experts. First, we view different quantization\nbit-width configurations as experts and use the traditional mixture of experts\n(MoE) method to select the optimal configuration. To avoid the inefficiency\ncaused by inputting tokens one by one into the router in the traditional MoE\nmethod, we input the tokens into the router chunk by chunk. Second, we design a\nlightweight router-only fine-tuning process to train MoQAE with a comprehensive\nloss to learn the trade-off between model accuracy and memory usage. Finally,\nwe introduce a routing freezing (RF) and a routing sharing (RS) mechanism to\nfurther reduce the inference overhead.

The key idea is to shift\nthe challenge of DP image synthesis from the image domain to the text domain by\nleveraging state of the art DP text generation methods.

Given a\nprivate dataset, SPTI produces synthetic images of substantially higher quality\nthan prior DP approaches. On the LSUN Bedroom dataset, SPTI attains an FID less\nthan or equal to 26.71 under epsilon equal to 1.0, improving over Private\nEvolution FID of 40.36.

Existing deep learning models often struggle to\nachieve the requisite localization accuracy for microscopic targets like\npollen, which are characterized by their minute size, indistinct edges, and\ncomplex backgrounds. To overcome this limitation, we introduce HieraEdgeNet, a\nmulti-scale edge-enhancement framework. The framework's core innovation is the\nintroduction of three synergistic modules: the Hierarchical Edge Module (HEM),\nwhich explicitly extracts a multi-scale pyramid of edge features that\ncorresponds to the semantic hierarchy at early network stages; the Synergistic\nEdge Fusion (SEF) module, for deeply fusing these edge priors with semantic\ninformation at each respective scale; and the Cross Stage Partial Omni-Kernel\nModule (CSPOKM), which maximally refines the most detail-rich feature layers\nusing an Omni-Kernel operator - comprising anisotropic large-kernel\nconvolutions and mixed-domain attention - all within a computationally\nefficient Cross-Stage Partial (CSP) framework. On a large-scale dataset\ncomprising 120 pollen classes, HieraEdgeNet achieves a mean Average Precision\n(mAP@.5) of 0.9501, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baseline\nmodels such as YOLOv12n and RT-DETR.

A prevalent solution is a dual-system\narchitecture, employing a small model for rapid, reactive decisions and a\nlarger model for slower but more informative analyses.

To achieve the shifting, we\nintroduce Efficiency through Thinking Ahead (ETA), an asynchronous system\ndesigned to: (1) propagate informative features from the past to the current\nframe using future predictions from the large model, (2) extract current frame\nfeatures using a small model for real-time responsiveness, and (3) integrate\nthese dual features via an action mask mechanism that emphasizes\naction-critical image regions.

Despite its impressive\nalgorithmic performance, real-time rendering on resource-constrained devices\nremains a major challenge due to tight power and area budgets. This paper\npresents an architecture-algorithm co-design to address these inefficiencies.\nFirst, we reveal substantial redundancy caused by repeated computation of\ncommon terms/expressions during the conventional rasterization. To resolve\nthis, we propose axis-oriented rasterization, which pre-computes and reuses\nshared terms along both the X and Y axes through a dedicated hardware design,\neffectively reducing multiply-and-add (MAC) operations by up to 63%. Second, by\nidentifying the resource and performance inefficiency of the sorting process,\nwe introduce a novel neural sorting approach that predicts order-independent\nblending weights using an efficient neural network, eliminating the need for\ncostly hardware sorters.
