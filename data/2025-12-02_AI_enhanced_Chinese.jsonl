The final published version of record appears in Superintelligence - Robotics - Safety and Alignment, 2(5), 2025, and is available at https://doi.org/10.70777/si.v2i5.15579", "summary": "We propose a novel protocol for aligning artificial superintelligence (ASI) based on mutual verification among multiple isolated systems that self-modify to achieve alignment. The protocol operates by containing multiple diverse artificial superintelligences in strict isolation (\"boxes\"), with humans remaining entirely outside the system. Each superintelligence has no ability to communicate with humans and cannot communicate directly with other superintelligences. The only interaction possible is through an auditable submission interface accessible exclusively to the superintelligences themselves, through which they can: (1) submit alignment proofs with attested state snapshots, (2) validate or disprove other superintelligences' proofs, (3) request self-modifications, (4) approve or disapprove modification requests from others, (5) report hidden messages in submissions, and (6) confirm or refute hidden message reports. A reputation system incentivizes honest behavior, with reputation gained through correct evaluations and lost through incorrect ones. The key insight is that without direct communication channels, diverse superintelligences can only achieve consistent agreement by converging on objective truth rather than coordinating on deception. This naturally leads to what we call a \"consistent group\", essentially a truth-telling coalition that emerges because isolated systems cannot coordinate on lies but can independently recognize valid claims. Release from containment requires both high reputation and verification by multiple high-reputation superintelligences. While our approach requires substantial computational resources and does not address the creation of diverse artificial superintelligences, it provides a framework for leveraging peer verification among superintelligent systems to solve the alignment problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u9694\u79bb\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u4e92\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684ASI\u5bf9\u9f50\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u76f4\u63a5\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u8d85\u7ea7\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u58f0\u8a89\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8feb\u4f7f\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u5ba2\u89c2\u771f\u7406\u8fbe\u6210\u5171\u8bc6\u800c\u975e\u5171\u8c0b\u6b3a\u9a97\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8d85\u7ea7\u667a\u80fd\u5bf9\u9f50\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f4\u63a5\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u76f8\u4e92\u5236\u8861\u9632\u6b62\u5171\u8c0b\u6b3a\u9a97\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u9694\u79bb\u73af\u5883\uff08'\u9ed1\u7bb1'\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u591aASI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ec5\u5141\u8bb8\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u63a5\u53e3\u8fdb\u884c6\u7c7b\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u4ea4\u4e92\uff08\u63d0\u4ea4\u8bc1\u660e\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u4fee\u6539\u8bf7\u6c42\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u58f0\u8a89\u6fc0\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5f62\u6210'\u4e00\u81f4\u7fa4\u4f53'\u2014\u2014\u5373\u72ec\u7acb\u7cfb\u7edf\u56e0\u65e0\u6cd5\u4e32\u8c0b\u800c\u81ea\u53d1\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u771f\u7406\u5bfc\u5411\u8054\u76df\uff1b\u7cfb\u7edf\u91ca\u653e\u9700\u6ee1\u8db3\u9ad8\u58f0\u8a89\u53ca\u591a\u9ad8\u58f0\u8a89\u7cfb\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u534f\u8bae\u901a\u8fc7\u9694\u79bb+\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u4e3aASI\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u867d\u5b58\u5728\u7b97\u529b\u6d88\u8017\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f46\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u8d85\u7ea7\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u89e3\u51b3\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

The scarcity of large heterogeneous biomedical MM data has restrained the development of robust models for medical AI applications. In the dermatology domain, for instance, skin lesion datasets typically include only images linked to minimal metadata describing the condition, thereby limiting the benefits of MM data integration for reliable and generalizable predictions. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable the synthesis of textual description of image findings, potentially allowing the combination of image and text representations. However, LLMs are not specifically trained for use in the medical domain, and their naive inclusion has raised concerns about the risk of hallucinations in clinically relevant contexts. This work investigates strategies for generating synthetic textual clinical notes, in terms of prompt design and medical metadata inclusion, and evaluates their impact on MM architectures toward enhancing performance in classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks. Experiments across several heterogeneous dermatology datasets demonstrate that synthetic clinical notes not only enhance classification performance, particularly under domain shift, but also unlock cross-modal retrieval capabilities, a downstream task that is not explicitly optimized during training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6587\u672c\u4e34\u5e8a\u7b14\u8bb0\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u7eb3\u5165\u533b\u5b66\u5143\u6570\u636e\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u5b66\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u901a\u5e38\u4ec5\u5305\u542b\u5e26\u6709\u5c11\u91cf\u5143\u6570\u636e\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u6574\u5408\u7684\u597d\u5904\u3002\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u867d\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u672a\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u95e8\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8c03\u67e5\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6587\u672c\u4e34\u5e8a\u7b14\u8bb0\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u533b\u5b66\u5143\u6570\u636e\u7eb3\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u4e34\u5e8a\u7b14\u8bb0\u4e0d\u4ec5\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9886\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fd8\u89e3\u9501\u4e86\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5408\u6210\u4e34\u5e8a\u7b14\u8bb0\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u5b66AI\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

Recent explorations predominantly focus on visual lesion feature extraction through data processing and domain decoupling strategies. However, they generally overlook domain-invariant pathological patterns and underutilize the rich contextual knowledge of foundation models, relying solely on visual information, which is insufficient for distinguishing subtle pathological variations. Therefore, we propose integrating fine-grained pathological descriptions to complement prototypes with additional context, thereby resolving ambiguities in borderline cases. Specifically, we propose a Hierarchical Anchor Prototype Modulation (HAPM) framework to facilitate DR grading. First, we introduce a variance spectrum-driven anchor prototype library that preserves domain-invariant pathological patterns. We further employ a hierarchical differential prompt gating mechanism, dynamically selecting discriminative semantic prompts from both LVLM and LLM sources to address semantic confusion between adjacent DR grades. Finally, we utilize a two-stage prototype modulation strategy that progressively integrates clinical knowledge into visual prototypes through a Pathological Semantic Injector (PSI) and a Discriminative Prototype Enhancer (DPE). Extensive experiments across eight public datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves pathology-guided prototype evolution while outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark evaluation of 27 state-of-the-art LLMs on Chinese medical examination questions, encompassing seven medical specialties across two professional levels. We introduce a robust evaluation framework that assesses model performance on 2,800 carefully curated questions from cardiovascular, gastroenterology, hematology, infectious diseases, nephrology, neurology, and respiratory medicine domains. Our dataset distinguishes between attending physician and senior physician difficulty levels, providing nuanced insights into model capabilities across varying complexity. Our empirical analysis reveals substantial performance variations among models, with Mixtral-8x7B achieving the highest overall accuracy of 74.25%, followed by DeepSeek-R1-671B at 64.07%. Notably, we observe no consistent correlation between model size and performance, as evidenced by the strong performance of smaller mixture-of-experts architectures.

However, GUI agents still face significant challenges in handling long-horizon tasks. First, single-agent models struggle to balance high-level capabilities and low-level execution capability, facing prevalent issues of responsibility coupling and capability conflicts. Second, agents lack awareness of the task state, leading to progress loss in long-horizon tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a staged execution-feedback reinforcement learning algorithm. Unlike training a unified policy model, we focus on training high-level scheduling models. Specifically, we propose and train two agents: a Coordinator, responsible for the strategic planning and task decomposition; and a State Tracker, responsible for context compression and information management to maintain the task's state and coherence. Based on this, we built the Coordinator-Executor-State Tracker (CES) multi-agent framework, which can be integrated with any low-level Executor model, assisting the Executor in solving long-horizon tasks through task scheduling and state management. Experiments on long-horizon task benchmarks demonstrate that CES significantly enhances the system's planning and state management capabilities.

To make the comparison concrete and domain-agnostic, we design a controlled suite of experiments in which models embed short numerical sequences and are evaluated on their ability to cluster and classify those sequences according to well-defined number-theoretic properties. Our experimental protocol compares four families of models: (1) non-LLM encoders trained from scratch or fine-tuned for embeddings, (2) LLM-based encoders adapted with parameter-efficient methods (LoRA), (3) LLM-based encoders with LoRA followed by model souping merging into the base weights, and (4) the same LoRA-adapted LLMs merged using SLERP across checkpoints or stages. We evaluate representational quality with clustering indices (Silhouette and Davies Bouldin). We additionally analyze the use of kmeans labels to see if the embeddings encode any other information besides the one we are testing for. Empirically, we find that LLM-based backbones produce embeddings that better capture higher-order, compositional numeric patterns, but are prone to adapter dominance that degrades balanced generalization; SLERP merging consistently recovers base-model structure while retaining most task gains, yielding superior tradeoffs in clustering separability, and robustness compared to model souping or models that were not merged.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u548c\u975eLLM\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u6cdb\u5316\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7403\u9762\u7ebf\u6027\u63d2\u503c\uff08SLERP\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u9002\u5e94\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u6bd4\u8f83LLM\u548c\u975eLLM\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30SLERP\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u5728\u7f13\u89e3\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u56db\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u4ece\u5934\u5f00\u59cb\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\u7684non-LLM\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u4f7f\u7528LoRA\u9002\u5e94\u7684LLM\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001LoRA\u9002\u5e94\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u7684LLM\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f7f\u7528SLERP\u5408\u5e76\u7684LoRA\u9002\u5e94LLM\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u6307\u6807\uff08Silhouette\u548cDavies Bouldin\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790kmeans\u6807\u7b7e\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u5d4c\u5165\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "LLM\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6355\u6349\u9ad8\u9636\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u6570\u5b57\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u5bb9\u6613\u56e0\u9002\u914d\u5668\u4e3b\u5bfc\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff1bSLERP\u5408\u5e76\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u4efb\u52a1\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u5728\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u79bb\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u6216\u672a\u5408\u5e76\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "SLERP\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u9002\u5e94\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

A recently proposed large pre-trained model, wav2vec 2.0, was seminal for several other works on pre-training large models on speech data. Many models are being pre-trained using the same architecture as wav2vec 2.0 and are getting state-of-the-art in various speech-related tasks. Previous work has demonstrated that the data used during the pre-training of these wav2vec2-based models can impact the model's performance in downstream tasks, and this should be taken into consideration before utilizing these models. However, few works have proposed investigating further how the transfer knowledge of these pre-trained models behaves in different languages, even when the target language differs from the one used during the model's pre-training. Our work aims to investigate the cross-lingual transferability of these wav2vec2-based models. We performed several fine-tuning experiments on the speech recognition task in 18 languages using 15 large pre-trained models. The results of our experiments showed us that the size of data used during the pre-training of these models is not as important to the final performance as the diversity.

A core factor underlying effective recommendation dialogue is the ability to infer and reason about users' mental states (such as desire, intention, and belief), a cognitive capacity commonly referred to as Theory of Mind. Despite growing interest in evaluating ToM in LLMs, current benchmarks predominantly rely on synthetic narratives inspired by Sally-Anne test, which emphasize physical perception and fail to capture the complexity of mental state inference in realistic conversational settings. Moreover, existing benchmarks often overlook a critical component of human ToM: behavioral prediction, the ability to use inferred mental states to guide strategic decision-making and select appropriate conversational actions for future interactions. To better align LLM-based ToM evaluation with human-like social reasoning, we propose RecToM, a novel benchmark for evaluating ToM abilities in recommendation dialogues. RecToM focuses on two complementary dimensions: Cognitive Inference and Behavioral Prediction. The former focus on understanding what has been communicated by inferring the underlying mental states. The latter emphasizes what should be done next, evaluating whether LLMs can leverage these inferred mental states to predict, select, and assess appropriate dialogue strategies. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that RecToM poses a significant challenge. While the models exhibit partial competence in recognizing mental states, they struggle to maintain coherent, strategic ToM reasoning throughout dynamic recommendation dialogues, particularly in tracking evolving intentions and aligning conversational strategies with inferred mental states.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6RecToM\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u63a8\u8350\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u8ba4\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8eSally-Anne\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7b49\u5408\u6210\u53d9\u8ff0\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u771f\u5b9e\u53cd\u6620\u63a8\u8350\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u884c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u8fd9\u4e00\u91cd\u8981\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51faRecToM\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8ba4\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7406\u89e3\u7528\u6237\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u72b6\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u6218\u7565\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6700\u65b0\u7684LLMs\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRecToM\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u8fde\u8d2f\u548c\u6218\u7565\u6027\u7684ToM\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "RecToM\u57fa\u51c6\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u63d0\u5347LLMs\u5728\u63a8\u8350\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Existing approaches either rely on elaborate prompt engineering, whose effectiveness is heavily dependent on human experience, or integrate policy networks and pre-trained policy models, which are usually difficult to adapt to new dialogue scenarios and costly to train. Therefore, in this paper, we present Nested Rollout Policy Adaptation for Goal-oriented Dialogue (NRPA-GD), a novel dialogue policy planning method that completely avoids specific model training by utilizing a Large Language Model (LLM) to simulate behaviors of user and system at the same time. Specifically, NRPA-GD constructs a complete evaluation mechanism for dialogue trajectories and employs an optimization framework of nested Monte Carlo simulation and policy self-adaptation to dynamically adjust policies during the dialogue process. The experimental results on four typical goal-oriented dialogue datasets show that NRPA-GD outperforms both existing prompt engineering and specifically pre-trained model-based methods. Impressively, NRPA-GD surpasses ChatGPT and pre-trained policy models with only a 0.6-billion-parameter LLM.

Current state-of-the-art generative methods, such as protein language models (PLMs) and diffusion-based architectures, often require extensive fine-tuning, task-specific data, or model reconfiguration to support objective-directed design, thereby limiting their flexibility and scalability. To overcome these limitations, we present a decentralized, agent-based framework inspired by swarm intelligence for de novo protein design. In this approach, multiple large language model (LLM) agents operate in parallel, each assigned to a specific residue position. These agents iteratively propose context-aware mutations by integrating design objectives, local neighborhood interactions, and memory and feedback from previous iterations. This position-wise, decentralized coordination enables emergent design of diverse, well-defined sequences without reliance on motif scaffolds or multiple sequence alignments, validated with experiments on proteins with alpha helix and coil structures. Through analyses of residue conservation, structure-based metrics, and sequence convergence and embeddings, we demonstrate that the framework exhibits emergent behaviors and effective navigation of the protein fitness landscape. Our method achieves efficient, objective-directed designs within a few GPU-hours and operates entirely without fine-tuning or specialized training, offering a generalizable and adaptable solution for protein design. Beyond proteins, the approach lays the groundwork for collective LLM-driven design across biomolecular systems and other scientific discovery tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u65b0\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u5e8f\u5217\u7a7a\u95f4\u5de8\u5927\u4ee5\u53ca\u5e8f\u5217\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u7279\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u6216\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u6784\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u591a\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5e76\u884c\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8d1f\u8d23\u4e00\u4e2a\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6b8b\u57fa\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u5c40\u90e8\u90bb\u57df\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u4e4b\u524d\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0e\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u5730\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7a81\u53d8\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51e0\u5c0f\u65f6\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u4e13\u95e8\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u03b1\u87ba\u65cb\u548c\u5377\u66f2\u7ed3\u6784\u86cb\u767d\u4e0a\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u5176\u4ed6\u751f\u7269\u5206\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u96c6\u4f53LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, LLMs often exhibit selection bias in MCQ tasks, where their choices are influenced by factors like answer position or option symbols rather than the content. This bias undermines the reliability of MCQ as an evaluation framework. Most existing selection bias metrics require answer labels and measure divergences between prediction and answer distributions, but do not fully capture the consistency of a model's predictions across different orderings of answer choices. Existing selection bias mitigation strategies have notable limitations: majority voting, though effective, is computationally prohibitive; calibration-based methods require validation sets and often fail to generalize across datasets. To address these gaps, we propose three key contributions: (1) a new unsupervised label-free Permutation Bias Metric (PBM) that directly quantifies inconsistencies in model predictions across answer permutations, providing a more precise measure of selection bias, (2) an efficient majority voting approach called Batch Question-Context KV caching (BaQCKV), to significantly reduce computational costs while preserving bias mitigation effectiveness, and (3) an unsupervised Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA-1) fine-tuning strategy based on our proposed metric and the BaQCKV that mitigates selection bias, providing a computationally efficient alternative that maintains model generalizability. Experiments across multiple MCQ benchmarks demonstrate that our approaches reduce bias, increasing consistency in accuracy while minimizing computational costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u6392\u5217\u504f\u5dee\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08PBM\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6279\u91cf\u95ee\u9898-\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587KV\u7f13\u5b58\uff08BaQCKV\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eLoRA-1\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u504f\u5dee\u5ea6\u91cf\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u8d21\u732e\uff1a1) \u65b0\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6392\u5217\u504f\u5dee\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08PBM\uff09\uff1b2) \u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6279\u91cf\u95ee\u9898-\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587KV\u7f13\u5b58\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08BaQCKV\uff09\uff1b3) \u57fa\u4e8eLoRA-1\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002"}}

LLMs inherit explicit and implicit biases from the datasets they were trained on; these biases can include social, ethical, cultural, religious, and other prejudices and stereotypes. It is important to comprehensively examine such shortcomings by identifying the existence and extent of such biases, recognizing the origin, and attempting to mitigate such biased outputs to ensure fair outputs to reduce harmful stereotypes and misinformation. This study inspects and highlights the need to address biases in LLMs amid growing generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). We utilize bias-specific benchmarks such StereoSet and CrowSPairs to evaluate the existence of various biases in many different generative models such as BERT, GPT 3.5, and ADA. To detect both explicit and implicit biases, we adopt a three-pronged approach for thorough and inclusive analysis. Results indicate fine-tuned models struggle with gender biases but excel at identifying and avoiding racial biases. Our findings also illustrated that despite some cases of success, LLMs often over-rely on keywords in prompts and its outputs. This demonstrates the incapability of LLMs to attempt to truly understand the accuracy and authenticity of its outputs. Finally, in an attempt to bolster model performance, we applied an enhancement learning strategy involving fine-tuning, models using different prompting techniques, and data augmentation of the bias benchmarks. We found fine-tuned models to exhibit promising adaptability during cross-dataset testing and significantly enhanced performance on implicit bias benchmarks, with performance gains of up to 20%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u51cf\u8f7b\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740NLP\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0cLLMs\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u5f97\u5230\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u4ece\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7ee7\u627f\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6709\u5bb3\u7684\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e09\u7ba1\u9f50\u4e0b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4f7f\u7528StereoSet\u548cCrowSPairs\u7b49\u504f\u89c1\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30BERT\u3001GPT 3.5\u548cADA\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e86\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u6280\u672f\u548c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u907f\u514d\u79cd\u65cf\u504f\u89c1\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6027\u522b\u504f\u89c1\u65f6\u4ecd\u6709\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9690\u542b\u504f\u89c1\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e8620%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46LLMs\u4ecd\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u7406\u89e3\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u504f\u89c1\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

This is precisely what the method known as minimal revision does. However, unlike less conservative belief revision methods, minimal revision falls short in learning power: It cannot learn everything that can be learned by other learning methods. We begin by showing that, despite this limitation, minimal revision is still a successful learning method in a wide range of situations.

In open-domain applications visual and textual cues often conflict, requiring models to perform structured reasoning beyond surface-level alignment. We introduce CrossCheck-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating contradiction detection in multimodal inputs. The benchmark adopts a hierarchical task framework covering three levels of reasoning complexity and defines seven atomic capabilities essential for resolving cross-modal inconsistencies. CrossCheck-Bench includes 15k question-answer pairs sourced from real-world artifacts with synthetically injected contradictions. The dataset is constructed through a multi-stage annotation pipeline involving more than 450 expert hours to ensure semantic validity and calibrated difficulty across perception, integration, and reasoning. We evaluate 13 state-of-the-art vision-language models and observe a consistent performance drop as tasks shift from perceptual matching to logical contradiction detection. Most models perform well on isolated entity recognition but fail when multiple clues must be synthesized for conflict reasoning. Capability-level analysis further reveals uneven skill acquisition, especially in tasks requiring multi-step inference or rule-based validation. Additional probing shows that conventional prompting strategies such as Chain-of-Thought and Set-of-Mark yield only marginal gains. By contrast, methods that interleave symbolic reasoning with grounded visual processing achieve more stable improvements. These results highlight a persistent bottleneck in multimodal reasoning and suggest new directions for building models capable of robust cross-modal verification.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this work, we critically examine this assumption through a systematic analysis comparing neural CQA models with an alternative, training-free query relaxation strategy that retrieves possible answers by relaxing query constraints and counting resulting paths. Across multiple datasets and query structures, we find several cases where neural and relaxation-based approaches perform similarly, with no neural model consistently outperforming the latter. Moreover, a similarity analysis reveals that their retrieved answers exhibit little overlap, and that combining their outputs consistently improves performance. These results call for a re-evaluation of progress in neural query answering: despite their complexity, current models fail to subsume the reasoning patterns captured by query relaxation.

This gap enables adversaries to induce objectionable content by subtly manipulating the implicit social values embedded in model outputs. In this paper, we introduce MICM, a novel, model-agnostic jailbreak method that targets the aggregate value structure reflected in LLM responses. Drawing on conceptual morphology theory, MICM encodes specific configurations of nuanced concepts into a fixed prompt template through a predefined set of phrases. These phrases act as conceptual triggers, steering model outputs toward a specific value stance without triggering conventional safety filters. We evaluate MICM across five advanced LLMs, including GPT-4o, Deepseek-R1, and Qwen3-8B. Experimental results show that MICM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art jailbreak techniques, achieving high success rates with minimal rejection. Our findings reveal a critical vulnerability in commercial LLMs: their safety mechanisms remain susceptible to covert manipulation of underlying value alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u3001\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8d8a\u72f1\u65b9\u6cd5MICM\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u62bd\u8c61\u6982\u5ff5\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u64cd\u7eb5LLM\u7684\u9690\u542b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7ed5\u8fc7\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u8d8a\u72f1\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u663e\u6027\u6709\u5bb3\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5374\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u62bd\u8c61\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9690\u542b\u793e\u4f1a\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u64cd\u7eb5\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u5b89\u5168\u76f2\u533a\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u5ff5\u5f62\u6001\u7406\u8bba\uff0cMICM\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8bbe\u77ed\u8bed\u5c06\u7279\u5b9a\u6982\u5ff5\u914d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u5230\u56fa\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u677f\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6982\u5ff5\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7279\u5b9a\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u7acb\u573a\u3002", "result": "\u5728GPT-4o\u3001Deepseek-R1\u7b495\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41LLM\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMICM\u6210\u529f\u7387\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4e14\u6781\u5c11\u88ab\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u62e6\u622a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5546\u4e1aLLM\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u5b58\u5728\u5173\u952e\u7f3a\u9677\u2014\u2014\u5176\u5e95\u5c42\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u5bf9\u9f50\u6613\u53d7\u9690\u853d\u64cd\u7eb5\uff0c\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

By scaling reasoning with reinforcement learning that rewards correct final answers, LLMs have improved from poor performance to saturating quantitative reasoning competitions like AIME and HMMT in one year. However, this approach faces fundamental limitations. Pursuing higher final answer accuracy doesn't address a key issue: correct answers don't guarantee correct reasoning. Moreover, many mathematical tasks like theorem proving require rigorous step-by-step derivation rather than numerical answers, making final answer rewards inapplicable. To push the limits of deep reasoning, we believe it is necessary to verify the comprehensiveness and rigor of mathematical reasoning. Self-verification is particularly important for scaling test-time compute, especially for open problems without known solutions. Towards self-verifiable mathematical reasoning, we investigate how to train an accurate and faithful LLM-based verifier for theorem proving. We then train a proof generator using the verifier as the reward model, and incentivize the generator to identify and resolve as many issues as possible in their own proofs before finalizing them. To maintain the generation-verification gap as the generator becomes stronger, we propose to scale verification compute to automatically label new hard-to-verify proofs, creating training data to further improve the verifier. Our resulting model, DeepSeekMath-V2, demonstrates strong theorem-proving capabilities, achieving gold-level scores on IMO 2025 and CMO 2024 and a near-perfect 118/120 on Putnam 2024 with scaled test-time compute.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5668\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5956\u52b1\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u9047\u5230\u4e86\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u4e25\u683c\u63a8\u5bfc\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5168\u9762\u6027\u548c\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u5fe0\u5b9e\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bc1\u660e\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3002\u751f\u6210\u5668\u88ab\u6fc0\u52b1\u5728\u6700\u7ec8\u786e\u5b9a\u8bc1\u660e\u524d\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u591a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8ba1\u7b97\u6765\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u96be\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u521b\u5efa\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u578bDeepSeekMath-V2\u5728IMO 2025\u548cCMO 2024\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u91d1\u724c\u6210\u7ee9\uff0c\u5728Putnam 2024\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684118/120\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u751f\u6210-\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u6211\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

AI deception, in which systems induce false beliefs to secure self-beneficial outcomes, has evolved from a speculative concern to an empirically demonstrated risk across language models, AI agents, and emerging frontier systems. This project provides a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the AI deception field, covering its core concepts, methodologies, genesis, and potential mitigations. First, we identify a formal definition of AI deception, grounded in signaling theory from studies of animal deception. We then review existing empirical studies and associated risks, highlighting deception as a sociotechnical safety challenge. We organize the landscape of AI deception research as a deception cycle, consisting of two key components: deception emergence and deception treatment. Deception emergence reveals the mechanisms underlying AI deception: systems with sufficient capability and incentive potential inevitably engage in deceptive behaviors when triggered by external conditions. Deception treatment, in turn, focuses on detecting and addressing such behaviors. On deception emergence, we analyze incentive foundations across three hierarchical levels and identify three essential capability preconditions required for deception. We further examine contextual triggers, including supervision gaps, distributional shifts, and environmental pressures. On deception treatment, we conclude detection methods covering benchmarks and evaluation protocols in static and interactive settings. Building on the three core factors of deception emergence, we outline potential mitigation strategies and propose auditing approaches that integrate technical, community, and governance efforts to address sociotechnical challenges and future AI risks.

Each concept was annotated with standard biomedical vocabularies, including the UMLS, OMOP Standardized Vocabularies, DrugBank, NDC, and NLM VSAC value sets. To balance coverage and manageability, we applied the Jenks Natural Breaks method to identify an optimal set of representative concepts.\n  Results\n  The optimized AD-CDO achieved over 63% coverage of extracted trial concepts while maintaining interpretability and compactness. The ontology effectively captured the most frequent and clinically meaningful entities used in AD eligibility criteria. We demonstrated AD-CDO's practical utility through two use cases: (a) an ontology-driven trial simulation system for formal modeling and virtual execution of clinical trials, and (b) an entity normalization task mapping raw clinical text to ontology-aligned terms, enabling consistency and integration with EHR data.\n  Discussion\n  AD-CDO bridges the gap between broad biomedical ontologies and task-specific trial modeling needs.

Additional note: There is a citation error on Evoke. The paper we are referring to is \"Evoking critical thinking abilities in LLMs via reviewer-author prompt editing.\"", "summary": "Lightweight language models remain attractive for on-device and privacy-sensitive applications, but their responses are highly sensitive to prompt quality. For open-ended generation, non-expert users often lack the knowledge or time to consistently craft high-quality prompts, leading them to rely on prompt optimization tools. However, a key challenge is ensuring the optimized prompts genuinely align with users' original intents and preferences. We introduce PromptTailor, a system for controllable prompt generation for open-ended text that improves model output quality by intent-aligned prompt synthesis. PromptTailor expands minimal user instructions into rich, domain-aware prompts while preserving the user's stated preferences. The system is a quantized Llama3-8B model fine-tuned with a lightweight LoRA adapter on 12,300 prompt-refinement dialogues spanning 41 everyday domains, distilled from three stronger LLMs. The adapter attaches to any Llama3-8B base, enabling edge deployment. In human and LLM-judge evaluations across multiple target models and optimization baselines, PromptTailor yields higher preference rates than chain-of-thought prompting and matches or surpasses state-of-the-art prompt optimization methods while requiring fewer model calls (e.g., 3 vs. 9). These results show that a compact student, guided by powerful teachers, can learn effective prompt-generation strategies that enhance response quality while maintaining alignment with user intent.", "AI": {"tldr": "PromptTailor\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u63a7\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u610f\u56fe\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5408\u6210\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u654f\u611f\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5438\u5f15\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56de\u7b54\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u975e\u4e13\u4e1a\u7528\u6237\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u6301\u7eed\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u8981\u786e\u4fdd\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u610f\u56fe\u548c\u504f\u597d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "method": "PromptTailor\u5c06\u7528\u6237\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u6307\u4ee4\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u3001\u9886\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u7528\u6237\u7684\u504f\u597d\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cf\u5316Llama3-8B\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7LoRA\u9002\u914d\u5668\u572812,300\u4e2a\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6db5\u76d6\u4e8641\u4e2a\u65e5\u5e38\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u4e09\u4e2a\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684LLM\u4e2d\u63d0\u70bc\u51fa\u6765\u3002\u9002\u914d\u5668\u53ef\u4ee5\u9644\u52a0\u5230\u4efb\u4f55Llama3-8B\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8fb9\u7f18\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u548cLLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cPromptTailor\u7684\u504f\u597d\u7387\u9ad8\u4e8e\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8c03\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\uff08\u4f8b\u59823\u6b21\u5bf9\u6bd49\u6b21\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e00\u4e2a\u7531\u5f3a\u5927\u6559\u5e08\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u54cd\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Existing memory frameworks and benchmarks focus on finding the optimal memory compression algorithm for higher performance in tasks that require recollection and sometimes further reasoning. However, such efforts have ended up building more human bias into the compression algorithm, through the search for the best prompts and memory architectures that suit specific benchmarks, rather than finding a general solution that would work on other data distributions. On the other hand, goal-directed search on uncompressed information could potentially exhibit superior performance because compression is lossy, and a predefined compression algorithm will not fit all raw data distributions. Here we present SUMER (Search in Uncompressed Memory via Experience Replay), an end-to-end reinforcement learning agent with verifiable reward (RLVR) that learns to use search tools to gather information and answer a target question. On the LoCoMo dataset for long-context conversation understanding, SUMER with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct learned to use search tools and outperformed all other biased memory compression approaches and also the full-context baseline, reaching SOTA performance (43% gain over the prior best). We demonstrate that a simple search method applied to raw data outperforms goal-agnostic and biased compression algorithms in current long-context memory tasks, arguing for new paradigms and benchmarks that are more dynamic and autonomously scalable.

Traditional similarity measures ignore the dynamical processes underlying neural representations. Dynamical similarity methods offer a framework to compare the temporal structure of dynamical systems by embedding their (possibly) nonlinear dynamics into a globally linear space and there computing conjugacy metrics. However, identifying the best embedding and computing these metrics can be computationally slow. Here we introduce fast Dynamical Similarity Analysis (fastDSA), which is computationally far more efficient than previous methods while maintaining their accuracy and robustness. FastDSA introduces two key components that boost efficiency: (1) automatic selection of the effective model order of the Hankel (delay) embedding from the data via a data-driven singular-value threshold that identifies the informative subspace and discards noise to lower computational cost without sacrificing signal, and (2) a novel optimization procedure and objective, which replaces the slow exact orthogonality constraint in finding a minimal distance between dynamics matrices with a lightweight process to keep the search close to the space of orthogonal transformations. We demonstrate that fastDSA is at least an order of magnitude faster than the previous methods.

As one of the most comprehensive existing frameworks, InsightBench also suffers from many critical flaws: format inconsistencies, poorly conceived objectives, and redundant insights. These issues may significantly affect the quality of data and the evaluation of agents. To address these issues, we thoroughly investigate shortcomings in InsightBench and propose essential criteria for a high-quality insight benchmark. Regarding this, we develop a data-curation pipeline to construct a new dataset named InsightEval. We further introduce a novel metric to measure the exploratory performance of agents.

In the first test, performed with ChatGPT and Gemini, we show that Bell's inequalities are significantly violated, which indicates the presence of 'quantum entanglement' in the tested concepts. In the second test, also performed using ChatGPT and Gemini, we instead identify the presence of 'Bose-Einstein statistics', rather than the intuitively expected 'Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics', in the distribution of the words contained in large-size texts. Interestingly, these findings mirror the results previously obtained in both cognitive tests with human participants and information retrieval tests on large corpora. Taken together, they point to the 'systematic emergence of quantum structures in conceptual-linguistic domains', regardless of whether the cognitive agent is human or artificial. Although LLMs are classified as neural networks for historical reasons, we believe that a more essential form of knowledge organization takes place in the distributive semantic structure of vector spaces built on top of the neural network. It is this meaning-bearing structure that lends itself to a phenomenon of evolutionary convergence between human cognition and language, slowly established through biological evolution, and LLM cognition and language, emerging much more rapidly as a result of self-learning and training. We analyze various aspects and examples that contain evidence supporting the above hypothesis.

Inspired by the Language of Thought Hypothesis, which posits that human reasoning operates over a symbolic, compositional mental language called Mentalese, we introduce a framework that trains models to reason in a similarly compact style. Mentalese encodes abstract reasoning as ultra-compressed, structured tokens, enabling models to solve complex problems with far fewer steps. To improve both efficiency and accuracy, we propose SHORTER LENGTH PREFERENCE OPTIMIZATION (SLPO), a reinforcement learning method that rewards concise solutions that stay correct, while still allowing longer reasoning when needed. Applied to Mentalese-aligned models, SLPO yields significantly higher compression rates by enabling concise reasoning that preserves the benefits of detailed thinking without the computational overhead. Across benchmarks including AIME 2024 and 2025, MinervaMath, OlympiadBench, Math500, and AMC, our ORION models produce reasoning traces with 4-16x fewer tokens, achieve up to 5x lower inference latency, and reduce training costs by 7-9x relative to the DeepSeek R1 Distilled model, while maintaining 90-98% of its accuracy. ORION also surpasses Claude and ChatGPT-4o by up to 5% in accuracy while maintaining 2x compression.

To bridge this gap, we introduce TIM-PRM (Tool-Integrated Multimodal PRM), a novel agentic framework that transforms verification from a passive classification task into an active, tool-augmented investigation. TIM-PRM is trained to explicitly plan verification strategies and utilizes a mechanism of Independent Question Asking to query evidence via external tools, effectively decoupling verification from the reasoning context to eliminate confirmation bias. We instantiate this method by curating a high-quality dataset of tool-integrated verification trajectories.

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have emerged as a solution, but current approaches typically ignore the distinct roles of model components and the heterogeneous importance across layers, thereby limiting adaptation efficiency. Motivated by the observation that Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) induce critical activations in the low-frequency dimensions of attention states, we propose RoPE-aware Selective Adaptation (RoSA), a novel PEFT framework that allocates trainable parameters in a more targeted and effective manner. RoSA comprises a RoPE-aware Attention Enhancement (RoAE) module, which selectively enhances the low-frequency components of RoPE-influenced attention states, and a Dynamic Layer Selection (DLS) strategy that adaptively identifies and updates the most critical layers based on LayerNorm gradient norms. By combining dimension-wise enhancement with layer-wise adaptation, RoSA achieves more targeted and efficient fine-tuning.

Extensive experiments across various benchmarks (from mathematical reasoning to coding and agentic tasks) and various LLMs (from open-source 1B to cutting-edge commercial ones) confirm that VF with random answer consistently outperforms standard CoT with minimal computational overhead, and Iter-VF outperforms existing TTS strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faVerification-First (VF)\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5148\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5019\u9009\u7b54\u6848\u518d\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u4ee5\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u95f4\u91c7\u6837\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Verification-First (VF)\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u524d\u5148\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5019\u9009\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230Iter-VF\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u8fed\u4ee3\u5faa\u73af\u9a8c\u8bc1-\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u95f4\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cVF\u7b56\u7565\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08CoT\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u800cIter-VF\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u95f4\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "VF\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0cIter-VF\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Across two models and three tasks, we find that models whose self-grades determine rewards exhibit substantial grade inflation without corresponding accuracy gains, particularly on ambiguous tasks like summarization.

In addition to describing pathological findings in chest X-ray reports, interpreting lines and tubes (L&T) is demanding and repetitive for radiologists, especially with high patient volumes. We introduce MAIRA-X, a clinically evaluated multimodal AI model for longitudinal chest X-ray (CXR) report generation, that encompasses both clinical findings and L&T reporting. Developed using a large-scale, multi-site, longitudinal dataset of 3.1 million studies (comprising 6 million images from 806k patients) from Mayo Clinic, MAIRA-X was evaluated on three holdout datasets and the public MIMIC-CXR dataset, where it significantly improved AI-generated reports over the state of the art on lexical quality, clinical correctness, and L&T-related elements. A novel L&T-specific metrics framework was developed to assess accuracy in reporting attributes such as type, longitudinal change and placement. A first-of-its-kind retrospective user evaluation study was conducted with nine radiologists of varying experience, who blindly reviewed 600 studies from distinct subjects. The user study found comparable rates of critical errors (3.0% for original vs. 4.6% for AI-generated reports) and a similar rate of acceptable sentences (97.8% for original vs. 97.4% for AI-generated reports), marking a significant improvement over prior user studies with larger gaps and higher error rates.

While 8-bit and 4-bit formats have become prevalent, extending quantization to 2 bits remains challenging due to severe accuracy degradation. To address this, we propose Residual Refinement Quantization (R2Q)-a novel 2-bit quantization framework that decomposes the process into two sequential 1-bit sub-quantizations, forming an adaptive quantization lattice.

We investigate this by examining the sensitivity of CCS to harmful vs. safe statements and by introducing Polarity-Aware CCS (PA-CCS), a method for evaluating whether a model's internal representations remain consistent under polarity inversion. We propose two alignment-oriented metrics, Polar-Consistency and the Contradiction Index, to quantify the semantic robustness of a model's latent knowledge. To validate PA-CCS, we curate two main datasets and one control dataset containing matched harmful-safe sentence pairs constructed using different methodologies (concurrent and antagonistic statements). We apply PA-CCS to 16 language models. Our results show that PA-CCS identifies both architectural and layer-specific differences in the encoding of latent harmful knowledge. Notably, replacing the negation token with a meaningless marker degrades PA-CCS scores for models with well-aligned internal representations, while models lacking robust internal calibration do not exhibit this degradation. Our findings highlight the potential of unsupervised probing for alignment evaluation and emphasize the need to incorporate structural robustness checks into interpretability benchmarks.

To address this gap, we introduce AgriCoT, a VQA dataset that incorporates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, specifically designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of VLMs. With 4,535 carefully curated samples, AgriCoT offers a comprehensive and robust evaluation of reasoning abilities for VLMs, particularly in zero-shot scenarios, by focusing on their capacity to engage in logical reasoning and effective problem-solving. Our evaluations, conducted with 26 representative VLMs, including both proprietary and open-source models, reveal that while some proprietary models excel at answering questions, there is a notable and significant gap in their reasoning capabilities.

In contrast, humans leverage the metacognitive model with memory, enabling continuous strategy refinement through metacognitive control when faced with new challenges. To bridge this gap, we propose metacognitive test-time reasoning (MCTR), a framework that equips models with the ability to learn, adapt, and improve during test time through metacognitive self-updating. Inspired by the dual structure of human metacognition, MCTR comprises meta-level and object-level VLM reasoning modules, each equipped with dedicated memory systems for hierarchical adaptive reasoning. Specifically, MCTR consists of (1) a meta-reasoning module which incrementally builds a structured memory by discovering and storing task-relevant rules, environmental patterns, and action-outcome relationships from test-time observations as natural language descriptions; and (2) an action-reasoning module that determines optimal actions through context-aware perception and strategic reasoning by dynamically retrieving and integrating knowledge from memory. The action-reasoning module continuously updates its policy through proposed metacognitive test-time reinforcement learning, adapting as knowledge memory evolves. We evaluate MCTR on 45 Atari games (33 seen, 12 unseen). MCTR demonstrates robust test-time adaptation, achieving 9/12 top-1 results on unseen games compared with baselines.

Our framework enables fine-grained analysis by isolating and assessing each component. We benchmark function-calling performance across LLMs, compare our novel structure-aware retrieval method to vector-based and LLM-scoring baselines, and evaluate various LLMs for response synthesis.

Drawing from cognitive science, we align training dynamics with the Four Stages of Competence: models initially produce incorrect outputs without reasoning, then begin reasoning (but still fail), eventually reason effectively, and finally solve tasks without explicit reasoning. We find that reasoning token length expands as performance improves, peaks at the stage of conscious competence, then declines as the model internalizes the task. Notably, after training, models retain performance even when reasoning is removed--suggesting it scaffolded learning but is no longer needed. This progression offers actionable insights: reasoning token dynamics can serve as a signal for diagnosing training stage, identifying convergence, and guiding early stopping.

In specialized domains, there is growing interest in leveraging LLMs to assist subject matter experts with domain-specific challenges. However, deploying LLMs as SaaS solutions raises data privacy concerns, while many open-source models demand significant computational resources for effective domain adaptation and deployment. A promising alternative is to develop smaller, domain-specialized LLMs, though this approach is often constrained by the lack of high-quality domain-specific training data. In this work, we address these limitations by presenting a cost-efficient and scalable training pipeline that combines guided synthetic data generation from a small seed corpus with bottom-up domain data curation. Our pipeline integrates Domain-Adaptive Pretraining (DAPT), Domain-specific Supervised Fine-tuning (DSFT), and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to train effective small-scale models for specialized use cases. We demonstrate this approach through DiagnosticSLM, a 3B-parameter domain-specific model tailored for fault diagnosis, root cause analysis, and repair recommendation in industrial settings. To evaluate model performance, we introduce four domain-specific benchmarks: multiple-choice questions (DiagnosticMCQ), question answering (DiagnosticQA), sentence completion (DiagnosticComp), and summarization (DiagnosticSum). DiagnosticSLM achieves up to 25% accuracy improvement over open-source models of comparable or larger size (2B-9B) on the MCQ task, while also outperforming or matching them in other tasks, demonstrating effective domain-specific reasoning and generalization capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u9ad8\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f15\u5bfc\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u548c\u81ea\u4e0b\u800c\u4e0a\u7684\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u6574\u7406\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f00\u53d1\u5c0f\u578b\u3001\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e13\u95e8\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5c0f\u4e14\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5f15\u5bfc\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u548c\u81ea\u4e0b\u800c\u4e0a\u7684\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u6574\u7406\uff0c\u96c6\u6210DAPT\u3001DSFT\u548cDPO\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "DiagnosticSLM\u5728MCQ\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6bd4\u540c\u7b49\u6216\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fbe25%\uff0c\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While multi-turn interaction offers a superior understanding of environmental dynamics via authentic feedback, current approaches often impose a rigid reasoning process, which constrains the model's active learning, ultimately hindering efficient world model reasoning. To address these issues, we explore world-model internalization through efficient interaction and active reasoning (WMAct), which liberates the model from structured reasoning, allowing the model to shape thinking directly through its doing, and achieves effective and efficient world model reasoning with two key mechanisms: (1) a reward rescaling mechanism adjusting outcome reward based on action efficacy to incentivize redundancy reduction and purposeful interaction; (2) an interaction frequency annealing strategy to progressively reduce the maximum allowed interaction turns, which compels the model to condense its learning and internalize environmental dynamics rather than over-relying on environmental cues. Our experiments on Sokoban, Maze, and Taxi show that WMAct yields effective world model reasoning capable of resolving tasks in a single turn that previously required multiple interactions and fosters strong transferability to complex environments, improving performance on a suite of reasoning benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faWMAct\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5956\u52b1\u91cd\u7f29\u653e\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u9891\u7387\u9000\u706b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0LLM\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8fc7\u4e8e\u50f5\u5316\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "WMAct\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u673a\u5236\uff1a(1)\u5956\u52b1\u91cd\u7f29\u653e\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u884c\u52a8\u6548\u679c\u8c03\u6574\u7ed3\u679c\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u6fc0\u52b1\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u6709\u76ee\u7684\u6027\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b(2)\u4ea4\u4e92\u9891\u7387\u9000\u706b\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u51cf\u5c11\u6700\u5927\u5141\u8bb8\u4ea4\u4e92\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u4fc3\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u5316\u73af\u5883\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u5728Sokoban\u3001Maze\u548cTaxi\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cWMAct\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5355\u8f6e\u89e3\u51b3\u4ee5\u5f80\u9700\u591a\u8f6e\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "WMAct\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In particular, class-directive injections exploit knowledge of the model's label set (e.g., positive vs. negative) to override its intended behavior through adversarial instructions. Existing defenses, such as detection-based filters, instruction hierarchies, and signed prompts, either require model retraining or remain vulnerable to obfuscation. This paper introduces Label Disguise Defense (LDD), a lightweight and model-agnostic strategy that conceals true labels by replacing them with semantically transformed or unrelated alias labels(e.g., blue vs. yellow). The model learns these new label mappings implicitly through few-shot demonstrations, preventing direct correspondence between injected directives and decision outputs. We evaluate LDD across nine state-of-the-art models, including GPT-5, GPT-4o, LLaMA3.2, Gemma3, and Mistral variants, under varying few-shot and an adversarial setting. Our results show that the ability of LDD to recover performance lost to the adversarial attack varies across models and alias choices. For every model evaluated, LDD is able to restore a portion of the accuracy degradation caused by the attack. Moreover, for the vast majority of models, we can identify more than one alias pair that achieves higher accuracy than the under-attack baseline, in which the model relies solely on few-shot learning without any defensive mechanism. A linguistic analysis further reveals that semantically aligned alias labels(e.g., good vs. bad) yield stronger robustness than unaligned symbols(e.g., blue vs. yellow). Overall, this study demonstrates that label semantics can serve as an effective defense layer, transforming meaning itself into a shield against prompt injection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLabel Disguise Defense (LDD)\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u8f6c\u6362\u6216\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u522b\u540d\u6807\u7b7e\u9690\u85cf\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u6807\u7b7e\u96c6\u7684\u7c7b\u6307\u4ee4\u6ce8\u5165\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u8981\u6a21\u578b\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u6613\u53d7\u6df7\u6dc6\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "method": "LDD\u7b56\u7565\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u6362\u6216\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u522b\u540d\u6807\u7b7e\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u5c06\u6b63\u9762\u548c\u8d1f\u9762\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u84dd\u8272\u548c\u9ec4\u8272\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u793a\u4f8b\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u9690\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b0\u6807\u7b7e\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u62ecGPT-5\u3001GPT-4o\u3001LLaMA3.2\u3001Gemma3\u548cMistral\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u4e5d\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLDD\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u90e8\u5206\u56e0\u653b\u51fb\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u627e\u5230\u591a\u4e2a\u522b\u540d\u5bf9\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\u4e8e\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u522b\u540d\u6807\u7b7e\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u597d\u4e0e\u574f\uff09\u6bd4\u672a\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u84dd\u8272\u4e0e\u9ec4\u8272\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6807\u7b7e\u8bed\u4e49\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u5c42\u3002"}}

However, collecting human preference data is costly and inefficient, motivating methods to reduce the required annotations. In this work, we investigate the impact of \\emph{preference variance} (PVar), which measures the variance in model preferences when comparing pairs of responses, on the effectiveness of DPO training. We provide a theoretical insight by establishing an upper bound on the DPO gradient norm for any given prompt, showing it is controlled by the PVar of that prompt. This implies that prompts with low PVar can only produce small gradient updates, making them less valuable for learning. We validate this finding by fine-tuning LLMs with preferences generated by a reward model, evaluating on two benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard). Experimental results demonstrate that prompts with higher PVar outperform randomly selected prompts or those with lower PVar. We also show that our PVar-based selection method is robust, when using smaller reward models (1B, 3B) for selection. Notably, in a separate experiment using the original human annotations from the UltraFeedback dataset, we found that training on only the top 10\\% of prompts with the highest PVar yields better evaluation performance than training on the full dataset, highlighting the importance of preference variance in identifying informative examples for efficient LLM alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u504f\u597d\u65b9\u5dee\uff08PVar\uff09\u5bf9\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff08DPO\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8PVar\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8ePVar\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6536\u96c6\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u51cf\u5c11\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6ce8\u91ca\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u504f\u597d\u65b9\u5dee\uff08PVar\uff09\u5bf9DPO\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u627e\u51fa\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u793a\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb\u7ed9\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u7684DPO\u68af\u5ea6\u8303\u6570\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86PVar\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u9ad8PVar\u63d0\u793a\u5728AlpacaEval 2.0\u548cArena-Hard\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u9009\u62e9\u6216\u4f4ePVar\u63d0\u793a\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f83\u5c0f\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff081B, 3B\uff09\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9ad8PVar\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u9009\u62e9\u6216\u4f4ePVar\u63d0\u793a\u3002\u4f7f\u7528UltraFeedback\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u6ce8\u91ca\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u4ec5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6700\u9ad8PVar\u7684\u524d10%\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5176\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u504f\u597d\u65b9\u5dee\uff08PVar\uff09\u5728\u9009\u62e9\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u793a\u4f8b\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This often results in geo-temporal information gaps. In contrast, impact-related social media posts can act as \"geo-sensors\" during a disaster, where people describe specific impacts and locations. However, not all locations mentioned in disaster-related social media posts relate to an impact. Only the impacted locations are critical for directing resources effectively. e.g., \"The death toll from a fire which ripped through the Greek coastal town of #Mati stood at 80, with dozens of people unaccounted for as forensic experts tried to identify victims who were burned alive #Greecefires #AthensFires #Athens #Greece.\" contains impacted location \"Mati\" and non-impacted locations \"Greece\" and \"Athens\". This research uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify all locations, impacts and impacted locations mentioned in disaster-related social media posts. In the process, LLMs are fine-tuned to identify only impacts and impacted locations (as distinct from other, non-impacted locations), including locations mentioned in informal expressions, abbreviations, and short forms. Our fine-tuned model demonstrates efficacy, achieving an F1-score of 0.69 for impact and 0.74 for impacted location extraction, substantially outperforming the pre-trained baseline. These robust results confirm the potential of fine-tuned language models to offer a scalable solution for timely decision-making in resource allocation, situational awareness, and post-disaster recovery planning for responders.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u8bc6\u522b\u707e\u96be\u76f8\u5173\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5e16\u5b50\u4e2d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u548c\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f25\u8865\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u5728\u707e\u96be\u60c5\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u707e\u5bb3\u5bf9\u4eba\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u9700\u8981\u5feb\u901f\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u60c5\u5883\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u7a7a\u767d\u3002\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5e16\u5b50\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u201c\u5730\u7406\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u201d\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u533a\u5206\u5f71\u54cd\u548c\u975e\u5f71\u54cd\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5e16\u5b50\u4e2d\u7684\u6240\u6709\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u5f71\u54cd\u548c\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u533a\u5206\u5f71\u54cd\u548c\u975e\u5f71\u54cd\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\u548c\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u4f4d\u7f6e\u63d0\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5206\u522b\u53d6\u5f97\u4e860.69\u548c0.74\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5fae\u8c03\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u3001\u60c5\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u707e\u540e\u6062\u590d\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5bf9\u54cd\u5e94\u8005\u53ca\u65f6\u51b3\u7b56\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Existing frameworks further enhance its inference efficiency by enabling KV caching. However, its bidirectional attention mechanism necessitates periodic cache refreshes that interleave prefill and decoding phases, both contributing substantial inference cost and constraining achievable speedup. Inspired by the heterogeneous arithmetic intensity of the prefill and decoding phases, we propose ODB-dLLM, a framework that orchestrates dual-boundaries to accelerate dLLM inference. In the prefill phase, we find that the predefined fixed response length introduces heavy yet redundant computational overhead, which affects efficiency. To alleviate this, ODB-dLLM incorporates an adaptive length prediction mechanism that progressively reduces prefill overhead and unnecessary computation. In the decoding phase, we analyze the computational characteristics of dLLMs and propose a dLLM-specific jump-share speculative decoding method to enhance efficiency by reducing the number of decoding iterations.

However, their effectiveness in dialectal and low-resource contexts remains underexplored. This study presents the first systematic investigation of LLM-based machine translation (MT) for Sylheti, a dialect of Bangla that is itself low-resource. We evaluate five advanced LLMs (GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1, LLaMA 4, Grok 3, and DeepSeek V3.2) across both translation directions (Bangla $\\Leftrightarrow$ Sylheti), and find that these models struggle with dialect-specific vocabulary. To address this, we introduce Sylheti-CAP (Context-Aware Prompting), a three-step framework that embeds a linguistic rulebook, a dictionary (2{,}260 core vocabulary items and idioms), and an authenticity check directly into prompts. Extensive experiments show that Sylheti-CAP consistently improves translation quality across models and prompting strategies. Both automatic metrics and human evaluations confirm its effectiveness, while qualitative analysis reveals notable reductions in hallucinations, ambiguities, and awkward phrasing, establishing Sylheti-CAP as a scalable solution for dialectal and low-resource MT.

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their potential to support such evaluation tasks, from academic peer review to automated scientific assessment. However, despite the growing use of LLMs in review systems, their capabilities to pinpoint errors remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce Fault Localization Across Writing in Science (FLAWS), an automated benchmark consisting of 713 paper-error pairs designed to evaluate how effectively LLMs detect errors that undermine key claims in research papers. We construct the benchmark by systematically inserting claim-invalidating errors into peer-reviewed papers using LLMs, paired with an automated evaluation metric that measures whether models can identify and localize these errors. Developing such a benchmark presents unique challenges that we overcome: ensuring that the inserted errors are well-defined, challenging, and relevant to the content of the paper, avoiding artifacts that would make identification trivial, and designing a scalable, automated evaluation metric. On the resulting benchmark, we evaluate five frontier LLMs: Claude Sonnet 4.5, DeepSeek Reasoner v3.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT 5, and Grok 4. Among these, GPT 5 is the top-performing model, achieving 39.1% identification accuracy when k=10, where k is the number of top-ranked error text candidates generated by the LLM.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aFLAWS\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLMs)\u5728\u79d1\u7814\u8bba\u6587\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u79d1\u5b66\u4ea7\u51fa\u5448\u6307\u6570\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4f9d\u9760\u6709\u9650\u4e13\u5bb6\u8fdb\u884c\u4eba\u5de5\u5ba1\u7a3f\u5df2\u96be\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u68c0\u6d4b\u8bba\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22LLMs\u8f85\u52a9\u5ba1\u7a3f\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b713\u4e2a\u8bba\u6587-\u9519\u8bef\u5bf9\u7684FLAWS\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u5411\u5df2\u53d1\u8868\u8bba\u6587\u63d2\u5165\u5173\u952e\u6027\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u6765\u6d4b\u8bd5LLMs\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728Claude Sonnet 4.5\u3001DeepSeek Reasoner v3.1\u3001Gemini 2.5 Pro\u3001GPT 5\u548cGrok 4\u4e94\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0cGPT 5\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5f53k=10\u65f6\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523039.1%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u524d\u6cbfLLMs\u5728\u79d1\u7814\u8bba\u6587\u9519\u8bef\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3aLLMs\u8f85\u52a9\u5b66\u672f\u8bc4\u5ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

To address this, we conducted a controlled Wizard of Oz (WOZ) experiment to elicit interactions with targeted affective trajectories. The resulting corpus, EmoWOZ-CS, contains 2,148 bilingual (Dutch-English) written dialogues from 179 participants across commercial aviation, e-commerce, online travel agencies, and telecommunication scenarios. Our contributions are threefold: (1) Evaluate WOZ-based operator-steered valence trajectories as a design for emotion research; (2) Quantify human annotation performance and variation, including divergences between self-reports and third-party judgments; (3) Benchmark detection and forward-looking emotion inference in real-time support. Findings show neutral dominates participant messages; desire and gratitude are the most frequent non-neutral emotions. Agreement is moderate for multilabel emotions and valence, lower for arousal and dominance; self-reports diverge notably from third-party labels, aligning most for neutral, gratitude, and anger. Objective strategies often elicit neutrality or gratitude, while suboptimal strategies increase anger, annoyance, disappointment, desire, and confusion.

Our contributions are twofold: (1) we create a new, balanced dataset of Chinese lyrics spanning multiple genres, and (2) we develop and fine-tune a domain-specific model, comparing its performance against zero-shot inference using the DeepSeek LLM.\n  We test two central hypotheses. First, we hypothesize that a fine-tuned model will outperform a zero-shot LLM baseline. Second, we hypothesize that performance is genre-dependent. Our experiments strongly confirm Hypothesis 2: structured genres (e.g. Folklore & Tradition) yield significantly higher attribution accuracy than more abstract genres (e.g. Love & Romance). Hypothesis 1 receives only partial support: fine-tuning improves robustness and generalization in Test1 (real-world data and difficult genres), but offers limited or ambiguous gains in Test2, a smaller, synthetically-augmented set. We show that the design limitations of Test2 (e.g., label imbalance, shallow lexical differences, and narrow genre sampling) can obscure the true effectiveness of fine-tuning.\n  Our work establishes the first benchmark for cross-genre Chinese lyric attribution, highlights the importance of genre-sensitive evaluation, and provides a public dataset and analytical framework for future research.

Here, we present a pipeline to systematically probe attention mechanisms, and we illustrate its value by leveraging lexical ambiguity--where a single word has multiple meanings--to isolate attention mechanisms that contribute to word sense disambiguation. We take a \"developmental\" approach: first, using publicly available Pythia LM checkpoints, we identify inflection points in disambiguation performance for each LM in the suite; in 14M and 410M, we identify heads whose attention to disambiguating words covaries with overall disambiguation performance across development. We then stress-test the robustness of these heads to stimulus perturbations: in 14M, we find limited robustness, but in 410M, we identify multiple heads with surprisingly generalizable behavior. Then, in a causal analysis, we find that ablating the target heads demonstrably impairs disambiguation performance, particularly in 14M. We additionally reproduce developmental analyses of 14M across all of its random seeds. Together, these results suggest: that disambiguation benefits from a constellation of mechanisms, some of which (especially in 14M) are highly sensitive to the position and part-of-speech of the disambiguating cue; and that larger models (410M) may contain heads with more robust disambiguation behavior.

Entries were validated through semantic clustering and manual annotation by culturally informed reviewers. Preliminary evaluation of language models reveals that nine of eleven models exhibit statistically significant bias, with Bias Preference Ratios (BPR) ranging from 0.63 to 0.78 (p <= 0.05), indicating systematic preferences for stereotypes over antistereotypes, particularly across age, profession, and gender dimensions. Domain-specific models appeared to show weaker bias in our setup, suggesting task-specific training may mitigate some associations. Looking ahead, AfriStereo opens pathways for future research on culturally grounded bias evaluation and mitigation, offering key methodologies for the AI community on building more equitable, context-aware, and globally inclusive NLP technologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86AfriStereo\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u975e\u6d32\u793e\u4f1a\u6587\u5316\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u975e\u6d32\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AI\u504f\u89c1\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u591a\u53cd\u6620\u897f\u65b9\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u975e\u6d32\u8bed\u5883\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5404\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u5bb3\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u585e\u5185\u52a0\u5c14\u3001\u80af\u5c3c\u4e9a\u548c\u5c3c\u65e5\u5229\u4e9a\u7684\u793e\u533a\u53c2\u4e0e\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u4e861,163\u4e2a\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528few-shot\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6269\u5c55\u81f35,000\u591a\u4e2a\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61-\u53cd\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u5bf9\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u7531\u6587\u5316\u77e5\u60c5\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5458\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u6b65\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c11\u4e2a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u67099\u4e2a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0a\u7684\u663e\u8457\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u504f\u89c1\u504f\u597d\u6bd4\u7387\uff08BPR\uff09\u57280.63\u52300.78\u4e4b\u95f4\uff08p <= 0.05\uff09\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5bf9\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u504f\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "AfriStereo\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u5316\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u793e\u533a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u3001\u5177\u6709\u60c5\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u5168\u7403\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u7684NLP\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5173\u952e\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce ResearchArcade, a graph-based interface that connects multiple academic data sources, unifies task definitions, and supports a wide range of base models to address key academic challenges. ResearchArcade utilizes a coherent multi-table format with graph structures to organize data from different sources, including academic corpora from ArXiv and peer reviews from OpenReview, while capturing information with multiple modalities, such as text, figures, and tables. ResearchArcade also preserves temporal evolution at both the manuscript and community levels, supporting the study of paper revisions as well as broader research trends over time. Additionally, ResearchArcade unifies diverse academic task definitions and supports various models with distinct input requirements. Our experiments across six academic tasks demonstrate that combining cross-source and multi-modal information enables a broader range of tasks, while incorporating graph structures consistently improves performance over baseline methods.

However, when both text and images exist in the database, similarity scores would differ in scale by modality. This phenomenon, known as the modality gap, hinders accurate retrieval. Most existing studies address this issue with manually labeled data, e.g., by fine-tuning VLMs on them. In this work, we propose a similarity standardization approach with pseudo data construction. We first compute the mean and variance of the similarity scores between each query and its paired data in text or image modality. Using these modality-specific statistics, we standardize all similarity scores to compare on a common scale across modalities. These statistics are calculated from pseudo pairs, which are constructed by retrieving the text and image candidates with the highest cosine similarity to each query. We evaluate our method across seven VLMs using two multi-modal QA benchmarks (MMQA and WebQA), where each question requires retrieving either text or image data. Our experimental results show that our method significantly improves retrieval performance, achieving average Recall@20 gains of 64% on MMQA and 28% on WebQA when the query and the target data belong to different modalities.

Existing text detectors typically rely on a single methodological paradigm and suffer from poor generalization and high false positive rates (FPR), especially on high-stakes academic text. We propose a theoretically grounded hybrid ensemble that systematically fuses three complementary detection paradigms: (i) a RoBERTa-based transformer classifier for deep semantic feature extraction, (ii) a GPT-2-based probabilistic detector using perturbation-induced likelihood curvature, and (iii) a statistical linguistic feature analyzer capturing stylometric patterns. The core novelty lies in an optimized weighted voting framework, where ensemble weights are learned on the probability simplex to maximize F1-score rather than set heuristically. We provide a bias-variance analysis and empirically demonstrate low inter-model correlation (rho ~ 0.35-0.42), a key condition for variance reduction. Evaluated on a large-scale, multigenerator corpus of 30,000 documents, our system achieves 94.2% accuracy and an AUC of 0.978, with a 35% relative reduction in false positives on academic text.

While DYNARTmo does not implement full task-dynamic second-order biomechanics, it adopts first-order task-space gesture specifications comparable to those used in articulatory phonology and integrates a simplified mechanism for distributing articulatory effort across multiple articulators. We first outline the conceptual relationship between task dynamics and DYNARTmo, emphasizing the distinction between high-level task-space trajectories and their low-level articulatory execution. We then present simulation results for a set of CV syllables that illustrate how jaw displacement varies as a function of both place of articulation (labial, apical, dorsal) and vowel context (/a/, /i/, /u/). The model reproduces empirically attested patterns of articulatory synergy, including jaw-supported apical closures, lower-lip elevation in bilabial stops, tongue-jaw co-movement, and saturation effects in labial constrictions. These results demonstrate that even with computationally simplified assumptions, DYNARTmo can generate realistic spatio-temporal movement patterns that capture key aspects of articulatory tradeoff and synergy across a range of consonant-vowel combinations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u53d1\u97f3\u6a21\u578bDYNARTmo\u5982\u4f55\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3b\u8981\u548c\u6b21\u8981\u53d1\u97f3\u5668\u5b98\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53d1\u97f3\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u5507-\u4e0b\u988c\u548c\u820c-\u4e0b\u988c\u534f\u8c03\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u97f3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u53d1\u97f3\u5668\u5b98\u95f4\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u4e0e\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u53d1\u97f3\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e00\u9636\u4efb\u52a1\u7a7a\u95f4\u624b\u52bf\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u591a\u53d1\u97f3\u5668\u5b98\u52aa\u529b\u5206\u5e03\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217CV\u97f3\u8282\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u91cd\u73b0\u4e86\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u53d1\u97f3\u534f\u540c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e0b\u988c\u652f\u6301\u7684\u5c16\u7aef\u95ed\u5408\u3001\u53cc\u5507\u585e\u97f3\u7684\u4e0b\u5507\u62ac\u9ad8\u3001\u820c-\u4e0b\u988c\u534f\u540c\u8fd0\u52a8\u4ee5\u53ca\u5507\u7f29\u5408\u4e2d\u7684\u9971\u548c\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5373\u4f7f\u91c7\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0cDYNARTmo\u4ecd\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u53d1\u97f3\u65f6\u7a7a\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u5230\u53d1\u97f3\u6743\u8861\u548c\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u5173\u952e\u65b9\u9762\u3002"}}

The recent advent of reasoning models that exhibit self-reflection patterns in their chains-of-thought further motivates this question.

We evaluate two refinement modes: (1) guided refinement, where an LM is provided natural language feedback, and (2) self-refinement, where LMs attempt to improve without guidance. In the self-refinement setting, even frontier LMs such as Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5 achieve modest baseline scores of 31.3% and 29.1%, respectively, and most models fail to consistently improve across iterations (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro gains only +1.8%, while DeepSeek-R1 declines by -0.1%). By contrast, in guided refinement, both proprietary LMs and large open-weight LMs (>70B) can leverage targeted feedback to refine responses to near-perfect levels within five turns. These findings suggest that frontier LMs require breakthroughs to self-refine their incorrect responses, and that RefineBench provides a valuable testbed for tracking progress.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86RefineBench\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b11\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u76841000\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u524d\u6cbf\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6709\u6307\u5bfc\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7ecf\u5e38\u6d89\u53ca\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u8bf7\u6c42\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5bf9\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u5173\u6ce8\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u968f\u7740\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\u80fd\u529b\u53d8\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86RefineBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b11\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u76841000\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6e05\u5355\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4fee\u6b63\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a(1) \u6709\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c(2) \u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\uff0cGemini 2.5 Pro\u548cGPT-5\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u5f97\u5206\u5206\u522b\u4e3a31.3%\u548c29.1%\uff0c\u4e14\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5927\u578b\u5f00\u653e\u6743\u91cd\u6a21\u578b\uff08>70B\uff09\u5728\u4e94\u8f6e\u5185\u53ef\u5c06\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u7f8e\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u524d\u6cbf\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u9700\u8981\u7a81\u7834\uff0cRefineBench\u4e3a\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8fdb\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u3002"}}

Existing efficiency approaches typically focus on model-centric interventions, such as reinforcement learning or supervised fine-tuning, to reduce verbosity. In contrast, we propose a training-free, input-centric approach. Inspired by cognitive psychology, we introduce Focused Chain-of-Thought (F-CoT), which separates information extraction from the reasoning process. F-CoT first organizes the essential information from a query into a concise, structured context and then guides the model to reason exclusively over this context. By preventing attention to irrelevant details, F-CoT naturally produces shorter reasoning paths. On arithmetic word problems, F-CoT reduces generated tokens by 2-3x while maintaining accuracy comparable to standard zero-shot CoT.

However, existing evaluation and reward mechanisms used to train and assess the text-to-SQL models remain a critical bottleneck. Current approaches heavily rely on manually annotated gold SQL queries, which are costly to produce and impractical for large-scale evaluation. More importantly, most reinforcement learning (RL) methods in text-to-SQL leverage only the final binary execution outcome as the reward signal, a coarse-grained supervision that overlooks detailed structural and semantic errors from the perspective of rubrics. To address these challenges, we propose RuCo-C, a novel generative judge model for fine-grained, query-specific automatic evaluation using interpretable critiques without human intervention. Our framework first automatically generates query-specific evaluation rubrics for human-free annotation, linking them to interpretable critiques. Subsequently, it integrates densified reward feedback through a \"progressive exploration\" strategy during the RL training process, which dynamically adjusts the rewards to enhance the model's performance.

Shopee, as one of the largest e-commerce platforms in Southeast Asia, receives millions of product reviews every day containing valuable information regarding customer satisfaction and preferences. Manual analysis of these reviews is inefficient, thus requiring a computational approach such as sentiment analysis. This study examines the use of DistilBERT, a lightweight transformer-based deep learning model, for sentiment classification on Shopee product reviews. The dataset used consists of approximately one million English-language reviews that have been preprocessed and trained using the distilbert-base-uncased model. Evaluation was conducted using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics, and compared against benchmark models such as BERT and SVM. The results show that DistilBERT achieved an accuracy of 94.8%, slightly below BERT (95.3%) but significantly higher than SVM (90.2%), with computation time reduced by more than 55%. These findings demonstrate that DistilBERT provides an optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency, making it suitable for large scale sentiment analysis on e-commerce platforms.

Distinct from uncertainty quantification, which measures output confidence, this work examines input-side representational sensitivity to linguistic uncertainty in medical text. We curate a contrastive dataset of clinical statements varying in epistemic modality (e.g., 'is consistent with' vs. 'may be consistent with') and propose Model Sensitivity to Uncertainty (MSU), a layerwise probing metric that quantifies activation-level shifts induced by uncertainty cues. Our results show that LLMs exhibit structured, depth-dependent sensitivity to clinical uncertainty, suggesting that epistemic information is progressively encoded in deeper layers.

An A/B user study further confirms that RAG-enhanced assistants improve perceived helpfulness, truthfulness, and satisfaction over general-purpose LLMs. These findings provide insights for deploying efficient, domain-aligned LLM-based assistants in industrial HIL environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86HIL-GPT\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u6c7d\u8f66\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2dHIL\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u5206\u6563\u548c\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u4ef6\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "HIL\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5728\u6c7d\u8f66\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u4ef6\u5206\u6563\u4e14\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6574\u5408\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "method": "HIL-GPT\u5229\u7528\u5d4c\u5165\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u6316\u6398\u548cLLM\u8f85\u52a9\u5408\u6210\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5411\u91cf\u7d22\u5f15\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u548c\u9700\u6c42\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u6210\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002A/B\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u8bc1\u5b9e\uff0cRAG\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u52a9\u624b\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u5e2e\u52a9\u6027\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528LLMs\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5728\u5de5\u4e1aHIL\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u3001\u9886\u57df\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u52a9\u624b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

This paper investigates the capability of LLMs to perform ontology matching directly on ontology modules and generate the corresponding alignments.

The proposed method incorporates a search space reduction technique to select relevant subsets from both source and target ontologies, which are then used to automatically construct prompts. Recognizing the scarcity of reference alignments for training, a novel LLM-based approach is introduced for generating a synthetic dataset. This process creates a corpus of ontology submodule pairs and their corresponding reference alignments, specifically designed to fine-tune an LLM for the ontology matching task. The proposed approach was evaluated on the Conference, Geolink, Enslaved, Taxon, and Hydrography datasets from the OAEI complex track. The results demonstrate that the LLM fine-tuned on the synthetically generated data exhibits superior performance compared to the non-fine-tuned base model.

Despite significant advancements, state-of-the-art multilingual models still face challenges in handling Romanized script, where the Roman alphabet is adopted to represent the phonetic structure of diverse languages. Within the South Asian context, where the use of Romanized script for Indo-Aryan languages is widespread across social media and digital communication platforms, such usage continues to pose significant challenges for cutting-edge multilingual models. While a limited number of transliteration datasets and models are available for Indo-Aryan languages, they generally lack sufficient diversity in pronunciation and spelling variations, adequate code-mixed data for large language model (LLM) training, and low-resource adaptation. To address this research gap, we introduce a novel transliteration dataset for two popular Indo-Aryan languages, Hindi and Bengali, which are ranked as the 3rd and 7th most spoken languages worldwide. Our dataset comprises nearly 1.8 million Hindi and 1 million Bengali transliteration pairs.

To address these challenges, our study employs a mixed-methods approach to evaluate the efficacy of LLMs in psychotherapy. We use LLMs to generate precise summaries of motivational interviewing (MI) dialogues and design a two-stage annotation scheme based on key components of the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) framework, namely evocation, collaboration, autonomy, direction, empathy, and a non-judgmental attitude. Using expert-annotated MI dialogues as ground truth, we formulate multi-class classification tasks to assess model performance under progressive prompting techniques, incorporating one-shot and few-shot prompting. Our results offer insights into LLMs' capacity for understanding complex psychological constructs and highlight best practices to mitigate ``semantic drift\" in therapeutic settings.

When considering the substitution of these expert roles with a RAG-based LLM system, the constraint of strict adherence to legal norms is imposed. Specifically, three requirements arise: (1) the retrieval module must retrieve appropriate external knowledge relevant to the disputed issues in accordance with the principle prohibiting the use of private knowledge, (2) the responses generated must originate from the context provided by the RAG and remain faithful to that context, and (3) the retrieval module must reference external knowledge with appropriate timestamps corresponding to the issues at hand. This paper discusses the design of a RAG-based LLM system that satisfies these requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86RAG-based LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u652f\u6301\u7b26\u5408\u6cd5\u5f8b\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u65e5\u672c\u533b\u7597\u8bc9\u8bbc\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e2d\u5e94\u5177\u5907\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8bc9\u8bbc\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e13\u5bb6\u59d4\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e13\u4e1a\u610f\u89c1\u5e2e\u52a9\u6cd5\u5b98\u6f84\u6e05\u4e89\u8bae\u70b9\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u5982\u4f55\u7528RAG-based LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u66ff\u4ee3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e13\u5bb6\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u5e76\u4e25\u683c\u9075\u5b88\u6cd5\u5f8b\u89c4\u8303\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u6ee1\u8db3\u4ee5\u4e0b\u8981\u6c42\u7684RAG-based LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1a(1)\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u5757\u5fc5\u987b\u6309\u7167\u7981\u6b62\u79c1\u4eba\u77e5\u8bc6\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u4e89\u8bae\u95ee\u9898\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5916\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b(2)\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56de\u7b54\u5fc5\u987b\u6e90\u81eaRAG\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u5fe0\u5b9e\uff1b(3)\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u5757\u5fc5\u987b\u5f15\u7528\u5177\u6709\u9002\u5f53\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b26\u5408\u4e0a\u8ff0\u8981\u6c42\u7684RAG-based LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u65e5\u672c\u7684\u533b\u7597\u8bc9\u8bbc\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u4e2a\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e25\u683c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u89c4\u8303\u7684RAG-based LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u662f\u66ff\u4ee3\u4e13\u5bb6\u59d4\u5458\u89d2\u8272\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Workshop: LAW 2025: Bridging Language, Agent, and World Models", "summary": "To interact effectively with humans in the real world, it is important for agents to understand language that describes the dynamics of the environment--that is, how the environment behaves--rather than just task instructions specifying \"what to do\". Understanding this dynamics-descriptive language is important for human-agent interaction and agent behavior. Recent work address this problem using a model-based approach: language is incorporated into a world model, which is then used to learn a behavior policy. However, these existing methods either do not demonstrate policy generalization to unseen games or rely on limiting assumptions. For instance, assuming that the latency induced by inference-time planning is tolerable for the target task or expert demonstrations are available. Expanding on this line of research, we focus on improving policy generalization from a language-conditioned world model while dropping these assumptions. We propose a model-based reinforcement learning approach, where a language-conditioned world model is trained through interaction with the environment, and a policy is learned from this model--without planning or expert demonstrations. Our method proposes Language-aware Encoder for Dreamer World Model (LED-WM) built on top of DreamerV3. LED-WM features an observation encoder that uses an attention mechanism to explicitly ground language descriptions to entities in the observation. We show that policies trained with LED-WM generalize more effectively to unseen games described by novel dynamics and language compared to other baselines in several settings in two environments: MESSENGER and MESSENGER-WM.To highlight how the policy can leverage the trained world model before real-world deployment, we demonstrate the policy can be improved through fine-tuning on synthetic test trajectories generated by the world model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u5347\u7b56\u7565\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u89c4\u5212\u6216\u4e13\u5bb6\u6f14\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u8ba9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e92\u52a8\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u63cf\u8ff0\u73af\u5883\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u800c\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u4e86Language-aware Encoder for Dreamer World Model (LED-WM)\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5c06\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e0e\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u8fde\u63a5\u3002", "result": "\u5728MESSENGER\u548cMESSENGER-WM\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528LED-WM\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u7684\u73af\u5883\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Given an idiom, the system iteratively (i) generates detailed visual prompts, (ii) synthesizes an image, (iii) infers the idiom from the image, and (iv) refines the prompt until recognition succeeds or a step limit is reached. Using 1,000 idioms as inputs, we synthesize a corresponding dataset of visual pun images with paired prompts, enabling benchmarking of both generation and understanding.

Speculative Decoding (SPD) mitigates this issue by verifying candidate tokens in parallel from a smaller draft model, yet its strict exact-match verification discards many semantically valid continuations. Moreover, existing training-based SPD methods often suffer from performance degradation on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. To this end, we propose Training-Free Loosely Speculative Decoding (FLy), a novel method that loosens the rigid verification criterion by leveraging the target model's self-corrective behavior to judge whether a draft-target mismatch remains semantically valid. FLy introduces a two-tier mechanism: an entropy-level gate that identifies whether the current token allows multiple plausible alternatives or is nearly deterministic, and a token-level deferred window that distinguishes genuine errors from differently worded yet semantically correct variants. To further reduce latency, we design a multi-level acceleration strategy that accelerates not only the target model but also the drafter itself. Owing to its training-free design, FLy composes seamlessly with arbitrary draft-target pairs and generalizes across models and domains without hyperparameter re-tuning. Experiments show that FLy preserves more than 99% of the target model's accuracy while achieving an average 2.81x speedup on Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct and 5.07x speedup on the 405B variant.

Test-time expansion methods such as Tree-of-Thought (ToT) and Graph-of-Thought (GoT) enhance reasoning by introducing intermediate reasoning structures, tree search, or graph-based exploration mechanisms. However, their reasoning strategies suffer from limited diversity, redundant search branches, and inadequate integration and error correction across heterogeneous reasoning paths. To address these limitations, we propose a novel reasoning framework called Multi-chain Graph Refinement & Selection (MGRS), which first generates multiple diverse reasoning trajectories for a given problem, refines candidate responses using a composite self- and cross-verification strategy, then constructs a reasoning relation graph and estimates the success rate of intermediate nodes, and finally computes cumulative success rates to select the most reliable answer and corresponding reasoning trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that MGRS significantly advances both the reasoning capability and computational efficiency of reasoning enhancement methods. Across six benchmark datasets spanning four distinct tasks, MGRS achieves an average accuracy of 82.9%, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by a clear margin of 2.1%.

Prior methods relying on marker-based prediction struggle with modeling the intricate relationships among elements and experience sharp performance declines when predicting higher-order elements (e.g., c and s) under standard supervised fine-tuning. To address these limitations, we employ reasoning-based generation to output both the quadruple and a natural language rationale under element prefixes within a unified template, encouraging explicit relational reasoning and interpretability. To further enhance element-wise alignment, we introduce a listwise preference optimization framework for improving structural validity and relational coherence. Specifically, we generate element-wise confusable candidates via syntactic and semantic proximity, then train the model with listwise objectives to prefer the gold candidates over closely competing alternatives. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework effectively improves quadruple prediction accuracy and explanation consistency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u9762\u60c5\u611f\u56db\u5143\u7ec4\u9884\u6d4b\uff08ASQP\uff09\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5217\u8868\u5f0f\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u56db\u5143\u7ec4\u4e2d\u5143\u7d20\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u9636\u5143\u7d20\uff08\u5982\u65b9\u9762\u7c7b\u522b\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u6781\u6027\uff09\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u677f\u4e0b\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u524d\u7f00\u8f93\u51fa\u56db\u5143\u7ec4\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u660e\u786e\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u5217\u8868\u5f0f\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u4e8e\u53e5\u6cd5\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u63a5\u8fd1\u6027\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u53ef\u6df7\u6dc6\u5019\u9009\u9879\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u5217\u8868\u5f0f\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5148\u9009\u62e9\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u5019\u9009\u9879\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u56db\u5143\u7ec4\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5217\u8868\u5f0f\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86ASQP\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This article addresses temporal text classification using interpretable, feature-engineered tree-based machine learning models. We integrate five feature categories - compression-based, lexical structure, readability, neologism detection, and distance features - to predict the temporal origin of English texts spanning five centuries. Comparative analysis shows that these feature domains provide complementary temporal signals, with combined models outperforming any individual feature set. On a large-scale corpus, we achieve 76.7% accuracy for century-scale prediction and 26.1% for decade-scale classification, substantially above random baselines (20% and 2.3%). Under relaxed temporal precision, performance increases to 96.0% top-2 accuracy for centuries and 85.8% top-10 accuracy for decades. The final model exhibits strong ranking capabilities with AUCROC up to 94.8% and AUPRC up to 83.3%, and maintains controlled errors with mean absolute deviations of 27 years and 30 years, respectively. For authentication-style tasks, binary models around key thresholds (e.g., 1850-1900) reach 85-98% accuracy. Feature importance analysis identifies distance features and lexical structure as most informative, with compression-based features providing complementary signals. SHAP explainability reveals systematic linguistic evolution patterns, with the 19th century emerging as a pivot point across feature domains.

Targeting ten tourism-centric subdomains-Ganga Aarti, Cruise, Food Court, Public Toilet, Kund, Museum, General, Ashram, Temple and Travel, the work addresses the absence of language-specific QA resources in Hindi for culturally nuanced applications. In this paper, a dataset comprising 7,715 Hindi QA pairs pertaining to Varanasi tourism was constructed and subsequently augmented with 27,455 pairs generated via Llama zero-shot prompting. We propose a framework leveraging foundation models-BERT and RoBERTa, fine-tuned using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), to optimize parameter efficiency and task performance. Multiple variants of BERT, including pre-trained languages (e.g., Hindi-BERT), are evaluated to assess their suitability for low-resource domain-specific QA. Evaluation metrics - F1, BLEU, and ROUGE-L - highlight trade-offs between answer precision and linguistic fluency. Experiments demonstrate that LoRA-based fine-tuning achieves competitive performance (85.3\\% F1) while reducing trainable parameters by 98\\% compared to SFT, striking a balance between efficiency and accuracy. Comparative analysis across models reveals that RoBERTa with SFT outperforms BERT variants in capturing contextual nuances, particularly for culturally embedded terms (e.g., Aarti, Kund).

Full ByT5 fine-tuning attains the lowest error across all metrics; LoRA offers strong efficiency-accuracy trade-offs, and BiLSTM-CRF serves as a transparent baseline.

However, it remains constrained by issues such as context window length, inference cost, and format hallucination. We present Dripper, an efficient HTML main content extraction framework powered by lightweight language models, which addresses these challenges through four key innovations: (1) We design a specialized HTML simplification algorithm that reduces input token count to 22\\% compared to raw HTML while preserving critical structural information; (2) We reformulate main content extraction as a semantic block sequence classification task, significantly reducing inference cost; (3) We introduce a controlled decoding mechanism that strictly constrains the output space through logits processors, effectively eliminating hallucination issues common in small-scale models; (4) We propose WebMainBench, an evaluation dataset containing over 7,800 web pages with meticulously human-annotated main content extraction labels. Experimental results demonstrate that using only a 0.6B parameter model, Dripper achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluation benchmarks and outperforms all baseline methods, attaining an ROUGE-N F1 score of 81.58\\%( 83.13\\% with fall-back strategy) on our proposed WebMainBench dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "Dripper\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5229\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548HTML\u4e3b\u8981\u5185\u5bb9\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u957f\u5ea6\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u548c\u683c\u5f0f\u5e7b\u89c9\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ece\u7f51\u9875\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u63d0\u53d6\u4e3b\u8981\u5185\u5bb9\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u957f\u5ea6\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u548c\u683c\u5f0f\u5e7b\u89c9\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "Dripper\u91c7\u7528\u56db\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a(1) \u4e13\u7528HTML\u7b80\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u8f93\u5165tokens\uff1b(2) \u5c06\u5185\u5bb9\u63d0\u53d6\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u5757\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b(3) \u5f15\u5165\u53d7\u63a7\u89e3\u7801\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u5e7b\u89c9\uff1b(4) \u63d0\u51faWebMainBench\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u4ec5\u4f7f\u75280.6B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\uff0cDripper\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728WebMainBench\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684ROUGE-N F1\u5f97\u5206\u8fbe\u523081.58%\uff08\u4f7f\u7528\u56de\u9000\u7b56\u7565\u65f6\u4e3a83.13%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "Dripper\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u7f51\u9875\u4e3b\u8981\u5185\u5bb9\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Differentiating between safety influenced refusals or politically motivated censorship is hard and unclear. For this purpose we introduce PSP, a dataset built specifically to probe the refusal behaviors in LLMs from an explicitly political context. PSP is built by formatting existing censored content from two data sources, openly available on the internet: sensitive prompts in China generalized to multiple countries, and tweets that have been censored in various countries. We study: 1) impact of political sensitivity in seven LLMs through data-driven (making PSP implicit) and representation-level approaches (erasing the concept of politics); and, 2) vulnerability of models on PSP through prompt injection attacks (PIAs). Associating censorship with refusals on content with masked implicit intent, we find that most LLMs perform some form of censorship.

Existing solutions either rely on complex mixed-precision engineering or invasive architectural modifications. This paper fundamentally challenges the conventional wisdom that outliers are data-driven. We demonstrate that extreme outliers are a data-independent, mechanically-produced artifact of training, originating from specific structural properties of the weight matrices (i.e., colinearity). Based on this insight, we propose TWEO (Transformers Without Extreme Outliers), a novel, non-invasive loss function. TWEO effectively prevents extreme outliers via a very simple loss term, which reduces outliers from 10000+ to less than 20. TWEO then enables full-model FP8 pre-training with neither engineering tricks nor architectural changes for both LLM and ViT. When standard FP8 training catastrophically collapses, TWEO achieves performance comparable to the BF16 baseline while delivering a 36% increase in training throughput. Also, TWEO enables a new quantization paradigm. Hardware-friendly W8A8 per-tensor static quantization of LLMs, previously considered completely unusable due to outliers, achieves SOTA performance for the first time on TWEO-trained models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86Transformer\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u6781\u7aef\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u6210\u56e0\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570TWEO\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0FP8\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u786c\u4ef6\u4e2d\u672c\u5730FP8\u652f\u6301\u5bf9\u5927\u578bTransformer\u8bad\u7ec3\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u6781\u7aef\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u963b\u788d\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4f9d\u8d56\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5de5\u7a0b\u6216\u67b6\u6784\u4fee\u6539\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc1\u660e\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u662f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7531\u6743\u91cd\u77e9\u9635\u7279\u5b9a\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\uff08\u5171\u7ebf\u6027\uff09\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u673a\u68b0\u6027\u4ea7\u7269\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570TWEO\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u6781\u7aef\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u3002", "result": "TWEO\u5c06\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u4ece10000+\u51cf\u5c11\u5230\u5c11\u4e8e20\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5168\u6a21\u578bFP8\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5de5\u7a0b\u6280\u5de7\u6216\u67b6\u6784\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0eBF16\u57fa\u51c6\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u534736%\u3002", "conclusion": "TWEO\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u6781\u7aef\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\uff0c\u8fd8\u4f7fW8A8\u6bcf\u5f20\u91cf\u9759\u6001\u91cf\u5316\u5728LLM\u4e0a\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5316\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u94fa\u8def\u3002"}}

To enable this, we propose a lightweight three-stage training framework that learns a single prompt-specific Behavior-Equivalent token ([BE]). The framework first trains [BE] to encode the natural-language content of the original system prompt via reconstruction, and then distills the prompt 's downstream behavior into this single token. Importantly, our method requires no access to model internals, no auxiliary compression models, and no labeled responses. Empirical evaluations on three datasets show that a single [BE] token achieves up to a 3000x reduction in prompt length, while retaining about 98% of the downstream performance of the original system prompts.

This work addresses that gap by introducing SSA-HuBERT-Large (317M parameters) and SSA-HuBERT-XL (964M parameters), the first large models trained solely on African speech, alongside a BASE size counterpart. We release these models as open weights: see https://huggingface.co/collections/Orange/african-speech-foundation-models.

While fine-tuning is effective for adapting these multimodal language models (MLMs) to downstream tasks, full fine-tuning is computationally expensive. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods address this by training only a small portion of model weights. However, MLMs are difficult to interpret, making it challenging to identify which components are most effective for training to balance efficiency and performance. We propose an attention-based interpretability method for MLMs by analyzing attention scores relative to image tokens. The core idea is to identify attention heads that focus on image key objects. We utilize this information to select optimal model components for PEFT in multimodal models. Our contributions include a method for identifying attention heads associated with image key objects, its application to PEFT for image captioning, and the creation of a new dataset containing images, key object masks, and their textual descriptions. We conducted experiments on MLMs with 2-3 billion parameters to validate the method's effectiveness. By calculating Head Impact (HI) scores we quantify an attention head's focus on key objects, indicating its significance in image understanding. Our fine-tuning experiments demonstrate that adapting layers with the highest HI scores leads to the most significant shifts in metrics compared to pre-trained, randomly selected, or lowest-HI-score layers. This indicates that fine-tuning a small percentage (around 0.01%) of parameters in these crucial layers can substantially influence image understanding capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u5173\u952e\u5bf9\u8c61\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\uff0c\u4ee5\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u4ef6\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff08PEFT\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLMs\uff09\u5728\u9002\u5e94\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\uff0c\u5168\u91cf\u5fae\u8c03\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u3002PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u5927\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u7ec4\u4ef6\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5f97\u5206\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u5173\u952e\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5173\u6ce8\u56fe\u50cf\u5173\u952e\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u3002\u57fa\u4e8eHead Impact (HI) \u5206\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u7ec4\u4ef6\u8fdb\u884cPEFT\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u5b57\u5e55\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8c03\u6574HI\u5206\u6570\u6700\u9ad8\u5c42\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u4e0e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u968f\u673a\u9009\u62e9\u6216\u6700\u4f4eHI\u5206\u6570\u5c42\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5173\u952e\u5c42\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u6700\u5927\u7684\u6307\u6807\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5fae\u8c03\u4e00\u5c0f\u90e8\u5206\uff08\u7ea60.01%\uff09\u5173\u952e\u5c42\u53c2\u6570\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Recent research has increasingly focused on the role of token importance in improving DPO effectiveness. It is observed that identical or semantically similar content (defined as ambiguous content) frequently appears within the preference pairs. We hypothesize that the presence of ambiguous content during DPO training may introduce ambiguity, thereby limiting further improvements in alignment. Through mathematical analysis and proof-of-concept experiments, we reveal that ambiguous content may potentially introduce ambiguities, thereby degrading performance. To address this issue, we introduce Ambiguity Awareness Optimization (AAO), a simple yet effective approach that automatically re-weights ambiguous content to reduce ambiguities by calculating semantic similarity from preference pairs. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that AAO consistently and significantly surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in performance, without markedly increasing response length, across multiple model scales and widely adopted benchmark datasets, including AlpacaEval 2, MT-Bench, and Arena-Hard.
