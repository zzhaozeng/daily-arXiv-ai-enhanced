As a result, LM performance on reasoning under uncertainty remains\npoorly characterized. To address this gap, we introduce OpenEstimate, an\nextensible, multi-domain benchmark for evaluating LMs on numerical estimation\ntasks that require models to synthesize significant amounts of background\ninformation and express predictions as probabilistic priors.

Our preliminary experiments suggest that this degradation stems\nfrom the unstructured latent space, which makes fitting latent tokens\ndifficult. To address this, we restrict the latent space to the column space of\nthe LLM vocabulary, treating latent reasoning as a superposition over\nvocabulary probabilities. Once latent reasoning concludes, it collapses into an\neigenstate of explicit reasoning to yield the final answer. Based on this idea,\nwe propose Latent-SFT, a two-stage learning framework. In the first stage, we\ndesign two specialized attention masks to guide the Latent Token Encoder in\ngenerating latent tokens, allowing the LLM to produce the correct answer\nconditioned on them. In the second stage, the Latent Token Encoder is\ndiscarded, and the LLM is directly trained to generate these latent tokens\nautonomously for latent reasoning, optimized with KL and CE losses. Latent-SFT\nsets a new state of the art on GSM8k, matching explicit SFT performance while\ncutting reasoning chains by up to 4 times and outperforming prior latent\nmethods.

Recently, Generative AI has been\nproposed as a competitor to AES systems in evaluating student essays\nautomatically. Considering the potential limitations of AI in processing\nidioms, this study assessed the scoring performances of Generative AI models\nfor essays with and without idioms by incorporating insights from Corpus\nLinguistics and Computational Linguistics. Two equal essay lists were created\nfrom 348 student essays taken from a corpus: one with multiple idioms present\nin each essay and another with no idioms in essays. Three Generative AI models\n(ChatGPT, Gemini, and Deepseek) were asked to score all essays in both lists\nthree times, using the same rubric used by human raters in assigning essay\nscores. The results revealed excellent consistency for all models, but Gemini\noutperformed its competitors in interrater reliability with human raters. There\nwas also no detectable bias for any demographic group in AI assessment. For\nessays with multiple idioms, Gemini followed a the most similar pattern to\nhuman raters. While the models in the study demonstrated potential for a hybrid\napproach, Gemini was the best candidate for the task due to its ability to\nhandle figurative language and showed promise for handling essay-scoring tasks\nalone in the future."}

Recognizing these\nsubtle expressions is critical for applications in psychology, security, and\nbehavioral analysis. Although deep learning has enabled significant advances in\nmicro-expression recognition (MER), its effectiveness is limited by the\nscarcity of annotated ME datasets. This data limitation not only hinders\ngeneralization but also restricts the diversity of motion patterns captured\nduring training. Existing MER studies predominantly rely on simple spatial\naugmentations (e.g., flipping, rotation) and overlook temporal augmentation\nstrategies that can better exploit motion characteristics. To address this gap,\nthis paper proposes a phase-aware temporal augmentation method based on dynamic\nimage. Rather than encoding the entire expression as a single onset-to-offset\ndynamic image (DI), our approach decomposes each expression sequence into two\nmotion phases: onset-to-apex and apex-to-offset. A separate DI is generated for\neach phase, forming a Dual-phase DI augmentation strategy. These phase-specific\nrepresentations enrich motion diversity and introduce complementary temporal\ncues that are crucial for recognizing subtle facial transitions. Extensive\nexperiments on CASME-II and SAMM datasets using six deep architectures,\nincluding CNNs, Vision Transformer, and the lightweight LEARNet, demonstrate\nconsistent performance improvements in recognition accuracy, unweighted\nF1-score, and unweighted average recall, which are crucial for addressing class\nimbalance in MER. When combined with spatial augmentations, our method achieves\nup to a 10\\% relative improvement. The proposed augmentation is simple,\nmodel-agnostic, and effective in low-resource settings, offering a promising\ndirection for robust and generalizable MER."}

It has broad applications across various real-world\napplications, including remote sensing element interpretation, ecological\nenvironment monitoring, and urban/rural planning. However, domain adaptation in\nremote sensing poses significant challenges due to differences in data, such as\nvariations in ground sampling distance, imaging modes from various sensors,\ngeographical landscapes, and environmental conditions. In recent years, deep\nlearning has emerged as a powerful tool for feature representation and\ncross-domain knowledge transfer, leading to widespread adoption in remote\nsensing tasks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of significant\nadvancements in deep learning based domain adaptation for remote sensing. We\nfirst introduce the preliminary knowledge to clarify key concepts, mathematical\nnotations, and the taxonomy of methodologies. We then organize existing\nalgorithms from multiple perspectives, including task categorization, input\nmode, supervision paradigm, and algorithmic granularity, providing readers with\na structured understanding of the field. Next, we review widely used datasets\nand summarize the performance of state-of-the-art methods to provide an\noverview of current progress. We also identify open challenges and potential\ndirections to guide future research in domain adaptation for remote sensing.\nCompared to previous surveys, this work addresses a broader range of domain\nadaptation tasks in remote sensing, rather than concentrating on a few\nsubfields.

Inspired by Dynamic\nTime Warping (DTW), a classic algorithm for aligning time series, we propose\nthe algorithm TokenTiming for universal speculative decoding. It operates by\nre-encoding the draft token sequence to get a new target token sequence, and\nthen uses DTW to build a mapping to transfer the probability distributions for\nspeculative sampling.

Existing\nresearch has rationalized divergence in latent representations in source and\ntarget languages as the source of cross-lingual gap.

Then a novel triplane-based reflectance\nnetwork trained on our lightstage data is used to synthesize high-fidelity OLAT\nimages to enable image-based relighting. Our reflectance network operates in\nthe latent space of the generative head model, crucially enabling a relatively\nsmall number of lightstage images to train the reflectance model. Combining the\ngenerated OLATs according to a given HDRI environment maps yields physically\naccurate environmental relighting results. Through quantitative and qualitative\nevaluations, we demonstrate that 3DPR outperforms previous methods,\nparticularly in preserving identity and in capturing lighting effects such as\nspecularities, self-shadows, and subsurface scattering.

In developing the state-of-the-art native image generation model,\nwe identify four key insights: (1) Most architectural choices yield comparable\nperformance; an architecture can be deemed effective provided it scales\nefficiently and supports fast inference; (2) The successful application of\nreinforcement learning can further push the frontier of native image\ngeneration; (3) Image editing still remains a challenging task, yet instruction\nfollowing and the consistency between generated and reference images can be\nsignificantly enhanced through post-training and data engine; (4) Data quality\nand scale continue to be decisive factors that determine the upper bound of\nmodel performance.

We developed a machine learning framework to integrate\ndiverse context from prior visits to improve health monitoring, especially when\nprior visits are limited and their frequency is variable.

We applied our\nframework to prostate cancer (PCa) risk prediction using data from a large\npopulation (28,342 patients, 39,013 magnetic resonance imaging scans, 68,931\nblood tests) collected over nearly a decade. For predictions of the risk of\nclinically significant PCa at the time of the visit, integrating prior context\ndirectly converted false positives to true negatives, increasing overall\nspecificity while preserving high sensitivity. False positive rates were\nreduced progressively from 51% to 33% when integrating information from up to\nthree prior imaging examinations, as compared to using data from a single\nvisit, and were further reduced to 24% when also including additional context\nfrom prior clinical data.

This issue stems from the ill-posed optimization\nin 3DGS. During training, background and foreground Gaussians are blended via\nalpha-compositing and optimized solely against the input RGB images using a\nphotometric loss. As this process lacks an explicit constraint on surface\nopacity, the optimization may incorrectly assign transparency to opaque\nregions, resulting in view-inconsistent and falsely transparent. This issue is\ndifficult to detect in standard evaluation settings but becomes particularly\nevident in object-centric reconstructions under interactive viewing. Although\nother causes of view-inconsistency have been explored recently, false\ntransparency has not been explicitly identified. To the best of our knowledge,\nwe are the first to identify, characterize, and develop solutions for this\nartifact, an underreported artifact in 3DGS. Our strategy, NGS, encourages\nsurface Gaussians to adopt higher opacity by injecting opaque noise Gaussians\nin the object volume during training, requiring only minimal modifications to\nthe existing splatting process. To quantitatively evaluate false transparency\nin static renderings, we propose a transmittance-based metric that measures the\nseverity of this artifact. In addition, we introduce a customized, high-quality\nobject-centric scan dataset exhibiting pronounced transparency issues, and we\naugment popular existing datasets with complementary infill noise specifically\ndesigned to assess the robustness of 3D reconstruction methods to false\ntransparency.
