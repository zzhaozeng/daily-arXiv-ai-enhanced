To explore this\nquestion, we build on previous work showing that LLM representations encode\nstatement truthfulness -- i.e., true, factual statements can be easily\nseparated from false, inaccurate ones. Specifically, we test the robustness of\nlearned knowledge by evaluating representation separability on samples that\nhave undergone superficial transformations to drive them out-of-distribution\n(OOD), such as typos or reformulations. By applying semantically-preserving\nperturbations, we study how separability degrades as statements become more\nOOD, across four LLM families, five evaluation datasets, and three knowledge\nprobing methods. Our results reveal that internal representations of statement\ntruthfulness collapse as the samples' presentations become less similar to\nthose seen during pre-training. While LLMs can often distinguish between true\nand false statements when they closely resemble the pre-training data, this\nability is highly dependent on the statement's exact surface form.

Experimental results demonstrate\nthat VideoLLaMA is particularly effective in temporal reasoning, achieving a\nCIDEr score of 1.1001, while Qwen2.5-VL excels in visual understanding with a\nVQA accuracy of 60.80\\%. Through extensive experiments on the WTS dataset, our\nmethod achieves an S2 score of 45.7572 in the 2025 AI City Challenge Track 2,\nplacing 10th on the challenge leaderboard.

For sketch learning\nmethods, the central objective is to fully exploit the effective information\nembedded in sketches. However, there is limited research on what constitutes\neffective sketch information, which in turn constrains the performance of\nexisting approaches. To tackle this issue, we first proposed the Multi-Level\nSketch Representation Scheme to systematically identify the effective\ninformation. The scheme organizes sketch representation into three levels:\nsketch-level, stroke-level, and point-level. This design is based on the\ngranularity of analytical elements, from coarse (sketch-level) to fine\n(point-level), thereby ensuring more comprehensive coverage of the sketch\ninformation. For each level, we conducted theoretical analyses and experimental\nevaluations to identify and validate the effective information. Building on the\nabove studies, we developed SDGraph, a deep learning architecture designed to\nexploit the identified effective information across the three levels. SDGraph\ncomprises two complementary modules: a Sparse Graph that treats strokes as\nnodes for sketch-level and stroke-level representation learning, and a Dense\nGraph that treats points as nodes for sketch-level and point-level\nrepresentation learning. Both modules employ graph convolution along with\ndown-sampling and up-sampling operations, enabling them to function as both\nencoder and decoder. Besides that, an information fusion module bridges the two\ngraphs to further enhance feature extraction. SDGraph supports a wide range of\nsketch-related downstream tasks, achieving accuracy improvements of 1.15\\% and\n1.70\\% over the state-of-the-art in classification and retrieval, respectively,\nand 36.58\\% improvement in vector sketch generation quality."}

However, detecting\nindividual-level anomalies, i.e., unusual deviations in a person's mobility\nbehavior relative to their own historical patterns, within datasets\nencompassing large populations remains a significant challenge. In this paper,\nwe present BeSTAD (Behavior-aware Spatio-Temporal Anomaly Detection for Human\nMobility Data), an unsupervised framework that captures individualized\nbehavioral signatures across large populations and uncovers fine-grained\nanomalies by jointly modeling spatial context and temporal dynamics. BeSTAD\nlearns semantically enriched mobility representations that integrate location\nmeaning and temporal patterns, enabling the detection of subtle deviations in\nindividual movement behavior. BeSTAD further employs a behavior-cluster-aware\nmodeling mechanism that builds personalized behavioral profiles from normal\nactivity and identifies anomalies through cross-period behavioral comparison\nwith consistent semantic alignment. Building on prior work in mobility behavior\nclustering, this approach enables not only the detection of behavioral shifts\nand deviations from established routines but also the identification of\nindividuals exhibiting such changes within large-scale mobility datasets.

In this work, we propose the\nDiscriminative Representation Learning (DRL) framework to specifically address\nthese challenges. To conduct incremental learning effectively and yet\nefficiently, the DRL's network, called Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA)\nnetwork, is built upon a PTM and increasingly augments the model by learning a\nlightweight adapter with a small amount of parameter learning overhead in each\nincremental stage. The adapter is responsible for adapting the model to new\nclasses, it can inherit and propagate the representation capability from the\ncurrent model through parallel connection between them by a transfer gate. As a\nresult, this design guarantees a smooth representation shift between different\nincremental stages. Furthermore, to alleviate inconsistency and enable\ncomparable feature representations across incremental stages, we design the\nDecoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS).

Traditional prototype-based methods rely on\ndeterministic averaging of support features, creating brittle representations\nthat fail to capture intra-class diversity essential for robust generalization.\nThis work introduces Diffusion Prototype Learning (DPL), a novel framework that\nreformulates prototype construction through diffusion-based feature space\nexploration. DPL models one-shot prototypes as learnable probability\ndistributions, enabling controlled generation of diverse yet semantically\ncoherent prototype variants from minimal labeled data. The framework operates\nthrough three core innovations: (1) a diffusion-based prototype enhancement\nmodule that transforms single support prototypes into diverse variant sets via\nforward-reverse diffusion processes, (2) a spatial-aware conditioning mechanism\nthat leverages geometric properties derived from prototype feature statistics,\nand (3) a conservative fusion strategy that preserves prototype fidelity while\nmaximizing representational diversity. DPL ensures training-inference\nconsistency by using the same diffusion enhancement and fusion pipeline in both\nphases. This process generates enhanced prototypes that serve as the final\nrepresentations for similarity calculations, while the diffusion process itself\nacts as a regularizer.

In real-world\nnetworks, information often spans multiple interrelated topics, posing\nchallenges for opinion evolution and highlighting the need for frameworks that\nsimulate interactions among topics. Existing studies based on large language\nmodels (LLMs) focus largely on single topics, limiting the capture of cognitive\ntransfer in multi-topic, cross-domain contexts. Traditional numerical models,\nmeanwhile, simplify complex linguistic attitudes into discrete values, lacking\ninterpretability, behavioral consistency, and the ability to integrate multiple\ntopics. To address these issues, we propose Multi-topic Opinion Simulation\n(MTOS), a social simulation framework integrating multi-topic contexts with\nLLMs. MTOS leverages LLMs alongside short-term and long-term memory,\nincorporates multiple user-selection interaction mechanisms and dynamic\ntopic-selection strategies, and employs a belief decay mechanism to enable\nperspective updates across topics. We conduct extensive experiments on MTOS,\nvarying topic numbers, correlation types, and performing ablation studies to\nassess features such as group polarization and local consistency. Results show\nthat multi-topic settings significantly alter polarization trends: positively\ncorrelated topics amplify echo chambers, negatively correlated topics inhibit\nthem, and irrelevant topics also mitigate echo chamber effects through resource\ncompetition.

To tackle this task, we propose a novel framework that distills\ngeneralization knowledge from a powerful large-scale vision-language\npre-trained model and transfers it to a lightweight, task-specific PRVR\nnetwork. Specifically, we introduce a Dual Learning framework with Dynamic\nKnowledge Distillation (DL-DKD++), where a large teacher model provides\nsupervision to a compact dual-branch student network. The student model\ncomprises two branches: an inheritance branch that absorbs transferable\nknowledge from the teacher, and an exploration branch that learns task-specific\ninformation from the PRVR dataset to address domain gaps. To further enhance\nlearning, we incorporate a dynamic soft-target construction mechanism. By\nreplacing rigid hard-target supervision with adaptive soft targets that evolve\nduring training, our method enables the model to better capture the\nfine-grained, partial relevance between videos and queries.

We\npropose VLM-Enabled Rewriting Injection with Flexibile Inference (VERIFI),\nwhich conditions a diffusion transformer (DiT) only on the text tokens\ngenerated by the VLM during in-model prompt rewriting. VERIFI combines the\nalignment of the conditioning distribution with the VLM's reasoning\ncapabilities for increased capabilities and flexibility at inference. In\naddition, finetuning on editing task not only improves text-image alignment for\ngeneration, indicative of cross-modality knowledge transfer, but also exhibits\ntremendous generalization capabilities. Our model when trained on single image\nediting, zero-shot generalizes to multiple image references further motivating\nthe unified encoder design of UniFusion."}

Although\nrecent efforts have attempted to leverage MLLMs to tackle this task, they face\nchallenges like low recall rate, duplicate predictions, coordinate\nmisalignment, etc. In this work, we bridge this gap and propose Rex-Omni, a\n3B-scale MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art object perception performance. On\nbenchmarks like COCO and LVIS, Rex-Omni attains performance comparable to or\nexceeding regression-based models (e.g., DINO, Grounding DINO) in a zero-shot\nsetting. This is enabled by three key designs: 1) Task Formulation: we use\nspecial tokens to represent quantized coordinates from 0 to 999, reducing the\nmodel's learning difficulty and improving token efficiency for coordinate\nprediction; 2) Data Engines: we construct multiple data engines to generate\nhigh-quality grounding, referring, and pointing data, providing semantically\nrich supervision for training; \\3) Training Pipelines: we employ a two-stage\ntraining process, combining supervised fine-tuning on 22 million data with\nGRPO-based reinforcement post-training. This RL post-training leverages\ngeometry-aware rewards to effectively bridge the discrete-to-continuous\ncoordinate prediction gap, improve box accuracy, and mitigate undesirable\nbehaviors like duplicate predictions that stem from the teacher-guided nature\nof the initial SFT stage. Beyond conventional detection, Rex-Omni's inherent\nlanguage understanding enables versatile capabilities such as object referring,\npointing, visual prompting, GUI grounding, spatial referring, OCR and\nkey-pointing, all systematically evaluated on dedicated benchmarks. We believe\nthat Rex-Omni paves the way for more versatile and language-aware visual\nperception systems."}

In face of these challenges, we\nintroduce a new algorithm for vectorizing MP homologies of cubical complexes.\nOur CuMPerLay decomposes the CMP into a combination of individual, learnable\nsingle-parameter persistence, where the bifiltration functions are jointly\nlearned. Thanks to the differentiability, its robust topological feature\nvectors can be seamlessly used within state-of-the-art architectures such as\nSwin Transformers.

To address these limitations, we present DeepMMSearch-R1,\nthe first multimodal LLM capable of performing on-demand, multi-turn web\nsearches and dynamically crafting queries for both image and text search tools.\nSpecifically, DeepMMSearch-R1 can initiate web searches based on relevant crops\nof the input image making the image search more effective, and can iteratively\nadapt text search queries based on retrieved information, thereby enabling\nself-reflection and self-correction. Our approach relies on a two-stage\ntraining pipeline: a cold start supervised finetuning phase followed by an\nonline reinforcement learning optimization. For training, we introduce\nDeepMMSearchVQA, a novel multimodal VQA dataset created through an automated\npipeline intermixed with real-world information from web search tools. This\ndataset contains diverse, multi-hop queries that integrate textual and visual\ninformation, teaching the model when to search, what to search for, which\nsearch tool to use and how to reason over the retrieved information.

To remedy this, we propose\n\\textbf{DriveVLA-W0}, a training paradigm that employs world modeling to\npredict future images. This task generates a dense, self-supervised signal that\ncompels the model to learn the underlying dynamics of the driving environment.\nWe showcase the paradigm's versatility by instantiating it for two dominant VLA\narchetypes: an autoregressive world model for VLAs that use discrete visual\ntokens, and a diffusion world model for those operating on continuous visual\nfeatures. Building on the rich representations learned from world modeling, we\nintroduce a lightweight action expert to address the inference latency for\nreal-time deployment.

With recent progress in audio-visual technologies, Omni\nLanguage Models (OLMs), capable of processing audio and video signals in\nparallel, have emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving richer\nunderstanding and reasoning. However, their capacity to capture and describe\nfine-grained details remains limited explored. In this work, we present a\nsystematic and comprehensive investigation of omni detailed perception from the\nperspectives of the data pipeline, models, and benchmark. We first identify an\ninherent \"co-growth\" between detail and hallucination in current OLMs. To\naddress this, we propose Omni-Detective, an agentic data generation pipeline\nintegrating tool-calling, to autonomously produce highly detailed yet minimally\nhallucinatory multimodal data. Based on the data generated with Omni-Detective,\nwe train two captioning models: Audio-Captioner for audio-only detailed\nperception, and Omni-Captioner for audio-visual detailed perception. Under the\ncascade evaluation protocol, Audio-Captioner achieves the best performance on\nMMAU and MMAR among all open-source models, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash and\ndelivering performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Pro. On existing detailed\ncaptioning benchmarks, Omni-Captioner sets a new state-of-the-art on VDC and\nachieves the best trade-off between detail and hallucination on the\nvideo-SALMONN 2 testset. Given the absence of a dedicated benchmark for omni\ndetailed perception, we design Omni-Cloze, a novel cloze-style evaluation for\ndetailed audio, visual, and audio-visual captioning that ensures stable,\nefficient, and reliable assessment. Experimental results and analysis\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of Omni-Detective in generating high-quality\ndetailed captions, as well as the superiority of Omni-Cloze in evaluating such\ndetailed captions."}
