Along with the anticipated benefits of this technology, potential\ndangers arise from unforseen and inherent biases. Thus, assessing and improving\nthe fairness of such systems is of utmost importance. A key challenge in\nfairness assessment is to ensure that the evaluation dataset is sufficiently\nrepresentative of different Personal Identifiable Information (PII) (sex, age,\nand race) and other minority groups. Against the backdrop of this challenge,\nthis study leverages the state-of-the-art Generative AI (GenAI) LightningDiT\nmodel to assess the fairness of publicly available melanoma classifiers. The\nresults suggest that fairness assessment using highly realistic synthetic data\nis a promising direction.

This work takes a first step toward\naddressing that gap by evaluating MLLM's code-based capabilities in multi-modal\nmathematical reasoning.Specifically, our framework focuses on two key\nevaluation aspects: (1) Multi-modal Code Generation (MCG) evaluates the model's\nability to accurately understand and construct visualizations from scratch. (2)\nMulti-modal Code Editing (MCE) assesses the model's capacity for fine-grained\noperations, which include three types: Deletion, Modification and Annotation.\nTo evaluate the above tasks, we incorporate a dataset that covers the five most\npopular types of mathematical figures, including geometric diagrams, function\nplots, and three types of statistical charts, to provide a comprehensive and\neffective measurement of existing MLLMs. Our experimental evaluation involves\nnine mainstream MLLMs, and the results reveal that existing models still lag\nsignificantly behind human performance in performing fine-grained visual\noperations."}

The novelty of\nViGText lies in its integration of detailed explanations with visual data, as\nit provides a more context-aware analysis than captions, which often lack\nspecificity and fail to reveal subtle inconsistencies. ViGText systematically\ndivides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates\nthem for analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify deepfakes.\nThrough the use of multi-level feature extraction across spatial and frequency\ndomains, ViGText captures details that enhance its robustness and accuracy to\ndetect sophisticated deepfakes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViGText\nsignificantly enhances generalization and achieves a notable performance boost\nwhen it detects user-customized deepfakes. Specifically, average F1 scores rise\nfrom 72.45% to 98.32% under generalization evaluation, and reflects the model's\nsuperior ability to generalize to unseen, fine-tuned variations of stable\ndiffusion models. As for robustness, ViGText achieves an increase of 11.1% in\nrecall compared to other deepfake detection approaches. When facing targeted\nattacks that exploit its graph-based architecture, ViGText limits\nclassification performance degradation to less than 4%.

However, current models struggle to generate longer videos with coherent\nscene transitions, primarily because they cannot infer when a transition is\nneeded from the prompt. Most open-source models are trained on datasets\nconsisting of single-scene video clips, which limits their capacity to learn\nand respond to prompts requiring multiple scenes. Developing scene transition\nawareness is essential for multi-scene generation, as it allows models to\nidentify and segment videos into distinct clips by accurately detecting\ntransitions.\n  To address this, we propose the \\textbf{Transition-Aware Video} (TAV)\ndataset, which consists of preprocessed video clips with multiple scene\ntransitions. Our experiment shows that post-training on the \\textbf{TAV}\ndataset improves prompt-based scene transition understanding, narrows the gap\nbetween required and generated scenes, and maintains image quality."}

To address this gap, we\npresent AraTable, a novel and comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the\nreasoning and understanding capabilities of LLMs when applied to Arabic tabular\ndata.

To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a\nnovel Locate-and-Focus method for terminology translation.

We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE,\nGoogle Scholar, and arXiv databases for publications associated with generating\nsynthetic medical unstructured free-text. We have identified 94 relevant\narticles out of 1,398 collected ones. A great deal of attention has been given\nto the generation of synthetic medical text from 2018 onwards, where the main\npurpose of such a generation is towards text augmentation, assistive writing,\ncorpus building, privacy-preserving, annotation, and usefulness. Transformer\narchitectures were the main predominant technique used to generate the text,\nespecially the GPTs. On the other hand, there were four main aspects of\nevaluation, including similarity, privacy, structure, and utility, where\nutility was the most frequent method used to assess the generated synthetic\nmedical text. Although the generated synthetic medical text demonstrated a\nmoderate possibility to act as real medical documents in different downstream\nNLP tasks, it has proven to be a great asset as augmented, complementary to the\nreal documents, towards improving the accuracy and overcoming\nsparsity/undersampling issues. Yet, privacy is still a major issue behind\ngenerating synthetic medical text, where more human assessments are needed to\ncheck for the existence of any sensitive information.

To further\nalleviate this problem, we construct a higher-quality dataset (OpenHumanBRDF)\nbased on scanned real data and statistical material data. In addition to the\nnormal, diffuse albedo, roughness, specular albedo, we produce displacement and\nsubsurface scattering to enhance the realism of rendering results, especially\nfor the skin. With the increase in prediction tasks for more materials, using\nan end-to-end model as in the previous work struggles to balance the importance\namong various material maps, and leads to model underfitting.

Concept probing works by training additional\nclassifiers to map the internal representations of a model into human-defined\nconcepts of interest, thus allowing humans to peek inside artificial neural\nnetworks. Research on concept probing has mainly focused on the model being\nprobed or the probing model itself, paying limited attention to the data\nrequired to train such probing models. In this paper, we address this gap.\nFocusing on concept probing in the context of image classification tasks, we\ninvestigate the effect of the data used to train probing models on their\nperformance. We also make available concept labels for two widely used\ndatasets."}

It is developed by our\nproposed SafeLadder framework, which incorporates large-scale, progressive,\nsafety-oriented reinforcement learning post-training, supported by a suite of\nmulti-principled verifiers. Unlike previous alignment methods such as RLHF that\nsimply learn human preferences, SafeLadder enables SafeWork-R1 to develop\nintrinsic safety reasoning and self-reflection abilities, giving rise to safety\n`aha' moments. Notably, SafeWork-R1 achieves an average improvement of\n$46.54\\%$ over its base model Qwen2.5-VL-72B on safety-related benchmarks\nwithout compromising general capabilities, and delivers state-of-the-art safety\nperformance compared to leading proprietary models such as GPT-4.1 and Claude\nOpus 4. To further bolster its reliability, we implement two distinct\ninference-time intervention methods and a deliberative search mechanism,\nenforcing step-level verification. Finally, we further develop\nSafeWork-R1-InternVL3-78B, SafeWork-R1-DeepSeek-70B, and\nSafeWork-R1-Qwen2.5VL-7B. All resulting models demonstrate that safety and\ncapability can co-evolve synergistically, highlighting the generalizability of\nour framework in building robust, reliable, and trustworthy general-purpose AI."}
