Prior\nwork on estimating model confidence tends to focus on the overall response for\ntraining and calibration, but fails to assess confidence in each reasoning\nstep, leading to undesirable hallucination snowballing. In this work, we\npresent MMBoundary, a novel framework that advances the knowledge boundary\nawareness of MLLMs through reasoning step confidence calibration. To achieve\nthis, we propose to incorporate complementary textual and cross-modal\nself-rewarding signals to estimate confidence at each step of the MLLM\nreasoning process. In addition to supervised fine-tuning MLLM on this set of\nself-rewarded confidence estimation signal for initial confidence expression\nwarm-up, we introduce a reinforcement learning stage with multiple reward\nfunctions for further aligning model knowledge and calibrating confidence at\neach reasoning step, enhancing reasoning chain self-correction. Empirical\nresults show that MMBoundary significantly outperforms existing methods across\ndiverse domain datasets and metrics, achieving an average of 7.5% reduction in\nmultimodal confidence calibration errors and up to 8.3% improvement in task\nperformance."}

Firstly, this paper identifies\napproach patterns using a top-down way, refining the patterns through four\ndistinct linguistic levels: semantic level, discourse level, syntactic level,\nand lexical level. Approaches in scientific papers are extracted based on\napproach patterns. Additionally, five dimensions for categorizing approaches\nare identified using these patterns. This paper proposes using tree structure\nto represent step and measuring the similarity between different steps with a\ntree-structure-based similarity measure that focuses on syntactic-level\nsimilarities. A collection similarity measure is proposed to compute the\nsimilarity between approaches. A bottom-up clustering algorithm is proposed to\nconstruct class trees for approach components within each dimension by merging\neach approach component or class with its most similar approach component or\nclass in each iteration. The class labels generated during the clustering\nprocess indicate the common semantics of the step components within the\napproach components in each class and are used to manage the approaches within\nthe class.

While previous studies have\nbuilt several datasets to assess LLMs' performance on UAQ, these datasets lack\nfactual knowledge support, which limits the evaluation of LLMs' ability to\nutilize their factual knowledge when handling UAQ. To address the limitation,\nwe introduce a new unanswerable question dataset UAQFact, a bilingual dataset\nwith auxiliary factual knowledge created from a Knowledge Graph. Based on\nUAQFact, we further define two new tasks to measure LLMs' ability to utilize\ninternal and external factual knowledge, respectively. Our experimental results\nacross multiple LLM series show that UAQFact presents significant challenges,\nas LLMs do not consistently perform well even when they have factual knowledge\nstored.

To generate\nhigh-quality try-on results, accurately warping the clothing item to fit the\nhuman body plays a significant role, as slight misalignment may lead to\nunrealistic artifacts in the fitting image. Most existing methods warp the\nclothing by feature matching and thin-plate spline (TPS). However, it often\nfails to preserve clothing details due to self-occlusion, severe misalignment\nbetween poses, etc. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a detail\nretention virtual try-on method via accurate non-rigid registration (VITON-DRR)\nfor diverse human poses. Specifically, we reconstruct a human semantic\nsegmentation using a dual-pyramid-structured feature extractor. Then, a novel\nDeformation Module is designed for extracting the cloth key points and warping\nthem through an accurate non-rigid registration algorithm. Finally, the Image\nSynthesis Module is designed to synthesize the deformed garment image and\ngenerate the human pose information adaptively. {Compared with} traditional\nmethods, the proposed VITON-DRR can make the deformation of fitting images more\naccurate and retain more garment details.

We start by designing\nthe tokenizer that converts images into sequences of discrete tokens, where\ntokens in different positions can be decoded into different diffusion denoising\nsteps in the pixel space. Thanks to the diffusion properties, these tokens\nnaturally follow a coarse-to-fine order, which directly lends itself to\nautoregressive modeling. Therefore, we apply standard next-token prediction on\nthese tokens, without modifying any underlying designs (either causal masks or\ntraining/inference strategies), and such sequential autoregressive token\ngeneration directly mirrors the diffusion procedure in image space. That is,\nonce the autoregressive model generates an increment of tokens, we can directly\ndecode these tokens into the corresponding diffusion denoising step in the\nstreaming manner. Our pipeline naturally reveals several intriguing properties,\nfor example, it supports consistent previews when generating only a subset of\ntokens and enables zero-shot layout-controlled synthesis. On the standard\nImageNet benchmark, our method achieves 2.09 FID using a 775M Llama backbone\nwith 256 discrete tokens.

For a standard n-class classification task, we extend the\nclassifier to an (n+1)-class model by introducing a \"garbage\" class, initially\npopulated with random gaussian noise to represent outlier inputs.
