However, this\npotential is hindered by their limited controllability and geometric\ninconsistency, creating a gap between their strong priors and their practical\nuse in 3D/4D tasks. As a result, current approaches often rely on retraining or\nfine-tuning, which risks degrading pretrained knowledge and incurs high\ncomputational costs. To address this, we propose WorldForge, a training-free,\ninference-time framework composed of three tightly coupled modules. Intra-Step\nRecursive Refinement introduces a recursive refinement mechanism during\ninference, which repeatedly optimizes network predictions within each denoising\nstep to enable precise trajectory injection. Flow-Gated Latent Fusion leverages\noptical flow similarity to decouple motion from appearance in the latent space\nand selectively inject trajectory guidance into motion-related channels.\nDual-Path Self-Corrective Guidance compares guided and unguided denoising paths\nto adaptively correct trajectory drift caused by noisy or misaligned structural\nsignals. Together, these components inject fine-grained, trajectory-aligned\nguidance without training, achieving both accurate motion control and\nphotorealistic content generation.

However, they have notable limitations. LLMs tend to\ngenerate hallucinations, a seemingly plausible yet factually unsupported output\n[Hua+24], which have serious real-world consequences [Kay23; Rum+24]. Recent\nwork has shown that probing-based classifiers that utilize LLMs' internal\nrepresentations can detect hallucinations [AM23; Bei+24; Bur+24; DYT24; Ji+24;\nSMZ24; Su+24]. This approach, since it does not involve model training, can\nenhance reliability without significantly increasing computational costs.\n  Building upon this approach, this thesis proposed novel methods for\nhallucination detection using LLM internal representations and evaluated them\nacross three benchmarks: TruthfulQA, HaluEval, and ReFact. Specifically, a new\narchitecture that dynamically weights and combines internal LLM layers was\ndeveloped to improve hallucination detection performance. Throughout extensive\nexperiments, two key findings were obtained: First, the proposed approach was\nshown to achieve superior performance compared to traditional probing methods,\nthough generalization across benchmarks and LLMs remains challenging. Second,\nthese generalization limitations were demonstrated to be mitigated through\ncross-benchmark training and parameter freezing. While not consistently\nimproving, both techniques yielded better performance on individual benchmarks\nand reduced performance degradation when transferred to other benchmarks. These\nfindings open new avenues for improving LLM reliability through internal\nrepresentation analysis."}

The\nMelting Pot contest is a social AI evaluation suite designed to assess the\ncooperation capabilities of AI systems. In this paper, we apply a Bayesian\napproach known as Measurement Layouts to infer the capability profiles of\nmulti-agent systems in the Melting Pot contest. We show that these capability\nprofiles not only predict future performance within the Melting Pot suite but\nalso reveal the underlying prosocial abilities of agents. Our analysis\nindicates that while higher prosocial capabilities sometimes correlate with\nbetter performance, this is not a universal trend-some lower-scoring agents\nexhibit stronger cooperation abilities. Furthermore, we find that\ntop-performing contest submissions are more likely to achieve high scores in\nscenarios where prosocial capabilities are not required. These findings,\ntogether with reports that the contest winner used a hard-coded solution\ntailored to specific environments, suggest that at least one top-performing\nteam may have optimised for conditions where cooperation was not necessary,\npotentially exploiting limitations in the evaluation framework.

Data distillation methods, which aim to improve data\nefficiency, have emerged as promising solutions to this challenge. In the field\nof single image super-resolution (SISR), the reliance on large training\ndatasets highlights the importance of these techniques. Recently, a generative\nadversarial network (GAN) inversion-based data distillation framework for SR\nwas proposed, showing potential for better data utilization. However, the\ncurrent method depends heavily on pre-trained SR networks and class-specific\ninformation, limiting its generalizability and applicability. To address these\nissues, we introduce a new data distillation approach for image SR that does\nnot need class labels or pre-trained SR models. In particular, we first extract\nhigh-gradient patches and categorize images based on CLIP features, then\nfine-tune a diffusion model on the selected patches to learn their distribution\nand synthesize distilled training images. Experimental results show that our\nmethod achieves state-of-the-art performance while using significantly less\ntraining data and requiring less computational time. Specifically, when we\ntrain a baseline Transformer model for SR with only 0.68\\% of the original\ndataset, the performance drop is just 0.3 dB. In this case, diffusion model\nfine-tuning takes 4 hours, and SR model training completes within 1 hour, much\nshorter than the 11-hour training time with the full dataset."}

We present the CORRECT-DETECT trade-off:\nthough models have both capabilities and deploy them implicitly, successful\nperformance balancing these two abilities remains elusive."}

Our\nresults indicate that fine-tuned models suffer from over-specialization,\nespecially when fine-tuned for complex tasks of FR. Also, our results pointed\nout that task complexity and classification head design, multi-class (FR) vs.\nbinary (MAD and PAD), correlate with the degree of catastrophic forgetting. The\nFRoundation model with the ViT-L backbone outperforms other approaches on the\nlarge-scale FR benchmark IJB-C, achieving an improvement of up to 58.52%.\nHowever, it experiences a substantial performance drop on ImageNetV2, reaching\nonly 51.63% compared to 69.84% achieved by the baseline CLIP model. Moreover,\nthe larger CLIP architecture consistently preserves more of the model's\noriginal generalization ability than the smaller variant, indicating that\nincreased model capacity may help mitigate over-specialization."}

However, conventional ultrasound diagnosis\nheavily relies on physician expertise, presenting challenges of high\nsubjectivity and low diagnostic efficiency. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer\npromising solutions for this issue, but existing general-purpose models\ndemonstrate limited knowledge in ultrasound medical tasks, with poor\ngeneralization in multi-organ lesion recognition and low efficiency across\nmulti-task diagnostics. To address these limitations, we propose EchoVLM, a\nvision-language model specifically designed for ultrasound medical imaging. The\nmodel employs a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture trained on data spanning\nseven anatomical regions. This design enables the model to perform multiple\ntasks, including ultrasound report generation, diagnosis and visual\nquestion-answering (VQA). The experimental results demonstrated that EchoVLM\nachieved significant improvements of 10.15 and 4.77 points in BLEU-1 scores and\nROUGE-1 scores respectively compared to Qwen2-VL on the ultrasound report\ngeneration task.

However, this reliance introduces new attack surfaces within\nthe retrieval pipeline, beyond the LLM itself. While prior RAG attacks have\nexposed such vulnerabilities, they largely rely on manipulating user queries,\nwhich is often infeasible in practice due to fixed or protected user inputs.\nThis narrow focus overlooks a more realistic and stealthy vector: instructional\nprompts, which are widely reused, publicly shared, and rarely audited. Their\nimplicit trust makes them a compelling target for adversaries to manipulate RAG\nbehavior covertly.\n  We introduce a novel attack for Adversarial Instructional Prompt (AIP) that\nexploits adversarial instructional prompts to manipulate RAG outputs by subtly\naltering retrieval behavior. By shifting the attack surface to the\ninstructional prompts, AIP reveals how trusted yet seemingly benign interface\ncomponents can be weaponized to degrade system integrity. The attack is crafted\nto achieve three goals: (1) naturalness, to evade user detection; (2) utility,\nto encourage use of prompts; and (3) robustness, to remain effective across\ndiverse query variations. We propose a diverse query generation strategy that\nsimulates realistic linguistic variation in user queries, enabling the\ndiscovery of prompts that generalize across paraphrases and rephrasings.\nBuilding on this, a genetic algorithm-based joint optimization is developed to\nevolve adversarial prompts by balancing attack success, clean-task utility, and\nstealthiness. Experimental results show that AIP achieves up to 95.23% ASR\nwhile preserving benign functionality. These findings uncover a critical and\npreviously overlooked vulnerability in RAG systems, emphasizing the need to\nreassess the shared instructional prompts."}

We reveal two key insights about MLLMs: (1) MLLMs tend to\ndynamically assign special tokens, referred to as \\textit{grounding tokens},\nfor grounding the text query; and (2) MLLMs often suffer from suboptimal\ngrounding due to the inability to fully integrate the cues in the text query\n(\\textit{e.g.}, attributes, actions) for inference.

However, a key\nlimitation of existing MoE-LoRA methods is their reliance on a discrete router,\nwhich prevents the integration of the MoE components into the backbone model.\nTo overcome this, we propose FURINA, a novel Free from Unmergeable Router\nframework based on the LINear Aggregation of experts. FURINA eliminates the\nrouter by introducing a Self-Routing mechanism. This is achieved through three\ncore innovations: (1) decoupled learning of the direction and magnitude for\nLoRA adapters, (2) a shared learnable magnitude vector for consistent\nactivation scaling, and (3) expert selection loss that encourages divergent\nexpert activation. The proposed mechanism leverages the angular similarity\nbetween the input and each adapter's directional component to activate experts,\nwhich are then scaled by the shared magnitude vector. This design allows the\noutput norm to naturally reflect the importance of each expert, thereby\nenabling dynamic, router-free routing. The expert selection loss further\nsharpens this behavior by encouraging sparsity and aligning it with standard\nMoE activation patterns. We also introduce a shared expert within the MoE-LoRA\nblock that provides stable, foundational knowledge. To the best of our\nknowledge, FURINA is the first router-free, MoE-enhanced LoRA method that can\nbe fully merged into the backbone model, introducing zero additional\ninference-time cost or complexity.

In this paper, we propose an OpenRE\nframework based on large language models (LLMs), which directly predicts new\nrelations for test instances by leveraging their strong language understanding\nand generation abilities, without human intervention. Specifically, our\nframework consists of two core components: (1) a relation discoverer (RD),\ndesigned to predict new relations for test instances based on\n\\textit{demonstrations} formed by training instances with known relations; and\n(2) a relation predictor (RP), used to select the most likely relation for a\ntest instance from $n$ candidate relations, guided by \\textit{demonstrations}\ncomposed of their instances. To enhance the ability of our framework to predict\nnew relations, we design a self-correcting inference strategy composed of three\nstages: relation discovery, relation denoising, and relation prediction. In the\nfirst stage, we use RD to preliminarily predict new relations for all test\ninstances. Next, we apply RP to select some high-reliability test instances for\neach new relation from the prediction results of RD through a cross-validation\nmethod.

We also compare the performance of Fair-GPTQ\nwith existing debiasing methods and find that it achieves performance on par\nwith the iterative null-space projection debiasing approach on\nracial-stereotype benchmarks. Overall, the results validate our theoretical\nsolution to the quantization problem with a group-bias term, highlight its\napplicability for reducing group bias at quantization time in generative\nmodels, and demonstrate that our approach can further be used to analyze\nchannel- and weight-level contributions to fairness during quantization."}

A Comparative Study of Multimodal, Caption-Based, and Hybrid Retrieval Techniques", "comment": null, "summary": "Slide decks, serving as digital reports that bridge the gap between\npresentation slides and written documents, are a prevalent medium for conveying\ninformation in both academic and corporate settings. Their multimodal nature,\ncombining text, images, and charts, presents challenges for retrieval-augmented\ngeneration systems, where the quality of retrieval directly impacts downstream\nperformance. Traditional approaches to slide retrieval often involve separate\nindexing of modalities, which can increase complexity and lose contextual\ninformation. This paper investigates various methodologies for effective slide\nretrieval, including visual late-interaction embedding models like ColPali, the\nuse of visual rerankers, and hybrid retrieval techniques that combine dense\nretrieval with BM25, further enhanced by textual rerankers and fusion methods\nlike Reciprocal Rank Fusion. A novel Vision-Language Models-based captioning\npipeline is also evaluated, demonstrating significantly reduced embedding\nstorage requirements compared to visual late-interaction techniques, alongside\ncomparable retrieval performance. Our analysis extends to the practical aspects\nof these methods, evaluating their runtime performance and storage demands\nalongside retrieval efficacy, thus offering practical guidance for the\nselection and development of efficient and robust slide retrieval systems for\nreal-world applications."}

Instead of constructing\ncontamination-free datasets (quite hard), we propose a novel framework,\n\\textbf{LNE-Blocking}, to restore model performance prior to contamination on\npotentially leaked datasets. Our framework consists of two components:\ncontamination detection and disruption operation. For the prompt, the framework\nfirst uses the contamination detection method, \\textbf{LNE}, to assess the\nextent of contamination in the model. Based on this, it adjusts the intensity\nof the disruption operation, \\textbf{Blocking}, to elicit non-memorized\nresponses from the model. Our framework is the first to efficiently restore the\nmodel's greedy decoding performance.

In this paper, we introduce Multi Agent based Reasoning for\nImage Classification (MARIC), a multi agent framework that reformulates image\nclassification as a collaborative reasoning process. MARIC first utilizes an\nOutliner Agent to analyze the global theme of the image and generate targeted\nprompts. Based on these prompts, three Aspect Agents extract fine grained\ndescriptions along distinct visual dimensions. Finally, a Reasoning Agent\nsynthesizes these complementary outputs through integrated reflection step,\nproducing a unified representation for classification. By explicitly\ndecomposing the task into multiple perspectives and encouraging reflective\nsynthesis, MARIC mitigates the shortcomings of both parameter-heavy training\nand monolithic VLM reasoning.

However, this reliance introduces new attack surfaces within\nthe retrieval pipeline, beyond the LLM itself. While prior RAG attacks have\nexposed such vulnerabilities, they largely rely on manipulating user queries,\nwhich is often infeasible in practice due to fixed or protected user inputs.\nThis narrow focus overlooks a more realistic and stealthy vector: instructional\nprompts, which are widely reused, publicly shared, and rarely audited. Their\nimplicit trust makes them a compelling target for adversaries to manipulate RAG\nbehavior covertly.\n  We introduce a novel attack for Adversarial Instructional Prompt (AIP) that\nexploits adversarial instructional prompts to manipulate RAG outputs by subtly\naltering retrieval behavior. By shifting the attack surface to the\ninstructional prompts, AIP reveals how trusted yet seemingly benign interface\ncomponents can be weaponized to degrade system integrity. The attack is crafted\nto achieve three goals: (1) naturalness, to evade user detection; (2) utility,\nto encourage use of prompts; and (3) robustness, to remain effective across\ndiverse query variations. We propose a diverse query generation strategy that\nsimulates realistic linguistic variation in user queries, enabling the\ndiscovery of prompts that generalize across paraphrases and rephrasings.\nBuilding on this, a genetic algorithm-based joint optimization is developed to\nevolve adversarial prompts by balancing attack success, clean-task utility, and\nstealthiness. Experimental results show that AIP achieves up to 95.23% ASR\nwhile preserving benign functionality. These findings uncover a critical and\npreviously overlooked vulnerability in RAG systems, emphasizing the need to\nreassess the shared instructional prompts."}
