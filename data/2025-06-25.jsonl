We investigate two key\nquestions: (1) Does higher predictive accuracy necessarily lead to better\nmaintenance decisions? (2) If not, how can the impact of prediction errors on\ndownstream maintenance decisions be mitigated? We first demonstrate that in the\ntraditional estimate-then-optimize (ETO) framework, errors in probabilistic\nprediction can result in inconsistent and suboptimal maintenance decisions. To\naddress this, we propose an integrated estimate-optimize (IEO) framework that\njointly tunes predictive models while directly optimizing for maintenance\noutcomes. We establish theoretical finite-sample guarantees on decision\nconsistency under standard assumptions. Specifically, we develop a stochastic\nperturbation gradient descent algorithm suitable for small run-to-failure\ndatasets. Empirical evaluations on a turbofan maintenance case study show that\nthe IEO framework reduces average maintenance regret up to 22% compared to ETO.\nThis study provides a principled approach to managing prediction errors in\ndata-driven PdM. By aligning prognostic model training with maintenance\nobjectives, the IEO framework improves robustness under model misspecification\nand improves decision quality. The improvement is particularly pronounced when\nthe decision-making policy is misaligned with the decision-maker's target.\nThese findings support more reliable maintenance planning in uncertain\noperational environments."}

To prevent performance degradation from algorithm updates, SC\ndevelopers must evaluate diagnostic performance changes for individual diseases\nbefore deployment. However, acquiring sufficient evaluation data for rare\ndiseases is difficult, and manually creating numerous clinical vignettes is\ncostly and impractical. Objective: This study proposes and validates a novel\nSynthetic Vignette Simulation Approach to evaluate diagnostic performance\nchanges for individual rare diseases following SC algorithm updates. Methods:\nWe used disease-phenotype annotations from the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO),\na knowledge database for rare diseases, to generate synthetic vignettes. With\nthese, we simulated SC interviews to estimate the impact of algorithm updates\non real-world diagnostic performance. The method's effectiveness was evaluated\nretrospectively by comparing estimated values with actual metric changes using\nthe R 2(R-squared) coefficient. Results: The experiment included eight past SC\nalgorithm updates. For updates on diseases with frequency information in HPO\n(n=5), the R^2 for recall@8 change was 0.831 (p=0.031), and for precision@8\nchange, it was 0.78 (p=0.047), indicating the method can predict\npost-deployment performance. In contrast, large prediction errors occurred for\ndiseases without frequency information (n=3), highlighting its importance. The\nmanual effort to map HPO phenotypes to SC symptoms was approximately 2 hours\nper disease. Conclusions: Our method enables pre-deployment evaluation of SC\nalgorithm changes for individual rare diseases using a publicly available,\nexpert-created knowledge base. This transparent and low-cost approach allows\ndevelopers to efficiently improve diagnostic performance for rare diseases,\npotentially enhancing support for early diagnosis."}

Under the MMDA setting, the samples\nin both domains have all the modalities. In two newly proposed modules of our\nPMC, the multiple modalities are cooperated for selecting the reliable\npseudo-labeled target samples, which captures the modality-specific information\nand modality-integrated information, respectively. Under the MMDA-PI setting,\nsome modalities are missing in the target domain. Hence, to better exploit the\nmulti-modality data in the source domain, we further propose the PMC with\nprivileged information (PMC-PI) method by proposing a new multi-modality data\ngeneration (MMG) network. MMG generates the missing modalities in the target\ndomain based on the source domain data by considering both domain distribution\nmismatch and semantics preservation, which are respectively achieved by using\nadversarial learning and conditioning on weighted pseudo semantics.

Inspired by our empirical findings highlighting the benefits of role\nassignment and diagnostic discernment in LLMs, MAM decomposes the medical\ndiagnostic process into specialized roles: a General Practitioner, Specialist\nTeam, Radiologist, Medical Assistant, and Director, each embodied by an\nLLM-based agent. This modular and collaborative framework enables efficient\nknowledge updates and leverages existing medical LLMs and knowledge bases.\nExtensive experimental evaluations conducted on a wide range of publicly\naccessible multimodal medical datasets, incorporating text, image, audio, and\nvideo modalities, demonstrate that MAM consistently surpasses the performance\nof modality-specific LLMs. Notably, MAM achieves significant performance\nimprovements ranging from 18% to 365% compared to baseline models. Our code is\nreleased at https://github.com/yczhou001/MAM."}

Clinicians visually\nevaluate a patient's tapping performance and assign an overall severity score\nbased on tapping amplitude, speed, and irregularity. However, this subjective\nevaluation is prone to inter- and intra-rater variability, and does not offer\ninsights into individual motor characteristics captured during this test. This\npaper introduces a granular computer vision-based method for quantifying PD\nmotor characteristics from video recordings. Four sets of clinically relevant\nfeatures are proposed to characterize hypokinesia, bradykinesia, sequence\neffect, and hesitation-halts. We evaluate our approach on video recordings and\nclinical evaluations of 74 PD patients from the Personalized Parkinson Project.\nPrincipal component analysis with varimax rotation shows that the video-based\nfeatures corresponded to the four deficits. Additionally, video-based analysis\nhas allowed us to identify further granular distinctions within sequence effect\nand hesitation-halts deficits. In the following, we have used these features to\ntrain machine learning classifiers to estimate the Movement Disorder Society\nUnified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) finger-tapping score.\nCompared to state-of-the-art approaches, our method achieves a higher accuracy\nin MDS-UPDRS score prediction, while still providing an interpretable\nquantification of individual finger-tapping motor characteristics.

(2025), titled The Illusion of Thinking:\nUnderstanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models via the Lens of\nProblem Complexity, presents a compelling empirical finding, a reasoning cliff,\nwhere the performance of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) collapses beyond a\nspecific complexity threshold, which the authors posit as an intrinsic scaling\nlimitation of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. This commentary, while\nacknowledging the study's methodological rigor, contends that this conclusion\nis confounded by experimental artifacts. We argue that the observed failure is\nnot evidence of a fundamental cognitive boundary, but rather a predictable\noutcome of system-level constraints in the static, text-only evaluation\nparadigm, including tool use restrictions, context window recall issues, the\nabsence of crucial cognitive baselines, inadequate statistical reporting, and\noutput generation limits. We reframe this performance collapse through the lens\nof an agentic gap, asserting that the models are not failing at reasoning, but\nat execution within a profoundly restrictive interface. We empirically\nsubstantiate this critique by demonstrating a striking reversal. A model,\ninitially declaring a puzzle impossible when confined to text-only generation,\nnow employs agentic tools to not only solve it but also master variations of\ncomplexity far beyond the reasoning cliff it previously failed to surmount.\nAdditionally, our empirical analysis of tool-enabled models like o4-mini and\nGPT-4o reveals a hierarchy of agentic reasoning, from simple procedural\nexecution to complex meta-cognitive self-correction, which has significant\nimplications for how we define and measure machine intelligence. The illusion\nof thinking attributed to LRMs is less a reasoning deficit and more a\nconsequence of an otherwise capable mind lacking the tools for action."}

We further introduced a novel\nPseudo-mask Attention (PMA) module, which used these pseudo-masks to\nautomatically generate bounding boxes and enhance localized feature extraction\nby guiding attention to relevant areas. Furthermore, a low-rank adaptation\n(LoRA) strategy was adopted to mitigate the domain shift issue. The proposed\nframework was evaluated on both 2D and 3D datasets across multiple medical\nimaging modalities, including fundus photography, X-ray, computed tomography\n(CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and\nultrasound. The results demonstrated a significant performance improvement over\nstate-of-the-art models, such as nnUNet and SwinUNet, as well as foundation\nmodels, such as SAM2 and MedSAM2, underscoring the effectiveness of the\nproposed approach.

Our\narchitecture employs a four-stage hierarchical design and was extensively\nevaluated on challenging remote sensing datasets: UC Merced, AID,\nNWPU-RESISC45, and EuroSAT. MambaOutRS consistently achieved state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) performance across these benchmarks.

However, existing solutions face\nseveral challenges in using these models to generate long movie-like videos\nwith rich human-object interactions that include unrealistic human-scene\ninteraction, lack of subject identity preservation, and require expensive\ntraining. We propose GenHSI, a training-free method for controllable generation\nof long human-scene interaction videos (HSI). Taking inspiration from movie\nanimation, our key insight is to overcome the limitations of previous work by\nsubdividing the long video generation task into three stages: (1) script\nwriting, (2) pre-visualization, and (3) animation. Given an image of a scene, a\nuser description, and multiple images of a person, we use these three stages to\ngenerate long-videos that preserve human-identity and provide rich human-scene\ninteractions. Script writing converts complex human tasks into simple atomic\ntasks that are used in the pre-visualization stage to generate 3D keyframes\n(storyboards). These 3D keyframes are rendered and animated by off-the-shelf\nvideo diffusion models for consistent long video generation with rich contacts\nin a 3D-aware manner. A key advantage of our work is that we alleviate the need\nfor scanned, accurate scenes and create 3D keyframes from single-view images.\nWe are the first to generate a long video sequence with a consistent camera\npose that contains arbitrary numbers of character actions without training.\nExperiments demonstrate that our method can generate long videos that\neffectively preserve scene content and character identity with plausible\nhuman-scene interaction from a single image scene.
