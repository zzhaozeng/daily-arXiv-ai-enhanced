In\ncontrast to previous works that operate on a global expression space, we\ncondition our avatar's dynamics on patch-based local expression features and\nsynthesize 3D Gaussians at a patch level. In particular, we leverage a\npatch-based geometric 3D face model to extract patch expressions and learn how\nto translate these into local dynamic skin appearance and motion by coupling\nthe patches with anchor points of Scaffold-GS, a recent hierarchical scene\nrepresentation. These anchors are then used to synthesize 3D Gaussians\non-the-fly, conditioned by patch-expressions and viewing direction. We employ\ncolor-based densification and progressive training to obtain high-quality\nresults and faster convergence for high resolution 3K training images.

We conduct a randomized controlled trial\n(RCT) to understand how AI tools at the February-June 2025 frontier affect the\nproductivity of experienced open-source developers. 16 developers with moderate\nAI experience complete 246 tasks in mature projects on which they have an\naverage of 5 years of prior experience. Each task is randomly assigned to allow\nor disallow usage of early 2025 AI tools. When AI tools are allowed, developers\nprimarily use Cursor Pro, a popular code editor, and Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet.\nBefore starting tasks, developers forecast that allowing AI will reduce\ncompletion time by 24%. After completing the study, developers estimate that\nallowing AI reduced completion time by 20%. Surprisingly, we find that allowing\nAI actually increases completion time by 19%--AI tooling slowed developers\ndown.

Prior work reading out depth or\nillumination from video generators required fine-tuning, which is impractical\nfor flow where labels are scarce and synthetic datasets suffer from a\nsim-to-real gap. Inspired by the Counterfactual World Model (CWM) paradigm,\nwhich can obtain point-wise correspondences by injecting a small tracer\nperturbation into a next-frame predictor and tracking its propagation, we\nextend this idea to generative video models. We explore several popular\narchitectures and find that successful zero-shot flow extraction in this manner\nis aided by three model properties: (1) distributional prediction of future\nframes (avoiding blurry or noisy outputs); (2) factorized latents that treat\neach spatio-temporal patch independently; and (3) random-access decoding that\ncan condition on any subset of future pixels. These properties are uniquely\npresent in the recent Local Random Access Sequence (LRAS) architecture.\nBuilding on LRAS, we propose KL-tracing: a novel test-time procedure that\ninjects a localized perturbation into the first frame, rolls out the model one\nstep, and computes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between perturbed and\nunperturbed predictive distributions. Without any flow-specific fine-tuning,\nour method outperforms state-of-the-art models on real-world TAP-Vid DAVIS\ndataset (16.6% relative improvement for endpoint error) and synthetic TAP-Vid\nKubric (4.7% relative improvement).

Current\nmethods remain reactive, employing stimulus-response mechanisms that fail when\nfacing novel scenarios. We argue for a transformative paradigm shift from\nreactive to proactive multi-agent intelligence through generative AI-based\nreinforcement learning. This position advocates reconceptualizing agents not as\nisolated policy optimizers, but as sophisticated generative models capable of\nsynthesizing complex multi-agent dynamics and making anticipatory decisions\nbased on predictive understanding of future interactions. Rather than\nresponding to immediate observations, generative-RL agents can model\nenvironment evolution, predict other agents' behaviors, generate coordinated\naction sequences, and engage in strategic reasoning accounting for long-term\ndynamics. This approach leverages pattern recognition and generation\ncapabilities of generative AI to enable proactive decision-making, seamless\ncoordination through enhanced communication, and dynamic adaptation to evolving\nscenarios. We envision this paradigm shift will unlock unprecedented\npossibilities for distributed intelligence, moving beyond individual\noptimization toward emergent collective behaviors representing genuine\ncollaborative intelligence.

Recently, this framework has been\nextended to 3D self-supervised learning by constructing a conditional point\ngenerator for enhancing 3D representations. However, its performance remains\nconstrained by the 3D diffusion model, which is trained on the available 3D\ndatasets with limited size. We hypothesize that the robust capabilities of\ntext-to-image diffusion models, particularly Stable Diffusion (SD), which is\ntrained on large-scale datasets, can help overcome these limitations. To\ninvestigate this hypothesis, we propose PointSD, a framework that leverages the\nSD model for 3D self-supervised learning. By replacing the SD model's text\nencoder with a 3D encoder, we train a point-to-image diffusion model that\nallows point clouds to guide the denoising of rendered noisy images. With the\ntrained point-to-image diffusion model, we use noise-free images as the input\nand point clouds as the condition to extract SD features.

For each image, we collected values of\ndifficulty, efficacy, artistic quality, and emotional arousal from human\nrating, as well as number of tags generated by participants to summarize the\nmessage. Semantic and emotion variables were further derived from the tags via\nNatural Language Processing. Visual metaphors were rated as more difficult to\nunderstand, yet more aesthetically pleasant than literal images, but did not\ndiffer in efficacy and arousal. The latter for visual metaphors, however, was\nhigher in participants with higher Need For Cognition. Furthermore, visual\nmetaphors received more tags, often referring to entities not depicted in the\nimage, and elicited words with more positive valence and greater dominance than\nliteral images.

However, LocLLM's linear projector fails to\ncapture complex spatial-textual interactions critical for high-precision\nlocalization.

However, due\nto limited resources, it is impractical to place sensors at every location to\ndetect unexpected shifts. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an optimal\nsensor placement strategy that enables partial observability of the system\nwhile detecting anomalies as quickly as possible. Numerous approaches have been\nproposed to address this challenge; however, most existing methods consider\nonly variable correlations and neglect a crucial factor: Causality. Moreover,\nalthough a few techniques incorporate causal analysis, they rely on\ninterventions-artificially creating anomalies-to identify causal effects, which\nis impractical and might lead to catastrophic losses. In this paper, we\nintroduce a causality-informed deep Q-network (Causal DQ) approach for\npartially observable sensor placement in anomaly detection. By integrating\ncausal information at each stage of Q-network training, our method achieves\nfaster convergence and tighter theoretical error bounds. Furthermore, the\ntrained causal-informed Q-network significantly reduces the detection time for\nanomalies under various settings, demonstrating its effectiveness for sensor\nplacement in large-scale, real-world data streams.

While tokenization has revolutionized\nimage and video generation, efficiently tokenizing complex 3D scenes remains a\ncritical challenge for 3D world models. To address this, we propose\n$I^{2}$-World, an efficient framework for 4D occupancy forecasting. Our method\ndecouples scene tokenization into intra-scene and inter-scene tokenizers. The\nintra-scene tokenizer employs a multi-scale residual quantization strategy to\nhierarchically compress 3D scenes while preserving spatial details. The\ninter-scene tokenizer residually aggregates temporal dependencies across\ntimesteps. This dual design preserves the compactness of 3D tokenizers while\nretaining the dynamic expressiveness of 4D tokenizers. Unlike decoder-only\nGPT-style autoregressive models, $I^{2}$-World adopts an encoder-decoder\narchitecture. The encoder aggregates spatial context from the current scene and\npredicts a transformation matrix to enable high-level control over scene\ngeneration. The decoder, conditioned on this matrix and historical tokens,\nensures temporal consistency during generation.

This paper reveals the negative impact of the long-term\ndecay in Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE), used for positional modeling in\nLVLMs, on multimodal alignment. Concretely, under long-term decay, instruction\ntokens exhibit uneven perception of image tokens located at different positions\nwithin the two-dimensional space: prioritizing image tokens from the\nbottom-right region since in the one-dimensional sequence, these tokens are\npositionally closer to the instruction tokens. This biased perception leads to\ninsufficient image-instruction interaction and suboptimal multimodal alignment.\nWe refer to this phenomenon as image alignment bias. To enhance instruction's\nperception of image tokens at different spatial locations, we propose\nMCA-LLaVA, based on Manhattan distance, which extends the long-term decay to a\ntwo-dimensional, multi-directional spatial decay.

For rare anomaly categories that appear on the road,\n3D detection models trained on closed sets often misdetect or fail to detect\nanomaly objects. To address this risk, it is necessary to enhance the\ngeneralization ability of 3D detection models for targets of arbitrary shapes\nand to possess the capability to filter out anomalies. The generalization of 3D\ndetection is limited by two factors: the coupled training of 2D and 3D, and the\ninsufficient diversity in the scale distribution of training samples. This\npaper proposes a Stereo-based 3D Anomaly object Detection (S3AD) algorithm,\nwhich decouples the training strategy of 3D and 2D to release the\ngeneralization ability for arbitrary 3D foreground detection, and proposes an\nanomaly scoring algorithm based on foreground confidence prediction, achieving\ntarget-level anomaly scoring. In order to further verify and enhance the\ngeneralization of anomaly detection, we use a 3D rendering method to synthesize\ntwo augmented reality binocular stereo 3D detection datasets which named\nKITTI-AR.

This representation\nsupports a wide range of applications, from robotics to augmented reality, by\nenabling accurate modeling of dynamic environments. Most existing long-term\ntracking approaches operate in an offline setting, where future frames are\navailable to refine predictions and recover from occlusions. However,\nreal-world scenarios often demand online predictions: the model must operate\ncausally, using only current and past frames. This constraint is critical in\nstreaming video and embodied AI, where decisions must be made immediately based\non past observations. Under such constraints, viewpoint invariance becomes\nessential. Visual foundation models, trained on diverse large-scale datasets,\noffer the potential for robust geometric representations. While they lack\ntemporal reasoning on their own, they can be integrated into tracking pipelines\nto enrich spatial features. In this thesis, we address the problem of long-term\npoint tracking in an online setting, where frames are processed sequentially\nwithout access to future information or sliding windows. We begin by evaluating\nthe suitability of visual foundation models for this task and find that they\ncan serve as useful initializations and be integrated into tracking pipelines.\nHowever, to enable long-term tracking in an online setting, a dedicated design\nis still required. In particular, maintaining coherence over time in this\ncausal regime requires memory to propagate appearance and context across\nframes.

However, this\nhas not been the case for assumption-based argumentation (ABA), despite it\nbeing a popular form of structured argumentation with several applications\nwhere gradual semantics could be useful. In this paper, we fill this gap and\npropose a family of novel gradual semantics for equipping assumptions, which\nare the core components in ABA frameworks, with dialectical strengths.

These issues manifest differently in\nvision-language classification and medical segmentation tasks, yet existing\nsolutions remain domain-specific. We propose \\textit{StaRFM}, a unified\nframework addressing both challenges.

Additionally, a confidence\nmisalignment penalty (CMP), reformulated for voxel-level predictions,\ncalibrates uncertainty in segmentation tasks. We theoretically derive PAC-Bayes\nbounds showing FIP controls generalization via the Fisher-Rao norm, while CMP\nminimizes calibration error through Brier score optimization.

To capture and transfer these movements\ninto virtual reality, the egocentric (first-person) perspective can be adopted,\nwhich enables the use of a portable and cost-effective device without\nfront-view cameras. However, this viewpoint introduces challenges such as\nocclusions and distorted body proportions.\n  There are few works reconstructing human appearance from egocentric views,\nand none use a generative prior-based approach. Some methods create avatars\nfrom a single egocentric image during inference, but still rely on multi-view\ndatasets during training. To our knowledge, this is the first study using a\ngenerative backbone to reconstruct animatable avatars from egocentric inputs.\nBased on Stable Diffusion, our method reduces training burden and improves\ngeneralizability.\n  Inspired by methods such as SiTH and MagicMan, which perform 360-degree\nreconstruction from a frontal image, we introduce a pipeline that generates\nrealistic frontal views from occluded top-down images using ControlNet and a\nStable Diffusion backbone.\n  Our goal is to convert a single top-down egocentric image into a realistic\nfrontal representation and feed it into an image-to-motion model. This enables\ngeneration of avatar motions from minimal input, paving the way for more\naccessible and generalizable telepresence systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528Stable Diffusion\u4ece\u5355\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u53ef\u52a8\u753b\u7684\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u906e\u6321\u548c\u8eab\u4f53\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5931\u771f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u89d2\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u4eba\u4f53\u5916\u89c2\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u906e\u6321\u548c\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5931\u771f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d1f\u62c5\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eStable Diffusion\u548cControlNet\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u906e\u6321\u7684\u4fef\u89c6\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u6b63\u9762\u89c6\u56fe\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u8f93\u5165\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u4fef\u89c6\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u52a8\u753b\u7684\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u66f4\u6613\u7528\u548c\u901a\u7528\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u8fdc\u7a0b\u5448\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u3002"}}

Hills"], "title": "Could you be wrong: Debiasing LLMs using a metacognitive prompt for improving human decision making", "comment": "12 pages, 3 figures", "summary": "Identifying bias in LLMs is ongoing. Because they are still in development,\nwhat is true today may be false tomorrow. We therefore need general strategies\nfor debiasing that will outlive current models. Strategies developed for\ndebiasing human decision making offer one promising approach as they\nincorporate an LLM-style prompt intervention designed to bring latent knowledge\ninto awareness during decision making. LLMs trained on vast amounts of\ninformation contain information about potential biases, counter-arguments, and\ncontradictory evidence, but that information may only be brought to bear if\nprompted. Metacognitive prompts developed in the human decision making\nliterature are designed to achieve this, and as I demonstrate here, they show\npromise with LLMs. The prompt I focus on here is \"could you be wrong?\"\nFollowing an LLM response, this prompt leads LLMs to produce additional\ninformation, including why they answered as they did, errors, biases,\ncontradictory evidence, and alternatives, none of which were apparent in their\ninitial response. Indeed, this metaknowledge often reveals that how LLMs and\nusers interpret prompts are not aligned. Here I demonstrate this prompt using a\nset of questions taken from recent articles about LLM biases, including\nimplicit discriminatory biases and failures of metacognition. \"Could you be\nwrong\" prompts the LLM to identify its own biases and produce cogent\nmetacognitive reflection. I also present another example involving convincing\nbut incomplete information, which is readily corrected by the metacognitive\nprompt.

However, existing methods still face\nchallenges in handling high-order associations and semantic ambiguities among\nsimilar instances. These ambiguities arise from subtle differences between soft\npositive samples (semantically similar but incorrectly labeled) and soft\nnegative samples (locally matched but globally inconsistent), creating matching\nuncertainties. Furthermore, current methods fail to fully utilize the\nneighborhood relationships among semantically similar instances within training\nbatches, limiting the model's ability to learn high-order shared knowledge.\nThis paper proposes the Ambiguity-Aware and High-order Relation learning\nframework (AAHR) to address these issues. AAHR constructs a unified\nrepresentation space through dynamic clustering prototype contrastive learning,\neffectively mitigating the soft positive sample problem. The framework\nintroduces global and local feature extraction mechanisms and an adaptive\naggregation network, significantly enhancing full-grained semantic\nunderstanding capabilities. Additionally, AAHR employs intra-modal and\ninter-modal correlation matrices to investigate neighborhood relationships\namong sample instances thoroughly. It incorporates GNN to enhance semantic\ninteractions between instances. Furthermore, AAHR integrates momentum\ncontrastive learning to expand the negative sample set.

However, existing automatic\ndietary assessment systems often overlook critical non-visual factors, such as\nrecipe-specific ingredient substitutions that can significantly alter\nnutritional content, and rarely account for individual dietary needs, including\nallergies, restrictions, cultural practices, and personal preferences. In\nSwitzerland, while food-related information is available, it remains\nfragmented, and no centralized repository currently integrates all relevant\nnutrition-related aspects within a Swiss context. To bridge this divide, we\nintroduce the Swiss Food Knowledge Graph (SwissFKG), the first resource, to our\nbest knowledge, to unite recipes, ingredients, and their substitutions with\nnutrient data, dietary restrictions, allergen information, and national\nnutrition guidelines under one graph. We establish a LLM-powered enrichment\npipeline for populating the graph, whereby we further present the first\nbenchmark of four off-the-shelf (<70 B parameter) LLMs for food knowledge\naugmentation. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can effectively enrich the\ngraph with relevant nutritional information. Our SwissFKG goes beyond recipe\nrecommendations by offering ingredient-level information such as allergen and\ndietary restriction information, and guidance aligned with nutritional\nguidelines. Moreover, we implement a Graph-RAG application to showcase how the\nSwissFKG's rich natural-language data structure can help LLM answer\nuser-specific nutrition queries, and we evaluate LLM-embedding pairings by\ncomparing user-query responses against predefined expected answers.

As\nclinicians may rely on a model's stated confidence to gauge the reliability of\nits predictions, it is especially important that when a model expresses high\nconfidence, it is also highly accurate. We introduce Prompt4Trust, the first\nreinforcement learning (RL) framework for prompt augmentation targeting\nconfidence calibration in MLLMs. A lightweight LLM is trained to produce\ncontext-aware auxiliary prompts that guide a downstream task MLLM to generate\nresponses in which the expressed confidence more accurately reflects predictive\naccuracy. Unlike conventional calibration techniques, Prompt4Trust specifically\nprioritizes aspects of calibration most critical for safe and trustworthy\nclinical decision-making. Beyond improvements driven by this clinically\nmotivated calibration objective, our proposed method also improves task\naccuracy, achieving state-of-the-art medical visual question answering (VQA)\nperformance on the PMC-VQA benchmark, which is composed of multiple-choice\nquestions spanning diverse medical imaging modalities. Moreover, our framework\ntrained with a small downstream task MLLM showed promising zero-shot\ngeneralization to larger MLLMs in our experiments, suggesting the potential for\nscalable calibration without the associated computational costs. This work\ndemonstrates the potential of automated yet human-aligned prompt engineering\nfor improving the the trustworthiness of MLLMs in safety critical settings.

However, it remains unclear what mechanisms\ninside the model drive such task-level generalization. In this work, we\napproach this question through the lens of off-by-one addition (i.e., 1+1=3,\n2+2=5, 3+3=?), a two-step, counterfactual task with an unexpected +1 function\nas a second step. Leveraging circuit-style interpretability techniques such as\npath patching, we analyze the models' internal computations behind their\nnotable performance and present three key findings. First, we uncover a\nfunction induction mechanism that explains the model's generalization from\nstandard addition to off-by-one addition. This mechanism resembles the\nstructure of the induction head mechanism found in prior work and elevates it\nto a higher level of abstraction.

Extensive experiments on the proposed\ndataset demonstrate that Geo-RepNet achieves state-of-the-art performance while\nmaintaining robustness and high computational efficiency under complex and\nlow-texture surgical environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Geo-RepNet\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u5f3a\u624b\u672f\u9636\u6bb5\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408RGB\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u624b\u672f\u9636\u6bb5\u8bc6\u522b\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ed3\u6784\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u63d0\u4f9b\u51e0\u4f55\u7ebf\u7d22\u4ee5\u8865\u5145\u5916\u89c2\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGeo-RepNet\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eRepVGG\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u51e0\u4f55\u5148\u9a8c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u5757\uff08DGPG\uff09\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff08GEMA\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408RGB\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e5d\u9636\u6bb5ESD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cGeo-RepNet\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4f4e\u7eb9\u7406\u624b\u672f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u624b\u672f\u9636\u6bb5\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0cGeo-RepNet\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This principle forms the basis of transfer learning,\nwhere large pre-trained neural networks are fine-tuned to adapt to downstream\ntasks. Transfer learning has demonstrated tremendous success, both in terms of\ntask adaptation speed and performance. However there are several domains where,\ndue to lack of data, training such large pre-trained models or foundational\nmodels is not a possibility - computational chemistry, computational\nimmunology, and medical imaging are examples. To address these challenges, our\nwork focuses on designing architectures to enable efficient acquisition of\npriors when large amounts of data are unavailable. In particular, we\ndemonstrate that we can use neural memory to enable adaptation on\nnon-stationary distributions with only a few samples. Then we demonstrate that\nour hypernetwork designs (a network that generates another network) can acquire\nmore generalizable priors than standard networks when trained with Model\nAgnostic Meta-Learning (MAML).

To facilitate progress in this emerging area, we introduce\nProactiveBench, the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate a system's\nability to engage in proactive interaction.

This paper proposes the Dynamic Inter-Class Confusion-Aware Encoder\n(DICCAE), an encoder that aligns audio-video representations at a fine-grained,\ncategory-level. DICCAE addresses category confusion by dynamically adjusting\nthe confusion loss based on inter-class confusion degrees, thereby enhancing\nthe model's ability to distinguish between similar activities.

Our method is flexible and easily integrates with\nother distillation frameworks. Empirical results show consistent improvements\nover prior approaches across diverse tasks, including classification,\ninstruction-following, and summarization, achieving up to a 3\\% performance\ngain over the linear projection baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5f81\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7279\u5f81\u84b8\u998f\u4e2d\u5e08\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u9690\u85cf\u5c42\u5c3a\u5bf8\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u53473%\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7279\u5f81\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u6c42\u5e08\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u9690\u85cf\u5c42\u5c3a\u5bf8\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u7ebf\u6027\u6295\u5f71\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u989d\u5916\u53c2\u6570\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5c06\u5176\u6fc0\u6d3b\u84b8\u998f\u5230\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u548c\u6458\u8981\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u7ebf\u6027\u6295\u5f71\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u53473%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u3002"}}

This research introduces a\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based image classification system designed\nto automate the detection and classification of eight common crop diseases\nusing leaf imagery. The methodology involves a complete deep learning pipeline:\nimage acquisition from a large, labeled dataset, preprocessing via resizing,\nnormalization, and augmentation, and model training using TensorFlow with\nKeras' Sequential API. The CNN architecture comprises three convolutional\nlayers with increasing filter sizes and ReLU activations, followed by max\npooling, flattening, and fully connected layers, concluding with a softmax\noutput for multi-class classification. The system achieves high training\naccuracy (~90%) and demonstrates reliable performance on unseen data, although\na validation accuracy of ~60% suggests minor overfitting. Notably, the model\nintegrates a treatment recommendation module, providing actionable guidance by\nmapping each detected disease to suitable pesticide or fungicide interventions.\nFurthermore, the solution is deployed on an open-source, mobile-compatible\nplatform, enabling real-time image-based diagnostics for farmers in remote\nareas. This research contributes a scalable and accessible tool to the field of\nprecision agriculture, reducing reliance on manual inspection and promoting\nsustainable disease management practices.

Among\nvarious TTA approaches, cache-based methods show promise by preserving\nhistorical knowledge from low-entropy samples in a dynamic cache and fostering\nefficient adaptation. However, these methods face two critical reliability\nchallenges: (1) entropy often becomes unreliable under distribution shifts,\ncausing error accumulation in the cache and degradation in adaptation\nperformance; (2) the final predictions may be unreliable due to inflexible\ndecision boundaries that fail to accommodate large downstream shifts. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a Reliable Test-time Adaptation (ReTA)\nmethod that integrates two complementary strategies to enhance reliability from\ntwo perspectives. First, to mitigate the unreliability of entropy as a sample\nselection criterion for cache construction, we introduce Consistency-aware\nEntropy Reweighting (CER), which incorporates consistency constraints to weight\nentropy during cache updating. While conventional approaches rely solely on low\nentropy for cache prioritization and risk introducing noise, our method\nleverages predictive consistency to maintain a high-quality cache and\nfacilitate more robust adaptation. Second, we present Diversity-driven\nDistribution Calibration (DDC), which models class-wise text embeddings as\nmultivariate Gaussian distributions, enabling adaptive decision boundaries for\nmore accurate predictions across visually diverse content.

MENTOR combines an AR image generator with a two-stage training\nparadigm, enabling fine-grained, token-level alignment between multimodal\ninputs and image outputs without relying on auxiliary adapters or\ncross-attention modules. The two-stage training consists of: (1) a multimodal\nalignment stage that establishes robust pixel- and semantic-level alignment,\nfollowed by (2) a multimodal instruction tuning stage that balances the\nintegration of multimodal inputs and enhances generation controllability.\nDespite modest model size, suboptimal base components, and limited training\nresources, MENTOR achieves strong performance on the DreamBench++ benchmark,\noutperforming competitive baselines in concept preservation and prompt\nfollowing. Additionally, our method delivers superior image reconstruction\nfidelity, broad task adaptability, and improved training efficiency compared to\ndiffusion-based methods.

Various deep learning\napproaches (e.g., super-resolution techniques, monocular depth estimation) have\nbeen developed to create high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs).\nHowever, super-resolution techniques are limited by the upscaling factor, and\nmonocular depth estimation lacks global elevation context, making its\nconversion to a seamless DEM restricted. The recently introduced technique of\nprompt-based monocular depth estimation has opened new opportunities to extract\nestimates of absolute elevation in a global context. We present here a\nframework for the estimation of high-resolution DEMs as a new paradigm for\nabsolute global elevation mapping. It is exemplified using low-resolution\nShuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation data as prompts and\nhigh-resolution RGB imagery from the National Agriculture Imagery Program\n(NAIP). The approach fine-tunes a vision transformer encoder with LiDAR-derived\nDEMs and employs a versatile prompting strategy, enabling tasks such as DEM\nestimation, void filling, and updating. Our framework achieves a 100x\nresolution gain (from 30-m to 30-cm), surpassing prior methods by an order of\nmagnitude. Evaluations across three diverse U.S. landscapes show robust\ngeneralization, capturing urban structures and fine-scale terrain features with\n< 5 m MAE relative to LiDAR, improving over SRTM by up to 18%. Hydrological\nanalysis confirms suitability for hazard and environmental studies. We\ndemonstrate scalability by applying the framework to large regions in the U.S.\nand Israel.

This constraint stems from the fact that\nMLLMs are fine-tuned with fixed image resolution to align with the pre-trained\nimage encoder used in MLLM. Consequently, feeding high-resolution images\ndirectly into MLLMs leads to poor generalization due to a train-test resolution\ndiscrepancy, while downsampling these images-although ensuring\nconsistency-compromises fine-grained visual details and ultimately degrades\nperformance. To address this challenge, we propose Extract Candidate then\nPredict (ECP), a novel training-free, task-agnostic two-stage framework\ndesigned to enhance MLLM performance on high-resolution images. The key\nintuition behind ECP is that while MLLMs struggle with high-resolution images,\ntheir predictions on downsampled images still contain implicit localization\ncues.

However, most existing\nlearning-based hyperspectral reconstruction methods directly learn the\nRGB-to-HSI mapping using complex attention mechanisms, neglecting the inherent\nchallenge of transitioning from low-dimensional to high-dimensional\ninformation. To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage approach, MCGA,\nwhich first learns spectral patterns before estimating the mapping. In the\nfirst stage, a multi-scale VQ-VAE learns representations from heterogeneous HSI\ndatasets, extracting a Mixture of Codebooks (MoC). In the second stage, the\nRGB-to-HSI mapping is refined by querying features from the MoC to replace\nlatent HSI representations, incorporating prior knowledge rather than forcing a\ndirect high-dimensional transformation. To further enhance reconstruction\nquality, we introduce Grayscale-Aware Attention and Quantized Self-Attention,\nwhich adaptively adjust feature map intensities to meet hyperspectral\nreconstruction requirements. This physically motivated attention mechanism\nensures lightweight and efficient HSI recovery.

However,\nrecent studies on rotation-equivariant aerial object detection remain scarce.\nMost detectors rely on data augmentation to enable models to learn\napproximately rotation-equivariant features. A few detectors have constructed\nrotation-equivariant networks, but due to the breaking of strict rotation\nequivariance by typical downsampling processes, these networks only achieve\napproximately rotation-equivariant backbones. Whether strict rotation\nequivariance is necessary for aerial image object detection remains an open\nquestion. In this paper, we implement a strictly rotation-equivariant backbone\nand neck network with a more advanced network structure and compare it with\napproximately rotation-equivariant networks to quantitatively measure the\nimpact of rotation equivariance on the performance of aerial image detectors.\nAdditionally, leveraging the inherently grouped nature of rotation-equivariant\nfeatures, we propose a multi-branch head network that reduces the parameter\ncount while improving detection accuracy. Based on the aforementioned\nimprovements, this study proposes the Multi-branch head rotation-equivariant\nsingle-stage Detector (MessDet), which achieves state-of-the-art performance on\nthe challenging aerial image datasets DOTA-v1.0, DOTA-v1.5 and DIOR-R with an\nexceptionally low parameter count.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e25\u683c\u65cb\u8f6c\u7b49\u53d8\u7684\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668MessDet\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u591a\u5206\u652f\u5934\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u822a\u7a7a\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7269\u4f53\u65b9\u5411\u4efb\u610f\uff0c\u65cb\u8f6c\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u5bf9\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b49\u53d8\uff0c\u4e25\u683c\u7b49\u53d8\u662f\u5426\u5fc5\u8981\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e25\u683c\u65cb\u8f6c\u7b49\u53d8\u7684\u9aa8\u5e72\u548c\u9888\u90e8\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u5206\u652f\u5934\u7f51\u7edc\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728DOTA-v1.0\u3001DOTA-v1.5\u548cDIOR-R\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u6781\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e25\u683c\u65cb\u8f6c\u7b49\u53d8\u5bf9\u822a\u7a7a\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0cMessDet\u5728\u4f4e\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

To bridge these gaps, we introduce\na benchmark for retinal anomaly detection, which is comprehensive and\nsystematic in terms of data and algorithm. Through categorizing and\nbenchmarking previous methods, we find that a fully supervised approach\nleveraging disentangled representations of abnormalities (DRA) achieves the\nbest performance but suffers from significant drops in performance when\nencountering certain unseen anomalies. Inspired by the memory bank mechanisms\nin one-class supervised learning, we propose NFM-DRA, which integrates DRA with\na Normal Feature Memory to mitigate the performance degradation, establishing a\nnew SOTA.

While existing 2D and 3D physical attacks typically optimize\ntexture, they often struggle to balance physical realism and attack robustness.\nIn this work, we propose 3D Gaussian-based Adversarial Attack (3DGAA), a novel\nadversarial object generation framework that leverages the full 14-dimensional\nparameterization of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to jointly optimize geometry\nand appearance in physically realizable ways. Unlike prior works that rely on\npatches or texture, 3DGAA jointly perturbs both geometric attributes (shape,\nscale, rotation) and appearance attributes (color, opacity) to produce\nphysically realistic and transferable adversarial objects. We further introduce\na physical filtering module to preserve geometric fidelity, and a physical\naugmentation module to simulate complex physical scenarios, thus enhancing\nattack generalization under real-world conditions. We evaluate 3DGAA on both\nvirtual benchmarks and physical-world setups using miniature vehicle models.\nExperimental results show that 3DGAA achieves to reduce the detection mAP from\n87.21% to 7.38%, significantly outperforming existing 3D physical attacks.\nMoreover, our method maintains high transferability across different physical\nconditions, demonstrating a new state-of-the-art in physically realizable\nadversarial attacks.

This approach exponentially reduces the\nmotion error in a pixel-wise and frame-wise loopable manner. Despite its\nefficacy, P-BSC suffers from high computational overhead and error accumulation\ndue to its reliance on multi-frame phase calculations and weighted summations.\nInspired by P-BSC, we propose an image-sequential binomial self-compensation\n(I-BSC) to weight sum the homogeneous fringe images instead of successive phase\nframes, which generalizes the BSC concept from phase sequences to image\nsequences.

In real-world large-scale deployments of\na positioning system, PCPR models must continuously acquire, update, and\naccumulate knowledge to adapt to diverse and dynamic environments, i.e., the\nability known as continual learning (CL). However, existing PCPR models often\nsuffer from catastrophic forgetting, leading to significant performance\ndegradation in previously learned scenes when adapting to new environments or\nsensor types. This results in poor model scalability, increased maintenance\ncosts, and system deployment difficulties, undermining the practicality of\nPCPR. To address these issues, we propose LifelongPR, a novel continual\nlearning framework for PCPR, which effectively extracts and fuses knowledge\nfrom sequential point cloud data. First, to alleviate the knowledge loss, we\npropose a replay sample selection method that dynamically allocates sample\nsizes according to each dataset's information quantity and selects spatially\ndiverse samples for maximal representativeness. Second, to handle domain\nshifts, we design a prompt learning-based CL framework with a lightweight\nprompt module and a two-stage training strategy, enabling domain-specific\nfeature adaptation while minimizing forgetting.

Existing approaches attribute this issue\nto imbalanced learning across modalities and tend to address it through\ngradient balancing. However, this paper argues that balanced learning is not\nthe optimal setting for multimodal learning. With bias-variance analysis, we\nprove that imbalanced dependency on each modality obeying the inverse ratio of\ntheir variances contributes to optimal performance. To this end, we propose the\nAsymmetric Representation Learning(ARL) strategy to assist multimodal learning\nvia imbalanced optimization. ARL introduces auxiliary regularizers for each\nmodality encoder to calculate their prediction variance. ARL then calculates\ncoefficients via the unimodal variance to re-weight the optimization of each\nmodality, forcing the modality dependence ratio to be inversely proportional to\nthe modality variance ratio. Moreover, to minimize the generalization error,\nARL further introduces the prediction bias of each modality and jointly\noptimizes them with multimodal loss. Notably, all auxiliary regularizers share\nparameters with the multimodal model and rely only on the modality\nrepresentation. Thus the proposed ARL strategy introduces no extra parameters\nand is independent of the structures and fusion methods of the multimodal\nmodel. Finally, extensive experiments on various datasets validate the\neffectiveness and versatility of ARL.

Emotional\nexpression and micro-expression research probe into understanding human\npsychological responses to emotional stimuli, thereby revealing substantial\nhidden yet authentic emotions that can be useful in the event of diagnosis and\ninterviews. While increased attention had been provided to micro-expression\nanalysis, the studies were done under Ekman's assumption of emotion\nuniversality, where emotional expressions are identical across cultures and\nsocial contexts. Our computational study uncovers some of the influences of\nethnic background in expression analysis, leading to an argument that the\nemotional universality hypothesis is an overgeneralization from the perspective\nof manual psychological analysis. In this research, we propose to investigate\nthe level of influence of ethnicity in a simulated micro-expression scenario.\nWe construct a cross-cultural micro-expression database and algorithmically\nannotate the ethnic labels to facilitate the investigation. With the ethnically\nannotated dataset, we perform a prima facie study to compare mono-ethnicity and\nstereo-ethnicity in a controlled environment, which uncovers a certain\ninfluence of ethnic bias via an experimental way.

Existing methods attribute this\nproblem to the imbalanced learning between modalities and rebalance them\nthrough gradient modulation. However, they fail to explain why the dominant\nmodality in multimodal models also underperforms that in unimodal learning. In\nthis work, we reveal the optimization conflict between the modality encoder and\nmodality fusion module in multimodal models. Specifically, we prove that the\ncross-modal fusion in multimodal models decreases the gradient passed back to\neach modality encoder compared with unimodal models. Consequently, the\nperformance of each modality in the multimodal model is inferior to that in the\nunimodal model. To this end, we propose a disentangled gradient learning (DGL)\nframework to decouple the optimization of the modality encoder and modality\nfusion module in the multimodal model. DGL truncates the gradient\nback-propagated from the multimodal loss to the modality encoder and replaces\nit with the gradient from unimodal loss. Besides, DGL removes the gradient\nback-propagated from the unimodal loss to the modality fusion module. This\nhelps eliminate the gradient interference between the modality encoder and\nmodality fusion module while ensuring their respective optimization processes.\nFinally, extensive experiments on multiple types of modalities, tasks, and\nframeworks with dense cross-modal interaction demonstrate the effectiveness and\nversatility of the proposed DGL.

Traditional methods struggle to preserve fine-grained,\nidentity-specific features when degradation is severe, often producing\naverage-looking faces that lack individual characteristics. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce IP-FVR, a novel method that leverages a high-quality\nreference face image as a visual prompt to provide identity conditioning during\nthe denoising process. IP-FVR incorporates semantically rich identity\ninformation from the reference image using decoupled cross-attention\nmechanisms, ensuring detailed and identity consistent results. For intra-clip\nidentity drift (within 24 frames), we introduce an identity-preserving feedback\nlearning method that combines cosine similarity-based reward signals with\nsuffix-weighted temporal aggregation.

Drawing inspiration from resampler structures, we introduce DisCo,\na novel visual encapsulation method designed to yield semantically distinct and\ntemporally coherent visual tokens for video MLLMs. DisCo integrates two key\ncomponents: (1) A Visual Concept Discriminator (VCD) module, assigning unique\nsemantics for visual tokens by associating them in pair with discriminative\nconcepts in the video.

However, previous\nworks have ignored the misalignment when introducing the foundation models into\nfeature matching. The misalignment arises from the discrepancy between the\nfoundation models focusing on single-image understanding and the cross-image\nunderstanding requirement of feature matching. Specifically, 1) the embeddings\nderived from commonly used foundation models exhibit discrepancies with the\noptimal embeddings required for feature matching; 2) lacking an effective\nmechanism to leverage the single-image understanding ability into cross-image\nunderstanding. A significant consequence of the misalignment is they struggle\nwhen addressing multi-instance feature matching problems. To address this, we\nintroduce a simple but effective framework, called IMD (Image feature Matching\nwith a pre-trained Diffusion model) with two parts: 1) Unlike the dominant\nsolutions employing contrastive-learning based foundation models that emphasize\nglobal semantics, we integrate the generative-based diffusion models to\neffectively capture instance-level details. 2) We leverage the prompt mechanism\nin generative model as a natural tunnel, propose a novel cross-image\ninteraction prompting module to facilitate bidirectional information\ninteraction between image pairs.

Existing works generally employ the deterministic textual\nfeature adapter to refine each category textual representation.

Such\ndescription diversity offers rich discriminative semantic knowledge that can\nbenefit downstream visual learning tasks. Obviously, traditional deterministic\nadapter model cannot adequately capture this varied semantic information. Also,\nit is desirable to exploit the inter-class relationships in VLM adapter. To\naddress these issues, we propose to exploit random graph model into VLM adapter\nand develop a novel Vertex Random Graph Adapter (VRGAdapter). VRGAdapter first\nmodels the inherent diverse descriptions of each category and inter-class\nrelationships of different categories simultaneously by leveraging a Vertex\nRandom Knowledge Graph (VRKG) model. Then, it employs probabilistic message\npropagation on VRKG to learn context-aware distribution representation for each\nclass node. Finally, it adopts a reparameterized sampling function to achieve\ntextual adapter learning. Note that, VRGAdapter provides a more general adapter\nsolution that encompasses traditional graph-based adapter as a special case.

In imaging contexts, TDA\ntypically models data as filtered cubical complexes from which we can extract\ndiscriminative features using persistence homology. Meanwhile, convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs) have been shown to be biased towards texture based local\nfeatures. To address this limitation, we propose a TDA feature engineering\npipeline and a simple method to integrate topological features with deep\nlearning models on remote sensing classification. Our method improves the\nperformance of a ResNet18 model on the EuroSAT dataset by 1.44% achieving\n99.33% accuracy, which surpasses all previously reported single-model\naccuracies, including those with larger architectures, such as ResNet50 (2x\nlarger) and XL Vision Transformers (197x larger). We additionally show that our\nmethod's accuracy is 1.82% higher than our ResNet18 baseline on the RESISC45\ndataset.

In outdoor scenarios, hourly estimates rely\non cues like brightness, hue, and shadow positioning, while seasonal changes\nand weather inform date estimation. However, these visual cues significantly\ndepend on geographic context, closely linking timestamp prediction to\ngeo-localization. To address this interdependence, we introduce GT-Loc, a novel\nretrieval-based method that jointly predicts the capture time (hour and month)\nand geo-location (GPS coordinates) of an image. Our approach employs separate\nencoders for images, time, and location, aligning their embeddings within a\nshared high-dimensional feature space. Recognizing the cyclical nature of time,\ninstead of conventional contrastive learning with hard positives and negatives,\nwe propose a temporal metric-learning objective providing soft targets by\nmodeling pairwise time differences over a cyclical toroidal surface.
