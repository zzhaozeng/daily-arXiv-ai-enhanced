This richer\nconception of systematicity has been obscured by the long shadow of the\n\"systematicity challenge\" to connectionism, according to which network\narchitectures are fundamentally at odds with what Fodor and colleagues termed\n\"the systematicity of thought.\" I offer a conceptual framework for thinking\nabout \"the systematicity of thought\" that distinguishes four senses of the\nphrase. I use these distinctions to defuse the perceived tension between\nsystematicity and connectionism and show that the conception of systematicity\nthat historically shaped our sense of what makes thought rational,\nauthoritative, and scientific is more demanding than the Fodorian notion. To\ndetermine whether we have reason to hold AI models to this ideal of\nsystematicity, I then argue, we must look to the rationales for systematization\nand explore to what extent they transfer to AI models. I identify five such\nrationales and apply them to AI.

A common rendering setup\nfor training feed-forward approaches places a 3D object at the world origin and\nrenders it from cameras pointed toward the origin -- i.e., from favorable\nviews, limiting the applicability of these models to real-world scenarios\ninvolving varying and unknown camera poses. To overcome this limitation, we\nintroduce a novel adaptation framework that enables pretrained pose-free\nfeed-forward 3DGS models to handle unfavorable views. We leverage priors\nlearned from favorable images by feeding recentered images into a pretrained\nmodel augmented with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) layers. We further propose a\nGaussian adapter module to enhance the geometric consistency of the Gaussians\nderived from the recentered inputs, along with a Gaussian alignment method to\nrender accurate target views for training. Additionally, we introduce a new\ntraining strategy that utilizes an off-the-shelf dataset composed solely of\nfavorable images. Experimental results on both synthetic images from the Google\nScanned Objects dataset and real images from the OmniObject3D dataset validate\nthe effectiveness of our method in handling unfavorable input views."}

To support this task, we construct ChangeChat-105k, a\nlarge-scale instruction-following dataset, generated through a hybrid\nrule-based and GPT-assisted process, covering six interaction types: change\ncaptioning, classification, quantification, localization, open-ended question\nanswering, and multi-turn dialogues. Building on this dataset, we propose\nDeltaVLM, an end-to-end architecture tailored for interactive RSICA. DeltaVLM\nfeatures three innovations: (1) a fine-tuned bi-temporal vision encoder to\ncapture temporal differences; (2) a visual difference perception module with a\ncross-semantic relation measuring (CSRM) mechanism to interpret changes; and\n(3) an instruction-guided Q-former to effectively extract query-relevant\ndifference information from visual changes, aligning them with textual\ninstructions.

However, harnessing\nthe power of KGs can be daunting for non-experts, as it often requires\nformulating complex SPARQL queries to retrieve specific information. With the\nadvent of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a growing potential to\nautomatically translate natural language queries into the SPARQL format, thus\nbridging the gap between user-friendly interfaces and the sophisticated\narchitecture of KGs. The challenge remains in adequately informing LLMs about\nthe relevant context and structure of domain-specific KGs, e.g., in\nmanufacturing, to improve the accuracy of generated queries. In this paper, we\nevaluate multiple strategies that use LLMs as mediators to facilitate\ninformation retrieval from KGs.

To this end,\nwe extend and propose VGAF-GEMS to provide more fine grained and holistic\nanalysis on top of existing group level annotation of VGAF dataset. GEMS aims\nto predict basic discrete and continuous emotions (including valence and\narousal) as well as individual, group and event level perceived emotions. Our\nbenchmarking effort links individual, group and situational emotional responses\nholistically. The quantitative and qualitative comparisons with adapted\nstate-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of GEMS framework on\nVGAF-GEMS benchmarking.
