Prior work has\nexplored augmenting training data with LLM-synthesized rationales and applying\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance reasoning ability, which in turn can\nimprove downstream action prediction. However, the performance of such\napproaches remains inherently bounded by the reasoning capabilities of the\nmodel used to generate the rationales. In this paper, we introduce Shop-R1, a\nnovel reinforcement learning (RL) framework aimed at enhancing the reasoning\nability of LLMs for simulation of real human behavior in online shopping\nenvironments Specifically, Shop-R1 decomposes the human behavior simulation\ntask into two stages: rationale generation and action prediction, each guided\nby distinct reward signals. For rationale generation, we leverage internal\nmodel signals (e.g., logit distributions) to guide the reasoning process in a\nself-supervised manner.

Current approaches struggle to capture the nuanced biomechanical\ntransitions essential for meaningful sports analysis, often missing critical\nphases like preparation, execution, and follow-through that occur within\nseconds. To address these limitations, we introduce SV3.3B, a lightweight 3.3B\nparameter video understanding model that combines novel temporal motion\ndifference sampling with self-supervised learning for efficient on-device\ndeployment. Our approach employs a DWT-VGG16-LDA based keyframe extraction\nmechanism that intelligently identifies the 16 most representative frames from\nsports sequences, followed by a V-DWT-JEPA2 encoder pretrained through\nmask-denoising objectives and an LLM decoder fine-tuned for sports action\ndescription generation. Evaluated on a subset of the NSVA basketball dataset,\nSV3.3B achieves superior performance across both traditional text generation\nmetrics and sports-specific evaluation criteria, outperforming larger\nclosed-source models including GPT-4o variants while maintaining significantly\nlower computational requirements.

LLMs have led to questions about writing integrity, thereby driving\nthe creation of artificial intelligence (AI) detection technologies.\nAdversarial attacks, such as standard and humanized paraphrasing, inhibit\ndetectors' ability to detect machine-generated text. Previous studies have\nmainly focused on ChatGPT and other well-known LLMs and have shown varying\naccuracy across detectors. However, there is a clear gap in the literature\nabout DeepSeek, a recently published LLM. Therefore, in this work, we\ninvestigate whether six generally accessible AI detection tools -- AI Text\nClassifier, Content Detector AI, Copyleaks, QuillBot, GPT-2, and GPTZero -- can\nconsistently recognize text generated by DeepSeek. The detectors were exposed\nto the aforementioned adversarial attacks. We also considered DeepSeek as a\ndetector by performing few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT)\nfor classifying AI and human-written text. We collected 49 human-authored\nquestion-answer pairs from before the LLM era and generated matching responses\nusing DeepSeek-v3, producing 49 AI-generated samples. Then, we applied\nadversarial techniques such as paraphrasing and humanizing to add 196 more\nsamples. These were used to challenge detector robustness and assess accuracy\nimpact.

To address this, Restormer employs channel-wise self-attention, which\ncomputes attention across channels instead of spatial dimensions. While\neffective, this approach may overlook localized artifacts that are crucial for\nhigh-quality image restoration. To bridge this gap, we explore Dilated\nNeighborhood Attention (DiNA) as a promising alternative, inspired by its\nsuccess in high-level vision tasks. DiNA balances global context and local\nprecision by integrating sliding-window attention with mixed dilation factors,\neffectively expanding the receptive field without excessive overhead.

These agents handle both structured and unstructured\ndata, enabling automatic feature selection, model selection, and preprocessing\nrecommendation without manual intervention. We evaluate the system on publicly\navailable datasets from geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy imaging.\nFor example, in the case of structured data (anxiety data) and unstructured\ndata (colonoscopy polyps data), the pipeline begins with file-type detection by\nthe Ingestion Identifier Agent, followed by the Data Anonymizer Agent ensuring\nprivacy compliance, where we first identify the data type and then anonymize\nit. The Feature Extraction Agent identifies features using an embedding-based\napproach for tabular data, extracting all column names, and a multi-stage\nMedGemma-based approach for image data, which infers modality and disease name.\nThese features guide the Model-Data Feature Matcher Agent in selecting the\nbest-fit model from a curated repository. The Preprocessing Recommender Agent\nand Preprocessing Implementor Agent then apply tailored preprocessing based on\ndata type and model requirements. Finally, the ``Model Inference Agent\" runs\nthe selected model on the uploaded data and generates interpretable outputs\nusing tools like SHAP, LIME, and DETR attention maps.

To address these\nlimitations, we introduce GrAInS, an inference-time steering approach that\noperates across both language-only and vision-language models and tasks. GrAInS\nuses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to\nidentify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively\nattributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred\noutputs. These tokens are then used to construct directional steering vectors\nthat capture semantic shifts from undesirable to desirable behavior.

In this work, we investigated how size and\nseparability of subgroups affected by label bias influence the learned features\nand performance of a deep learning model. Therefore, we trained deep learning\nmodels for binary tissue density classification using the EMory BrEast imaging\nDataset (EMBED), where label bias affected separable subgroups (based on\nimaging manufacturer) or non-separable \"pseudo-subgroups\". We found that\nsimulated subgroup label bias led to prominent shifts in the learned feature\nrepresentations of the models. Importantly, these shifts within the feature\nspace were dependent on both the relative size and the separability of the\nsubgroup affected by label bias. We also observed notable differences in\nsubgroup performance depending on whether a validation set with clean labels\nwas used to define the classification threshold for the model. For instance,\nwith label bias affecting the majority separable subgroup, the true positive\nrate for that subgroup fell from 0.898, when the validation set had clean\nlabels, to 0.518, when the validation set had biased labels.

To separate these phases, LLMs\nare prompted to generate answers under two different cognitive modes, fast\nthinking and slow thinking, respectively. The performance under different\ncognitive modes is analyzed to quantify the contribution of knowledge and\nreasoning. This architecture is employed to 15 LLMs across 3 datasets.

In this work, we introduce GOAT-SLM, a novel\nspoken language model with paralinguistic and speaker characteristic awareness,\ndesigned to extend spoken language modeling beyond text semantics. GOAT-SLM\nadopts a dual-modality head architecture that decouples linguistic modeling\nfrom acoustic realization, enabling robust language understanding while\nsupporting expressive and adaptive speech generation. To enhance model\nefficiency and versatility, we propose a modular, staged training strategy that\nprogressively aligns linguistic, paralinguistic, and speaker characteristic\ninformation using large-scale speech-text corpora. Experimental results on\nTELEVAL, a multi-dimensional evaluation benchmark, demonstrate that GOAT-SLM\nachieves well-balanced performance across both semantic and non-semantic tasks,\nand outperforms existing open-source models in handling emotion, dialectal\nvariation, and age-sensitive interactions.

(2)\nMulti-modal Code Editing (MCE) assesses the model's capacity for fine-grained\noperations, which include three types: Deletion, Modification and Annotation.\nTo evaluate the above tasks, we incorporate a dataset that covers the five most\npopular types of mathematical figures, including geometric diagrams, function\nplots, and three types of statistical charts, to provide a comprehensive and\neffective measurement of existing MLLMs. Our experimental evaluation involves\nnine mainstream MLLMs, and the results reveal that existing models still lag\nsignificantly behind human performance in performing fine-grained visual\noperations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0a\u4ecd\u8fdc\u843d\u540e\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86MLLMs\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u7801\u6267\u884c\u51c6\u786e\u89c6\u89c9\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\uff08MCG\uff09\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ee3\u7801\u7f16\u8f91\uff08MCE\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e94\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u6570\u5b66\u56fe\u5f62\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e5d\u79cd\u4e3b\u6d41MLLMs\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u64cd\u4f5c\uff08\u5982\u5220\u9664\u3001\u4fee\u6539\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\uff09\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u4f4e\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30MLLMs\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u521d\u6b65\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Our experiment shows that post-training on the \\textbf{TAV}\ndataset improves prompt-based scene transition understanding, narrows the gap\nbetween required and generated scenes, and maintains image quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aTAV\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3AI\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u591a\u573a\u666f\u8fc7\u6e21\u4e0d\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u573a\u666f\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u77ed\u7247\u6bb5\u5355\u573a\u666f\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u591a\u573a\u666f\u8fc7\u6e21\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u573a\u666f\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Transition-Aware Video (TAV)\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u591a\u573a\u666f\u8fc7\u6e21\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528TAV\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u573a\u666f\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u591a\u573a\u666f\u89c6\u9891\u66f4\u8fde\u8d2f\uff0c\u4e14\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u6301\u3002", "conclusion": "TAV\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u573a\u666f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u6e21\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose VLM-IMI, a novel\nframework that leverages large vision-language models (VLMs) with iterative and\nmanual instructions (IMIs) for LLIE. VLM-IMI incorporates textual descriptions\nof the desired normal-light content as enhancement cues, enabling semantically\ninformed restoration.

This refinement enhances structural fidelity, semantic\nalignment, and the recovery of fine details under extremely low-light\nconditions.

Subsequently, the framework was\napplied to quantify the spatial uniformity of meibomian gland atrophy and to\nanalyze the difference in this uniformity between \\textit{Demodex}-negative and\n\\textit{Demodex}-positive patient groups. The results demonstrated a\nsignificant difference in tortuosity-based uniformity between the two groups,\nwith an area under the curve of 0.8768, sensitivity of 0.75, and specificity of\n0.93.

While diffusion-based methods\nhave shown promising performance due to their strong generative capabilities.\nHowever, their unidirectional modelling of degradation often struggles to\ncapture the complexity of real-world degradation patterns, leading to\nstructural inconsistencies and pixel misalignments. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a bidirectional diffusion optimization mechanism that\njointly models the degradation processes of both low-light and normal-light\nimages, enabling more precise degradation parameter matching and enhancing\ngeneration quality. Specifically, we perform bidirectional diffusion-from\nlow-to-normal light and from normal-to-low light during training and introduce\nan adaptive feature interaction block (AFI) to refine feature representation.\nBy leveraging the complementarity between these two paths, our approach imposes\nan implicit symmetry constraint on illumination attenuation and noise\ndistribution, facilitating consistent degradation learning and improving the\nmodels ability to perceive illumination and detail degradation. Additionally,\nwe design a reflection-aware correction module (RACM) to guide color\nrestoration post-denoising and suppress overexposed regions, ensuring content\nconsistency and generating high-quality images that align with human visual\nperception.

The defining\ncharacteristic of LRMs lies in their extensive chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning\ncapabilities. In this paper, we identify a previously unexplored attack vector\nagainst LRMs, which we term \"overthinking backdoors\". We advance this concept\nby proposing a novel tunable backdoor, which moves beyond simple on/off attacks\nto one where an attacker can precisely control the extent of the model's\nreasoning verbosity. Our attack is implemented through a novel data poisoning\nmethodology. It pairs a tunable trigger-where the number of repetitions signals\nthe desired intensity-with a correspondingly verbose CoT response. These\nresponses are programmatically generated by instructing a teacher LLM to inject\na controlled number of redundant refinement steps into a correct reasoning\nprocess.

We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE,\nGoogle Scholar, and arXiv databases for publications associated with generating\nsynthetic medical unstructured free-text. We have identified 94 relevant\narticles out of 1,398 collected ones. A great deal of attention has been given\nto the generation of synthetic medical text from 2018 onwards, where the main\npurpose of such a generation is towards text augmentation, assistive writing,\ncorpus building, privacy-preserving, annotation, and usefulness. Transformer\narchitectures were the main predominant technique used to generate the text,\nespecially the GPTs. On the other hand, there were four main aspects of\nevaluation, including similarity, privacy, structure, and utility, where\nutility was the most frequent method used to assess the generated synthetic\nmedical text. Although the generated synthetic medical text demonstrated a\nmoderate possibility to act as real medical documents in different downstream\nNLP tasks, it has proven to be a great asset as augmented, complementary to the\nreal documents, towards improving the accuracy and overcoming\nsparsity/undersampling issues. Yet, privacy is still a major issue behind\ngenerating synthetic medical text, where more human assessments are needed to\ncheck for the existence of any sensitive information.

To\naddress these challenges, we propose AQuilt, a framework for constructing\ninstruction-tuning data for any specialized domains from corresponding\nunlabeled data, including Answer, Question, Unlabeled data, Inspection, Logic,\nand Task type. By incorporating logic and inspection, we encourage reasoning\nprocesses and self-inspection to enhance model performance. Moreover,\ncustomizable task instructions enable high-quality data generation for any\ntask. As a result, we construct a dataset of 703k examples to train a powerful\ndata synthesis model. Experiments show that AQuilt is comparable to DeepSeek-V3\nwhile utilizing just 17% of the production cost. Further analysis demonstrates\nthat our generated data exhibits higher relevance to downstream tasks.

In this\npaper, we propose a novel deep learning approach for head pose estimation with\nlimited training data via non-linear manifold learning called NLML-HPE. This\nmethod is based on the combination of tensor decomposition (i.e., Tucker\ndecomposition) and feed forward neural networks. Unlike traditional\nclassification-based approaches, our method formulates head pose estimation as\na regression problem, mapping input landmarks into a continuous representation\nof pose angles. To this end, our method uses tensor decomposition to split each\nEuler angle (yaw, pitch, roll) to separate subspaces and models each dimension\nof the underlying manifold as a cosine curve. We address two key challenges: 1.\nAlmost all HPE datasets suffer from incorrect and inaccurate pose annotations.\nHence, we generated a precise and consistent 2D head pose dataset for our\ntraining set by rotating 3D head models for a fixed set of poses and rendering\nthe corresponding 2D images. 2. We achieved real-time performance with limited\ntraining data as our method accurately captures the nature of rotation of an\nobject from facial landmarks. Once the underlying manifold for rotation around\neach axis is learned, the model is very fast in predicting unseen data.

We release the\ndataset and benchmark to foster further research:\nhttps://graceduansu.github.io/IdentifyingPromptedArtists/", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u50cf\u8bc6\u522b\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8c03\u7528\u7684\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u540d\u79f0\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u660e\u786e\u547d\u540d\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u540d\u79f0\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7ba1\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b1.95M\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8986\u76d6110\u4f4d\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u56db\u79cd\u6cdb\u5316\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u57fa\u7ebf\u3001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u98ce\u683c\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u539f\u578b\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u548c\u590d\u6742\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u800c\u98ce\u683c\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u5728\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u98ce\u683c\u660e\u663e\u65f6\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u5f3a\uff1b\u591a\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u63d0\u793a\u6700\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7ba1\u7406\u3002"}}

Project page: https://thecinema.ai", "summary": "We present Captain Cinema, a generation framework for short movie generation.\nGiven a detailed textual description of a movie storyline, our approach firstly\ngenerates a sequence of keyframes that outline the entire narrative, which\nensures long-range coherence in both the storyline and visual appearance (e.g.,\nscenes and characters). We refer to this step as top-down keyframe planning.\nThese keyframes then serve as conditioning signals for a video synthesis model,\nwhich supports long context learning, to produce the spatio-temporal dynamics\nbetween them. This step is referred to as bottom-up video synthesis. To support\nstable and efficient generation of multi-scene long narrative cinematic works,\nwe introduce an interleaved training strategy for Multimodal Diffusion\nTransformers (MM-DiT), specifically adapted for long-context video data. Our\nmodel is trained on a specially curated cinematic dataset consisting of\ninterleaved data pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that Captain Cinema\nperforms favorably in the automated creation of visually coherent and narrative\nconsistent short movies in high quality and efficiency.
