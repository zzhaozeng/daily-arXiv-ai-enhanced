Second, we introduce a Hierarchical Sparse Attention (HSA)\nmechanism that adaptively adjusts attention patterns according to a variety of\ninput lengths, reducing computational complexity from O($n^2$) to O($n$) while\nmaintaining model performance. Finally, we propose a soft absorption guidance\noptimization strategy that combines with DPM-solver++ to reduce diffusion\nsteps, significantly improving generation speed.

We identify\nthe shortcomings in the current benchmarks, where we show that a single frame\ncan often suffice for capturing the motion referring expression without any\ntemporal reasoning. To address this, we introduce four motion-centric probing\ntechniques, particularly designed for the visual grounding task, to study video\nMLLMs' ability to identify true motion from a fake one and their ability to\ngrasp the motion order.

Numerous visual-only approaches\naddress these issues by partitioning an image and applying attention modules,\nyet they rely on costly manual annotations and struggle with complex\nocclusions. Recent multimodal methods, motivated by CLIP, introduce semantic\ncues to guide visual understanding. However, they focus solely on foreground\ninformation, but overlook the potential value of background cues. Inspired by\nhuman perception, we argue that background semantics are as important as the\nforeground semantics in ReID, as humans tend to eliminate background\ndistractions while focusing on target appearance. Therefore, this paper\nproposes an end-to-end framework that jointly models foreground and background\ninformation within a dual-branch cross-modal feature extraction pipeline.

Pre-training broke the symmetry among\ntokens and grouped them into finite, small, strong match token clusters, as\ninferred from the presented token confusion matrix. This feature was sharpened\nalong the transformer blocks toward the output layer, enhancing its performance\nconsiderably compared with that of the embedding layer.

Additionally, the output label prediction\nconfidence was found to be independent of the average input APT, as the input\nmeaning was preserved since the tokens are replaced primarily by strong match\ntokens.

Strefer produces\ndiverse instruction-tuning data using a data engine that pseudo-annotates\ntemporally dense, fine-grained video metadata, capturing rich spatial and\ntemporal information in a structured manner, including subjects, objects, their\nlocations as masklets, and their action descriptions and timelines. Our\napproach enhances the ability of Video LLMs to interpret spatial and temporal\nreferences, fostering more versatile, space-time-aware reasoning essential for\nreal-world AI companions. Without using proprietary models, costly human\nannotation, or the need to annotate large volumes of new videos, experimental\nevaluations show that models trained with data produced by Strefer outperform\nbaselines on tasks requiring spatial and temporal disambiguation. Additionally,\nthese models exhibit enhanced space-time-aware reasoning, establishing a new\nfoundation for perceptually grounded, instruction-tuned Video LLMs."}

The main challenge\nin this domain is the reliance on fine-grained location-level annotations,\n(i.e. points placed on top of each individual) to train deep networks.\nCollecting such detailed annotations is both tedious, time-consuming, and poses\na significant barrier to scalability for real-world applications. To alleviate\nthis burden, we present Count2Density: a novel pipeline designed to predict\nmeaningful density maps containing quantitative spatial information using only\ncount-level annotations (i.e., total number of people) during training. To\nachieve this, Count2Density generates pseudo-density maps leveraging past\npredictions stored in a Historical Map Bank, thereby reducing confirmation\nbias. This bank is initialised using an unsupervised saliency estimator to\nprovide an initial spatial prior and is iteratively updated with an EMA of\npredicted density maps. These pseudo-density maps are obtained by sampling\nlocations from estimated crowd areas using a hypergeometric distribution, with\nthe number of samplings determined by the count-level annotations. To further\nenhance the spatial awareness of the model, we add a self-supervised\ncontrastive spatial regulariser to encourage similar feature representations\nwithin crowded regions while maximising dissimilarity with background regions.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms\ncross-domain adaptation methods and achieves better results than recent\nstate-of-the-art approaches in semi-supervised settings across several\ndatasets. Additional analyses validate the effectiveness of each individual\ncomponent of our pipeline, confirming the ability of Count2Density to\neffectively retrieve spatial information from count-level annotations and\nenabling accurate subregion counting."}

To\nsupport this research, we create a small, custom dataset featuring military\nvehicles: MilCivVeh. We explore the vulnerability of military object detectors\nfor poisoning attacks by implementing a modified version of the BadDet attack:\na patch-based poisoning attack. We then assess its impact, finding that while a\npositive attack success rate is achievable, it requires a substantial portion\nof the data to be poisoned -- raising questions about its practical\napplicability. To address the detection challenge, we test both specialized\npoisoning detection methods and anomaly detection methods from the visual\nindustrial inspection domain.

The synthesized image quality is improved by our\nproposed CLIP-based Fr\\'echet Inception Distance loss. The generative model in\nJTGD is trained jointly with the detector to encourage the generative model to\nsynthesize harder examples for the detector. Since harder synthesized images of\nbetter quality caused by the aforesaid design are used in the data\naugmentation, JTGD outperforms the state-of-the-art method in the RDD2022 road\ndefect detection benchmark across various countries under the condition of no\nensemble and TTA. JTGD only uses less than 20% of the number of parameters\ncompared with the competing baseline, which makes it more suitable for\ndeployment on edge devices in practice."}

To bridge this critical gap, we introduce Strefer, a\nsynthetic instruction data generation framework designed to equip Video LLMs\nwith spatiotemporal referring and reasoning capabilities. Strefer produces\ndiverse instruction-tuning data using a data engine that pseudo-annotates\ntemporally dense, fine-grained video metadata, capturing rich spatial and\ntemporal information in a structured manner, including subjects, objects, their\nlocations as masklets, and their action descriptions and timelines. Our\napproach enhances the ability of Video LLMs to interpret spatial and temporal\nreferences, fostering more versatile, space-time-aware reasoning essential for\nreal-world AI companions. Without using proprietary models, costly human\nannotation, or the need to annotate large volumes of new videos, experimental\nevaluations show that models trained with data produced by Strefer outperform\nbaselines on tasks requiring spatial and temporal disambiguation. Additionally,\nthese models exhibit enhanced space-time-aware reasoning, establishing a new\nfoundation for perceptually grounded, instruction-tuned Video LLMs."}

However, with the emerging advances of T2I models in reasoning\nbeyond composition, existing benchmarks reveal clear limitations in providing\ncomprehensive evaluations across and within these capabilities. Meanwhile,\nthese advances also enable models to handle more complex prompts, whereas\ncurrent benchmarks remain limited to low scene density and simplified\none-to-one reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose T2I-CoReBench, a\ncomprehensive and complex benchmark that evaluates both composition and\nreasoning capabilities of T2I models. To ensure comprehensiveness, we structure\ncomposition around scene graph elements (instance, attribute, and relation) and\nreasoning around the philosophical framework of inference (deductive,\ninductive, and abductive), formulating a 12-dimensional evaluation taxonomy. To\nincrease complexity, driven by the inherent complexities of real-world\nscenarios, we curate each prompt with high compositional density for\ncomposition and multi-step inference for reasoning. We also pair each prompt\nwith a checklist that specifies individual yes/no questions to assess each\nintended element independently to facilitate fine-grained and reliable\nevaluation. In statistics, our benchmark comprises 1,080 challenging prompts\nand around 13,500 checklist questions. Experiments across 27 current T2I models\nreveal that their composition capability still remains limited in complex\nhigh-density scenarios, while the reasoning capability lags even further behind\nas a critical bottleneck, with all models struggling to infer implicit elements\nfrom prompts.

The\nsystem is designed for interpretable lane change trajectory prediction by\nfinetuning an LLM to output the core physical parameters of a trajectory model\ninstead of raw coordinates. For lane-keeping scenarios, the model predicts\ndiscrete coordinates, but for lane change maneuvers, it generates the\nparameters for an enhanced Sinusoidal Acceleration Model (SAM), including\nlateral displacement, maneuver duration, initial lateral velocity, and\nlongitudinal velocity change. This parametric approach yields a complete,\ncontinuous, and physically plausible trajectory model that is inherently\ninterpretable and computationally efficient, achieving an 80% reduction in\noutput size compared to coordinate-based methods.
