Recent\napproaches attempt to address this challenge by leveraging the rich world\nknowledge of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), but these methods suffer from\nseveral limitations: (1) a significant domain gap between the pre-training data\nof VLMs and real-world driving data, (2) a dimensionality mismatch between the\ndiscrete language space and the continuous action space, and (3) imitation\nlearning tends to capture the average behavior present in the dataset, which\nmay be suboptimal even dangerous. In this paper, we propose ReCogDrive, an\nautonomous driving system that integrates VLMs with diffusion planner, which\nadopts a three-stage paradigm for training. In the first stage, we use a\nlarge-scale driving question-answering datasets to train the VLMs, mitigating\nthe domain discrepancy between generic content and real-world driving\nscenarios. In the second stage, we employ a diffusion-based planner to perform\nimitation learning, mapping representations from the latent language space to\ncontinuous driving actions. Finally, we fine-tune the diffusion planner using\nreinforcement learning with NAVSIM non-reactive simulator, enabling the model\nto generate safer, more human-like driving trajectories. We evaluate our\napproach on the planning-oriented NAVSIM benchmark, achieving a PDMS of 89.6\nand setting a new state-of-the-art that surpasses the previous vision-only SOTA\nby 5.6 PDMS."}

To\nfacilitate this, we present GrAImes: an evaluation protocol grounded in\nliterary theory, specifically drawing from a literary perspective, to offer an\nobjective framework for assessing AI-generated microfiction.

To more effectively extract\nand fuse spatial context with fine spectral information in hyperspectral image\n(HSI) classification, this paper proposes a novel network architecture called\nSTNet. The core advantage of STNet stems from the dual innovative design of its\nSpatial-Spectral Transformer module: first, the fundamental explicit decoupling\nof spatial and spectral attention ensures targeted capture of key information\nin HSI; second, two functionally distinct gating mechanisms perform intelligent\nregulation at both the fusion level of attention flows (adaptive attention\nfusion gating) and the internal level of feature transformation (GFFN). This\ncharacteristic demonstrates superior feature extraction and fusion capabilities\ncompared to traditional convolutional neural networks, while reducing\noverfitting risks in small-sample and high-noise scenarios. STNet enhances\nmodel representation capability without increasing network depth or width. The\nproposed method demonstrates superior performance on IN, UP, and KSC datasets,\noutperforming mainstream hyperspectral image classification approaches."}

This\nstrategy promotes alignment between 2D and 3D modalities and enables the model\nto benefit from rich visual cues in the RGB-D inputs. However, these approaches\nare limited by their reliance on implicit scene representations and high memory\ndemands.

In this paper, we propose Bingo, an RL\nframework that advances length-based reward design to boost efficient\nreasoning. Bingo incorporates two key mechanisms: a significance-aware length\nreward, which gradually guides the model to reduce only insignificant tokens,\nand a dynamic length reward, which initially encourages elaborate reasoning for\nhard questions but decays over time to improve overall efficiency.

Concept\nreplacement techniques (CRTs) aim to address this challenge, often by trying to\n\"erase\" unacceptable concepts from models. Recently, model providers have\nstarted offering image editing services which accept an image and a text prompt\nas input, to produce an image altered as specified by the prompt. These are\nknown as image-to-image (I2I) models. In this paper, we first use an I2I model\nto empirically demonstrate that today's state-of-the-art CRTs do not in fact\nerase unacceptable concepts.

By contrast, active reasoning-where an LLM must interact with\nexternal systems to acquire missing evidence or data-has received little\nsystematic attention. To address this shortfall, we present AR-Bench, a novel\nbenchmark designed explicitly to evaluate an LLM's active reasoning skills.\nAR-Bench comprises three task families-detective cases, situation puzzles, and\nguessing numbers-that together simulate real-world, agentic scenarios and\nmeasure performance across commonsense, logical, and symbolic reasoning\nchallenges. Empirical evaluation on AR-Bench demonstrates that contemporary\nLLMs exhibit pronounced difficulties with active reasoning: they frequently\nfail to acquire or leverage the information needed to solve tasks. This gap\nhighlights a stark divergence between their passive and active reasoning\nabilities. Moreover, ablation studies indicate that even advanced strategies,\nsuch as tree-based searching or post-training approaches, yield only modest\ngains and fall short of the levels required for real-world deployment.\nCollectively, these findings highlight the critical need to advance methodology\nfor active reasoning, e.g., incorporating interactive learning, real-time\nfeedback loops, and environment-aware objectives for training.

This results in three key limitations: (1) an\ninability to utilize images without accompanying captions, (2) the risk that\ncaptions omit critical visual details, and (3) the challenge that certain\nvision-centric content cannot be adequately conveyed through text. As a result,\ncurrent LVLMs often prioritize vision-to-language alignment while potentially\noverlooking fine-grained visual information. While some prior works have\nexplored autoregressive image generation, effectively leveraging autoregressive\nvisual supervision to enhance image understanding remains an open challenge. In\nthis paper, we introduce Autoregressive Semantic Visual Reconstruction (ASVR),\nwhich enables joint learning of visual and textual modalities within a unified\nautoregressive framework. We show that autoregressively reconstructing the raw\nvisual appearance of images does not enhance and may even impair multimodal\nunderstanding. In contrast, autoregressively reconstructing the semantic\nrepresentation of images consistently improves comprehension.

Its ability to safeguard privacy,\nat the heart of FL, has recently been a hot-button debate topic. To elaborate,\nseveral studies have introduced a type of attacks known as gradient leakage\nattacks (GLAs), which exploit the gradients shared during training to\nreconstruct clients' raw data. On the flip side, some literature, however,\ncontends no substantial privacy risk in practical FL environments due to the\neffectiveness of such GLAs being limited to overly relaxed conditions, such as\nsmall batch sizes and knowledge of clients' data distributions.\n  This paper bridges this critical gap by empirically demonstrating that\nclients' data can still be effectively reconstructed, even within realistic FL\nenvironments. Upon revisiting GLAs, we recognize that their performance\nfailures stem from their inability to handle the gradient matching problem. To\nalleviate the performance bottlenecks identified above, we develop FedLeak,\nwhich introduces two novel techniques, partial gradient matching and gradient\nregularization. Moreover, to evaluate the performance of FedLeak in real-world\nFL environments, we formulate a practical evaluation protocol grounded in a\nthorough review of extensive FL literature and industry practices. Under this\nprotocol, FedLeak can still achieve high-fidelity data reconstruction, thereby\nunderscoring the significant vulnerability in FL systems and the urgent need\nfor more effective defense methods."}
