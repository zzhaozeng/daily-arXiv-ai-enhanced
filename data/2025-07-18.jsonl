To\naddress these issues simultaneously, we propose a novel decoupled optimization\nframework, which integrates wavelet decomposition into 3D Gaussian Splatting\nand 2D sampling. Technically, through 3D wavelet decomposition, our approach\ndivides point clouds into high-frequency and low-frequency components, enabling\ntargeted optimization for each. The low-frequency component captures global\nstructural outlines and manages the distribution of Gaussians through\nvoxelization. In contrast, the high-frequency component restores intricate\ngeometric and textural details while incorporating a relight module to mitigate\nlighting artifacts and enhance photorealistic rendering. Additionally, a 2D\nwavelet decomposition is applied to the training images, simulating radiance\nvariations.

In order to reliably accomplish these\ntasks, LMs must be able to discern the modal category of a sentence (i.e.,\nwhether it describes something that is possible, impossible, completely\nnonsensical, etc.). However, recent studies have called into question the\nability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al.,\n2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that\ndiscriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal\ndifference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have\naccess to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously\nreported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a\nconsistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps,\nlayers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors\nidentified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human\ncategorization behavior. This potentially provides a novel view into how human\nparticipants distinguish between modal categories, which we explore by\ncorrelating projections along modal difference vectors with human participants'\nratings of interpretable features.

However, these gains often persist\neven when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted\nrewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true\nreasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific\npatterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective\nand identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First,\n\\emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test\nproblems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \\emph{evaluation\nfragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are\nhighly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning\nconsistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic\nevaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting\nfixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve\nmultiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across\nstructurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and\nimproving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular\nbenchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and\nVAR-AIME24. Experimental results reveal substantial performance drops for\nRL-trained models on the variabilized versions, especially for smaller models,\nwith average declines of 48.0\\% on AMC23 and 58.3\\% on AIME24. These findings\nsuggest that many existing RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and fail\nto generalize beyond specific numerical forms.

However, this method has certain limitations, being the most\nconcerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is\nto have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a\nlarge and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and\ncostly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators\nand having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is\nthe use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can\nfreely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models.\nThe results are then elaborated into a model ranking. An increasingly important\naspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how\nenergy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of\ninterest. In this paper, we present GEA, the Generative Energy Arena, an arena\nthat incorporates information on the energy consumption of the model in the\nevaluation process. Preliminary results obtained with GEA are also presented,\nshowing that for most questions, when users are aware of the energy\nconsumption, they favor smaller and more energy efficient models.

However, recent studies have called into question the\nability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al.,\n2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that\ndiscriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal\ndifference vectors.

To address this challenge, this study presents an innovative method for\nclassifying food images, named Feature-Enhanced TResNet (FE-TResNet),\nspecifically designed to address fine-grained food images and accurately\ncapture subtle features within them. The FE-TResNet method is based on the\nTResNet model and integrates Style-based Recalibration Module (StyleRM) and\nDeep Channel-wise Attention (DCA) technologies to enhance feature extraction\ncapabilities. In experimental validation on Chinese food image datasets\nChineseFoodNet and CNFOOD-241, the FE-TResNet method significantly improved\nclassification accuracy, achieving rates of 81.37% and 80.29%, respectively,\ndemonstrating its effectiveness and superiority in fine-grained food image\nclassification."}

The solution lies in effectively constructing the spectral-spatial\njoint distribution conditioned on the RGB image to complement the unobservable\nfeature. Since HSIs share a similar spatial structure with the corresponding\nRGB images, it is rational to capitalize on the rich spatial knowledge in RGB\npre-trained models for spectral-spatial joint distribution learning. To this\nend, we extend the RGB pre-trained latent diffusion model (RGB-LDM) to an\nunobservable feature LDM (ULDM) for SR. As the RGB-LDM and its corresponding\nspatial autoencoder (SpaAE) already excel in spatial knowledge, the ULDM can\nfocus on modeling spectral structure. Moreover, separating the unobservable\nfeature from the HSI reduces the redundant spectral information and empowers\nthe ULDM to learn the joint distribution in a compact latent space.\nSpecifically, we propose a two-stage pipeline consisting of spectral structure\nrepresentation learning and spectral-spatial joint distribution learning to\ntransform the RGB-LDM into the ULDM.

These low-rank matrices are commonly derived\nthrough the multiplication structure of down-projection and up-projection\nmatrices, exemplified by methods such as LoRA and Adapter. In this work, we\nobserve an approximate orthogonality among any two row or column vectors within\nany weight matrix of the backbone parameters; however, this property is absent\nin the vectors of the down/up-projection matrices. Approximate orthogonality\nimplies a reduction in the upper bound of the model's generalization error,\nsignifying that the model possesses enhanced generalization capability. If the\nfine-tuned down/up-projection matrices were to exhibit this same property as\nthe pre-trained backbone matrices, could the generalization capability of\nfine-tuned ViTs be further augmented? To address this question, we propose an\nApproximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (AOFT) strategy for representing the\nlow-rank weight matrices. This strategy employs a single learnable vector to\ngenerate a set of approximately orthogonal vectors, which form the\ndown/up-projection matrices, thereby aligning the properties of these matrices\nwith those of the backbone.

Previous methods solve the issue of\ninsufficient observation by leveraging 4D diffusion models to generate videos\nat novel viewpoints.

In this\npaper, we propose a novel sliding iterative denoising process to enhance the\nspatio-temporal consistency of the 4D diffusion model. Specifically, we define\na latent grid in which each latent encodes the image, camera pose, and human\npose for a certain viewpoint and timestamp, then alternately denoising the\nlatent grid along spatial and temporal dimensions with a sliding window, and\nfinally decode the videos at target viewpoints from the corresponding denoised\nlatents. Through the iterative sliding, information flows sufficiently across\nthe latent grid, allowing the diffusion model to obtain a large receptive field\nand thus enhance the 4D consistency of the output, while making the GPU memory\nconsumption affordable.
