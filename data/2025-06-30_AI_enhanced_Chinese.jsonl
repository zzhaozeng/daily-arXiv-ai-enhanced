It is widely recognized that achieving\nhuman-like efficiency and robustness manipulation requires the robotic brain to\nintegrate a comprehensive set of functions, such as task planning, policy\ngeneration, anomaly monitoring and handling, and long-term memory, achieving\nhigh-efficiency operation across all functions. Vision-Language Models (VLMs),\npretrained on massive multimodal data, have acquired rich world knowledge,\nexhibiting exceptional scene understanding and multimodal reasoning\ncapabilities. However, existing methods typically focus on realizing only a\nsingle function or a subset of functions within the robotic brain, without\nintegrating them into a unified cognitive architecture. Inspired by a\ndivide-and-conquer strategy and the architecture of the human brain, we propose\nFrankenBot, a VLM-driven, brain-morphic robotic manipulation framework that\nachieves both comprehensive functionality and high operational efficiency. Our\nframework includes a suite of components, decoupling a part of key functions\nfrom frequent VLM calls, striking an optimal balance between functional\ncompleteness and system efficiency. Specifically, we map task planning, policy\ngeneration, memory management, and low-level interfacing to the cortex,\ncerebellum, temporal lobe-hippocampus complex, and brainstem, respectively, and\ndesign efficient coordination mechanisms for the modules.

As manufacturing tasks become more\ncomplex, full automation is not always an option, human involvement may be\nrequired. This has increased the need for advanced human robot collaboration\n(HRC), and with it, improved methods for interaction, such as voice control.\nRecent advances in natural language processing, driven by artificial\nintelligence (AI), have the potential to answer this demand. Large language\nmodels (LLMs) have rapidly developed very impressive general reasoning\ncapabilities, and many methods of applying this to robotics have been proposed,\nincluding through the use of code generation. This paper presents Language\nModel Program Voice Control (LMPVC), an LLM-based prototype voice control\narchitecture with integrated policy programming and teaching capabilities,\nbuilt for use with Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) compatible robots.

While Reinforcement\nlearning (RL) can boost reasoning in LLMs, applying it to MLLMs is tricky.\nCommon issues include a drop in performance on general tasks and the generation\nof overly detailed or \"overthinking\" reasoning. Our work investigates how the\nKL penalty and overthinking affect RL training in MLLMs. We propose Asymmetric\nPolicy Optimization (APO) to address these issues, which divides the sampled\nresponses into positive and negative groups. For positive samples,\nDifficulty-Adaptive Divergence Shaping (DADS) is introduced to dynamically\nadjust the KL divergence weight based on their difficulty. This method prevents\npolicy entropy from dropping sharply, improves training stability, utilizes\nsamples better, and preserves the model's existing knowledge. For negative\nsamples, Suboptimal Trajectory Complexity Regularization (STCR) is proposed to\npenalize overly long responses. This helps mitigate overthinking and encourages\nmore concise reasoning while preserving the model's explorative capacity. We\napply our method to Qwen2.5-VL-3B, creating View-R1-3B.

Such\nmultidimensional settings are not merely of theoretical interest but are\ncentral to many real-world applications. For example, cloud computing resources\nare evaluated based on multiple criteria such as CPU cores, memory, and network\nbandwidth. In such cases, traditional one dimensional fairness notions fail to\ncapture fairness across multiple attributes. To address these challenges, we\nstudy two relaxed variants of envy-freeness: weak simultaneously envy-free up\nto c goods (weak sEFc) and strong simultaneously envy-free up to c goods\n(strong sEFc), which accommodate the multidimensionality of agents'\npreferences. Under the weak notion, for every pair of agents and for each\ndimension, any perceived envy can be eliminated by removing, if necessary, a\ndifferent set of goods from the envied agent's allocation. In contrast, the\nstrong version requires selecting a single set of goods whose removal from the\nenvied bundle simultaneously eliminates envy in every dimension.

These models often struggle to construct stable\nframe-to-frame attention, leading to increased latency and degraded synthesis\nquality, thereby limiting their feasibility for real-time applications. To\naddress these limitations, we introduce a novel dynamic chunk-wise\nautoregressive synthesis framework, termed DCAR, designed to enhance both\nefficiency and intelligibility robustness in AR speech generation. DCAR\nintroduces a chunk-to-frame attention mechanism through training with\nmulti-token prediction, enabling dynamic chunk prediction in variable speech\ncontexts using a lightweight module trained on-policy. DCAR dynamically adjusts\nthe token prediction span, significantly reducing the sequence length\ndependency while obtaining high synthesis quality. Comprehensive empirical\nevaluations demonstrate that DCAR substantially outperforms traditional\nnext-token prediction models, achieving up to 72.27% intelligibility\nimprovement and 2.61x inference speedup simultaneously on the test set.\nFurthermore, we conduct comprehensive analysis to support it as a versatile\nfoundation for next-generation speech synthesis systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u5757\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\uff08DCAR\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bed\u97f3\u5408\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bed\u97f3\u5408\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u8bed\u97f3\u5e8f\u5217\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5e27\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\u548c\u5408\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "method": "DCAR\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u5757\u5230\u5e27\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u4ee4\u724c\u9884\u6d4b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u4ee4\u724c\u9884\u6d4b\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDCAR\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8672.27%\u7684\u53ef\u61c2\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u548c2.61\u500d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "DCAR\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u8bed\u97f3\u5408\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

However, few works have paid attention to the error-bias with\nrespect to error distribution of facial landmarks. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the error-bias issue in face alignment, where the distributions of\nlandmark errors tend to spread along the tangent line to landmark curves. This\nerror-bias is not trivial since it is closely connected to the ambiguous\nlandmark labeling task. Inspired by this observation, we seek a way to leverage\nthe error-bias property for better convergence of CNN model. To this end, we\npropose anisotropic direction loss (ADL) and anisotropic attention module (AAM)\nfor coordinate and heatmap regression, respectively. ADL imposes strong binding\nforce in normal direction for each landmark point on facial boundaries. On the\nother hand, AAM is an attention module which can get anisotropic attention mask\nfocusing on the region of point and its local edge connected by adjacent\npoints, it has a stronger response in tangent than in normal, which means\nrelaxed constraints in the tangent. These two methods work in a complementary\nmanner to learn both facial structures and texture details. Finally, we\nintegrate them into an optimized end-to-end training pipeline named ADNet.

Ideally, a theorist abstracts protocols as ideal,\nimplementation-independent primitives, letting conclusions in the \"ideal world\"\ncarry over to the \"real world.\" This is crucial, since the game theorist\ncannot--and should not be expected to--handle full cryptographic complexity. In\ntoday's landscape, the rise of distributed ledgers makes a shared language\nbetween cryptography and game theory increasingly necessary.\n  The security of cryptographic protocols hinges on two types of assumptions:\nstate-of-the-world (e.g., \"factoring is hard\") and behavioral (e.g., \"honest\nmajority\"). We observe that for protocols relying on behavioral assumptions\n(e.g., ledgers), our goal is unattainable in full generality. For\nstate-of-the-world assumptions, we show that standard solution concepts, e.g.,\n($\\epsilon$-)Nash equilibria, are not robust to transfer from the ideal to the\nreal world.\n  We propose a new solution concept: the pseudo-Nash equilibrium. Informally, a\nprofile $s=(s_1,\\dots,s_n)$ is a pseudo-Nash equilibrium if, for any player $i$\nand deviation $s'_i$ with higher expected utility, $i$'s utility from $s_i$ is\n(computationally) indistinguishable from that of $s'_i$.

This paper presents\nWaLi, which reconstructs intelligible speech from the low-resolution and noisy\npressure sensor data by providing the following technical contributions: (i)\nWaLi reconstructs intelligible speech from a minimum of 0.5 kHz sampling\nfrequency of pressure sensors, whereas previous work can only detect hot\nwords/phrases.

Existing approaches primarily focus on optimizing\nnetwork architecture and diffusion paths but overlook the integration of the\ndiffusion training paradigm within general ordinary IR frameworks. To address\nthese challenges, this paper elucidates key principles for adapting the\ndiffusion training paradigm to general IR training through systematic analysis\nof time-step dependencies, network hierarchies, noise-level relationships, and\nmulti-restoration task correlations, proposing a new IR framework supported by\ndiffusion-based training. To enable IR networks to simultaneously restore\nimages and model generative representations, we introduce a series of\nregularization strategies that align diffusion objectives with IR tasks,\nimproving generalization in single-task scenarios. Furthermore, recognizing\nthat diffusion-based generation exerts varying influences across different IR\ntasks, we develop an incremental training paradigm and task-specific adaptors,\nfurther enhancing performance in multi-task unified IR. Experiments demonstrate\nthat our method significantly improves the generalization of IR networks in\nsingle-task IR and achieves superior performance in multi-task unified IR.\nNotably, the proposed framework can be seamlessly integrated into existing\ngeneral IR architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u6269\u6563\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u878d\u5165\u666e\u901a\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\uff08IR\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u4f9d\u8d56\u3001\u7f51\u7edc\u5c42\u6b21\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u589e\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1IR\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u590d\u6742\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0e\u666e\u901aIR\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6574\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u4f9d\u8d56\u3001\u7f51\u7edc\u5c42\u6b21\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684IR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u589e\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u9002\u914d\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5355\u4efb\u52a1IR\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u7edf\u4e00IR\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4ee5\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u666e\u901aIR\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u5728IR\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, the demand charge component in the\nmonthly electricity cost, make it difficult to be encapsulated in additive\nstage costs, and can make solutions violate the principle of optimality if\nnaively introduced in the objective function. Moreover, previous EMPC based\nworks mostly rely on a-priori knowledge of an optimal economic steady state or\noptimal periodic trajectory for performance guarantees, which are not useful or\npossibly don't exist respectively, for real-time economical MG dispatch where\nload/generation forecasts are known only 24-48 h in advance. This paper, first,\nproposes an EMPC formulation for a generic deterministic discrete non-linear\ntime varying system with hard state and input constraints, without any a-priori\nrequirements of an optimal economic steady state or optimal periodic\ntrajectory. It is proved that under mild assumptions on terminal cost and\nregion, the asymptotic average economic cost of the proposed method is no worse\nthan the asymptotic average economic cost of any other non-fixed arbitrary\nreference trajectory which is known only until the current time-step. The EMPC\nframework is then leveraged for optimal MG dispatch by showing that the problem\ncan be reformulated to satisfy the assumptions required for the asymptotic\nperformance guarantee. Realistic simulations at the Port of San Diego MG\ndemonstrated that the proposed method can also reduce monthly electricity costs\nin closed-loop with respect to reference trajectories generated by directly\noptimizing the electricity cost function over the prediction horizon or by\ntracking an ideal grid import curve in a majority of the cases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u5148\u77e5\u9053\u6700\u4f18\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7a33\u6001\u6216\u5468\u671f\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\uff08EMPC\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5fae\u7535\u7f51\u5b9e\u65f6\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u52a3\u4e8e\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u975e\u56fa\u5b9a\u53c2\u8003\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfEMPC\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u9884\u5148\u77e5\u9053\u6700\u4f18\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7a33\u6001\u6216\u5468\u671f\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u5fae\u7535\u7f51\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e2d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u6216\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u524d\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u79bb\u6563\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u53d8\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684EMPC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u5148\u5047\u8bbe\u6700\u4f18\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7a33\u6001\u6216\u5468\u671f\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec8\u7aef\u6210\u672c\u548c\u533a\u57df\u5047\u8bbe\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u5047\u8bbe\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u5e73\u5747\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6210\u672c\u4e0d\u52a3\u4e8e\u4efb\u4f55\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u975e\u56fa\u5b9a\u53c2\u8003\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002\u5fae\u7535\u7f51\u8c03\u5ea6\u4eff\u771f\u663e\u793a\u5176\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u6708\u5ea6\u7535\u8d39\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5fae\u7535\u7f51\u5b9e\u65f6\u8c03\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u5148\u6700\u4f18\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684EMPC\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We propose a multi-task parallelism method\nthat distributes each head across computing resources with GPU acceleration.\nImplemented in the open-source HydraGNN architecture, our method was trained on\nover 24 million structures from five datasets and tested on the Perlmutter,\nAurora, and Frontier supercomputers, demonstrating efficient scaling on all\nthree highly heterogeneous super-computing architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5e76\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6e90\u3001\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8d85\u7ea7\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6e90\u3001\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u539f\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u6570\u636e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5171\u4eab\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u5c42\u5904\u7406\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4e2a\u89e3\u7801\u5934\u9884\u6d4b\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528GPU\u52a0\u901f\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5e76\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u57282400\u4e07\u4e2a\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u5f02\u6784\u8d85\u7ea7\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u8d85\u7ea7\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

Traditional solutions often seek to erase\nthese asymmetries, but recent research suggests embracing them as productive\ndesign constraints. In this context, we introduce NoticeLight: a tangible,\nperipheral robotic embodiment designed to augment hybrid meetings. NoticeLight\ntransforms remote participants' digital presence into ambient, physical signals\n-- such as mood dynamics, verbal contribution mosaics, and attention cues --\nwithin the co-located space.

The growing interest in this challenge\nhighlights the need for comprehensive datasets that capture unstructured\nenvironments, enabling the development of more robust prediction models to\nenhance pedestrian safety and vehicle navigation. In this paper, we introduce\nan Indian driving pedestrian dataset designed to address the complexities of\nmodeling pedestrian behavior in unstructured environments, such as illumination\nchanges, occlusion of pedestrians, unsignalized scene types and\nvehicle-pedestrian interactions. The dataset provides high-level and detailed\nlow-level comprehensive annotations focused on pedestrians requiring the\nego-vehicle's attention. Evaluation of the state-of-the-art intention\nprediction methods on our dataset shows a significant performance drop of up to\n$\\mathbf{15\\%}$, while trajectory prediction methods underperform with an\nincrease of up to $\\mathbf{1208}$ MSE, defeating standard pedestrian datasets.\nAdditionally, we present exhaustive quantitative and qualitative analysis of\nintention and trajectory baselines.

Traditionally, efforts have\nfocused on converting brain activity into 2D images, neglecting the translation\nof EEG data into 3D objects. This limitation is noteworthy, as the human brain\ninherently processes three-dimensional spatial information regardless of\nwhether observing 2D images or the real world. The neural activities captured\nby EEG contain rich spatial information that is inevitably lost when\nreconstructing only 2D images, thus limiting its practical applications in BCI.\nThe transition from EEG data to 3D object reconstruction faces considerable\nobstacles. These include the presence of extensive noise within EEG signals and\na scarcity of datasets that include both EEG and 3D information, which\ncomplicates the extraction process of 3D visual data.

To improve the automation of these bidding\nsystems, we adopt generative models, namely the Decision Transformer (DT), to\ntackle the difficulties inherent in automated bidding. Applying the Decision\nTransformer to the auto-bidding task enables a unified approach to sequential\nmodeling, which efficiently overcomes short-sightedness by capturing long-term\ndependencies between past bidding actions and user behavior.

To address these challenges,\nwe introduce the R* Decision Transformer (R* DT), developed in a three-step\nprocess: (1) R DT: Similar to traditional DT, R DT stores actions based on\nstate and RTG value, as well as memorizing the RTG for a given state using the\ntraining set; (2) R^ DT: We forecast the highest value (within the training\nset) of RTG for a given state, deriving a suboptimal policy based on the\ncurrent state and the forecasted supreme RTG value; (3) R* DT: Based on R^ DT,\nwe generate trajectories and select those with high rewards (using a simulator)\nto augment our training dataset. This data enhancement has been shown to\nimprove the RTG of trajectories in the training data and gradually leads the\nsuboptimal policy towards optimality.

However, their\napplication to remote sensing (RS) remains underexplored due to significant\ndomain differences in visual appearances, object scales, and semantics. These\ndiscrepancies hider the effective understanding of RS scenes, which contain\nrich, multi-level semantic information spanning from coarse-to-fine levels.\nHence, it limits the direct adaptation of existing LVLMs to RS imagery. To\naddress this gap, we propose a novel LVLM framework tailored for RS\nunderstanding, incorporating two core components: Semantic-augmented\nMulti-level Alignment and Semantic-aware Expert Modeling. First, to align\nmulti-level visual features, we introduce the retrieval-based Semantic\nAugmentation Module which enriches the visual features with relevant semantics\nacross fine-to-coarse levels (e.g., object- and scene-level information).

In this paper,\nour empirical experiments show that synthetic-to-real domain shift\nsignificantly degrades the alignment of point cloud with their associated text\nembeddings in the 3D VLM latent space, hindering downstream performance.

We validate both models experimentally and find\nthat they demonstrate strong performance across a variety of problems,\nincluding the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing\nProblem (CVRP).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u591a\u56fe\u8def\u7531\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u591a\u56fe\uff08multigraph\uff09\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8def\u7531\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u7b2c\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u591a\u56fe\u4e0a\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u9009\u62e9\u8fb9\u5b8c\u6210\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5148\u5c06\u591a\u56fe\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u7b80\u5355\u56fe\uff0c\u518d\u6784\u5efa\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5982TSP\u548cCVRP\uff09\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u591a\u56fe\u8def\u7531\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Traditional TD methods rely on predefined structural\nassumptions, such as CP or Tucker decompositions. From a probabilistic\nperspective, these can be viewed as using Dirac delta distributions to model\nthe relationships between shared factors and the low-rank tensor. However, such\nprior knowledge is rarely available in practical scenarios, particularly\nregarding the optimal rank structure and contraction rules. The optimization\nprocedures based on fixed contraction rules are complex, and approximations\nmade during these processes often lead to accuracy loss. To address this issue,\nwe propose a score-based model that eliminates the need for predefined\nstructural or distributional assumptions, enabling the learning of\ncompatibility between tensors and shared factors. Specifically, a neural\nnetwork is designed to learn the energy function, which is optimized via score\nmatching to capture the gradient of the joint log-probability of tensor entries\nand shared factors.

However, conventional federated learning\n(FL) algorithms typically consider unimodal datasets, require identical model\narchitectures, and fail to leverage the rich information embedded in multimodal\ndata, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios with diverse\nmodalities and varying client capabilities. To address this issue, we propose\nSheaf-DMFL, a novel decentralized multimodal learning framework leveraging\nsheaf theory to enhance collaboration among devices with diverse modalities.\nSpecifically, each client has a set of local feature encoders for its different\nmodalities, whose outputs are concatenated before passing through a\ntask-specific layer. While encoders for the same modality are trained\ncollaboratively across clients, we capture the intrinsic correlations among\nclients' task-specific layers using a sheaf-based structure.

Yet, ADNet faces three key\nlimitations: dependence on a single prototype per class, a focus on binary\nclassification, and fixed thresholds that fail to adapt to patient and organ\nvariability. To address these shortcomings, we propose the Tied Prototype Model\n(TPM), a principled reformulation of ADNet with tied prototype locations for\nforeground and background distributions. Building on its probabilistic\nfoundation, TPM naturally extends to multiple prototypes and multi-class\nsegmentation while effectively separating non-typical background features.\nNotably, both extensions lead to improved segmentation accuracy. Finally, we\nleverage naturally occurring class priors to define an ideal target for\nadaptive thresholds, boosting segmentation performance. Taken together, TPM\nprovides a fresh perspective on prototype-based FSS for medical image\nsegmentation.

This strategy enables the model to\nadaptively adjust low-light images to align with the illumination distribution\nof a user-provided reference image, ensuring personalized enhancement results.\nExtensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that ReF-LLE\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior perceptual quality and\nadaptability in personalized low-light image enhancement.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReF-LLE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u9891\u57df\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4f4e\u5149\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96f6\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fed\u4ee3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u589e\u5f3a\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f4e\u5149\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u4e2d\u56e0\u6761\u4ef6\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u4e3b\u89c2\u504f\u597d\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u9891\u57df\u4e2d\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u96f6\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fed\u4ee3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ReF-LLE\u4e3a\u4f4e\u5149\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While these\nperturbations are typically seen as detrimental to quantum computation, they\ncan actually enhance performance by serving as a natural source of data\naugmentation. Additionally, they can often be efficiently simulated on\nclassical hardware, enabling quantum-inspired approaches to improve classical\nmachine learning methods. In this paper, we investigate random Bloch sphere\nrotations, which are fundamental SU(2) transformations, as a simple yet\neffective quantum-inspired data augmentation technique. Unlike conventional\naugmentations such as flipping, rotating, or cropping, quantum transformations\nlack intuitive spatial interpretations, making their application to tasks like\nimage classification less straightforward. While common quantum augmentation\nmethods rely on applying quantum models or trainable quanvolutional layers to\nclassical datasets, we focus on the direct application of small-angle Bloch\nrotations and their effect on classical data. Using the large-scale ImageNet\ndataset, we demonstrate that our quantum-inspired augmentation method improves\nimage classification performance, increasing Top-1 accuracy by 3%, Top-5\naccuracy by 2.5%, and the F$_1$ score from 8% to 12% compared to standard\nclassical augmentation methods. Finally, we examine the use of stronger unitary\naugmentations. Although these transformations preserve information in\nprinciple, they result in visually unrecognizable images with potential\napplications for privacy computations.

In real-world applications, however, users\noften seek tools to faithfully realize their creative editing intentions with\nprecise and consistent control. Despite the progress achieved by existing\nmethods, ensuring fine-grained alignment with user intentions remains an open\nand challenging problem. In this work, we present Shape-for-Motion, a novel\nframework that incorporates a 3D proxy for precise and consistent video\nediting. Shape-for-Motion achieves this by converting the target object in the\ninput video to a time-consistent mesh, i.e., a 3D proxy, allowing edits to be\nperformed directly on the proxy and then inferred back to the video frames. To\nsimplify the editing process, we design a novel Dual-Propagation Strategy that\nallows users to perform edits on the 3D mesh of a single frame, and the edits\nare then automatically propagated to the 3D meshes of the other frames. The 3D\nmeshes for different frames are further projected onto the 2D space to produce\nthe edited geometry and texture renderings, which serve as inputs to a\ndecoupled video diffusion model for generating edited results. Our framework\nsupports various precise and physically-consistent manipulations across the\nvideo frames, including pose editing, rotation, scaling, translation, texture\nmodification, and object composition.
