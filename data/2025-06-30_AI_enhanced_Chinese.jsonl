Despite current advancements in reinforcement fine-tuning\n(RFT) showing strong performance in enhancing reasoning in LLMs, its potential\nto enable self-evolving embodied intelligence with multi-modal interactions\nremains largely unexplored. Specifically, reinforcement fine-tuning faces two\nfundamental obstacles in embodied settings: (i) the lack of accessible\nintermediate rewards in multi-step reasoning tasks limits effective learning\nsignals, and (ii) reliance on hand-crafted reward functions restricts\ngeneralization to novel tasks and environments. To address these challenges, we\npresent Self-Evolving Embodied Agents-R1, SEEA-R1, the first RFT framework\ndesigned for enabling the self-evolving capabilities of embodied agents.\nSpecifically, to convert sparse delayed rewards into denser intermediate\nsignals that improve multi-step reasoning, we propose Tree-based group relative\npolicy optimization (Tree-GRPO), which integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search into\nGRPO. To generalize reward estimation across tasks and scenes, supporting\nautonomous adaptation and reward-driven self-evolution, we further introduce\nMulti-modal Generative Reward Model (MGRM).

We further\nintroduce a novel multimodal RAG framework that retrieves detailed\nconcept-level knowledge in response to queries from arbitrary modalities.\nExperiments on question answering tasks across various modalities demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of VAT-KG in supporting MLLMs, highlighting its practical\nvalue in unifying and leveraging multimodal knowledge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86VAT-KG\uff0c\u9996\u4e2a\u6db5\u76d6\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u97f3\u9891\u548c\u6587\u672c\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u6b65\u9aa4\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001RAG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MMKGs\u77e5\u8bc6\u8986\u76d6\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u6a21\u6001\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u3001\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVAT-KG\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u4e25\u683c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6b65\u9aa4\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u591a\u6a21\u6001RAG\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u610f\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eVAT-KG\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301MLLMs\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "VAT-KG\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709MMKGs\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Although visual\ncropping techniques seem promising, recent approaches have several limitations:\nthe need for task-specific fine-tuning, low efficiency due to uninformed\nexhaustive search, or incompatibility with efficient attention implementations.\nWe address these shortcomings by proposing a training-free visual cropping\nmethod, dubbed FOCUS, that leverages MLLM-internal representations to guide the\nsearch for the most relevant image region. This is accomplished in four steps:\nfirst, we identify the target object(s) in the VQA prompt; second, we compute\nan object relevance map using the key-value (KV) cache; third, we propose and\nrank relevant image regions based on the map; and finally, we perform the\nfine-grained VQA task using the top-ranked region. As a result of this informed\nsearch strategy, FOCUS achieves strong performance across four fine-grained VQA\ndatasets and two types of MLLMs. It outperforms three popular visual cropping\nmethods in both accuracy and efficiency, and matches the best-performing\nbaseline, ZoomEye, while requiring 3 - 6.5 x less compute.", "AI": {"tldr": "FOCUS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u88c1\u526a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528MLLM\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u6307\u5bfc\u641c\u7d22\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u56fe\u50cf\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6VQA\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\uff08VQA\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u88c1\u526a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff08\u5982\u9700\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u4f4e\u6548\u641c\u7d22\u6216\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u6b65\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1a\u8bc6\u522b\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u8c61\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bf9\u8c61\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u56fe\u3001\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u6392\u5e8f\u76f8\u5173\u56fe\u50cf\u533a\u57df\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u6392\u540d\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u533a\u57df\u6267\u884cVQA\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "FOCUS\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6VQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e24\u79cdMLLM\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e09\u79cd\u6d41\u884c\u89c6\u89c9\u88c1\u526a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u51cf\u5c113-6.5\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "FOCUS\u4e3a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6VQA\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u88c1\u526a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

CNNs are effective at capturing spatial\nartifacts, and Transformers excel at modeling temporal inconsistencies.\nHowever, many existing CNN-Transformer models process spatial and temporal\nfeatures independently. In particular, attention-based methods often use\nseparate attention mechanisms for spatial and temporal features and combine\nthem using naive approaches like averaging, addition, or concatenation, which\nlimits the depth of spatio-temporal interaction. To address this challenge, we\npropose a unified CAST model that leverages cross-attention to effectively fuse\nspatial and temporal features in a more integrated manner. Our approach allows\ntemporal features to dynamically attend to relevant spatial regions, enhancing\nthe model's ability to detect fine-grained, time-evolving artifacts such as\nflickering eyes or warped lips. This design enables more precise localization\nand deeper contextual understanding, leading to improved performance across\ndiverse and challenging scenarios. We evaluate the performance of our model\nusing the FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF, and DeepfakeDetection datasets in both\nintra- and cross-dataset settings to affirm the superiority of our approach.\nOur model achieves strong performance with an AUC of 99.49 percent and an\naccuracy of 97.57 percent in intra-dataset evaluations.

However, few works have paid attention to the error-bias with\nrespect to error distribution of facial landmarks.

This\nerror-bias is not trivial since it is closely connected to the ambiguous\nlandmark labeling task. Inspired by this observation, we seek a way to leverage\nthe error-bias property for better convergence of CNN model. To this end, we\npropose anisotropic direction loss (ADL) and anisotropic attention module (AAM)\nfor coordinate and heatmap regression, respectively. ADL imposes strong binding\nforce in normal direction for each landmark point on facial boundaries. On the\nother hand, AAM is an attention module which can get anisotropic attention mask\nfocusing on the region of point and its local edge connected by adjacent\npoints, it has a stronger response in tangent than in normal, which means\nrelaxed constraints in the tangent.

However, the\ndata ecosystems of these three key areas are increasingly fragmented and\nincompatible. Especially, existing testing methods rely on data stacking, fail\nto cover all edge cases, and lack flexibility. To address this issue, this\npaper introduces the concept of \"Query as Test\" (QaT). This concept shifts the\nfocus from rigid, prescripted test cases to flexible, on-demand logical queries\nagainst a unified data representation. Specifically, we identify the need for a\nfundamental improvement in data storage and representation, leading to our\nproposal of \"Extensible Scenarios Notations\" (ESN). ESN is a novel declarative\ndata framework based on Answer Set Programming (ASP), which uniformly\nrepresents heterogeneous multimodal data from the cockpit, vehicle, and road as\na collection of logical facts and rules. This approach not only achieves deep\nsemantic fusion of data, but also brings three core advantages: (1) supports\ncomplex and flexible semantic querying through logical reasoning; (2) provides\nnatural interpretability for decision-making processes; (3) allows for\non-demand data abstraction through logical rules, enabling fine-grained privacy\nprotection. We further elaborate on the QaT paradigm, transforming the\nfunctional validation and safety compliance checks of autonomous driving\nsystems into logical queries against the ESN database, significantly enhancing\nthe expressiveness and formal rigor of the testing. Finally, we introduce the\nconcept of \"Validation-Driven Development\" (VDD), which suggests to guide\ndevelopments by logical validation rather than quantitative testing in the era\nof Large Language Models, in order to accelerating the iteration and\ndevelopment process.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u201cQuery as Test\u201d\uff08QaT\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u903b\u8f91\u67e5\u8be2\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u793a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u788e\u7247\u5316\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u5728\u4ea4\u901a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u5ea7\u8231\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u8def\u7f51\u7684\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6001\u65e5\u76ca\u788e\u7247\u5316\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u636e\u5806\u53e0\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8986\u76d6\u6240\u6709\u8fb9\u7f18\u60c5\u51b5\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u201cExtensible Scenarios Notations\u201d\uff08ESN\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b54\u6848\u96c6\u7f16\u7a0b\uff08ASP\uff09\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u793a\u5f02\u6784\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u903b\u8f91\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "ESN\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u590d\u6742\u8bed\u4e49\u67e5\u8be2\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6309\u9700\u62bd\u8c61\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u3002", "conclusion": "QaT\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u201cValidation-Driven Development\u201d\uff08VDD\uff09\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4ee5\u903b\u8f91\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6307\u5bfc\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u8fed\u4ee3\u3002"}}

However, current benchmarks overwhelmingly\nfocus on questions answerable through explicit visual content - actions,\nobjects & events directly observable within individual frames or short clips.\nIn contrast, creative and cinematic videos - such as movies, TV shows, and\nnarrative-driven content - employ storytelling techniques that deliberately\nomit certain depictions, requiring viewers to infer motives, causality, and\nrelationships across discontinuous frames. Humans naturally excel at such\nimplicit reasoning, seamlessly integrating information across time and context\nto construct coherent narratives. Current VideoQA systems and benchmarks fail\nto capture this essential dimension of human-like understanding. To bridge this\ngap, we present ImplicitQA, a novel benchmark specifically designed to test\nmodels on implicit reasoning. It comprises 1K meticulously annotated QA pairs\nderived from 320+ high-quality creative video clips, systematically categorized\ninto key reasoning dimensions: lateral and vertical spatial reasoning, depth\nand proximity, viewpoint and visibility, motion and trajectory, causal and\nmotivational reasoning, social interactions, physical context, and inferred\ncounting. These annotations are deliberately challenging, crafted by authors\nensuring high-quality. Our extensive evaluations on leading VideoQA models\nreveals performance degradation, underscoring their reliance on surface-level\nvisual cues and highlighting the difficulty of implicit reasoning.

Inspired by the observation\nthat certain CoT patterns -- e.g., ``Wait, did I miss anything?'' --\nconsistently emerge across tasks, we explore whether LRMs exhibit human-like\ncognitive habits. Building on Habits of Mind, a well-established framework of\ncognitive habits associated with successful human problem-solving, we introduce\nCogTest, a principled benchmark designed to evaluate LRMs' cognitive habits.\nCogTest includes 16 cognitive habits, each instantiated with 25 diverse tasks,\nand employs an evidence-first extraction method to ensure reliable habit\nidentification. With CogTest, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 16\nwidely used LLMs (13 LRMs and 3 non-reasoning ones). Our findings reveal that\nLRMs, unlike conventional LLMs, not only exhibit human-like habits but also\nadaptively deploy them according to different tasks. Finer-grained analyses\nfurther uncover patterns of similarity and difference in LRMs' cognitive habit\nprofiles, particularly certain inter-family similarity (e.g., Qwen-3 models and\nDeepSeek-R1).

Recent research\nhas been dedicated to data efficiency, which aims to maximize performance by\nselecting a minimal or optimal subset of training data.

To\ncomplement it, we define Data Efficacy, which focuses on maximizing performance\nby optimizing the organization of training data and remains relatively\nunderexplored. This work introduces a general paradigm, DELT, for considering\ndata efficacy in LM training, which highlights the significance of training\ndata organization. DELT comprises three components: Data Scoring, Data\nSelection, and Data Ordering. Among these components, we design\nLearnability-Quality Scoring (LQS), as a new instance of Data Scoring, which\nconsiders both the learnability and quality of each data sample from the\ngradient consistency perspective.

Secondly, among these\ninstances, the combination of our proposed LQS for data scoring and Folding for\ndata ordering achieves the most significant improvement.

Unlike prior work that treats relational and graph\nformalisms in isolation, STRuCT-LLM leverages shared abstractions between SQL\nand Cypher to induce cross-formalism transfer, enabling SQL training to improve\nCypher performance and vice versa - even without shared schemas. Our largest\nmodel (QwQ-32B) achieves substantial relative improvements across tasks: on\nsemantic parsing, Spider improves by 13.5\\% and Text2Cypher by 73.1\\%. The\nmodel also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, improving performance\non downstream tabular QA (TableBench: 8.5\\%) and knowledge graph QA\n(CR-LT-KGQA: 1.7\\%) without any QA-specific supervision. These results\ndemonstrate both the effectiveness of executable queries as scaffolds for\nstructured reasoning and the synergistic benefits of jointly training on SQL\nand Cypher (code available at https://github.com/bouv/STRuCT-LLM).", "AI": {"tldr": "STRuCT-LLM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u76d1\u7763\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316Text-to-SQL\u548cText-to-Cypher\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u5f62\u5f0f\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u6790\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u95ee\u7b54\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b64\u7acb\u5904\u7406\u5173\u7cfb\u578b\u548c\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u6570\u636e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528SQL\u548cCypher\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u62bd\u8c61\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u5f62\u5f0f\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7f16\u8f91\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u611f\u77e5\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316Text-to-SQL\u548cText-to-Cypher\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "QwQ-32B\u6a21\u578b\u5728Spider\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u63d0\u534713.5%\uff0cText2Cypher\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u63d0\u534773.1%\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "STRuCT-LLM\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u67e5\u8be2\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u652f\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3SQL\u548cCypher\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

To\naddress this gap, we propose a novel LVLM framework tailored for RS\nunderstanding, incorporating two core components: Semantic-augmented\nMulti-level Alignment and Semantic-aware Expert Modeling. First, to align\nmulti-level visual features, we introduce the retrieval-based Semantic\nAugmentation Module which enriches the visual features with relevant semantics\nacross fine-to-coarse levels (e.g., object- and scene-level information). It is\ndesigned to retrieve relevant semantic cues from a RS semantic knowledge\ndatabase, followed by aggregation of semantic cues with user query and\nmulti-level visual features, resulting in semantically enriched representation\nacross multiple levels. Second, for Semantic-aware Expert Modeling, we design\nsemantic experts, where each expert is responsible for processing semantic\nrepresentation at different levels separately. This enables hierarchical\nsemantic understanding from coarse to fine levels. Evaluations across multiple\nRS tasks-including scene classification and VQA, etc.-demonstrate that the\nproposed framework achieves consistent improvements across multiple semantic\nlevels. This highlights its capability and effectiveness in bridging the gap\nbetween general LVLMs and unique demands of RS-specific vision-language\nunderstanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u9065\u611f\uff08RS\uff09\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LVLM\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u591a\u7ea7\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u4e13\u5bb6\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709LVLM\u5728RS\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LVLM\uff09\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9065\u611f\uff08RS\uff09\u9886\u57df\u7531\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u5916\u89c2\u3001\u5bf9\u8c61\u5c3a\u5ea6\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u7ea7\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b2\uff09\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u4e13\u5bb6\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aRS\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u573a\u666f\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8de8\u591a\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u901a\u7528LVLM\u4e0eRS\u7279\u5b9a\u9700\u6c42\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728RS\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

This progress has driven the\ndevelopment of token pruning methods to mitigate the high computational costs\nassociated with processing numerous visual tokens. However, we observe that\npruning significantly weakens the model's grounding ability, leading to\nincorrect predictions and drastic performance degradation.

In this paper,\nour empirical experiments show that synthetic-to-real domain shift\nsignificantly degrades the alignment of point cloud with their associated text\nembeddings in the 3D VLM latent space, hindering downstream performance. To\naddress this, we propose a novel methodology called SODA which improves the\ndetection of OOD point clouds through a neighborhood-based score propagation\nscheme.

This work represents a pilot exploration for\nbridging this gap. We conceptualize each motion as comprising both attribute\ninformation and action semantics, where textual descriptions align exclusively\nwith action semantics.

Currently, massive fine-resolution remotely sensed\n(FRRS) images acquired by improving sensing and imaging technologies become\navailable. However, accurate semantic segmentation of such FRRS images is\ngreatly affected by substantial class disparities, the invisibility of key\nground objects due to occlusion, and object size variation. Despite the\nextraordinary potential in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) in image\nfeature learning and representation, extracting sufficient features from FRRS\nimages for accurate semantic segmentation is still challenging. These\nchallenges demand the deep learning models to learn robust features and\ngenerate sufficient feature descriptors.

Beyond adaptation-based\nmethods, distillation-based approaches transfer vision-language alignment of\nvision-language model, e.g., CLIP, to segmentation models. However, such\nknowledge transfer remains challenging due to: (1) the difficulty of aligning\nvision-based features with the textual space, which requires combining spatial\nprecision with vision-language alignment; and (2) the semantic gap between\nCLIP's global representations and the local, fine-grained features of\nsegmentation models.

First, to overcome the\nlimited number of heartbeat cycles in ultra-short video clips, we propose an\neffective periodicity-guided rPPG estimation method that enforces consistent\nperiodicity between rPPG signals estimated from ultra-short clips and their\nmuch longer ground truth signals. Next, to mitigate estimation inaccuracies due\nto spectral leakage, we propose including a generator to reconstruct longer\nrPPG signals from ultra-short ones while preserving their periodic consistency\nto enable more accurate HR measurement.

Although autoregressive systems\nexhibit certain advantages in speech naturalness, their token-by-token\ngeneration mechanism makes it difficult to precisely control the duration of\nsynthesized speech. This is a key limitation in applications such as video\ndubbing that require strict audio-visual synchronization. This paper introduces\nIndexTTS2, which proposes a novel and autoregressive-model-friendly method for\nspeech duration control. The method supports two generation modes: one allows\nexplicit specification of the number of generated tokens for precise duration\ncontrol; the other does not require manual input and lets the model freely\ngenerate speech while preserving prosodic characteristics from the input\nprompt. Furthermore, IndexTTS2 achieves disentanglement between emotional\nexpression and speaker identity, enabling independent control of timbre and\nemotion. In the zero-shot setting, the model can perfectly reproduce the\nemotional characteristics of the input prompt. Users may also provide a\nseparate emotion prompt, even from a different speaker, allowing the model to\nreconstruct the target timbre while conveying the desired emotion. To enhance\nclarity during strong emotional expressions, we incorporate GPT latent\nrepresentations to improve speech stability. Meanwhile, to lower the barrier\nfor emotion control, we design a soft instruction mechanism based on textual\ndescriptions by fine-tuning Qwen3.

A popular DL approach is self-supervised\nlearning (SSL), where models learn from vast amounts of unlabeled data,\navoiding costly annotation. SSL has allowed the development of foundation\nmodels (FMs), large models that can be used for a variety of downstream tasks.\nHowever, existing FMs for OCT, trained solely on image data, lack a\ncomprehensive and robust semantic understanding of images, as evidenced by\ntheir downstream performance (especially for complex tasks), and thus require\nsupervised fine-tuning (which may be unfeasible) to better adapt to specific\napplications and populations. To address this, we propose RetFiner, an SSL\nvision-language refinement scheme that improves the representations of existing\nFMs and enables their efficient and direct adaptation to specific populations\nfor improved downstream performance.

The framework is designed\nto systematically assess the role of explicit structural modeling in enhancing\nlanguage model (LM) representations and to investigate the potential of MLPs as\nefficient and scalable alternatives to GNNs.

This paradigm inherently establishes class-specific objectness criteria\nand suffers from unrepresentative novel class samples. To resolve this\nlimitation, we propose a Uniform Orthogonal Feature Space (UOFS) optimization\nframework.

This decoupling enables transferring class-agnostic objectness\nknowledge from base classes to novel classes. Moreover, implementing the\ndisentanglement requires careful attention to two challenges: (1) Base set\nimages contain unlabeled foreground instances, causing confusion between\npotential novel class instances and backgrounds. (2) Angular optimization\ndepends exclusively on base class foreground instances, inducing overfitting of\nangular distributions to base classes. To address these challenges, we propose\na Hybrid Background Optimization (HBO) strategy: (1) Constructing a pure\nbackground base set by removing unlabeled instances in original images to\nprovide unbiased magnitude-based objectness supervision. (2) Incorporating\nunlabeled foreground instances in the original base set into angular\noptimization to enhance distribution uniformity.

To further investigate structural changes, we include\npart of speech tagging in our analysis to quantify linguistic shifts over\ngrammatical categories and differentiate between word forms, like \"potential\"\nas a noun vs. as an adjective. We systematically analyze synonym groups for\nwidely discussed 'spiking words' based on frequency trends in scientific\nabstracts from PubMed. We find that entire semantic clusters often shift\ntogether, with most or all words in a group increasing in usage. This pattern\nsuggests that changes induced by Large Language Models are primarily semantic\nand pragmatic rather than purely lexical. Notably, the adjective \"important\"\nshows a significant decline, which prompted us to systematically analyze\ndecreasing lexical items. Our analysis of \"collapsing\" words reveals a more\ncomplex picture, which is consistent with organic language change and contrasts\nwith the patterns of the abrupt spikes.

In this paper, we investigate random Bloch sphere\nrotations, which are fundamental SU(2) transformations, as a simple yet\neffective quantum-inspired data augmentation technique. Unlike conventional\naugmentations such as flipping, rotating, or cropping, quantum transformations\nlack intuitive spatial interpretations, making their application to tasks like\nimage classification less straightforward. While common quantum augmentation\nmethods rely on applying quantum models or trainable quanvolutional layers to\nclassical datasets, we focus on the direct application of small-angle Bloch\nrotations and their effect on classical data. Using the large-scale ImageNet\ndataset, we demonstrate that our quantum-inspired augmentation method improves\nimage classification performance, increasing Top-1 accuracy by 3%, Top-5\naccuracy by 2.5%, and the F$_1$ score from 8% to 12% compared to standard\nclassical augmentation methods.

To address the complementary limitations of these methods, we\npropose two hybrid approaches that integrate token- and prompt-level techniques\nto enhance jailbreak effectiveness across diverse PTLMs. GCG + PAIR and the\nnewly explored GCG + WordGame hybrids were evaluated across multiple Vicuna and\nLlama models.

In real-world applications, however, users\noften seek tools to faithfully realize their creative editing intentions with\nprecise and consistent control. Despite the progress achieved by existing\nmethods, ensuring fine-grained alignment with user intentions remains an open\nand challenging problem. In this work, we present Shape-for-Motion, a novel\nframework that incorporates a 3D proxy for precise and consistent video\nediting. Shape-for-Motion achieves this by converting the target object in the\ninput video to a time-consistent mesh, i.e., a 3D proxy, allowing edits to be\nperformed directly on the proxy and then inferred back to the video frames. To\nsimplify the editing process, we design a novel Dual-Propagation Strategy that\nallows users to perform edits on the 3D mesh of a single frame, and the edits\nare then automatically propagated to the 3D meshes of the other frames. The 3D\nmeshes for different frames are further projected onto the 2D space to produce\nthe edited geometry and texture renderings, which serve as inputs to a\ndecoupled video diffusion model for generating edited results. Our framework\nsupports various precise and physically-consistent manipulations across the\nvideo frames, including pose editing, rotation, scaling, translation, texture\nmodification, and object composition. Our approach marks a key step toward\nhigh-quality, controllable video editing workflows. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our approach.

A straightforward solution is to adapt rule-based\nreinforcement learning for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, such methods\ntypically rely on manually curated question-answer pairs, which can be\nparticularly challenging when dealing with fine grained visual details and\ncomplex logic across images. Inspired by self-supervised visual representation\nlearning, we observe that images contain inherent constraints that can serve as\nsupervision. Based on this insight, we construct image triplets comprising two\naugmented views of the same image and a third, similar but distinct image.\nDuring training, the model is prompted to generate a reasoning process to\ncompare these images (i.e., determine same or different). Then we optimize the\nmodel with rule-based reinforcement learning.
