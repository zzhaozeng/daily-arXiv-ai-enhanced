In this challenging setting, traditional\nimage stitching pipelines fail, producing outputs with ghosting and other\nartifacts. While recent generative models are capable of outpainting content\nconsistent with multiple reference images, they fail when tasked with\nsynthesizing large, coherent regions of a panorama. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a method that fine-tunes a diffusion-based inpainting\nmodel to preserve a scene's content and layout based on multiple reference\nimages. Once fine-tuned, the model outpaints a full panorama from a single\nreference image, producing a seamless and visually coherent result that\nfaithfully integrates content from all reference images.

Existing\nmethods often rely on additional models or annotations to learn robust,\nclothing-invariant features, making them resource-intensive. In contrast, we\nexplore the use of color - specifically foreground and background colors - as a\nlightweight, annotation-free proxy for mitigating appearance bias in ReID\nmodels. We propose Colors See, Colors Ignore (CSCI), an RGB-only method that\nleverages color information directly from raw images or video frames. CSCI\nefficiently captures color-related appearance bias ('Color See') while\ndisentangling it from identity-relevant ReID features ('Color Ignore'). To\nachieve this, we introduce S2A self-attention, a novel self-attention to\nprevent information leak between color and identity cues within the feature\nspace. Our analysis shows a strong correspondence between learned color\nembeddings and clothing attributes, validating color as an effective proxy when\nexplicit clothing labels are unavailable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nCSCI on both image and video ReID with extensive experiments on four CC-ReID\ndatasets. We improve the baseline by Top-1 2.9% on LTCC and 5.0% on PRCC for\nimage-based ReID, and 1.0% on CCVID and 2.5% on MeVID for video-based ReID\nwithout relying on additional supervision.

Most of these methods focus on imitating specific expert\nbehaviors or promoting chosen reasoning thoughts and actions over rejected\nones. However, without reasoning and comparing over alternatives actions, LLM\nagents finetuned with these methods may over-commit towards seemingly plausible\nbut suboptimal actions due to limited action space exploration. To address\nthis, in this paper we propose Self-taught ActioN Deliberation (SAND)\nframework, enabling LLM agents to explicitly deliberate over candidate actions\nbefore committing to one.

Diagnostic benchmark for spatial reasoning in\n  LLMs. Project page: https://OldDelorean.github.io/PlanQA/", "summary": "We introduce PlanQA, a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating geometric and\nspatial reasoning in large-language models (LLMs). PlanQA is grounded in\nstructured representations of indoor scenes, such as kitchens, living rooms,\nand bedrooms, encoded in a symbolic format (e.g., JSON, XML layouts). The\nbenchmark includes diverse question types that test not only metric and\ntopological reasoning (e.g., distance, visibility, shortest paths) but also\ninterior design constraints such as affordance, clearance, balance, and\nusability.

Over the next 200\nyears, they spread across Europe and luthiers of various royal courts, eager to\nexperiment with new techniques, created a highly diverse family of instruments.\nAround 1750, size standards were introduced to unify violin making for\norchestras and conservatories. Instruments that fell between two standards were\nthen reduced to a smaller size by luthiers. These reductions have an impact on\nseveral characteristics of violins, in particular on the contour lines, i.e.\nlines of constant altitude, which look more like a U for non reduced\ninstruments and a V for reduced ones. While such differences are observed by\nexperts, they have not been studied quantitatively.\n  This paper presents a method for classifying violins as reduced or\nnon-reduced based on their contour lines. We study a corpus of 25 instruments\nwhose 3D geometric meshes were acquired via photogrammetry. For each\ninstrument, we extract 10-20 contour lines regularly spaced every millimetre.\nEach line is fitted with a parabola-like curve (with an equation of the type y\n= alpha*abs(x)**beta) depending on two parameters, describing how open (beta)\nand how vertically stretched (alpha) the curve is. We compute additional\nfeatures from those parameters, using regressions and counting how many values\nfall under some threshold. We also deal with outliers and non equal numbers of\nlevels, and eventually obtain a numerical profile for each instrument.\n  We then apply classification methods to assess whether geometry alone can\npredict size reduction. We find that distinguishing between reduced and non\nreduced instruments is feasible to some degree, taking into account that a\nwhole spectrum of more or less transformed violins exists, for which it is more\ndifficult to quantify the reduction. We also find the opening parameter beta to\nbe the most predictive.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f6e\u5ed3\u7ebf\u5206\u7c7b\u5c0f\u63d0\u7434\u662f\u5426\u4e3a\u7f29\u51cf\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u533a\u5206\u7f29\u51cf\u4e0e\u975e\u7f29\u51cf\u5c0f\u63d0\u7434\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u53c2\u6570beta\u6700\u5177\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c0f\u63d0\u7434\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7f29\u51cf\u5bf9\u5176\u8f6e\u5ed3\u7ebf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e13\u5bb6\u89c2\u5bdf\u4f46\u672a\u5b9a\u91cf\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6444\u5f71\u6d4b\u91cf\u83b7\u53d625\u628a\u5c0f\u63d0\u7434\u76843D\u51e0\u4f55\u7f51\u683c\uff0c\u63d0\u53d610-20\u6761\u8f6e\u5ed3\u7ebf\uff0c\u62df\u5408\u629b\u7269\u7ebf\u66f2\u7ebf\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u7279\u5f81\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5e94\u7528\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7f29\u51cf\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u533a\u5206\u7f29\u51cf\u4e0e\u975e\u7f29\u51cf\u5c0f\u63d0\u7434\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u53c2\u6570beta\u6700\u5177\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5c0f\u63d0\u7434\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7f29\u51cf\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8003\u8651\u5b58\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u96be\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u72b6\u6001\u3002"}}

This enables a systematic study of multilingual\nretrieval behavior.\n  Our findings reveal that retrieval is a critical bottleneck in cross-lingual\ndomain-specific scenarios, with significant performance drops occurring when\nthe user query and supporting document languages differ. A key insight is that\nthese failures stem primarily from the retriever's difficulty in ranking\ndocuments across languages. Finally, we propose a simple retrieval strategy\nthat addresses this source of failure by enforcing equal retrieval from both\nlanguages, resulting in substantial improvements in cross-lingual and overall\nperformance. These results highlight meaningful opportunities for improving\nmultilingual retrieval, particularly in practical, real-world RAG applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u68c0\u7d22\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u68c0\u7d22\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u652f\u6301\u6587\u6863\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed-\u82f1\u8bed\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4f01\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u6240\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u68c0\u7d22\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u68c0\u7d22\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5f3a\u5236\u5747\u8861\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u68c0\u7d22\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u4ecd\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u3002"}}

The de facto approach to solving the\nproblem is to leverage language models that (iteratively) retrieve and reason\nthrough the retrieved documents, until the model has sufficient information to\ngenerate an answer. Attempts at improving this approach focus on\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) metrics such as accuracy and recall and\ncan be categorized into two types: (a) fine-tuning on large question answering\n(QA) datasets augmented with chain-of-thought traces, and (b) leveraging\nRL-based fine-tuning techniques that rely on question-document relevance\nsignals. However, efficiency in the number of retrieval searches is an equally\nimportant metric, which has received less attention. In this work, we show\nthat: (1) Large-scale fine-tuning is not needed to improve RAG metrics,\ncontrary to popular claims in recent literature.

However, leading open-source MLLMs exhibit significant\nlimitations in complex and structured reasoning, particularly in tasks\nrequiring deep reasoning for decision-making and problem-solving. In this work,\nwe present Corvid, an MLLM with enhanced chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning\ncapabilities. Architecturally, Corvid incorporates a hybrid vision encoder for\ninformative visual representation and a meticulously designed connector\n(GateMixer) to facilitate cross-modal alignment. To enhance Corvid's CoT\nreasoning capabilities, we introduce MCoT-Instruct-287K, a high-quality\nmultimodal CoT instruction-following dataset, refined and standardized from\ndiverse public reasoning sources. Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune Corvid\nwith a two-stage CoT-formatted training approach to progressively enhance its\nstep-by-step reasoning abilities. Furthermore, we propose an effective\ninference-time scaling strategy that enables Corvid to mitigate over-reasoning\nand under-reasoning through self-verification. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that Corvid outperforms existing o1-like MLLMs and state-of-the-art\nMLLMs with similar parameter scales, with notable strengths in mathematical\nreasoning and science problem-solving.

However, its inherent characteristics often introduce\nsubstantial noise, posing considerable challenges for automated lesion or organ\nsegmentation in ultrasound video sequences. To address these limitations, we\npropose the Dual Semantic-Aware Network (DSANet), a novel framework designed to\nenhance noise robustness in ultrasound video segmentation by fostering mutual\nsemantic awareness between local and global features. Specifically, we\nintroduce an Adjacent-Frame Semantic-Aware (AFSA) module, which constructs a\nchannel-wise similarity matrix to guide feature fusion across adjacent frames,\neffectively mitigating the impact of random noise without relying on\npixel-level relationships. Additionally, we propose a Local-and-Global\nSemantic-Aware (LGSA) module that reorganizes and fuses temporal unconditional\nlocal features, which capture spatial details independently at each frame, with\nconditional global features that incorporate temporal context from adjacent\nframes. This integration facilitates multi-level semantic representation,\nsignificantly improving the model's resilience to noise interference.

We further analyze the MHA and observe that its performance improves as the\nnumber of attention heads increases, provided the hidden size per head remains\nsufficiently large. Therefore, increasing both the head count and hidden size\nper head with minimal parameter overhead can lead to significant performance\ngains at a low cost.

Traditionally, transmitting embeddings instead of\nraw text has been seen as privacy-preserving. However, recent methods such as\nVec2Text challenge this assumption by demonstrating that controlled decoding\ncan successfully reconstruct original texts from black-box embeddings. The\nunexpectedly strong results reported by Vec2Text motivated us to conduct\nfurther verification, particularly considering the typically non-intuitive and\nopaque structure of high-dimensional embedding spaces. In this work, we\nreproduce the Vec2Text framework and evaluate it from two perspectives: (1)\nvalidating the original claims, and (2) extending the study through targeted\nexperiments. First, we successfully replicate the original key results in both\nin-domain and out-of-domain settings, with only minor discrepancies arising due\nto missing artifacts, such as model checkpoints and dataset splits.\nFurthermore, we extend the study by conducting a parameter sensitivity\nanalysis, evaluating the feasibility of reconstructing sensitive inputs (e.g.,\npasswords), and exploring embedding quantization as a lightweight privacy\ndefense. Our results show that Vec2Text is effective under ideal conditions,\ncapable of reconstructing even password-like sequences that lack clear\nsemantics.

Adverse weather significantly degrades\nimage quality, which in turn reduces recognition accuracy. Although recent face\nimage restoration (FIR) models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs)\nand diffusion models have shown progress, their performance remains limited due\nto the lack of dedicated modules that explicitly address weather-induced\ndegradations. This leads to distorted facial textures and structures. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a novel GAN-based blind FIR framework\nthat integrates two key components: local Statistical Facial Feature\nTransformation (SFFT) and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE). The\nlocal SFFT module enhances facial structure and color fidelity by aligning the\nlocal statistical distributions of low-quality (LQ) facial regions with those\nof high-quality (HQ) counterparts. Complementarily, the DAFE module enables\nrobust statistical facial feature extraction under adverse weather conditions\nby aligning LQ and HQ encoder representations, thereby making the restoration\nprocess adaptive to severe weather-induced degradations. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed degradation-agnostic SFFT model outperforms\nexisting state-of-the-art FIR methods based on GAN and diffusion models,\nparticularly in suppressing texture distortions and accurately reconstructing\nfacial structures.

To alleviate these issues, this paper presents the first\ninvestigation on preventing personal video data from unauthorized exploitation\nby deep trackers.

To address these issues, we\npropose a novel generative framework for generating Temporal Unlearnable\nExamples (TUEs), and whose efficient computation makes it scalable for usage on\nlarge-scale video datasets. The trackers trained w/ TUEs heavily rely on\nunlearnable noises for temporal matching, ignoring the original data structure\nand thus ensuring training video data-privacy.

It pioneers an innovative dual\nlens taxonomy that integrates legal reasoning frameworks and professional\nontologies to systematically unify historical research and contemporary\nbreakthroughs. Transformer-based LLMs, which exhibit emergent capabilities such\nas contextual reasoning and generative argumentation, surmount traditional\nlimitations by dynamically capturing legal semantics and unifying evidence\nreasoning. Significant progress is documented in task generalization, reasoning\nformalization, workflow integration, and addressing core challenges in text\nprocessing, knowledge integration, and evaluation rigor via technical\ninnovations like sparse attention mechanisms and mixture-of-experts\narchitectures. However, widespread adoption of LLM introduces critical\nchallenges: hallucination, explainability deficits, jurisdictional adaptation\ndifficulties, and ethical asymmetry. This review proposes a novel taxonomy that\nmaps legal roles to NLP subtasks and computationally implements the Toulmin\nargumentation framework, thus systematizing advances in reasoning, retrieval,\nprediction, and dispute resolution. It identifies key frontiers including\nlow-resource systems, multimodal evidence integration, and dynamic rebuttal\nhandling.

By constructing a small vocabulary\nfrom STL syntax, we demonstrate that our proposed model is able to generate\nvalid formulae after only 1 epoch and to generalize to the semantics of the\nlogic in about 10 epochs. Additionally, the model is able to decode a given\nembedding into formulae that are often simpler in terms of length and nesting\nwhile remaining semantically close (or equivalent) to gold references. We show\nthe effectiveness of our methodology across various levels of training formulae\ncomplexity to assess the impact of training data on the model's ability to\neffectively capture the semantic information contained in the embeddings and\ngeneralize out-of-distribution. Finally, we deploy our model for solving a\nrequirement mining task, i.e. inferring STL specifications that solve a\nclassification task on trajectories, performing the optimization directly in\nthe semantic space.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53cd\u8f6c\u4fe1\u53f7\u65f6\u5e8f\u903b\u8f91\uff08STL\uff09\u516c\u5f0f\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u7b80\u6d01\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u516c\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06\u7b26\u53f7\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u5230\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u903b\u8f91\u516c\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5d4c\u5165\u662f\u53ef\u9006\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2aTransformer\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7STL\u8bed\u6cd5\u7684\u5c0f\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\uff0c\u53cd\u8f6c\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6548\u516c\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u57281\u4e2a\u5468\u671f\u540e\u5373\u53ef\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6548\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ea610\u4e2a\u5468\u671f\u540e\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u903b\u8f91\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u516c\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9700\u6c42\u6316\u6398\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

Existing methods typically represent\nthe human pose as an abstract graph structure, neglecting the intrinsic\nphysical dependencies between joints, which increases learning difficulty and\nmakes the model prone to generating unrealistic motions. In this paper, we\npropose GGMotion, a group graph dynamics-kinematics network that models human\ntopology in groups to better leverage dynamics and kinematics priors. To\npreserve the geometric equivariance in 3D space, we propose a novel radial\nfield for the graph network that captures more comprehensive spatio-temporal\ndependencies by aggregating joint features through spatial and temporal edges.\nInter-group and intra-group interaction modules are employed to capture the\ndependencies of joints at different scales. Combined with equivariant\nmultilayer perceptrons (MLP), joint position features are updated in each group\nthrough parallelized dynamics-kinematics propagation to improve physical\nplausibility. Meanwhile, we introduce an auxiliary loss to supervise motion\npriors during training.

In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of\ndifferentially weighting prompt and response tokens in instruction tuning loss,\nand propose Weighted Instruction Tuning (WIT) as a better alternative to\nconventional instruction tuning. Through extensive experiments on five language\nmodels of different families and scale, three finetuning datasets of different\nsizes, and five diverse evaluation benchmarks, we show that the standard\ninstruction tuning loss often yields suboptimal performance and limited\nrobustness to input prompt variations.

For each task, scientists carefully\nchoose appropriate modalities or leverage data from purpose-built instruments.\nRecent work on remote sensing foundation models pre-trains computer vision\nmodels on large amounts of remote sensing data. These large-scale models tend\nto focus on specific modalities, often optical RGB or multispectral data. For\nmany important applications, this introduces a mismatch between the application\nmodalities and the pre-training data. Moreover, the large size of foundation\nmodels makes them expensive and difficult to fine-tune on typically small\ndatasets for each task.

MAPEX is pre-trained on\nmulti-modal remote sensing data with a novel modality-conditioned token routing\nmechanism that elicits modality-specific experts. To apply the model on a\nspecific task, we propose a modality aware pruning technique, which only\nretains experts specialized for the task modalities.

Timely, large-scale information on flood extent and\ndepth is essential for disaster response; however, existing products often\ntrade spatial detail for coverage or ignore flood depth altogether. To bridge\nthis gap, this work presents HOTA: Hierarchical Overlap-Tiling Aggregation, a\nplug-and-play, multi-scale inference strategy. When combined with SegFormer and\na dual-constraint depth estimation module, this approach forms a complete 3D\nflood-mapping pipeline. HOTA applies overlapping tiles of different sizes to\nmultispectral Sentinel-2 images only during inference, enabling the SegFormer\nmodel to capture both local features and kilometre-scale inundation without\nchanging the network weights or retraining. The subsequent depth module is\nbased on a digital elevation model (DEM) differencing method, which refines the\n2D mask and estimates flood depth by enforcing (i) zero depth along the flood\nboundary and (ii) near-constant flood volume with respect to the DEM. A case\nstudy on the March 2021 Kempsey (Australia) flood shows that HOTA, when coupled\nwith SegFormer, improves IoU from 73\\% (U-Net baseline) to 84\\%. The resulting\n3D surface achieves a mean absolute boundary error of less than 0.5 m.

In this paper, we\npropose Stable-Hair v2, a novel diffusion-based multi-view hair transfer\nframework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage\nmulti-view diffusion models for robust, high-fidelity, and view-consistent hair\ntransfer across multiple perspectives. We introduce a comprehensive multi-view\ntraining data generation pipeline comprising a diffusion-based Bald Converter,\na data-augment inpainting model, and a face-finetuned multi-view diffusion\nmodel to generate high-quality triplet data, including bald images, reference\nhairstyles, and view-aligned source-bald pairs. Our multi-view hair transfer\nmodel integrates polar-azimuth embeddings for pose conditioning and temporal\nattention layers to ensure smooth transitions between views. To optimize this\nmodel, we design a novel multi-stage training strategy consisting of\npose-controllable latent IdentityNet training, hair extractor training, and\ntemporal attention training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method\naccurately transfers detailed and realistic hairstyles to source subjects while\nachieving seamless and consistent results across views, significantly\noutperforming existing methods and establishing a new benchmark in multi-view\nhair transfer.

Conveniently, recent work showed that every language model defines\nan implicit reward model (IM-RM), without requiring any architectural changes.\nHowever, such IM-RMs tend to generalize worse, especially out-of-distribution,\ncompared to explicit reward models (EX-RMs) that apply a dedicated linear head\nover the hidden representations of a language model. The existence of a\ngeneralization gap is puzzling, as EX-RMs and IM-RMs are nearly identical. They\ncan be trained using the same data, loss function, and language model, and\ndiffer only in how the reward is computed. Towards a fundamental understanding\nof the implicit biases underlying different reward model types, we investigate\nthe root cause of this gap.

To address these challenges, we propose\na Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding framework (dubbed T-GVC). T-GVC\nemploys a semantic-aware sparse motion sampling pipeline to effectively bridge\nlow-level motion tracking with high-level semantic understanding by extracting\npixel-wise motion as sparse trajectory points based on their semantic\nimportance, not only significantly reducing the bitrate but also preserving\ncritical temporal semantic information.

Subsequently, the knowledge is integrated with the learning\noutcomes of a conventional deep learning network through the introduction of AU\nloss. The design is incorporated into the existing optimal model for dynamic\nexpression recognition for the purpose of validation. Experiments are conducted\non three recent mainstream open-source approaches to DFER on the principal\ndatasets in this field. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture\noutperforms the state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods without the need for additional\narithmetic and generally produces improved results. Furthermore, we investigate\nthe potential of AU loss function redesign to address data label imbalance\nissues in established dynamic expression datasets.

Recently,\nMamba-based methods have achieved promising performance across various vision\ntasks; however, they struggle with the UMDE task because their inflexible state\nscanning strategies fail to model the structural features of underwater images\neffectively. Meanwhile, existing UMDE datasets usually contain unreliable depth\nlabels, leading to incorrect object-depth relationships between underwater\nimages and their corresponding depth maps. To overcome these limitations, we\ndevelop a novel tree-aware Mamba method, dubbed Tree-Mamba, for estimating\naccurate monocular depth maps from underwater degraded images. Specifically, we\npropose a tree-aware scanning strategy that adaptively constructs a minimum\nspanning tree based on feature similarity. The spatial topological features\namong the tree nodes are then flexibly aggregated through bottom-up and\ntop-down traversals, enabling stronger multi-scale feature representation\ncapabilities. Moreover, we construct an underwater depth estimation benchmark\n(called BlueDepth), which consists of 38,162 underwater image pairs with\nreliable depth labels. This benchmark serves as a foundational dataset for\ntraining existing deep learning-based UMDE methods to learn accurate\nobject-depth relationships.

Our key insight is to guide the model's\nintermediate representations toward geometry-aware structure by aligning them\nwith features from a pretrained geometric foundation model. To this end, we\nintroduce two complementary alignment objectives: Angular Alignment, which\nenforces directional consistency via cosine similarity, and Scale Alignment,\nwhich preserves scale-related information by regressing unnormalized geometric\nfeatures from normalized diffusion representation. We evaluate Geometry Forcing\non both camera view-conditioned and action-conditioned video generation tasks.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves visual\nquality and 3D consistency over the baseline methods.

To leverage the built-in objectness of query-based transformers, which\nmitigates catastrophic forgetting of mask proposals, current methods often\ndecouple mask generation from the continual learning process. This study,\nhowever, identifies two key issues with decoupled frameworks: loss of\nplasticity and heavy reliance on input data order. To address these, we conduct\nan in-depth investigation of the built-in objectness and find that highly\naggregated image features provide a shortcut for queries to generate masks\nthrough simple feature alignment. Based on this, we propose SimCIS, a simple\nyet powerful baseline for CIS. Its core idea is to directly select image\nfeatures for query assignment, ensuring \"perfect alignment\" to preserve\nobjectness, while simultaneously allowing queries to select new classes to\npromote plasticity.

They are a critical tool\nin applications ranging from marine ecology and aquaculture to underwater\nconstruction and archaeology. While existing pixel-domain diffusion-based image\nrestoration approaches are effective at restoring simple scenes with limited\ndepth variation, they are computationally intensive and often generate\nunrealistic artifacts when applied to scenes with complex geometry and\nsignificant depth variation. In this work we overcome these limitations by\ncombining a novel network architecture (SLURPP) with an accurate synthetic data\ngeneration pipeline. SLURPP combines pretrained latent diffusion models --\nwhich encode strong priors on the geometry and depth of scenes -- with an\nexplicit scene decomposition -- which allows one to model and account for the\neffects of light attenuation and backscattering. To train SLURPP we design a\nphysics-based underwater image synthesis pipeline that applies varied and\nrealistic underwater degradation effects to existing terrestrial image\ndatasets. This approach enables the generation of diverse training data with\ndense medium/degradation annotations. We evaluate our method extensively on\nboth synthetic and real-world benchmarks and demonstrate state-of-the-art\nperformance. Notably, SLURPP is over 200X faster than existing diffusion-based\nmethods while offering ~ 3 dB improvement in PSNR on synthetic benchmarks.

First, insufficient retrieval can miss critical\ninformation, whereas excessive retrieval can introduce irrelevant or misleading\ncontent, disrupting model output. Second, even when the model initially\nprovides correct answers, over-reliance on retrieved data can lead to factual\nerrors. To address these issues, we introduce the Multimodal Intelligent\nRetrieval and Augmentation (MIRA) framework, designed to optimize factual\naccuracy in MLLM. MIRA consists of two key components: (1) a calibrated\nRethinking and Rearrangement module that dynamically adjusts the number of\nretrieved contexts to manage factual risk, and (2) A medical RAG framework\nintegrating image embeddings and a medical knowledge base with a query-rewrite\nmodule for efficient multimodal reasoning.

Three-dimensional Time-of-Flight Magnetic Resonance\nAngiography (3D TOF MRA) is widely used to visualize cerebral vasculature,\nhowever, clinical evaluations generally focus on major arterial abnormalities,\noverlooking quantitative metrics critical for understanding subtle vascular\nchanges. Existing methods for extracting structural, geometrical and\nmorphological arterial features from MRA - whether manual or automated - face\nchallenges including user-dependent variability, steep learning curves, and\nlack of standardized quantitative validations. We propose a novel\nsemi-supervised artery evaluation framework, named ArteryX, a MATLAB-based\ntoolbox that quantifies vascular features with high accuracy and efficiency,\nachieving processing times ~10-15 minutes per subject at 0.5 mm resolution with\nminimal user intervention. ArteryX employs a vessel-fused network based\nlandmarking approach to reliably track and manage tracings, effectively\naddressing the issue of dangling/disconnected vessels.

Hoffmann", "Thomas Brox"], "title": "CLIP Won't Learn Object-Attribute Binding from Natural Data and Here is Why", "comment": null, "summary": "Contrastive vision-language models like CLIP are used for a large variety of\napplications, such as zero-shot classification or as vision encoder for\nmulti-modal models. Despite their popularity, their representations show major\nlimitations. For instance, CLIP models learn bag-of-words representations and,\nas a consequence, fail to distinguish whether an image is of \"a yellow\nsubmarine and a blue bus\" or \"a blue submarine and a yellow bus\". Previous\nattempts to fix this issue added hard negatives during training or modified the\narchitecture, but failed to resolve the problem in its entirety. We suspect\nthat the missing insights to solve the binding problem for CLIP are hidden in\nthe arguably most important part of learning algorithms: the data. In this\nwork, we fill this gap by rigorously identifying the influence of data\nproperties on CLIP's ability to learn binding using a synthetic dataset.

However,\nthe role of concept combinations in the training data on compositional\ngeneralization is largely unclear -- for instance, how does accuracy vary when\na common object appears in an uncommon pairing with another object? In this\npaper, we investigate how word co-occurrence statistics in the pretraining\ndataset (a proxy for co-occurrence of visual concepts) impacts CLIP/LMM\nperformance. To disentangle the effects of word co-occurrence frequencies from\nsingle-word frequencies, we measure co-occurrence with pointwise mutual\ninformation (PMI), which normalizes the joint probability of two words\nco-occurring by the probability of co-occurring independently. Using\nsynthetically generated images with a variety of concept pairs, we show a\nstrong correlation between PMI in the CLIP pretraining data and zero-shot\naccuracy in CLIP models trained on LAION-400M (r=0.97 and 14% accuracy gap\nbetween images in the top and bottom 5% of PMI values), demonstrating that even\naccuracy on common concepts is affected by the combination of concepts in the\nimage. Leveraging this finding, we reproduce this effect in natural images by\nediting them to contain pairs with varying PMI, resulting in a correlation of\nr=0.75. Finally, we demonstrate that this behavior in CLIP transfers to LMMs\nbuilt on top of CLIP (r=0.70 for TextVQA, r=0.62 for VQAv2).
