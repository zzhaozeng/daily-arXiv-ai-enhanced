Most of the existing\napproaches model BSSRDF either through an analysis-by-synthesis approach,\napproximating complex path integrals, or using differentiable volume rendering\ntechniques to account for heterogeneity. However, only a few studies have\napplied learning-based methods to estimate subsurface scattering parameters,\nbut they assume homogeneous media. Interestingly, no specific distribution is\nknown to us that can explicitly model the heterogeneous scattering parameters\nin the real world. Notably, procedural noise models such as Perlin and Fractal\nPerlin noise have been effective in representing intricate heterogeneities of\nnatural, organic, and inorganic surfaces. Leveraging this, we first create\nHeteroSynth, a synthetic dataset comprising photorealistic images of\nheterogeneous media whose scattering parameters are modeled using Fractal\nPerlin noise. Furthermore, we propose Tensorial Inverse Scattering (TensoIS), a\nlearning-based feed-forward framework to estimate these Perlin-distributed\nheterogeneous scattering parameters from sparse multi-view image observations.\nInstead of directly predicting the 3D scattering parameter volume, TensoIS uses\nlearnable low-rank tensor components to represent the scattering volume. We\nevaluate TensoIS on unseen heterogeneous variations over shapes from the\nHeteroSynth test set, smoke and cloud geometries obtained from open-source\nrealistic volumetric simulations, and some real-world samples to establish its\neffectiveness for inverse scattering. Overall, this study is an attempt to\nexplore Perlin noise distribution, given the lack of any such well-defined\ndistribution in literature, to potentially model real-world heterogeneous\nscattering in a feed-forward manner."}

To address this, recent\nstudies have shown that aggregating features via segmentation, to compute a\nsingle attribution value for a group of consecutive time points, drastically\nreduces SHAP running time. However, the choice of the optimal segmentation\nstrategy remains an open question. In this work, we investigated eight\ndifferent Time Series Segmentation algorithms to understand how segment\ncompositions affect the explanation quality. We evaluate these approaches using\ntwo established XAI evaluation methodologies: InterpretTime and AUC Difference.\nThrough experiments on both Multivariate (MTS) and Univariate Time Series\n(UTS), we find that the number of segments has a greater impact on explanation\nquality than the specific segmentation method. Notably, equal-length\nsegmentation consistently outperforms most of the custom time series\nsegmentation algorithms.

We propose a multi-task learning framework to segment vessels\nin liver MRI without contrast. It exploits auxiliary contrast enhanced MRI data\navailable only during training to reduce the need for annotated training\nexamples. Our approach draws on paired native and contrast enhanced data with\nand without vessel annotations for model training. Results show that auxiliary\ndata improves the accuracy of vessel segmentation, even if they are not\navailable during inference. The advantage is most pronounced if only few\nannotations are available for training, since the feature representation\nbenefits from the shared task structure. A validation of this approach to\naugment a model for brain tumor segmentation confirms its benefits across\ndifferent domains. An auxiliary informative imaging modality can augment expert\nannotations even if it is only available during training."}

We\nstudy the properties of such distributions as the domain size tends to\ninfinity. Three types of concrete examples of MLNs will be considered, and the\nproperties of random structures with domain sizes tending to infinity will be\nstudied: (1) Arbitrary quantifier-free MLNs over a language with only one\nrelation symbol which has arity 1. In this case we give a pretty complete\ncharacterization of the possible limit behaviours of random structures. (2) An\nMLN that favours graphs with fewer triangles (or more generally, fewer\nk-cliques). As a corollary of the analysis a ``$\\delta$-approximate 0-1 law''\nfor first-order logic is obtained. (3) An MLN that favours graphs with fewer\nvertices with degree higher than a fixed (but arbitrary) number. The analysis\nshows that depending on which ``soft constraints'' an MLN uses the limit\nbehaviour of random structures can be quite different, and the weights of the\nsoft constraints may, or may not, have influence on the limit behaviour. It\nwill also be demonstrated, using (1), that quantifier-free MLNs and lifted\nBayesian networks (in a broad sense) are asymptotically incomparable, roughly\nmeaning that there is a sequence of distributions on possible worlds with\nincreasing domain sizes that can be defined by one of the formalisms but not\neven approximated by the other. In a rather general context it is also shown\nthat on large domains the distribution determined by an MLN concentrates almost\nall its probability mass on a totally different part of the space of possible\nworlds than the uniform distribution does."}

Though few-step distillation methods, particularly\nConsistency Models (CMs), have achieved substantial advancements in\naccelerating 2D diffusion models, they remain under-explored for more complex\n3D generation tasks. In this study, we propose a novel framework, MDT-dist, for\nfew-step 3D flow distillation. Our approach is built upon a primary objective:\ndistilling the pretrained model to learn the Marginal-Data Transport. Directly\nlearning this objective needs to integrate the velocity fields, while this\nintegral is intractable to be implemented. Therefore, we propose two\noptimizable objectives, Velocity Matching (VM) and Velocity Distillation (VD),\nto equivalently convert the optimization target from the transport level to the\nvelocity and the distribution level respectively. Velocity Matching (VM) learns\nto stably match the velocity fields between the student and the teacher, but\ninevitably provides biased gradient estimates. Velocity Distillation (VD)\nfurther enhances the optimization process by leveraging the learned velocity\nfields to perform probability density distillation. When evaluated on the\npioneer 3D generation framework TRELLIS, our method reduces sampling steps of\neach flow transformer from 25 to 1 or 2, achieving 0.68s (1 step x 2) and 0.94s\n(2 steps x 2) latency with 9.0x and 6.5x speedup on A800, while preserving high\nvisual and geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nmethod significantly outperforms existing CM distillation methods, and enables\nTRELLIS to achieve superior performance in few-step 3D generation."}

However, their reliance on static training data is a major risk\nwhen medical recommendations evolve with new research and developments. When\nLLMs memorize outdated medical knowledge, they can provide harmful advice or\nfail at clinical reasoning tasks. To investigate this problem, we introduce two\nnovel question-answering (QA) datasets derived from systematic reviews:\nMedRevQA (16,501 QA pairs covering general biomedical knowledge) and\nMedChangeQA (a subset of 512 QA pairs where medical consensus has changed over\ntime). Our evaluation of eight prominent LLMs on the datasets reveals\nconsistent reliance on outdated knowledge across all models. We additionally\nanalyze the influence of obsolete pre-training data and training strategies to\nexplain this phenomenon and propose future directions for mitigation, laying\nthe groundwork for developing more current and reliable medical AI systems."}

However, dense prediction is\ninherently an image-to-image task, suggesting that image editing models, rather\nthan T2I generative models, may be a more suitable foundation for fine-tuning.\n  Motivated by this, we conduct a systematic analysis of the fine-tuning\nbehaviors of both editors and generators for dense geometry estimation. Our\nfindings show that editing models possess inherent structural priors, which\nenable them to converge more stably by ``refining\" their innate features, and\nultimately achieve higher performance than their generative counterparts.\n  Based on these findings, we introduce \\textbf{FE2E}, a framework that\npioneeringly adapts an advanced editing model based on Diffusion Transformer\n(DiT) architecture for dense geometry prediction. Specifically, to tailor the\neditor for this deterministic task, we reformulate the editor's original flow\nmatching loss into the ``consistent velocity\" training objective. And we use\nlogarithmic quantization to resolve the precision conflict between the editor's\nnative BFloat16 format and the high precision demand of our tasks.\nAdditionally, we leverage the DiT's global attention for a cost-free joint\nestimation of depth and normals in a single forward pass, enabling their\nsupervisory signals to mutually enhance each other.\n  Without scaling up the training data, FE2E achieves impressive performance\nimprovements in zero-shot monocular depth and normal estimation across multiple\ndatasets.

While existing methods can transfer style patterns onto\n3D-consistent neural representations, they struggle to effectively extract and\ntransfer high-level style semantics from the reference style image.\nAdditionally, the stylized results often lack structural clarity and\nseparation, making it difficult to distinguish between different instances or\nobjects within the 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel\n3D style transfer pipeline that effectively integrates prior knowledge from\npretrained 2D diffusion models. Our pipeline consists of two key stages: First,\nwe leverage diffusion priors to generate stylized renderings of key viewpoints.\nThen, we transfer the stylized key views onto the 3D representation. This\nprocess incorporates two innovative designs. The first is cross-view style\nalignment, which inserts cross-view attention into the last upsampling block of\nthe UNet, allowing feature interactions across multiple key views. This ensures\nthat the diffusion model generates stylized key views that maintain both style\nfidelity and instance-level consistency. The second is instance-level style\ntransfer, which effectively leverages instance-level consistency across\nstylized key views and transfers it onto the 3D representation. This results in\na more structured, visually coherent, and artistically enriched stylization.\nExtensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our 3D\nstyle transfer pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods\nacross a wide range of scenes, from forward-facing to challenging 360-degree\nenvironments.
