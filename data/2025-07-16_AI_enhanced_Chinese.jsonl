Yet\nas graphs grow more complex, these depictions can become difficult to\nunderstand. Quilts are matrix-based depictions for layered graphs designed to\naddress this problem. In this research, we first improve Quilts by developing\nthree design alternatives, and then compare the best of these alternatives to\nbetter-known node-link and matrix depictions. A primary weakness in Quilts is\ntheir depiction of skip links, links that do not simply connect to a succeeding\nlayer. Therefore in our first study, we compare Quilts using color-only,\ntext-only, and mixed (color and text) skip link depictions, finding that path\nfinding with the color-only depiction is significantly slower and less\naccurate, and that in certain cases, the mixed depiction offers an advantage\nover the text-only depiction. In our second study, we compare Quilts using the\nmixed depiction to node-link diagrams and centered matrices. Overall results\nshow that users can find paths through graphs significantly faster with Quilts\n(46.6 secs) than with node-link (58.3 secs) or matrix (71.2 secs) diagrams.\nThis speed advantage is still greater in large graphs (e.g. in 200 node graphs,\n55.4 secs vs. 71.1 secs for node-link and 84.2 secs for matrix depictions).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86Quilts\uff08\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u8def\u5f84\u67e5\u627e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u8282\u70b9-\u94fe\u63a5\u56fe\u548c\u77e9\u9635\u56fe\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u5c42\u56fe\uff08\u5982\u6d41\u7a0b\u56fe\uff09\u5728\u590d\u6742\u56fe\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\uff0cQuilts\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e09\u79cdQuilts\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08\u989c\u8272\u3001\u6587\u672c\u3001\u6df7\u5408\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5176\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u5c06\u6700\u4f73\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u8282\u70b9-\u94fe\u63a5\u56fe\u548c\u77e9\u9635\u56fe\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u6df7\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684Quilts\u5728\u8def\u5f84\u67e5\u627e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u5feb\u4e8e\u8282\u70b9-\u94fe\u63a5\u56fe\uff0846.6\u79d2 vs. 58.3\u79d2\uff09\u548c\u77e9\u9635\u56fe\uff0846.6\u79d2 vs. 71.2\u79d2\uff09\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5927\u578b\u56fe\u4e2d\u4f18\u52bf\u66f4\u660e\u663e\u3002", "conclusion": "Quilts\u5728\u590d\u6742\u56fe\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u662f\u5176\u6700\u4f73\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}

An evaluative challenge facing FER\nalgorithms is the fall in performance when detecting spontaneous expressions\ncompared to posed expressions. An ethical (and evaluative) challenge facing FER\nalgorithms is that they tend to perform poorly for people of some races and\nskin colors. These challenges are linked to the data collection practices\nemployed in the creation of FER datasets. In this study, we audit two\nstate-of-the-art FER datasets. We take random samples from each dataset and\nexamine whether images are spontaneous or posed. In doing so, we propose a\nmethodology for identifying spontaneous or posed images. We discover a\nsignificant number of images that were posed in the datasets purporting to\nconsist of in-the-wild images. Since performance of FER models vary between\nspontaneous and posed images, the performance of models trained on these\ndatasets will not represent the true performance if such models were to be\ndeployed in in-the-wild applications.

Yet, a pressing\nchallenge remains: How can we trust these agents especially in zero-shot\nsettings with no fine-tuning? We introduce a novel modular Agentic AI visual\nclassification framework that integrates generalist multimodal agents with a\nnon-visual reasoning orchestrator and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\nmodule. Applied to apple leaf disease diagnosis, we benchmark three\nconfigurations: (I) zero-shot with confidence-based orchestration, (II)\nfine-tuned agents with improved performance, and (III) trust-calibrated\norchestration enhanced by CLIP-based image retrieval and re-evaluation loops.\nUsing confidence calibration metrics (ECE, OCR, CCC), the orchestrator\nmodulates trust across agents. Our results demonstrate a 77.94\\% accuracy\nimprovement in the zero-shot setting using trust-aware orchestration and RAG,\nachieving 85.63\\% overall. GPT-4o showed better calibration, while Qwen-2.5-VL\ndisplayed overconfidence. Furthermore, image-RAG grounded predictions with\nvisually similar cases, enabling correction of agent overconfidence via\niterative re-evaluation. The proposed system separates perception (vision\nagents) from meta-reasoning (orchestrator), enabling scalable and interpretable\nmulti-agent AI.

There are potentially\n19 types of mutations such as adding, removing, swapping or reversing parts of\nthe grammar that can be applied to the grammars.

Our study examines how tunes change gradually over the course of multiple\nmutations.

We address the quintessential question of whether AI will have a net\npositive, neutral, or negative impact on CO2 emissions by 2035. Additionally,\nwe discuss AI's potential to automate, create efficient and disruptive\nworkflows across various fields related to energy production, supply and\nconsumption. In the near-term scenario, the growing demand for AI will likely\nstrain computing resources, lead to increase in electricity consumption and\ntherefore associated CO2 emissions. This is due to the power-hungry nature of\nbig data centers and the requirements for training and running of large and\ncomplex AI models, as well as the penetration of AI assistant search and\napplications for public use. However, the long-term outlook could be more\npromising. AI has the potential to be a game-changer in CO2 reduction. Its\nability to further automate and optimize processes across industries, from\nenergy production to logistics, could significantly decrease our carbon\nfootprint.

We propose Winsor-CAM, a\nnovel, human-tunable extension of Grad-CAM that generates robust and coherent\nsaliency maps by aggregating information across all convolutional layers. To\nmitigate the influence of noisy or extreme attribution values, Winsor-CAM\napplies Winsorization, a percentile-based outlier attenuation technique.

To address this, our ExRec presents\nan end-to-end pipeline, from annotating the KCs of questions and learning their\nsemantic representations to training KT models and optimizing several\nreinforcement learning (RL) methods. Moreover, we improve standard\nQ-learning-based continuous RL methods via a tailored model-based value\nestimation (MVE) approach that directly leverages the components of KT model in\nestimating cumulative knowledge improvement.

However, both CNNs and transformers exhibit a\nsimplicity bias, favoring straightforward features over complex structural\nrepresentations. Furthermore, modern CNNs often integrate MLP-like blocks akin\nto those in transformers, but these blocks suffer from significant information\nredundancies, necessitating high expansion ratios to sustain competitive\nperformance. To address these limitations, we propose SpaRTAN, a lightweight\narchitectural design that enhances spatial and channel-wise information\nprocessing. SpaRTAN employs kernels with varying receptive fields, controlled\nby kernel size and dilation factor, to capture discriminative multi-order\nspatial features effectively. A wave-based channel aggregation module further\nmodulates and reinforces pixel interactions, mitigating channel-wise\nredundancies. Combining the two modules, the proposed network can efficiently\ngather and dynamically contextualize discriminative features. Experimental\nresults in ImageNet and COCO demonstrate that SpaRTAN achieves remarkable\nparameter efficiency while maintaining competitive performance. In particular,\non the ImageNet-1k benchmark, SpaRTAN achieves 77. 7% accuracy with only 3.8M\nparameters and approximately 1.0 GFLOPs, demonstrating its ability to deliver\nstrong performance through an efficient design.

We present\nGoldMine OS, a research oriented architecture that employs multiple specialized\nAI agents to automate and secure the tokenization and exchange of physical gold\ninto a blockchain based stablecoin (\"OZ\"). Our approach combines on chain smart\ncontracts for critical risk controls with off chain AI agents for decision\nmaking, blending the transparency and reliability of blockchains with the\nflexibility of AI driven automation. We describe four cooperative agents\n(Compliance, Token Issuance, Market Making, and Risk Control) and a\ncoordinating core, and evaluate the system through simulation and a controlled\npilot deployment. In experiments the prototype delivers on demand token\nissuance in under 1.2 s, more than 100 times faster than manual workflows. The\nMarket Making agent maintains tight liquidity with spreads often below 0.5\npercent even under volatile conditions. Fault injection tests show resilience:\nan oracle price spoofing attack is detected and mitigated within 10 s, and a\nsimulated vault mis reporting halts issuance immediately with minimal user\nimpact.

Social media platforms played a pivotal role in amplifying\npublic sentiment and shaping discourse during this historic mass uprising. In\nthis study, we present a hybrid transformer-based sentiment analysis framework\nto decode public opinion expressed in social media comments during and after\nthe revolution. We used a brand new dataset of 4,200 Bangla comments collected\nfrom social media. The framework employs advanced transformer-based feature\nextraction techniques, including BanglaBERT, mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, and the\nproposed hybrid XMB-BERT, to capture nuanced patterns in textual data.\nPrinciple Component Analysis (PCA) were utilized for dimensionality reduction\nto enhance computational efficiency.

To this end, we present DIJA, the first\nsystematic study and jailbreak attack framework that exploits unique safety\nweaknesses of dLLMs. Specifically, our proposed DIJA constructs adversarial\ninterleaved mask-text prompts that exploit the text generation mechanisms of\ndLLMs, i.e., bidirectional modeling and parallel decoding. Bidirectional\nmodeling drives the model to produce contextually consistent outputs for masked\nspans, even when harmful, while parallel decoding limits model dynamic\nfiltering and rejection sampling of unsafe content. This causes standard\nalignment mechanisms to fail, enabling harmful completions in alignment-tuned\ndLLMs, even when harmful behaviors or unsafe instructions are directly exposed\nin the prompt. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that DIJA\nsignificantly outperforms existing jailbreak methods, exposing a previously\noverlooked threat surface in dLLM architectures.

To overcome these limitations, we propose the\nDark Channel Guided Frequency-aware Dehazing Network (DGFDNet), a novel\ndual-domain framework that performs physically guided degradation alignment\nacross spatial and frequency domains. At its core, the DGFDBlock comprises two\nkey modules: 1) the Haze-Aware Frequency Modulator (HAFM), which generates a\npixel-level haze confidence map from dark channel priors to adaptively enhance\nhaze-relevant frequency components, thereby achieving global degradation-aware\nspectral modulation; 2) the Multi-level Gating Aggregation Module (MGAM), which\nfuses multi-scale features through diverse convolutional kernels and hybrid\ngating mechanisms to recover fine structural details.

Collecting accurate\nsurface geometry data from the foot and ankle during dynamic gait conditions is\ninherently challenging due to swing foot occlusions and viewing limitations.\nThus, this paper introduces FootGait3D, a novel multi-view dataset of\nhigh-resolution ankle-foot surface point clouds captured during natural gait.\nDifferent from existing gait datasets that typically target whole-body or\nlower-limb motion, FootGait3D focuses specifically on the detailed modeling of\nthe ankle-foot region, offering a finer granularity of motion data. To address\nthis, FootGait3D consists of 8,403 point cloud frames collected from 46\nsubjects using a custom five-camera depth sensing system. Each frame includes a\ncomplete 5-view reconstruction of the foot and ankle (serving as ground truth)\nalong with partial point clouds obtained from only four, three, or two views.\nThis structured variation enables rigorous evaluation of 3D point cloud\ncompletion methods under varying occlusion levels and viewpoints.

While multi-agent\nsystems (MAS) can emulate human coding workflows, their benefits over\nsingle-agent coding remain poorly understood. We conducted an experimental\nstudy of how agent persona and temperature shape consensus-building and coding\naccuracy of dialog segments based on a codebook with 8 codes. Our open-source\nMAS mirrors deductive human coding through structured agent discussion and\nconsensus arbitration. Using six open-source LLMs (with 3 to 32 billion\nparameters) and 18 experimental configurations, we analyze over 77,000 coding\ndecisions against a gold-standard dataset of human-annotated transcripts from\nonline math tutoring sessions. Temperature significantly impacted whether and\nwhen consensus was reached across all six LLMs. MAS with multiple personas\n(including neutral, assertive, or empathetic), significantly delayed consensus\nin four out of six LLMs compared to uniform personas. In three of those LLMs,\nhigher temperatures significantly diminished the effects of multiple personas\non consensus. However, neither temperature nor persona pairing lead to robust\nimprovements in coding accuracy. Single agents matched or outperformed MAS\nconsensus in most conditions. Only one model (OpenHermesV2:7B) and code\ncategory showed above-chance gains from MAS deliberation when temperature was\n0.5 or lower and especially when the agents included at least one assertive\npersona.

However,\nachieving precise local 3D edits remains challenging, especially for Gaussian\nSplatting, due to inconsistent multi-view 2D part segmentations and inherently\nambiguous nature of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss. To address these\nlimitations, we propose RoMaP, a novel local 3D Gaussian editing framework that\nenables precise and drastic part-level modifications. First, we introduce a\nrobust 3D mask generation module with our 3D-Geometry Aware Label Prediction\n(3D-GALP), which uses spherical harmonics (SH) coefficients to model\nview-dependent label variations and soft-label property, yielding accurate and\nconsistent part segmentations across viewpoints. Second, we propose a\nregularized SDS loss that combines the standard SDS loss with additional\nregularizers. In particular, an L1 anchor loss is introduced via our Scheduled\nLatent Mixing and Part (SLaMP) editing method, which generates high-quality\npart-edited 2D images and confines modifications only to the target region\nwhile preserving contextual coherence. Additional regularizers, such as\nGaussian prior removal, further improve flexibility by allowing changes beyond\nthe existing context, and robust 3D masking prevents unintended edits.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our RoMaP achieves state-of-the-art local\n3D editing on both reconstructed and generated Gaussian scenes and objects\nqualitatively and quantitatively, making it possible for more robust and\nflexible part-level 3D Gaussian editing.", "AI": {"tldr": "RoMaP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u5c40\u90e83D\u9ad8\u65af\u7f16\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc73D-GALP\u548c\u6b63\u5219\u5316SDS\u635f\u5931\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u90e8\u4ef6\u7ea7\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\u4e2d\u5c40\u90e83D\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5982\u591a\u89c6\u89d22D\u5206\u5272\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548cSDS\u635f\u5931\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa3D-GALP\u6a21\u5757\u751f\u6210\u9c81\u68d23D\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6b63\u5219\u5316SDS\u635f\u5931\uff08\u5305\u62ecL1\u951a\u635f\u5931\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u5148\u9a8c\u53bb\u9664\uff09\u3002", "result": "RoMaP\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5c40\u90e83D\u7f16\u8f91\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "RoMaP\u4e3a\u90e8\u4ef6\u7ea73D\u9ad8\u65af\u7f16\u8f91\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing studies often focus on individual neurons, but their\npolysemantic nature makes it difficult to isolate language-specific units from\ncross-lingual representations. To address this, we explore sparse autoencoders\n(SAEs) for their ability to learn monosemantic features that represent concrete\nand abstract concepts across languages in LLMs. While some of these features\nare language-independent, the presence of language-specific features remains\nunderexplored.

We propose a framework, inspired\nby open-ended evolutionary theory, to reconsider these three \"dogmas.\" We\nrevisit each assumption and address related concerns raised alongside them. To\nmake our arguments relevant to RL as a model of biological learning, we first\nestablish that evolutionary dynamics can plausibly operate within living brains\nover an individual's lifetime, and are not confined to cross-generational\nprocesses. We begin by revisiting the second dogma, drawing on evolutionary\ninsights to enrich the \"adaptation-rather-than-search\" view of learning. We\nthen address the third dogma regarding the limits of the reward hypothesis,\nusing analogies from evolutionary fitness to illuminate the scalar reward vs.\nmulti-objective debate. After discussing practical implications for exploration\nin RL, we turn to the first--and arguably most fundamental--issue: the absence\nof a formal account of agency. We argue that unlike the other two problems, the\nevolutionary paradigm alone cannot resolve the agency question, though it\ngestures in a productive direction.

However, these\nmodels often struggle with capturing fine-grained semantic information, such as\nthe precise identification and analysis of object keypoints. Keypoints, as\nstructure-aware, pixel-level, and compact representations of objects,\nparticularly articulated ones, play a crucial role in applications such as\nfine-grained image analysis, object retrieval, and behavior recognition. In\nthis paper, we propose KptLLM++, a novel multimodal large language model that\nspecifically designed for generic keypoint comprehension through the\nintegration of diverse input modalities guided by user-defined instructions. By\nunifying keypoint detection across varied contexts, KptLLM++ establishes itself\nas an advanced interface, fostering more effective human-AI collaboration. The\nmodel is built upon a novel identify-then-detect paradigm, which first\ninterprets keypoint semantics and subsequently localizes their precise\npositions through a structured chain-of-thought reasoning mechanism. To push\nthe boundaries of performance, we have scaled up the training dataset to over\n500K samples, encompassing diverse objects, keypoint categories, image styles,\nand scenarios with complex occlusions. This extensive scaling enables KptLLM++\nto unlock its potential, achieving remarkable accuracy and generalization.\nComprehensive experiments on multiple keypoint detection benchmarks demonstrate\nits state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its potential as a unified\nsolution for fine-grained image understanding and its transformative\nimplications for human-AI interaction.", "AI": {"tldr": "KptLLM++\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u6307\u4ee4\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u5bf9\u8c61\u5173\u952e\u70b9\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u800c\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u3001\u5bf9\u8c61\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "KptLLM++\u91c7\u7528\u2018\u5148\u8bc6\u522b\u540e\u68c0\u6d4b\u2019\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u6790\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u8bed\u4e49\u5e76\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5176\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6269\u5c55\u81f350\u4e07\u6837\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cKptLLM++\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "KptLLM++\u4e3a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

Learning a scene representation for multiple modalities\nenhances comprehension of the physical world. However, modality conflicts,\narising from inherent distinctions among different modalities, present two\ncritical challenges: property disparity and granularity disparity. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a general framework, MMOne, to represent multiple\nmodalities in one scene, which can be readily extended to additional\nmodalities. Specifically, a modality modeling module with a novel modality\nindicator is proposed to capture the unique properties of each modality.\nAdditionally, we design a multimodal decomposition mechanism to separate\nmulti-modal Gaussians into single-modal Gaussians based on modality\ndifferences.

Recent studies reveal that the goal of long\nvideo generation tasks is not only to extend video duration but also to\naccurately express richer narrative content within longer videos. However, due\nto the lack of evaluation benchmarks specifically designed for long video\ngeneration models, the current assessment of these models primarily relies on\nbenchmarks with simple narrative prompts (e.g., VBench). To the best of our\nknowledge, our proposed NarrLV is the first benchmark to comprehensively\nevaluate the Narrative expression capabilities of Long Video generation models.\nInspired by film narrative theory, (i) we first introduce the basic narrative\nunit maintaining continuous visual presentation in videos as Temporal Narrative\nAtom (TNA), and use its count to quantitatively measure narrative richness.\nGuided by three key film narrative elements influencing TNA changes, we\nconstruct an automatic prompt generation pipeline capable of producing\nevaluation prompts with a flexibly expandable number of TNAs.

To address this limitation, we\npropose a fairness-based grouping approach for continuous (possibly\nmultidimensional) sensitive attributes.

Our empirical results on both CelebA and FFHQ, leveraging\nthe skin tone as predicted by an industrial proprietary algorithm, show that\nthe proposed segmentation uncovers more nuanced patterns of discrimination than\npreviously reported, and that these findings remain stable across datasets for\na given model.

However, the scarcity of smoke image\ndata from forest fires is one of the significant factors hindering the\ndetection of forest fire smoke. Image generation models offer a promising\nsolution for synthesizing realistic smoke images. However, current inpainting\nmodels exhibit limitations in generating high-quality smoke representations,\nparticularly manifesting as inconsistencies between synthesized smoke and\nbackground contexts. To solve these problems, we proposed a comprehensive\nframework for generating forest fire smoke images. Firstly, we employed the\npre-trained segmentation model and the multimodal model to obtain smoke masks\nand image captions.Then, to address the insufficient utilization of masks and\nmasked images by inpainting models, we introduced a network architecture guided\nby mask and masked image features. We also proposed a new loss function, the\nmask random difference loss, which enhances the consistency of the generated\neffects around the mask by randomly expanding and eroding the mask\nedges.Finally, to generate a smoke image dataset using random masks for\nsubsequent detection tasks, we incorporated smoke characteristics and use a\nmultimodal large language model as a filtering tool to select diverse and\nreasonable smoke images, thereby improving the quality of the synthetic\ndataset. Experiments showed that our generated smoke images are realistic and\ndiverse, and effectively enhance the performance of forest fire smoke detection\nmodels.

The method operates in three stages:\ni) The CNN model processes the MFI data to predict ($\\ell/z_o$), where $\\ell$\nis the wire length and $z_o$ is the wire's vertical depth beneath the magnetic\nsensors and classify segment type ($c$). ii) By leveraging\nspatial-physics-based constraints, the routine provides initial estimates for\nthe position ($x_o$, $y_o$, $z_o$), length ($\\ell$), current ($I$), and current\nflow direction (positive or negative) of the current segment. iii) An optimizer\nthen adjusts these five parameters ($x_o$, $y_o$, $z_o$, $\\ell$, $I$) to\nminimize the difference between the reconstructed MFI and the actual MFI. The\nresults demonstrate that the 3D MIR method accurately recovers 3D information\nwith high precision, setting a new benchmark for magnetic image reconstruction\nin semiconductor packaging. This method highlights the potential of combining\nDL and physics-driven optimization in practical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a3D MIR\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4ece\u78c1\u573a\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u5c01\u88c5\u4e2d\u76843D\u7535\u6d41\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u5c01\u88c5\u4e2d\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u6062\u590d3D\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u975e\u7834\u574f\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08NDT\uff09\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7535\u8def\u7f3a\u9677\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "3D MIR\u5206\u4e3a\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a1) CNN\u5904\u7406\u78c1\u573a\u56fe\u50cf\u9884\u6d4b\u53c2\u6570\uff1b2) \u5229\u7528\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u63d0\u4f9b\u521d\u59cb\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b3) \u4f18\u5316\u5668\u8c03\u6574\u53c2\u6570\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "result": "3D MIR\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6062\u590d3D\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4e3a\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u5c01\u88c5\u4e2d\u7684\u78c1\u573a\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e86\u65b0\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7269\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

This lack of omni datasets and lightweight,\ncapable models hampers progress in fine grained, multimodal video\nunderstanding. To address these challenges, we introduce UGC-VideoCap, a new\nbenchmark and model framework specifically designed for detailed omnimodal\ncaptioning of short form user-generated videos.

Results show that 3C-FBI achieves state-of-the-art\naccuracy (Jaccard index 0.896) while maintaining real-time performance (40.3\nfps), significantly outperforming classical methods like RCD (6.8 fps) on a\nstandard CPU (i7-10875H). It maintains near-perfect accuracy (Jaccard almost\n1.0) at high resolutions (480x480) and reliable performance (Jaccard higher\nthan 0.95) down to 160x160 with up to 20% outliers.\n  In extensive synthetic testing, 3C-FBI achieves a mean Jaccard Index of 0.989\nacross contamination levels, comparable to modern methods like Qi et al. (2024,\n0.991), and surpassing RHT (0.964).

The resulting data are used to extract\nfuzzy partitions and generate membership functions that reflect real-world\nperceptual uncertainty.

Traditional methods relying on\nhardware sensors like LiDAR are often limited by high costs, low resolution,\nand environmental sensitivity, limiting their applicability in real-world\nscenarios. Recent advances in vision-based methods offer a promising\nalternative, yet they face challenges in generalization and stability due to\neither the low-capacity model architectures or the reliance on domain-specific\nand small-scale datasets. The emergence of scaling laws and foundation models\nin other domains has inspired the development of \"depth foundation models\":\ndeep neural networks trained on large datasets with strong zero-shot\ngeneralization capabilities. This paper surveys the evolution of deep learning\narchitectures and paradigms for depth estimation across the monocular, stereo,\nmulti-view, and monocular video settings. We explore the potential of these\nmodels to address existing challenges and provide a comprehensive overview of\nlarge-scale datasets that can facilitate their development.
