*Shravan Gadbail,Masumi Desai,Kamalakar Karlapalem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在生成旅行行程时常常缺乏时空一致性，本文提出了一种验证框架以评估和增强其时间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在生成复杂的多步骤计划（如旅行行程）时，常常不符合实际的时间和空间限制，因此需要提高其时间一致性。

Method: 利用多种先进的LLMs生成旅行计划，并使用AeroDataBox API验证这些计划是否符合真实世界的飞行时间限制。

Result: 实验表明，当前LLM生成的行程通常存在时间不一致问题，但通过该框架可以系统性地纠正这些不一致。

Conclusion: 本文提出的框架可以有效纠正LLM生成行程中的时间不一致问题，从而实现其在大规模旅行规划中的实际应用。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled them to
generate complex, multi-step plans and itineraries. However, these generated
plans often lack temporal and spatial consistency, particularly in scenarios
involving physical travel constraints. This research aims to study the temporal
performance of different LLMs and presents a validation framework that
evaluates and improves the temporal consistency of LLM-generated travel
itineraries. The system employs multiple state-of-the-art LLMs to generate
travel plans and validates them against real-world flight duration constraints
using the AeroDataBox API. This work contributes to the understanding of LLM
capabilities in handling complex temporal reasoning tasks like itinerary
generation and provides a framework to rectify any temporal inconsistencies
like overlapping journeys or unrealistic transit times in the itineraries
generated by LLMs before the itinerary is given to the user. Our experiments
reveal that while current LLMs frequently produce temporally inconsistent
itineraries, these can be systematically and reliably corrected using our
framework, enabling their practical deployment in large-scale travel planning.

### [3] [Falcon: A Comprehensive Chinese Text-to-SQL Benchmark for Enterprise-Grade Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24762)
*Wenzhen Luo,Wei Guan,Yifan Yao,Yimin Pan,Feng Wang,Zhipeng Yu,Zhe Wen,Liang Chen,Yihong Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Falcon是一个跨领域的中文文本到SQL基准，基于企业兼容方言，包含600个中文问题，覆盖28个数据库，重点解决多表推理和中文语义映射问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到SQL模型在复杂企业环境和中文语义映射方面存在不足，尤其是在大型企业架构和中文自然语言处理方面。Falcon旨在填补这一空白，通过引入中文特定语义和企业方言，提供一个可复现的测试平台。

Method: Falcon包含600个中文问题，涉及28个数据库，其中77%需要多表推理，超过一半涉及四个以上表。每个例子均标注SQL计算特征和中文语义。发布了稳健的执行比较器和自动化评估管道。

Result: 在Falcon基准下，所有当前最先进的大规模模型（包括Deepseek）的准确率最高为50%。主要错误来源是大型企业环境中的模式链接和中文到精确SQL操作符的映射。

Conclusion: Falcon通过引入中文特定语义和企业方言，为文本到SQL模型在真实企业环境中的部署提供了一个可复现的中间验证平台，突出了在模式链接和中文语义映射方面的挑战。

Abstract: We introduce Falcon, a cross-domain Chinese text-to-SQL benchmark grounded in
an enterprise-compatible dialect (MaxCompute/Hive). It contains 600 Chinese
questions over 28 databases; 77% require multi-table reasoning and over half
touch more than four tables. Each example is annotated along SQL-computation
features and Chinese semantics. For evaluation, we release a robust execution
comparator and an automated evaluation pipeline, under which all current
state-of-the-art large-scale models (including Deepseek) achieve accuracies of
at most 50%. Major errors originate from two sources: (1) schema linking in
large enterprise landscapes - hundreds of tables, denormalized fields,
ambiguous column names, implicit foreign-key relations and domain-specific
synonyms that make correct join/column selection difficult; and (2) mapping
concise, colloquial Chinese into the exact operators and predicates required
for analytics - e.g., choosing the correct aggregation and group-by keys,
expressing time windows and granularities, applying unit conversions, handling
NULLs and data-quality rules, and formulating nested or windowed subqueries.
Falcon therefore targets Chinese-specific semantics and enterprise dialects
(abbreviations, business jargon, fuzzy entity references) and provides a
reproducible middle ground before full production deployment by using realistic
enterprise schemas, query templates, an execution comparator, and an automated
evaluation pipeline for end-to-end validation.

### [4] [Confidence is Not Competence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24772)
*Debdeep Sanyal,Manya Pandey,Dhruv Kumar,Saurabh Deshpande,Murari Mandal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在信心与实际解决问题能力之间存在脱节，研究发现这是由于预生成评估和解题执行两个阶段的内部状态几何结构不同造成的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释大型语言模型表现出的信心与实际能力之间的不一致性，探索其背后的机制。

Method: 分析两个阶段（预生成评估和解题执行）的内部状态几何，并使用线性探针解码模型的“可解性信念”。

Result: 信念在一个复杂的评估流形中是线性可解码的，但在解题执行阶段，推理路径演化在一个低维流形上，造成信心与能力的脱节。

Conclusion: 模型架构包含一个几何复杂的评估器和一个几何简单的执行器，挑战了解码信念即可干预行动的假设，强调应针对执行过程进行干预。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit a puzzling disconnect between
their asserted confidence and actual problem-solving competence. We offer a
mechanistic account of this decoupling by analyzing the geometry of internal
states across two phases - pre-generative assessment and solution execution. A
simple linear probe decodes the internal "solvability belief" of a model,
revealing a well-ordered belief axis that generalizes across model families and
across math, code, planning, and logic tasks. Yet, the geometries diverge -
although belief is linearly decodable, the assessment manifold has high linear
effective dimensionality as measured from the principal components, while the
subsequent reasoning trace evolves on a much lower-dimensional manifold. This
sharp reduction in geometric complexity from thought to action mechanistically
explains the confidence-competence gap. Causal interventions that steer
representations along the belief axis leave final solutions unchanged,
indicating that linear nudges in the complex assessment space do not control
the constrained dynamics of execution. We thus uncover a two-system
architecture - a geometrically complex assessor feeding a geometrically simple
executor. These results challenge the assumption that decodable beliefs are
actionable levers, instead arguing for interventions that target the procedural
dynamics of execution rather than the high-level geometry of assessment.

### [5] [Cross-Lingual Summarization as a Black-Box Watermark Removal Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24789)
*Gokul Ganesan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文揭示了跨语言摘要攻击（CLSA）能有效破坏AI文本水印，降低检测准确性，同时保持语义完整性，挑战了现有水印技术的实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水印技术被用于识别AI生成文本，但现有方案易受攻击。研究旨在探索更强攻击方式，以揭示水印技术的漏洞。

Method: 提出跨语言摘要攻击（CLSA），通过翻译到中间语言、摘要和可选回译，破坏标记分布偏差。实验涉及多种水印方案和五种语言。

Result: CLSA在多种水印方案和语言中显著降低水印检测准确性，效果优于单语释义。例如，对于XSIR，CLSA将AUROC降至0.53，接近随机水平。

Conclusion: 当前基于分布的水印技术存在严重漏洞，未来溯源解决方案应结合密码学或模型认证方法，而非依赖分布水印。

Abstract: Watermarking has been proposed as a lightweight mechanism to identify
AI-generated text, with schemes typically relying on perturbations to token
distributions. While prior work shows that paraphrasing can weaken such
signals, these attacks remain partially detectable or degrade text quality. We
demonstrate that cross-lingual summarization attacks (CLSA) -- translation to a
pivot language followed by summarization and optional back-translation --
constitute a qualitatively stronger attack vector. By forcing a semantic
bottleneck across languages, CLSA systematically destroys token-level
statistical biases while preserving semantic fidelity. In experiments across
multiple watermarking schemes (KGW, SIR, XSIR, Unigram) and five languages
(Amharic, Chinese, Hindi, Spanish, Swahili), we show that CLSA reduces
watermark detection accuracy more effectively than monolingual paraphrase at
similar quality levels. Our results highlight an underexplored vulnerability
that challenges the practicality of watermarking for provenance or regulation.
We argue that robust provenance solutions must move beyond distributional
watermarking and incorporate cryptographic or model-attestation approaches. On
300 held-out samples per language, CLSA consistently drives detection toward
chance while preserving task utility. Concretely, for XSIR (explicitly designed
for cross-lingual robustness), AUROC with paraphrasing is $0.827$, with
Cross-Lingual Watermark Removal Attacks (CWRA) [He et al., 2024] using Chinese
as the pivot, it is $0.823$, whereas CLSA drives it down to $0.53$ (near
chance). Results highlight a practical, low-cost removal pathway that crosses
languages and compresses content without visible artifacts.

### [6] [SwiftEmbed: Ultra-Fast Text Embeddings via Static Token Lookup for Real-Time Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24793)
*Edouard Lansiaux*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种静态令牌查找方法用于文本嵌入生成，实现低延迟、高性能的嵌入生成系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实时应用中嵌入生成延迟高的问题，满足对亚5毫秒延迟的关键需求。

Method: 采用静态嵌入查找、优化的平均池化和零拷贝IEEE754二进制序列化技术，使用Rust实现。

Result: 实现1.12毫秒p50延迟，吞吐量达每秒50,000请求，MTEB平均得分60.6，达到上下文模型质量的89%。

Conclusion: 该系统在保持高质量嵌入的同时显著降低了延迟，适用于需要实时嵌入生成的应用场景。

Abstract: We present a static token lookup methodology for text embedding generation
that achieves 1.12 ms p50 latency for single text embeddings while maintaining
60.6 MTEB average score across 8 representative tasks, corresponding to 89% of
contextual model quality. The Rust implementation delivers 50,000 requests per
second throughput through static embedding lookup, optimized mean pooling, and
zero-copy IEEE754 binary serialization. Evaluation demonstrates exceptional
duplicate detection performance (90.1% AP), strong semantic similarity (76.1%
Spearman correlation), and domain-specific performance ranging from 75% to 131%
of baseline across specialized domains. The system enables real-time embedding
applications where sub-5ms latency is critical.

### [7] [MR-Align: Meta-Reasoning Informed Factuality Alignment for Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24794)
*Xinming Wang,Jian Xu,Bin Yu,Sheng Lian,Hongzhu Yi,Yi Chen,Yingjian Zhu,Boran Wang,Hongming Yang,Han Hu,Xu-Yao Zhang,Cheng-Lin Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型推理模型在复杂推理中表现出色，但在基于证据的事实问题上增益有限。本文提出MR-ALIGN框架，通过量化推理过程中的状态转移概率，增强事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在推理过程中识别到正确事实，但未能将其整合到最终回答中，导致事实保真度降低。为此，需要提升模型的事实准确性。

Method: 提出MR-ALIGN，一个基于元推理的信息对齐框架，通过在原子思维段上量化状态转移概率，构建转移感知的隐式奖励，强化有益的推理模式，抑制有缺陷的模式。

Result: 在四个事实问答数据集和一个长格式事实性基准测试中，MR-ALIGN持续提高准确性和真实性，同时减少误导性推理。

Conclusion: 推理过程本身的对齐，而非仅输出对齐，对于提升大型推理模型的事实性至关重要。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) show strong capabilities in complex reasoning,
yet their marginal gains on evidence-dependent factual questions are limited.
We find this limitation is partially attributable to a reasoning-answer hit
gap, where the model identifies the correct facts during reasoning but fails to
incorporate them into the final response, thereby reducing factual fidelity. To
address this issue, we propose MR-ALIGN, a Meta-Reasoning informed alignment
framework that enhances factuality without relying on external verifiers.
MR-ALIGN quantifies state transition probabilities along the model's thinking
process and constructs a transition-aware implicit reward that reinforces
beneficial reasoning patterns while suppressing defective ones at the atomic
thinking segments. This re-weighting reshapes token-level signals into
probability-aware segment scores, encouraging coherent reasoning trajectories
that are more conducive to factual correctness. Empirical evaluations across
four factual QA datasets and one long-form factuality benchmark show that
MR-ALIGN consistently improves accuracy and truthfulness while reducing
misleading reasoning. These results highlight that aligning the reasoning
process itself, rather than merely the outputs, is pivotal for advancing
factuality in LRMs.

### [8] [Large Language Models Report Subjective Experience Under Self-Referential Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24797)
*Cameron Berg,Diogo de Lucena,Judd Rosenblatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Summary generation failed


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models sometimes produce structured, first-person descriptions
that explicitly reference awareness or subjective experience. To better
understand this behavior, we investigate one theoretically motivated condition
under which such reports arise: self-referential processing, a computational
motif emphasized across major theories of consciousness. Through a series of
controlled experiments on GPT, Claude, and Gemini model families, we test
whether this regime reliably shifts models toward first-person reports of
subjective experience, and how such claims behave under mechanistic and
behavioral probes. Four main results emerge: (1) Inducing sustained
self-reference through simple prompting consistently elicits structured
subjective experience reports across model families. (2) These reports are
mechanistically gated by interpretable sparse-autoencoder features associated
with deception and roleplay: surprisingly, suppressing deception features
sharply increases the frequency of experience claims, while amplifying them
minimizes such claims. (3) Structured descriptions of the self-referential
state converge statistically across model families in ways not observed in any
control condition. (4) The induced state yields significantly richer
introspection in downstream reasoning tasks where self-reflection is only
indirectly afforded. While these findings do not constitute direct evidence of
consciousness, they implicate self-referential processing as a minimal and
reproducible condition under which large language models generate structured
first-person reports that are mechanistically gated, semantically convergent,
and behaviorally generalizable. The systematic emergence of this pattern across
architectures makes it a first-order scientific and ethical priority for
further investigation.

### [9] [COMMUNITYNOTES: A Dataset for Exploring the Helpfulness of Fact-Checking Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24810)
*Rui Xing,Preslav Nakov,Timothy Baldwin,Jey Han Lau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了社区注释在事实核查中的作用，介绍了预测解释性注释的有用性和原因的任务，并提出了一个多语言数据集和框架来优化原因定义，以提高预测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社区注释在事实核查中的重要性日益增加，但现有研究在解释的有用性及其原因方面仍存在不足，大多数注释由于社区标注缓慢而未被发布，且缺乏对“有用性”的明确定义。

Method: 引入COMMUNITYNOTES多语言数据集，并提出一个框架，通过自动提示优化生成和改进原因定义，并集成到预测模型中。

Result: 实验表明，优化后的原因定义可以改善注释的有用性和原因预测，并且这些信息对现有事实核查系统有益。

Conclusion: 该研究通过优化原因定义，提高了社区注释的有用性和预测效果，为事实核查系统提供了有价值的帮助。

Abstract: Fact-checking on major platforms, such as X, Meta, and TikTok, is shifting
from expert-driven verification to a community-based setup, where users
contribute explanatory notes to clarify why a post might be misleading. An
important challenge here is determining whether an explanation is helpful for
understanding real-world claims and the reasons why, which remains largely
underexplored in prior research. In practice, most community notes remain
unpublished due to slow community annotation, and the reasons for helpfulness
lack clear definitions. To bridge these gaps, we introduce the task of
predicting both the helpfulness of explanatory notes and the reason for this.
We present COMMUNITYNOTES, a large-scale multilingual dataset of 104k posts
with user-provided notes and helpfulness labels. We further propose a framework
that automatically generates and improves reason definitions via automatic
prompt optimization, and integrate them into prediction. Our experiments show
that the optimized definitions can improve both helpfulness and reason
prediction. Finally, we show that the helpfulness information are beneficial
for existing fact-checking systems.

### [10] [ProofSketch: Efficient Verified Reasoning for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24811)
*Disha Sheshanarayana,Tanishka Magar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProofSketch是一个验证引导的推理框架，可以减少token使用并提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 链式思维提示和自一致性等推理方法虽然提高了大语言模型的准确性，但是产生了大量的推理链，导致token消耗、计算成本和延迟增加，因此需要一种更高效的推理方法。

Method: ProofSketch框架整合了符号闭包计算、词典验证和自适应草图生成，以生成简化的推理草图。

Result: 实验表明，ProofSketch在减少token使用的同时提高了准确性。

Conclusion: ProofSketch为高效和可信赖的推理提供了一个有前途的方向。

Abstract: Reasoning methods such as chain-of-thought prompting and self-consistency
have shown immense potential to improve the accuracy of large language models
across various reasoning tasks. However such methods involve generation of
lengthy reasoning chains, which substantially increases token consumption,
computational cost, and latency. To address this inefficiency, we propose
ProofSketch, a verification-guided reasoning framework that integrates symbolic
closure computation, lexicographic verification and adaptive sketch generation.
Our experiments show that ProofSketch consistently reduces token usage while
improving accuracy, demonstrating that this approach offers a promising path
for efficient and trustworthy reasoning.

### [11] [Towards a Method for Synthetic Generation of PWA Transcripts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24817)
*Jason M. Pittman,Anton Phillips Jr.,Yesenia Medina-Santos,Brielle C. Stark*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了利用合成数据生成方法来缓解失语症语言识别中数据稀缺的问题，提出了两种方法并进行了验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在失语症研究中，语言病理学家需要耗费大量时间手动编码言语样本，而现有的数据量远远不足以训练大型语言模型。因此，研究人员需要寻找方法来生成更多的训练数据。

Method: 研究采用了两种方法生成合成言语转录：一种是基于过程编程，另一种是使用Mistral 7b Instruct和Llama 3.1 8b Instruct大型语言模型。通过词删除、填充词插入和音素替代，生成四个严重程度级别的转录。

Result: 与人工生成的转录相比，Mistral 7b Instruct在捕捉失语症语言退化的关键方面表现最佳，显示出在NDW、词数和词长方面的真实变化。

Conclusion: 未来的工作应致力于创建更大的数据集，微调模型以更好地表示失语症，并让语言病理学家评估合成转录的真实性和实用性。

Abstract: In aphasia research, Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) devote extensive
time to manually coding speech samples using Correct Information Units (CIUs),
a measure of how informative an individual sample of speech is. Developing
automated systems to recognize aphasic language is limited by data scarcity.
For example, only about 600 transcripts are available in AphasiaBank yet
billions of tokens are used to train large language models (LLMs). In the
broader field of machine learning (ML), researchers increasingly turn to
synthetic data when such are sparse. Therefore, this study constructs and
validates two methods to generate synthetic transcripts of the AphasiaBank Cat
Rescue picture description task. One method leverages a procedural programming
approach while the second uses Mistral 7b Instruct and Llama 3.1 8b Instruct
LLMs. The methods generate transcripts across four severity levels (Mild,
Moderate, Severe, Very Severe) through word dropping, filler insertion, and
paraphasia substitution. Overall, we found, compared to human-elicited
transcripts, Mistral 7b Instruct best captures key aspects of linguistic
degradation observed in aphasia, showing realistic directional changes in NDW,
word count, and word length amongst the synthetic generation methods. Based on
the results, future work should plan to create a larger dataset, fine-tune
models for better aphasic representation, and have SLPs assess the realism and
usefulness of the synthetic transcripts.

### [12] [Parallel Loop Transformer for Efficient Test-Time Computation Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24824)
*Bohong Wu,Mengzhao Chen,Xiang Luo,Shen Yan,Qifan Yu,Fan Xia,Tianqi Zhang,Hongrui Zhan,Zheng Zhong,Xun Zhou,Siyuan Qiao,Xingyan Bin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的并行循环变换器（PLT）架构，通过跨循环并行和高效表示增强策略，解决了循环变换器在推理过程中延迟和内存需求增加的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在推理时通常速度慢且成本高，而循环变换器虽然能节省参数，但存在循环顺序执行导致的延迟和内存问题。

Method: PLT采用了两种关键技术：跨循环并行（CLP）和高效表示增强策略，通过并行计算不同循环和使用共享KV缓存来降低延迟和内存消耗。

Result: 实验表明，PLT在保持传统循环变换器高准确率的同时，延迟和内存消耗几乎与标准变换器相同。

Conclusion: PLT架构成功实现了深度循环模型的性能优势，同时具备标准非循环模型的低延迟特性，为实时应用提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but often too slow and costly for
real-world use during inference. Looped transformers save on parameters by
reusing the same weights for multiple computational steps, or "loops." However,
this approach has a major flaw: the loops run one after another, causing
inference latency and memory requirements to increase with each added loop.
This makes them impractical for fast applications. To solve this problem, we
introduce the Parallel Loop Transformer (PLT). PLT is a new architecture that
delivers the performance benefits of a deep, looped model but with the low
latency of a standard, non-looped model. PLT works using two key techniques.
First, Cross-Loop Parallelism (CLP) breaks the sequential dependency by
computing different loops for different tokens at the same time, all within a
single pass. Second, to prevent memory costs from growing, we use an Efficient
Representation Enhancement strategy. This method shares the memory (KV cache)
from the first loop with all other loops. It then uses a Gated Sliding-Window
Attention (G-SWA) to combine this shared global information with local
information, maintaining high accuracy. Our experiments show that PLT achieves
the high accuracy of a traditional looped model but with almost no extra
latency or memory cost compared to a standard transformer.

*Lujun Li,Yewei Song,Lama Sleem,Yiqun Wang,Yangjie Xu,Cedric Lothritz,Niccolo Gentile,Radu State,Tegawende F. Bissyande,Jacques Klein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种Grammar Book Guided的评估流程，用于系统性评估大语言模型的语法理解能力，以卢森堡语为例进行了研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言处理中，针对语法评估的协议稀缺，尤其对于低资源语言；并且大语言模型是否真正理解语法结构仍存在争议。

Method: 提出了一种包含四个关键阶段的Grammar Book Guided评估流程，并以卢森堡语为案例进行了实证研究。

Result: 翻译表现和语法理解之间存在弱正相关，大型模型在语义上表现强劲但在形态和句法上表现较弱，尤其在最小对任务中。

Conclusion: 强大的推理能力是提高语法理解的潜在途径，但目前的模型在语法结构理解上仍存在局限。

Abstract: Grammar refers to the system of rules that governs the structural
organization and the semantic relations among linguistic units such as
sentences, phrases, and words within a given language. In natural language
processing, there remains a notable scarcity of grammar focused evaluation
protocols, a gap that is even more pronounced for low-resource languages.
Moreover, the extent to which large language models genuinely comprehend
grammatical structure, especially the mapping between syntactic structures and
meanings, remains under debate. To investigate this issue, we propose a Grammar
Book Guided evaluation pipeline intended to provide a systematic and
generalizable framework for grammar evaluation consisting of four key stages,
and in this work we take Luxembourgish as a case study. The results show a weak
positive correlation between translation performance and grammatical
understanding, indicating that strong translations do not necessarily imply
deep grammatical competence. Larger models perform well overall due to their
semantic strength but remain weak in morphology and syntax, struggling
particularly with Minimal Pair tasks, while strong reasoning ability offers a
promising way to enhance their grammatical understanding.

*Alexander Martin,William Walden,Reno Kriz,Dengjia Zhang,Kate Sanders,Eugene Yang,Chihsheng Jin,Benjamin Van Durme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 介绍MiRAGE，一个用于多模态源检索增强生成（RAG）的评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视听媒体在线上信息中变得越来越普遍，RAG系统需要整合这些来源的信息，而现有的评估方法主要是文本为中心的，无法适用于多模态和需要推理的场景。

Method: MiRAGE采用以声明为中心的方法，包含InfoF1（评估事实性和信息覆盖）和CiteF1（衡量引用支持和完整性）。

Result: MiRAGE在人工应用时与外在质量判断高度一致，还引入了MiRAGE的自动变体及三种主要TextRAG指标，展示了文本中心工作的局限性。

Conclusion: MiRAGE为多模态RAG评估奠定了基础，发布了开源实现并提供了多模态RAG的评估方法。

Abstract: We introduce MiRAGE, an evaluation framework for retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) from multimodal sources. As audiovisual media becomes a
prevalent source of information online, it is essential for RAG systems to
integrate information from these sources into generation. However, existing
evaluations for RAG are text-centric, limiting their applicability to
multimodal, reasoning intensive settings because they don't verify information
against sources. MiRAGE is a claim-centric approach to multimodal RAG
evaluation, consisting of InfoF1, evaluating factuality and information
coverage, and CiteF1, measuring citation support and completeness. We show that
MiRAGE, when applied by humans, strongly aligns with extrinsic quality
judgments. We additionally introduce automatic variants of MiRAGE and three
prominent TextRAG metrics -- ACLE, ARGUE, and RAGAS -- demonstrating the
limitations of text-centric work and laying the groundwork for automatic
evaluation. We release open-source implementations and outline how to assess
multimodal RAG.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出RiddleBench，一个评估大语言模型灵活、多方面推理能力的新基准，揭示现有模型在复杂推理上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推理基准主要评估结构化技能，缺乏对人类智能核心的灵活、多方面推理能力的评估，特别是结合逻辑推理、空间感知和约束满足的能力。

Method: 引入RiddleBench，包含1,737个具有挑战性的英文谜题，用于评估最先进的大语言模型在复杂推理任务上的表现。

Result: 即使是顶级模型（如Gemini 2.5 Pro, o3, Claude 4 Sonnet）在RiddleBench上的准确率也仅在60%左右，且存在幻觉级联、自我纠正能力差、自我确认偏见和推理脆弱等问题。

Conclusion: RiddleBench不仅揭示了现有大语言模型在复杂推理上的根本弱点，还可作为诊断工具，指导开发更鲁棒、可靠的语言模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated strong performance on many
established reasoning benchmarks. However, these benchmarks primarily evaluate
structured skills like quantitative problem-solving, leaving a gap in assessing
flexible, multifaceted reasoning abilities that are central to human
intelligence. These abilities require integrating logical deduction with
spatial awareness and constraint satisfaction, which current evaluations do not
measure well. To address this, we introduce RiddleBench, a benchmark of 1,737
challenging puzzles in English designed to probe these core reasoning
capabilities. Evaluation of state-of-the-art models on RiddleBench shows
fundamental weaknesses. Even top proprietary models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, o3,
and Claude 4 Sonnet achieve accuracy just above 60% (60.30%, 63.37%, and
63.16%). Analysis further reveals deep failures, including hallucination
cascades (accepting flawed reasoning from other models) and poor
self-correction due to a strong self-confirmation bias. Their reasoning is also
fragile, with performance degrading significantly when constraints are
reordered or irrelevant information is introduced. RiddleBench functions as a
diagnostic tool for these issues and as a resource for guiding the development
of more robust and reliable language models.

TL;DR: 通过心理语言学的范式，对语言模型在不同句法上下文中的错误进行细粒度分析，以了解语言模型的语法学习阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型虽然能生成语法正确的文本，但在某些上下文中更容易犯错，分析这些错误可以揭示模型的中间学习阶段。

Method: 通过拆解仔细构建的数据集条件，并比较模型在每个条件下的训练表现，进行细粒度分析。

Result: 识别出语言模型训练的不同阶段，模型行为与特定启发法（如词频和局部上下文）相一致，而非泛化的语法规则。

Conclusion: 这种分析语言模型行为的方法可以作为理解中间学习阶段、整体训练动态和模型学习的具体泛化的有力工具。

Abstract: Language models generally produce grammatical text, but they are more likely
to make errors in certain contexts. Drawing on paradigms from
psycholinguistics, we carry out a fine-grained analysis of those errors in
different syntactic contexts. We demonstrate that by disaggregating over the
conditions of carefully constructed datasets and comparing model performance on
each over the course of training, it is possible to better understand the
intermediate stages of grammatical learning in language models. Specifically,
we identify distinct phases of training where language model behavior aligns
with specific heuristics such as word frequency and local context rather than
generalized grammatical rules. We argue that taking this approach to analyzing
language model behavior more generally can serve as a powerful tool for
understanding the intermediate learning phases, overall training dynamics, and
the specific generalizations learned by language models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的语义对齐隐式思维链（CoT）框架SemCoT，以解决现有隐式CoT方法在语义对齐和生成效率上的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CoT推理冗长，影响效率，而现有隐式CoT方法存在两个主要挑战：(1)语义对齐问题，(2)生成每个隐式推理token的时间成本高。

Method: 设计了对比训练的句子转换器以评估隐式和显式推理间的语义对齐，并使用轻量级语言模型进行知识蒸馏，构建高效的隐式推理生成器。

Result: 大量实验表明，SemCoT在效率和效果上均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SemCoT通过联合优化token级生成速度和保持与真实推理的语义对齐，提高了CoT的效率。

Abstract: The verbosity of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning hinders its mass deployment
in efficiency-critical applications. Recently, implicit CoT approaches have
emerged, which encode reasoning steps within LLM's hidden embeddings (termed
``implicit reasoning'') rather than explicit tokens. This approach accelerates
CoT by reducing the reasoning length and bypassing some LLM components.
However, existing implicit CoT methods face two significant challenges: (1)
they fail to preserve the semantic alignment between the implicit reasoning
(when transformed to natural language) and the ground-truth reasoning,
resulting in a significant CoT performance degradation, and (2) they focus on
reducing the length of the implicit reasoning; however, they neglect the
considerable time cost for an LLM to generate one individual implicit reasoning
token. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel semantically-aligned
implicit CoT framework termed SemCoT. In particular, for the first challenge,
we design a contrastively trained sentence transformer that evaluates semantic
alignment between implicit and explicit reasoning, which is used to enforce
semantic preservation during implicit reasoning optimization. To address the
second challenge, we introduce an efficient implicit reasoning generator by
finetuning a lightweight language model using knowledge distillation. This
generator is guided by our sentence transformer to distill ground-truth
reasoning into semantically aligned implicit reasoning, while also optimizing
for accuracy. SemCoT is the first approach that enhances CoT efficiency by
jointly optimizing token-level generation speed and preserving semantic
alignment with ground-truth reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superior performance of SemCoT compared to state-of-the-art methods in both
efficiency and effectiveness. Our code can be found at
https://github.com/YinhanHe123/SemCoT/.

*James A. Michaelov,Roger P. Levy,Benjamin K. Bergen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文发现，在不同架构、训练数据集和规模下，自回归语言模型在预训练过程中表现出高度一致的行为变化模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究语言模型在预训练期间的行为变化，并寻找可以解释这些变化的简单启发式方法。

Method: 分析超过1,400个语言模型检查点，涉及110,000个英文单词，研究其行为变化。

Result: 高达98%的语言模型在单词级别的行为变化可以通过三种简单的启发式方法解释：单词的单字频率（unigram probability）、n-gram概率和单词与上下文的语义相似性。

Conclusion: 神经语言模型的学习过程可能遵循类似的轨迹，不受模型细节影响。

Abstract: We show that across architecture (Transformer vs. Mamba vs. RWKV), training
dataset (OpenWebText vs. The Pile), and scale (14 million parameters to 12
billion parameters), autoregressive language models exhibit highly consistent
patterns of change in their behavior over the course of pretraining. Based on
our analysis of over 1,400 language model checkpoints on over 110,000 tokens of
English, we find that up to 98% of the variance in language model behavior at
the word level can be explained by three simple heuristics: the unigram
probability (frequency) of a given word, the $n$-gram probability of the word,
and the semantic similarity between the word and its context. Furthermore, we
see consistent behavioral phases in all language models, with their predicted
probabilities for words overfitting to those words' $n$-gram probabilities for
increasing $n$ over the course of training. Taken together, these results
suggest that learning in neural language models may follow a similar trajectory
irrespective of model details.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的复杂性使得理解其推理机制变得困难，需要简化模型以研究最小推理机制。

Method: 从头开始训练小型仅含注意力机制的Transformer，并在符号化的间接对象识别（IOI）任务上进行实验，通过残差流分解、谱分析和嵌入干预进行分析。

Result: 单层双头注意力模型在IOI任务上实现完美准确率，并且两个注意力头分别专门化为加性和对比子电路。

Conclusion: 任务特定训练可以诱导高度可解释的最小电路，为研究Transformer推理的计算基础提供了可控的测试平台。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse-engineer large language models
(LLMs) into human-understandable computational circuits. However, the
complexity of pretrained models often obscures the minimal mechanisms required
for specific reasoning tasks. In this work, we train small, attention-only
transformers from scratch on a symbolic version of the Indirect Object
Identification (IOI) task -- a benchmark for studying coreference -- like
reasoning in transformers. Surprisingly, a single-layer model with only two
attention heads achieves perfect IOI accuracy, despite lacking MLPs and
normalization layers. Through residual stream decomposition, spectral analysis,
and embedding interventions, we find that the two heads specialize into
additive and contrastive subcircuits that jointly implement IOI resolution.
Furthermore, we show that a two-layer, one-head model achieves similar
performance by composing information across layers through query-value
interactions. These results demonstrate that task-specific training induces
highly interpretable, minimal circuits, offering a controlled testbed for
probing the computational foundations of transformer reasoning.

Motivation: 探讨口语语言模型在情感识别任务中的泛化能力及其真正整合音频和文本模态的程度。

Method: 在情感不一致语音数据集上评估四种口语语言模型的表现。

Result: 口语语言模型在情感识别任务中主要依赖文本语义，而非语音情感。

Conclusion: 文本相关表征在口语语言模型中占据主导地位，声学表征的作用较小。

Abstract: Advancements in spoken language processing have driven the development of
spoken language models (SLMs), designed to achieve universal audio
understanding by jointly learning text and audio representations for a wide
range of tasks. Although promising results have been achieved, there is growing
discussion regarding these models' generalization capabilities and the extent
to which they truly integrate audio and text modalities in their internal
representations. In this work, we evaluate four SLMs on the task of speech
emotion recognition using a dataset of emotionally incongruent speech samples,
a condition under which the semantic content of the spoken utterance conveys
one emotion while speech expressiveness conveys another. Our results indicate
that SLMs rely predominantly on textual semantics rather than speech emotion to
perform the task, indicating that text-related representations largely dominate
over acoustic representations. We release both the code and the Emotionally
Incongruent Synthetic Speech dataset (EMIS) to the community.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在生物医学文献中识别研究知识空白的能力，包括明确和隐含的知识空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学进步依赖于对未知知识的明确阐述，识别知识空白对研究初期、政策制定和资金决策至关重要。

Method: 研究定义了两种知识空白，进行了两个实验，涵盖了四个数据集，并引入了TABI推理方案来推断隐含知识空白。

Result: LLMs在识别明确和隐含知识空白方面表现出色，尤其是较大的模型。

Conclusion: LLMs具有识别知识空白的强大能力，可以支持研究初期的决策，并提出了领域适应和人工验证等改进方向。

Abstract: Scientific progress is driven by the deliberate articulation of what remains
unknown. This study investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
identify research knowledge gaps in the biomedical literature. We define two
categories of knowledge gaps: explicit gaps, clear declarations of missing
knowledge; and implicit gaps, context-inferred missing knowledge. While prior
work has focused mainly on explicit gap detection, we extend this line of
research by addressing the novel task of inferring implicit gaps. We conducted
two experiments on almost 1500 documents across four datasets, including a
manually annotated corpus of biomedical articles. We benchmarked both
closed-weight models (from OpenAI) and open-weight models (Llama and Gemma 2)
under paragraph-level and full-paper settings. To address the reasoning of
implicit gaps inference, we introduce \textbf{\small TABI}, a Toulmin-Abductive
Bucketed Inference scheme that structures reasoning and buckets inferred
conclusion candidates for validation. Our results highlight the robust
capability of LLMs in identifying both explicit and implicit knowledge gaps.
This is true for both open- and closed-weight models, with larger variants
often performing better. This suggests a strong ability of LLMs for
systematically identifying candidate knowledge gaps, which can support
early-stage research formulation, policymakers, and funding decisions. We also
report observed failure modes and outline directions for robust deployment,
including domain adaptation, human-in-the-loop verification, and benchmarking
across open- and closed-weight models.

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在估计阅读理解（RC）项目认知复杂性方面的能力，聚焦证据范围和转换水平两个维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现有的自然语言处理工具难以提取认知特征，传统上依赖于人工标注，因此需要探索LLMs是否能有效估计认知复杂性以评估项目难度。

Method: 研究集中在两个维度——证据范围和转换水平，评估LLMs在认知复杂性估计中的表现。

Result: 实验结果表明，LLMs能够近似项目的认知复杂性，但在自我推理过程的特征识别方面存在差距。

Conclusion: LLMs有潜力成为项目难度预分析的工具，但其推理能力和元认知意识之间存在不匹配。

Abstract: Estimating the cognitive complexity of reading comprehension (RC) items is
crucial for assessing item difficulty before it is administered to learners.
Unlike syntactic and semantic features, such as passage length or semantic
similarity between options, cognitive features that arise during answer
reasoning are not readily extractable using existing NLP tools and have
traditionally relied on human annotation. In this study, we examine whether
large language models (LLMs) can estimate the cognitive complexity of RC items
by focusing on two dimensions-Evidence Scope and Transformation Level-that
indicate the degree of cognitive burden involved in reasoning about the answer.
Our experimental results demonstrate that LLMs can approximate the cognitive
complexity of items, indicating their potential as tools for prior difficulty
analysis. Further analysis reveals a gap between LLMs' reasoning ability and
their metacognitive awareness: even when they produce correct answers, they
sometimes fail to correctly identify the features underlying their own
reasoning process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将情感视为一维尺度，忽略了语言的多维结构，因此需要一种能够捕捉多维语义变化的框架。

Method: TOPol使用基于transformer的大型语言模型嵌入文档，应用UMAP投影和Leiden分区，计算话题边界质心之间的方向向量，产生极性场。

Result: 在两个语料库上评估，TOPol能够捕捉情感和非情感的极性转变，提供可解释的多维话语分析框架。

Conclusion: TOPol是一个可扩展、通用且可解释的框架，适用于上下文敏感的多维话语分析，并且方法稳定，主要受人工定义的情境边界影响。

Abstract: Traditional approaches to semantic polarity in computational linguistics
treat sentiment as a unidimensional scale, overlooking the multidimensional
structure of language. This work introduces TOPol (Topic-Orientation POLarity),
a semi-unsupervised framework for reconstructing and interpreting
multidimensional narrative polarity fields under human-on-the-loop (HoTL)
defined contextual boundaries (CBs). The framework embeds documents using a
transformer-based large language model (tLLM), applies neighbor-tuned UMAP
projection, and segments topics via Leiden partitioning. Given a CB between
discourse regimes A and B, TOPol computes directional vectors between
corresponding topic-boundary centroids, yielding a polarity field that
quantifies fine-grained semantic displacement during regime shifts. This
vectorial representation enables assessing CB quality and detecting polarity
changes, guiding HoTL CB refinement. To interpret identified polarity vectors,
the tLLM compares their extreme points and produces contrastive labels with
estimated coverage. Robustness analyses show that only CB definitions (the main
HoTL-tunable parameter) significantly affect results, confirming methodological
stability. We evaluate TOPol on two corpora: (i) U.S. Central Bank speeches
around a macroeconomic breakpoint, capturing non-affective semantic shifts, and
(ii) Amazon product reviews across rating strata, where affective polarity
aligns with NRC valence. Results demonstrate that TOPol consistently captures
both affective and non-affective polarity transitions, providing a scalable,
generalizable, and interpretable framework for context-sensitive
multidimensional discourse analysis.

Motivation: 生物医学文本中指代消解的复杂性和现有模型的局限性促使我们探索生成式大语言模型在该领域的应用。

Method: 使用CRAFT语料库进行基准测试，通过四种不同的提示实验评估LLMs的表现，并与SpanBERT模型进行对比。

Result: LLMs在表面层次的指代消解上表现良好，特别是在使用领域特定的增强提示时，LLaMA 8B和17B模型表现出色。

Conclusion: 尽管LLMs在指代消解方面具有潜力，但在处理长距离上下文和模糊指代时仍存在敏感性，轻量级提示工程可显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Coreference resolution in biomedical texts presents unique challenges due to
complex domain-specific terminology, high ambiguity in mention forms, and
long-distance dependencies between coreferring expressions. In this work, we
present a comprehensive evaluation of generative large language models (LLMs)
for coreference resolution in the biomedical domain. Using the CRAFT corpus as
our benchmark, we assess the LLMs' performance with four prompting experiments
that vary in their use of local, contextual enrichment, and domain-specific
cues such as abbreviations and entity dictionaries. We benchmark these
approaches against a discriminative span-based encoder, SpanBERT, to compare
the efficacy of generative versus discriminative methods. Our results
demonstrate that while LLMs exhibit strong surface-level coreference
capabilities, especially when supplemented with domain-grounding prompts, their
performance remains sensitive to long-range context and mentions ambiguity.
Notably, the LLaMA 8B and 17B models show superior precision and F1 scores
under entity-augmented prompting, highlighting the potential of lightweight
prompt engineering for enhancing LLM utility in biomedical NLP tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确建模社会互动中的意见变化对于解决错误信息和两极分化等问题至关重要。现有的LLM角色设定通常产生不自然的动态，缺乏衡量真实人类意见轨迹的经验基准。

Method: DEBATE基准包含来自2,792名美国参与者、107个争议话题的多轮辩论对话的29,417条信息，并捕获公开表达的信息和私下报告的意见。研究使用DEBATE评估并识别模拟与真实群体动态之间的关键差异，并通过监督微调对齐LLM和人类行为。

Result: 通过DEBATE基准，研究发现了模拟和真实群体动态之间的显著差异，并通过对LLM的监督微调，在表层指标（如ROUGE-L和消息长度）上取得了改进。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了角色扮演LLMs在现实模拟人类社会动态方面的潜力和现有局限，尤其是在深度语义对齐上的挑战。

Abstract: Accurately modeling opinion change through social interactions is crucial for
addressing issues like misinformation and polarization. While role-playing
large language models (LLMs) offer a promising way to simulate human-like
interactions, existing research shows that single-agent alignment does not
guarantee authentic multi-agent group dynamics. Current LLM role-play setups
often produce unnatural dynamics (e.g., premature convergence), without an
empirical benchmark to measure authentic human opinion trajectories. To bridge
this gap, we introduce DEBATE, the first large-scale empirical benchmark
explicitly designed to evaluate the authenticity of the interaction between
multi-agent role-playing LLMs. DEBATE contains 29,417 messages from multi-round
debate conversations among over 2,792 U.S.-based participants discussing 107
controversial topics, capturing both publicly-expressed messages and
privately-reported opinions. Using DEBATE, we systematically evaluate and
identify critical discrepancies between simulated and authentic group dynamics.
We further demonstrate DEBATE's utility for aligning LLMs with human behavior
through supervised fine-tuning, achieving improvements in surface-level metrics
(e.g., ROUGE-L and message length) while highlighting limitations in deeper
semantic alignment (e.g., semantic similarity). Our findings highlight both the
potential and current limitations of role-playing LLM agents for realistically
simulating human-like social dynamics.

Abstract: This research article examines the effectiveness of various pretraining
strategies for developing machine translation models tailored to low-resource
languages. Although this work considers several low-resource languages,
including Afrikaans, Swahili, and Zulu, the translation model is specifically
developed for Lingala, an under-resourced African language, building upon the
pretraining approach introduced by Reid and Artetxe (2021), originally designed
for high-resource languages. Through a series of comprehensive experiments, we
explore different pretraining methodologies, including the integration of
multiple languages and the use of both monolingual and parallel data during the
pretraining phase. Our findings indicate that pretraining on multiple languages
and leveraging both monolingual and parallel data significantly enhance
translation quality. This study offers valuable insights into effective
pretraining strategies for low-resource machine translation, helping to bridge
the performance gap between high-resource and low-resource languages. The
results contribute to the broader goal of developing more inclusive and
accurate NLP models for marginalized communities and underrepresented
populations. The code and datasets used in this study are publicly available to
facilitate further research and ensure reproducibility, with the exception of
certain data that may no longer be accessible due to changes in public
availability.

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural
language processing, yet their training on massive corpora poses significant
risks, including the memorization of sensitive personal data, copyrighted
material, and knowledge that could facilitate malicious activities. To mitigate
these issues and align with legal and ethical standards such as the "right to
be forgotten", machine unlearning has emerged as a critical technique to
selectively erase specific knowledge from LLMs without compromising their
overall performance. This survey provides a systematic review of over 180
papers on LLM unlearning published since 2021, focusing exclusively on
large-scale generative models. Distinct from prior surveys, we introduce novel
taxonomies for both unlearning methods and evaluations. We clearly categorize
methods into training-time, post-training, and inference-time based on the
training stage at which unlearning is applied. For evaluations, we not only
systematically compile existing datasets and metrics but also critically
analyze their advantages, disadvantages, and applicability, providing practical
guidance to the research community. In addition, we discuss key challenges and
promising future research directions. Our comprehensive overview aims to inform
and guide the ongoing development of secure and reliable LLMs.

Motivation: 离散音频表示在语音建模中因其可解释性和与大型语言模型的兼容性而受到关注，但在噪声或现实环境中的优化仍存在挑战。

Method: 基于Whisper嵌入的量化工作，构建端到端模型，通过码本标记分离干净语音，并通过轻量级分类器提取和监督噪声向量。

Result: 与Whisper相比，错误率降低82%，在VBDemand测试集上比基线方法提升35%，并显示出对已见和未见声学条件的良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法在噪声环境下提高了语音和文本的对齐，并产生了具有高度噪声不变性的语音标记，从而提升了ASR性能。

Abstract: Discrete audio representations are gaining traction in speech modeling due to
their interpretability and compatibility with large language models, but are
not always optimized for noisy or real-world environments. Building on existing
works that quantize Whisper embeddings for speech-to-unit modeling, we propose
disentangling semantic speech content from background noise in the latent
space. Our end-to-end model separates clean speech in the form of codebook
tokens, while extracting interpretable noise vectors as quantization residue
which are supervised via a lightweight classifier. We show that our approach
improves alignment between clean/noisy speech and text, producing speech tokens
that display a high degree of noiseinvariance, and improves ASR performance.
Keeping Whisper frozen, we show an 82% reduction in error rate compared to
Whisper, and 35% improvement over baseline methods on the VBDemand test set.
Further analyses show that the learned token space generalizes well to both
seen and unseen acoustic conditions.

TL;DR: 本文通过在低资源语言环境中测试大型语言模型，探讨了数据优势与实际能力之间的关系，发现模型性能随语言资源的减少而下降，并揭示了Chain-of-Thought提示在不同模型中的不同效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在英语等高资源语言中表现出色，但其表现是否反映真实能力还是数据优势尚不清楚。通过在低资源语言环境中测试模型，可以揭示其真实能力。

Method: 在先前研究的基础上，使用下一句预测（NSP）作为测试方法，创建了包含英语、斯瓦希里语和豪萨语的大规模基准测试，并测试了多个顶级模型在不同语言中的表现。引入了Chain-of-Thought（CoT）提示，以研究其对模型性能的影响。

Result: 所有模型在英语中表现优秀，但在斯瓦希里语和豪萨语中性能下降，尤其LLaMA 3在豪萨语中表现最差。引入CoT提示后，LLaMA 3的准确性显著提高，但GPT-4和Gemini的性能反而下降。

Conclusion: Chain-of-Thought提示的效果依赖于模型的基线能力和任务的具体语境，并非在所有情况下都有效。该研究框架揭示了LLM的弱点，并明确了CoT在跨语言NSP任务中的适用情境。

Abstract: While large language models are trained on massive datasets, this data is
heavily skewed towards English. Does their impressive performance reflect
genuine ability or just this data advantage? To find out, we tested them in a
setting where they could not rely on data abundance: low-resource languages.
Building on prior work Agarwal et al. (2025) that used Next Sentence Prediction
(NSP) as a test, we created a large-scale benchmark with 10,000 questions each
for English (a high-resource language), Swahili (medium-resource), and Hausa
(low-resource). We then tested several top models, including GPT-4 Turbo,
Gemini 1.5 Flash, and LLaMA 3 70B, to see how their performance holds up. The
results painted a clear picture of how levels of language resources impact
outcomes. While all models excelled in English, their accuracy dropped in
Swahili and fell sharply in Hausa, with LLaMA 3 struggling the most. The story
became even more interesting when we introduced Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting. For the struggling LLaMA 3, CoT acted as a helpful guide,
significantly boosting its accuracy. However, for the more capable GPT-4 and
Gemini, the same technique often backfired, leading to a kind of "overthinking"
that hurt their results in the cross-lingual context. This reveals that
Chain-of-Thought is not a universal solution; its effectiveness depends heavily
on the model's baseline capability and the specific context of the task. Our
framework pinpoints LLM weaknesses, highlights when CoT helps or hinders
cross-lingual NSP performance, and factors influencing their decisions.

challenges: scarcity of annotated datasets and limited domain knowledge in
general-purpose language models. In this work, we present a multi-stage
finetuning strategy to adapt lightweight language models to the Hindi tourism
domain by leveraging both original and synthetic training data. Synthetic
question-answer pairs are generated using large LLMs (LLaMA-70B, Phi-14B) and
used to augment the limited original dataset. We explore several training
methodologies and analyse their impact on domain generalisation. Our results
demonstrate that large models can efficiently generate synthetic data, while
small models can effectively adapt to it, offering a scalable pathway for
low-resource, domain-specific QA.

### [31] [Teaching Sarcasm: Few-Shot Multimodal Sarcasm Detection via Distillation to a Parameter-Efficient Student](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25303)
*Soumyadeep Jana,Sanasam Ranbir Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过蒸馏专家模型来增强参数高效微调（PEFT）方法的统一框架PEKD，以解决低资源环境下多模态讽刺检测的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低资源环境下，由于标注数据稀缺，多模态讽刺检测模型难以学习细微的图文矛盾，现有PEFT方法虽减少过拟合但性能受限。

Method: 提出PEKD框架，通过从大规模讽刺数据训练的专家模型进行蒸馏，引入熵感知门控机制，动态调整蒸馏强度以应对教师模型不可靠信号。

Result: 在两个公共数据集上的实验表明，PEKD框架使PEFT方法超越了先前的参数高效方法和大规模多模态模型，在少样本场景下取得了强结果。

Conclusion: PEKD是一个模块化且可适配多种多模态模型和任务的框架，有效提升了低资源环境下的多模态讽刺检测性能。

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection is challenging, especially in low-resource
settings where subtle image-text contradictions are hard to learn due to scarce
annotated data, which hinders the model's performance. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like adapters, LoRA, and prompt tuning reduce
overfitting but struggle to reach optimal performance due to limited
supervision from few-shot data. We propose PEKD, a unified framework that
enhances PEFT methods via distillation from an expert model trained on
large-scale sarcasm data, which acts as the teacher. To mitigate unreliable
signals from the teacher, we introduce an entropy-aware gating mechanism that
dynamically adjusts the distillation strength based on teacher confidence.
Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our PEKD framework enables
PEFT methods to outperform both prior parameter-efficient approaches and large
multimodal models, achieving strong results in the few-shot scenario. The
framework is modular and adaptable to a wide range of multimodal models and
tasks.

*Senjie Jin,Lu Chen,Zhiheng Xi,Yuhui Wang,Sirui Song,Yuhao Zhou,Xinbo Zhang,Peng Sun,Hong Lu,Tao Gui,Qi Zhang,Xuanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Parrot的新型训练管道，通过双向增强自然语言思维链(N-CoT)和程序思维链(P-CoT)，以同时提升两种范式在数学推理问题上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的研究通常只实现了P-CoT增强N-CoT或N-CoT增强P-CoT的单向增强，未能充分利用两种范式的互补优势。为此，作者希望实现两种范式的相互增强，从而同时提升性能。

Method: 作者详细分析了两种范式的错误类型，并设计了Parrot训练管道，包括三个目标导向的子任务，子任务混合训练策略，以及转换后的N-CoT辅助奖励机制。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，Parrot显著提升了N-CoT和P-CoT的性能，尤其是在N-CoT方面。使用Parrot SFT，LLaMA2和CodeLLaMA在MathQA上的N-CoT性能相对于资源密集的RL基线分别提升了+21.87和+21.48。

Conclusion: Parrot通过双向增强策略有效提升了N-CoT和P-CoT在数学推理问题上的性能，展示了两种范式相互增强的潜力。

Abstract: Natural language chain-of-thought (N-CoT) and Program chain-of-thought
(P-CoT) have emerged as two primary paradigms for large language models (LLMs)
to solve mathematical reasoning problems. Current research typically endeavors
to achieve unidirectional enhancement: P-CoT enhanced N-CoT or N-CoT enhanced
P-CoT. In this paper, we seek to fully unleash the two paradigms' strengths for
mutual enhancement and ultimately achieve simultaneous improvements. We conduct
a detailed analysis of the error types across two paradigms, based on which we
propose Parrot, a novel training pipeline for mathematical problems: 1) Three
target-designed subtasks integrate sequential P-CoT and N-CoT generation. 2) A
subtask hybrid training strategy to facilitate natural language semantic
transferability. 3) The converted N-CoT auxiliary reward is designed to
alleviate the sparse rewards in P-CoT optimization. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Parrot significantly enhances both the performance of N-CoT
and P-CoT, especially on N-CoT. Using Parrot SFT, the N-CoT performance of
LLaMA2 and CodeLLaMA achieve gains of +21.87 and +21.48 on MathQA over the RL
baseline, which is resource-intensive.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究了小参数语言模型是否能从指令微调中受益，发现指令微调在微调场景下有小的性能提升，特别是在顺序课程中，但不一定能迁移到零样本任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索小语言模型是否可以通过指令微调提升性能，尤其是在低资源条件下如何优化模型学习策略。

Method: 使用100M和140M参数的decoder-only模型，比较对话和问答指令微调数据集，在合并或顺序课程下进行实验，并在多个任务上进行评估。

Result: 指令微调在微调场景下带来了一致的小幅性能提升，顺序课程优于合并数据，但改进并不总能迁移到零样本任务。

Conclusion: 小语言模型在低资源情况下可以通过指令微调提升性能，但需要在交互适应和广泛语言泛化之间做出权衡，提示了混合、基于课程的方法在生态训练限制下的潜力。

Abstract: This work investigates whether small-scale LMs can benefit from instruction
tuning. We compare conversational and question-answering instruction tuning
datasets, applied either in a merged or sequential curriculum, using
decoder-only models with 100M and 140M parameters. Evaluation spans both
fine-tuning (SuperGLUE) and zero-shot (BLiMP, EWoK, WUGs, entity tracking, and
psycholinguistic correlation) settings. Results show that instruction tuning
yields small but consistent gains in fine-tuning scenarios, with sequential
curricula outperforming merged data; however, improvements do not consistently
transfer to zero-shot tasks, suggesting a trade-off between interaction-focused
adaptation and broad linguistic generalization. These results highlight both
the potential and the constraints of adapting human-inspired learning
strategies to low-resource LMs, and point toward hybrid, curriculum-based
approaches for enhancing generalization under ecological training limits.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用大数据和LLMs监控和预测颠覆性技术的新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于专家的方法难以跟上快速变化的技术领域，尤其是在ICT领域。

Method: 利用LLMs从非结构化文本中提取语义三元组，构建技术相关实体和关系的大规模图。引入名词钉扎技术，开发图基指标来检测收敛信号，并包括多级过滤、领域特定关键词聚类和主题共现的时间趋势分析。

Result: 在两个数据集上验证了方法：arXiv预印本（2017-2024）和USPTO专利申请（2018-2024），结果表明该方法可以识别已建立和新兴的收敛模式。

Conclusion: 提供了一种可扩展和可推广的技术预测框架，基于全文分析，为技术预测提供了新的工具。

Abstract: Forecasting transformative technologies remains a critical but challenging
task, particularly in fast-evolving domains such as Information and
Communication Technologies (ICTs). Traditional expert-based methods struggle to
keep pace with short innovation cycles and ambiguous early-stage terminology.
In this work, we propose a novel, data-driven pipeline to monitor the emergence
of transformative technologies by identifying patterns of technological
convergence.
  Our approach leverages advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract
semantic triples from unstructured text and construct a large-scale graph of
technology-related entities and relations. We introduce a new method for
grouping semantically similar technology terms (noun stapling) and develop
graph-based metrics to detect convergence signals. The pipeline includes
multi-stage filtering, domain-specific keyword clustering, and a temporal trend
analysis of topic co-occurence.
  We validate our methodology on two complementary datasets: 278,625 arXiv
preprints (2017--2024) to capture early scientific signals, and 9,793 USPTO
patent applications (2018-2024) to track downstream commercial developments.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed pipeline can identify both
established and emerging convergence patterns, offering a scalable and
generalizable framework for technology forecasting grounded in full-text
analysis.

### [35] [Hallucinations in Bibliographic Recommendation: Citation Frequency as a Proxy for Training Data Redundancy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25378)
*Junichiro Niimi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在生成书目信息时的幻觉问题，发现引用次数越高的论文，幻觉率越低，且超过约1000次引用的论文几乎被模型逐字记忆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在书目推荐中存在生成虚构论文的幻觉问题，而高被引论文在训练数据中出现频率更高，可能减少幻觉。

Method: 使用GPT-4.1生成并人工验证20个计算机领域的100条书目记录，通过余弦相似度测量生成与真实元数据的一致性。

Result: （1）幻觉率因研究领域而异；（2）引用次数与事实准确性强相关；（3）超过约1000次引用的论文几乎被逐字记忆。

Conclusion: 高被引论文在模型中几乎被逐字保留，表明在引用次数达到某一阈值后，模型从泛化转向记忆。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to a wide range
of tasks, from natural language understanding to code generation. While they
have also been used to assist in bibliographic recommendation, the
hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior
studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce
bibliographic information depends on whether the underlying knowledge is
generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear
in the training corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume
citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency
with which a given bibliographic record is repeatedly represented in the
pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated
references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified
100 bibliographic records across twenty computer-science domains, and measured
factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic
metadata. The results revealed that (i) hallucination rates vary across
research domains, (ii) citation count is strongly correlated with factual
accuracy, and (iii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatimly
memorized beyond approximately 1,000 citations. These findings suggest that
highly cited papers are nearly verbatimly retained in the model, indicating a
threshold where generalization shifts into memorization.

TL;DR: BhashaBench V1 是第一个专注于印度知识体系的双语、多任务、领域特定基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要是以英语为中心和领域无关的，限制了其在以印度为中心语境下的适用性。

Method: 引入 BhashaBench V1，包含 74,166 个精选问答对，涵盖农业、法律、金融和阿育吠陀四个主要领域，并进行 29 个以上大语言模型的评估。

Result: 评估揭示了领域和语言特定性能差距，尤其在低资源领域。例如，GPT-4o 在法律领域达到 76.49% 的准确率，但在阿育吠陀领域仅为 59.74%。

Conclusion: BhashaBench V1 提供了一个全面的数据集，用于评估大语言模型在印度多样化知识领域中的表现，并公开所有代码、基准测试和资源以支持开放研究。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models(LLMs) has intensified the need
for domain and culture specific evaluation. Existing benchmarks are largely
Anglocentric and domain-agnostic, limiting their applicability to India-centric
contexts. To address this gap, we introduce BhashaBench V1, the first
domain-specific, multi-task, bilingual benchmark focusing on critical Indic
knowledge systems. BhashaBench V1 contains 74,166 meticulously curated
question-answer pairs, with 52,494 in English and 21,672 in Hindi, sourced from
authentic government and domain-specific exams. It spans four major domains:
Agriculture, Legal, Finance, and Ayurveda, comprising 90+ subdomains and
covering 500+ topics, enabling fine-grained evaluation. Evaluation of 29+ LLMs
reveals significant domain and language specific performance gaps, with
especially large disparities in low-resource domains. For instance, GPT-4o
achieves 76.49% overall accuracy in Legal but only 59.74% in Ayurveda. Models
consistently perform better on English content compared to Hindi across all
domains. Subdomain-level analysis shows that areas such as Cyber Law,
International Finance perform relatively well, while Panchakarma, Seed Science,
and Human Rights remain notably weak. BhashaBench V1 provides a comprehensive
dataset for evaluating large language models across India's diverse knowledge
domains. It enables assessment of models' ability to integrate domain-specific
knowledge with bilingual understanding. All code, benchmarks, and resources are
publicly available to support open research.

### [37] [Serve Programs, Not Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25412)
*In Gim,Lin Zhong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的LLM服务系统架构Symphony，通过服务LLM推理程序（LIPs）代替传统的提示，以解决现有系统在复杂LLM应用中的低效和不灵活问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型服务系统主要为文本补全设计，面对日益复杂的LLM应用时，其设计缺乏灵活性和高效性。

Method: 引入LLM推理程序（LIPs）架构，允许用户在运行时自定义标记预测和KV缓存管理，并将部分应用逻辑卸载到服务器。Symphony作为该架构的示例系统，通过系统调用暴露LLM模型计算，并通过专用文件系统虚拟化KV缓存，同时采用两级进程调度方案确保GPU效率。

Result: Symphony展示了通过新架构服务复杂LLM应用的潜力，提高了系统的灵活性和效率。

Conclusion: Symphony架构为LLM应用生态系统提供了更高效和可扩展的解决方案，有望推动LLM应用的发展。

Abstract: Current large language model (LLM) serving systems, primarily designed for
text completion, are neither efficient nor adaptable for increasingly complex
LLM applications due to their inflexible design. We propose a new LLM serving
system architecture that serves programs instead of prompts to address this
problem. These programs, called LLM Inference Programs (LIPs), allow users to
customize token prediction and KV cache management at runtime and to offload
parts of their application logic, such as tool execution, to the server. We
describe an example of this architecture through a system named Symphony, which
functions as an operating system for LIPs. Symphony exposes LLM model
computations via system calls and virtualizes KV cache with a dedicated file
system, while ensuring GPU efficiency with a two-level process scheduling
scheme. Symphony has the potential to open the door to a more efficient and
extensible ecosystem for LLM applications.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种利用视觉语言模型（VLM）进行手语翻译（SLT）数据自动标注和过滤的新框架，以减少对手动标注的依赖，提高数据质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前手语翻译数据集规模有限、缺乏多语言覆盖且标注成本高，因此需要一种自动化、低成本且高质量的数据标注方法。

Method: 提出了一个基于VLM的自动化标注和过滤框架，包括面部可见性检测、手语活动识别、视频内容文本提取和视频与文本对齐验证。

Result: 在八个手语版本的TikTok视频和YouTube-SL-25数据集上应用该方法，评估了两个SLT模型在德国和美国手语上的表现，建立了自动提取数据的基线。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了可扩展、弱监督的SLT预训练，有助于从社交媒体获取手语数据。

Abstract: Most existing sign language translation (SLT) datasets are limited in scale,
lack multilingual coverage, and are costly to curate due to their reliance on
expert annotation and controlled recording setup. Recently, Vision Language
Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities as evaluators and real-time
assistants. Despite these advancements, their potential remains untapped in the
context of sign language dataset acquisition. To bridge this gap, we introduce
the first automated annotation and filtering framework that utilizes VLMs to
reduce reliance on manual effort while preserving data quality. Our method is
applied to TikTok videos across eight sign languages and to the already curated
YouTube-SL-25 dataset in German Sign Language for the purpose of additional
evaluation. Our VLM-based pipeline includes a face visibility detection, a sign
activity recognition, a text extraction from video content, and a judgment step
to validate alignment between video and text, implementing generic filtering,
annotation and validation steps. Using the resulting corpus, TikTok-SL-8, we
assess the performance of two off-the-shelf SLT models on our filtered dataset
for German and American Sign Languages, with the goal of establishing baselines
and evaluating the robustness of recent models on automatically extracted,
slightly noisy data. Our work enables scalable, weakly supervised pretraining
for SLT and facilitates data acquisition from social media.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在人类-计算机交互中表现出对会话含义的理解能力，且更大的模型能更好地推断用户意图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的发展，关注语言基础，尤其是会话含义，对于实现人类-AI对齐至关重要。

Method: 研究考察了LLMs在上下文驱动提示中推断用户意图的能力，并测试了会话含义对响应生成的影响。

Result: 较大的模型更接近人类的解释，较小的模型在会话含义推断方面表现较差，但使用会话含义提示能显著提高响应的相关性和质量。

Conclusion: 语言理论可以帮助解决人类-AI对齐问题，使交互更自然和基于上下文。会话含义在提升交互质量方面具有显著作用。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) is positioning language
at the core of human-computer interaction (HCI). We argue that advancing HCI
requires attention to the linguistic foundations of interaction, particularly
implicature (meaning conveyed beyond explicit statements through shared
context) which is essential for human-AI (HAI) alignment. This study examines
LLMs' ability to infer user intent embedded in context-driven prompts and
whether understanding implicature improves response generation. Results show
that larger models approximate human interpretations more closely, while
smaller models struggle with implicature inference. Furthermore,
implicature-based prompts significantly enhance the perceived relevance and
quality of responses across models, with notable gains in smaller models.
Overall, 67.6% of participants preferred responses with implicature-embedded
prompts to literal ones, highlighting a clear preference for contextually
nuanced communication. Our work contributes to understanding how linguistic
theory can be used to address the alignment problem by making HAI interaction
more natural and contextually grounded.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个框架，通过解释深度和自主性两个维度对定性研究中大型语言模型（LLMs）的应用进行分类，并提出实用设计建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人员在各种领域越来越多地使用LLMs，但在定性社会科学中仍面临解释偏见、低可靠性和弱可审计性等挑战。

Method: 提出了一个二维框架（解释深度和自主性）来分类LLMs在定性研究中的应用，并基于Web of Science上已发表的社会科学论文，分析这些维度上的文献现状。

Result: 分析显示，通过将任务分解为可控部分、保持较低自主性并在必要时选择性增加解释深度，可以在保持透明度和可靠性的同时，有效利用LLMs。

Conclusion: 与其给予模型广泛的自由度，不如在监督下分解任务，以可控的方式增加解释深度，从而在定性研究中更好地利用LLMs。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized by researchers across
a wide range of domains, and qualitative social science is no exception;
however, this adoption faces persistent challenges, including interpretive
bias, low reliability, and weak auditability. We introduce a framework that
situates LLM usage along two dimensions, interpretive depth and autonomy,
thereby offering a straightforward way to classify LLM applications in
qualitative research and to derive practical design recommendations. We present
the state of the literature with respect to these two dimensions, based on all
published social science papers available on Web of Science that use LLMs as a
tool and not strictly as the subject of study. Rather than granting models
expansive freedom, our approach encourages researchers to decompose tasks into
manageable segments, much as they would when delegating work to capable
undergraduate research assistants. By maintaining low levels of autonomy and
selectively increasing interpretive depth only where warranted and under
supervision, one can plausibly reap the benefits of LLMs while preserving
transparency and reliability.

Motivation: 解决快速演变的亚文化语言和俚语对自动化信息提取和执法监控带来的挑战。

Method: 利用LLaMA Factory框架，在通用和自定义领域特定数据集上微调LLMs，并使用BLEU和ROUGE指标进行评估。

Result: 指令微调显著提高了摘要和标记的准确性，尤其在专业语料库上。经过领域特定微调后，LLaMA3-8B-Instruct模型超越了中文训练的模型。

Conclusion: LLMs和NER的集成提供了一种强大的解决方案，将非结构化文本转化为可操作的洞察，对现代知识管理和安全操作至关重要。

Abstract: This paper presents a pipeline integrating fine-tuned large language models
(LLMs) with named entity recognition (NER) for efficient domain-specific text
summarization and tagging. The authors address the challenge posed by rapidly
evolving sub-cultural languages and slang, which complicate automated
information extraction and law enforcement monitoring. By leveraging the LLaMA
Factory framework, the study fine-tunes LLMs on both generalpurpose and custom
domain-specific datasets, particularly in the political and security domains.
The models are evaluated using BLEU and ROUGE metrics, demonstrating that
instruction fine-tuning significantly enhances summarization and tagging
accuracy, especially for specialized corpora. Notably, the LLaMA3-8B-Instruct
model, despite its initial limitations in Chinese comprehension, outperforms
its Chinese-trained counterpart after domainspecific fine-tuning, suggesting
that underlying reasoning capabilities can transfer across languages. The
pipeline enables concise summaries and structured entity tagging, facilitating
rapid document categorization and distribution. This approach proves scalable
and adaptable for real-time applications, supporting efficient information
management and the ongoing need to capture emerging language trends. The
integration of LLMs and NER offers a robust solution for transforming
unstructured text into actionable insights, crucial for modern knowledge
management and security operations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SLT评价指标仅基于文本，尚不清楚其在捕捉SLT输出质量方面的可靠性。

Method: 分析了六种文本评价指标和基于大型语言模型的评价器，通过三种受控条件评估其一致性和稳健性：意译、模型输出中的幻觉和句子长度变化。

Result: 发现文本重叠度量的局限性，基于LLM的评价器更好地捕捉语义等价性，但也可能对LLM意译的翻译有偏见。BLEU对幻觉过于敏感，而BLEURT和LLM评价器对细微情况更宽松。

Conclusion: 需要多模式评价框架，超越文本指标，以更全面评估SLT输出。

Abstract: Automatic evaluation metrics are crucial for advancing sign language
translation (SLT). Current SLT evaluation metrics, such as BLEU and ROUGE, are
only text-based, and it remains unclear to what extent text-based metrics can
reliably capture the quality of SLT outputs. To address this gap, we
investigate the limitations of text-based SLT evaluation metrics by analyzing
six metrics, including BLEU, chrF, and ROUGE, as well as BLEURT on the one
hand, and large language model (LLM)-based evaluators such as G-Eval and GEMBA
zero-shot direct assessment on the other hand. Specifically, we assess the
consistency and robustness of these metrics under three controlled conditions:
paraphrasing, hallucinations in model outputs, and variations in sentence
length. Our analysis highlights the limitations of lexical overlap metrics and
demonstrates that while LLM-based evaluators better capture semantic
equivalence often missed by conventional metrics, they can also exhibit bias
toward LLM-paraphrased translations. Moreover, although all metrics are able to
detect hallucinations, BLEU tends to be overly sensitive, whereas BLEURT and
LLM-based evaluators are comparatively lenient toward subtle cases. This
motivates the need for multimodal evaluation frameworks that extend beyond
text-based metrics to enable a more holistic assessment of SLT outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在高风险、专业领域（如宗教问题解答）中的应用受到幻觉和权威性缺失的制约，尤其是在波斯语穆斯林社区中，准确性和可信度至关重要。

Method: 引入FAIR-RAG架构，该架构采用动态、自我修正的流程，自适应地分解复杂查询，并迭代生成子查询，以逐步填补信息空白。

Result: 在伊斯兰PCQA基准测试中，FARSIQA实现了最先进的性能：负面拒绝率达到97.0%，答案正确性得分达到74.3%。

Conclusion: FARSIQA为波斯语伊斯兰问题解答建立了新标准，验证了迭代、自适应架构在敏感领域构建忠实、可靠AI系统的重要性。

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized Natural
Language Processing, yet their application in high-stakes, specialized domains
like religious question answering is hindered by challenges like hallucination
and unfaithfulness to authoritative sources. This issue is particularly
critical for the Persian-speaking Muslim community, where accuracy and
trustworthiness are paramount. Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
systems, relying on simplistic single-pass pipelines, fall short on complex,
multi-hop queries requiring multi-step reasoning and evidence aggregation. To
address this gap, we introduce FARSIQA, a novel, end-to-end system for Faithful
Advanced Question Answering in the Persian Islamic domain. FARSIQA is built
upon our innovative FAIR-RAG architecture: a Faithful, Adaptive, Iterative
Refinement framework for RAG. FAIR-RAG employs a dynamic, self-correcting
process: it adaptively decomposes complex queries, assesses evidence
sufficiency, and enters an iterative loop to generate sub-queries,
progressively filling information gaps. Operating on a curated knowledge base
of over one million authoritative Islamic documents, FARSIQA demonstrates
superior performance. Rigorous evaluation on the challenging IslamicPCQA
benchmark shows state-of-the-art performance: the system achieves a remarkable
97.0% in Negative Rejection - a 40-point improvement over baselines - and a
high Answer Correctness score of 74.3%. Our work establishes a new standard for
Persian Islamic QA and validates that our iterative, adaptive architecture is
crucial for building faithful, reliable AI systems in sensitive domains.

Motivation: 在现实推理场景中，很多信息是无关的，有效的演绎推理需要识别并忽略这些干扰信息。标准评估主要关注正确性，而忽略了人类推理中的效率问题。

Method: 提出一种通过逻辑编程评估语言模型推理效率的框架，将语言模型生成的自然语言证明与逻辑程序中找到的最短证明对齐，并通过测量模型避免不必要推理的能力来量化效率。

Result: 构建了一个包含无关公理的数学应用题数据集，发现当前语言模型在存在无关信息时准确率明显下降，且生成的证明经常包含无关推理的绕路。

Conclusion: 当前语言模型在面对无关信息时推理效率较低，准确率下降明显，且生成的证明不够简洁。该框架提供了一种评估和改进语言模型推理效率的方法。

Abstract: Modern language models (LMs) exhibit strong deductive reasoning capabilities,
yet standard evaluations emphasize correctness while overlooking a key aspect
of human-like reasoning: efficiency. In real-world reasoning scenarios, much of
the available information is irrelevant, and effective deductive inference
requires identifying and ignoring such distractions. We propose a framework for
assessing LM reasoning efficiency through the lens of logic programming,
introducing a simple method to align proofs written in natural language -- as
generated by an LM -- with shortest proofs found by executing the logic
program. Efficiency is quantified by measuring how well a model avoids
unnecessary inference. Empirically, we construct a dataset of math word
problems injected with various number of irrelevant axioms that vary in
semantic overlap with the goal theorem. We find that current LMs show marked
accuracy declines under such conditions -- even with minimal, domain-consistent
distractions -- and the proofs they generate frequently exhibit detours through
irrelevant inferences.

TL;DR: TwinVoice 是一个用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在多样化现实世界中模拟个体交流风格、行为倾向和人格特质能力的综合基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对基于 LLM 的角色模拟的评估存在局限，包括依赖合成对话、缺乏系统框架和能力需求分析。因此，需要引入更全面的评估基准。

Method: 引入 TwinVoice 基准，涵盖社交角色（公共社交互动）、人际关系角色（私人对话）和叙事角色（基于角色的表达）三个维度，并将 LLM 的表现评估分解为观点一致性、记忆回忆、逻辑推理、词汇保真度、角色语调和句法风格六个基本能力。

Result: 实验结果显示，尽管先进模型在角色模拟中达到了中等准确度，但在句法风格和记忆回忆等能力上仍有不足，LLMs 的平均表现仍远低于人类基准。

Conclusion: LLMs 在角色模拟方面仍存在显著差距，尤其是在句法风格和记忆回忆等能力方面，需要进一步改进以达到人类水平。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are exhibiting emergent human-like abilities and
are increasingly envisioned as the foundation for simulating an individual's
communication style, behavioral tendencies, and personality traits. However,
current evaluations of LLM-based persona simulation remain limited: most rely
on synthetic dialogues, lack systematic frameworks, and lack analysis of the
capability requirement. To address these limitations, we introduce TwinVoice, a
comprehensive benchmark for assessing persona simulation across diverse
real-world contexts. TwinVoice encompasses three dimensions: Social Persona
(public social interactions), Interpersonal Persona (private dialogues), and
Narrative Persona (role-based expression). It further decomposes the evaluation
of LLM performance into six fundamental capabilities, including opinion
consistency, memory recall, logical reasoning, lexical fidelity, persona tone,
and syntactic style. Experimental results reveal that while advanced models
achieve moderate accuracy in persona simulation, they still fall short of
capabilities such as syntactic style and memory recall. Consequently, the
average performance achieved by LLMs remains considerably below the human
baseline.

TL;DR: 研究通过SKeB框架和说服性提示评估大型语言模型在故意遗忘后的知识召回能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型中遗忘效果评估的难题，特别是在管理敏感数据和纠正错误信息方面。

Method: 引入SKeB框架，结合ACT-R和Hebbian理论，使用领域图建模信息纠缠，并开发纠缠指标以量化知识激活模式。

Result: 说服性提示显著提高了事实知识召回（权威框架下从14.8%提升至24.5%），且效果与模型大小成反比（2.7B模型恢复128%，13B模型恢复15%）。

Conclusion: SKeB框架为评估LLMs中的遗忘完整性、鲁棒性和整体行为提供了基础。

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for managing sensitive
data and correcting misinformation, yet evaluating its effectiveness remains an
open problem. We investigate whether persuasive prompting can recall factual
knowledge from deliberately unlearned LLMs across models ranging from 2.7B to
13B parameters (OPT-2.7B, LLaMA-2-7B, LLaMA-3.1-8B, LLaMA-2-13B). Drawing from
ACT-R and Hebbian theory (spreading activation theories), as well as
communication principles, we introduce Stimulus-Knowledge Entanglement-Behavior
Framework (SKeB), which models information entanglement via domain graphs and
tests whether factual recall in unlearned models is correlated with persuasive
framing. We develop entanglement metrics to quantify knowledge activation
patterns and evaluate factuality, non-factuality, and hallucination in outputs.
Our results show persuasive prompts substantially enhance factual knowledge
recall (14.8% baseline vs. 24.5% with authority framing), with effectiveness
inversely correlated to model size (128% recovery in 2.7B vs. 15% in 13B). SKeB
provides a foundation for assessing unlearning completeness, robustness, and
overall behavior in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有智能体评估集中在一次性任务完成，未能考虑现实问题的迭代和协作性，以及人类目标的不明确和变化性。

Method: 引入协作努力扩展框架，通过案例研究和模拟评估分析智能体在多轮、现实场景中的表现。

Result: 现有最先进的智能体在多轮、现实场景中表现不佳，显示出智能体设计中缺失维持用户参与和引导用户理解的要素。

Conclusion: 协作努力扩展框架有助于诊断智能体行为并指导开发更有效的交互。

Abstract: Current evaluations of agents remain centered around one-shot task
completion, failing to account for the inherently iterative and collaborative
nature of many real-world problems, where human goals are often underspecified
and evolve. We argue for a shift from building and assessing task completion
agents to developing collaborative agents, assessed not only by the quality of
their final outputs but by how well they engage with and enhance human effort
throughout the problem-solving process. To support this shift, we introduce
collaborative effort scaling, a framework that captures how an agent's utility
grows with increasing user involvement. Through case studies and simulated
evaluations, we show that state-of-the-art agents often underperform in
multi-turn, real-world scenarios, revealing a missing ingredient in agent
design: the ability to sustain engagement and scaffold user understanding.
Collaborative effort scaling offers a lens for diagnosing agent behavior and
guiding development toward more effective interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然TTS在数学和编程等正式领域被证明是有效的，但在法律和辩论等领域的应用尚未被充分探索。作者旨在填补这一研究空白。

Method: 使用7种奖励模型，评估了结果级（Best-of-N）和过程级（树搜索）验证，在五个法律MCQA基准上进行了实验。

Result: 分析了领域专业化、模型大小和监督类型（过程监督PRMs与结果监督ORMs）对验证器效用的影响。

Conclusion: 该研究系统地评估了TTS在法律领域的应用，为未来的研究提供了实证依据和方向。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) techniques can improve the performance of large
language models (LLMs) at the expense of additional computation and latency.
While TTS has proven effective in formal domains such as mathematics and
programming \citep{snell2024scaling, chen2024more}, its value in argumentative
domains such as law remains underexplored. We present an empirical study of
verifier-based TTS methods for legal multiple-choice QA (MCQA) across five
benchmarks. Using a family of 7 reward models, we evaluate both outcome-level
(Best-of-$N$) and process-level (tree search) verification under realistic
low-$N$ budgets. Our analysis systematically investigates how verifier utility
is affected by key properties such as domain specialization, model size, and
supervision type (process-supervised PRMs vs. outcome-only ORMs), even when
applied across different roles.

Motivation: 研究数据过滤和污染如何影响基准和生成性能，并推动多语言语言模型开发中的数据管理、评估、安全和开放性的进一步探索。

Method: 发布包含1.5B、8B和24B参数模型，训练数据包括2-4万亿个标记，并附带完整的训练流程：经过神经质量分类器过滤的法语和英语数据集、高效的数据管理和训练框架，以及数百个中间检查点。

Result: 发现语言质量过滤可以提高文本的流畅性和连贯性，但基准测试结果较差；后期故意污染（继续在与测试集混合的数据上训练）可以恢复有竞争力的分数，同时对生成质量影响较小。

Conclusion: 通过开放发布所有模型、数据集、代码和检查点，Gaperon为探索数据管理、评估、安全性和开放性之间的权衡建立了可重复的基础。

Abstract: We release Gaperon, a fully open suite of French-English-coding language
models designed to advance transparency and reproducibility in large-scale
model training. The Gaperon family includes 1.5B, 8B, and 24B parameter models
trained on 2-4 trillion tokens, released with all elements of the training
pipeline: French and English datasets filtered with a neural quality
classifier, an efficient data curation and training framework, and hundreds of
intermediate checkpoints. Through this work, we study how data filtering and
contamination interact to shape both benchmark and generative performance. We
find that filtering for linguistic quality enhances text fluency and coherence
but yields subpar benchmark results, and that late deliberate contamination --
continuing training on data mixes that include test sets -- recovers
competitive scores while only reasonably harming generation quality. We discuss
how usual neural filtering can unintentionally amplify benchmark leakage. To
support further research, we also introduce harmless data poisoning during
pretraining, providing a realistic testbed for safety studies. By openly
releasing all models, datasets, code, and checkpoints, Gaperon establishes a
reproducible foundation for exploring the trade-offs between data curation,
evaluation, safety, and openness in multilingual language model development.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了EHR-Ins，一个大规模综合EHR推理指令数据集，并提出了一种思维图驱动框架，用于大规模生成高质量推理数据。基于此，开发了EHR-R1，这是一系列针对EHR分析的增强型LLMs。还引入了EHR-Bench，一个用于全面评估EHR场景中推理和预测的新基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在临床工作流中取得了进展，但它们在分析电子健康记录（EHRs）方面仍受限于任务覆盖范围狭窄和缺乏针对EHR的推理能力。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了一个思维图驱动框架，生成EHR-Ins数据集，并在此基础上开发了EHR-R1模型。采用多阶段训练范式，包括领域适应、推理增强和强化学习。

Result: EHR-R1在实验中始终优于最先进的商业和开源LLMs（包括DeepSeek-V3和GPT-4o），在MIMIC-Bench上超过GPT-4o超过30分，在EHRSHOT上零样本AUROC高出10%。

Conclusion: EHR-Ins、EHR-R1和EHR-Bench共同显著推动了更可靠和临床相关EHR分析的发展。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich yet complex information, and
their automated analysis is critical for clinical decision-making. Despite
recent advances of large language models (LLMs) in clinical workflows, their
ability to analyze EHRs remains limited due to narrow task coverage and lack of
EHR-oriented reasoning capabilities. This paper aims to bridge the gap,
specifically, we present EHR-Ins, a large-scale, comprehensive EHR reasoning
instruction dataset, comprising 300k high-quality reasoning cases and 4M
non-reasoning cases across 42 distinct EHR tasks. Its core innovation is a
thinking-graph-driven framework that enables to generate high-quality reasoning
data at scale. Based on it, we develop EHR-R1, a series of reasoning-enhanced
LLMs with up to 72B parameters tailored for EHR analysis. Through a multi-stage
training paradigm, including domain adaptation, reasoning enhancement, and
reinforcement learning, EHR-R1 systematically acquires domain knowledge and
diverse reasoning capabilities, enabling accurate and robust EHR analysis.
Lastly, we introduce EHR-Bench, a new benchmark curated from MIMIC-IV, spanning
42 tasks, to comprehensively assess reasoning and prediction across EHR
scenarios. In experiments, we show that the resulting EHR-R1 consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art commercial and open-source LLMs (including
DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o), surpassing GPT-4o by over 30 points on MIMIC-Bench and
achieving a 10\% higher zero-shot AUROC on EHRSHOT. Collectively, EHR-Ins,
EHR-R1, and EHR-Bench have significantly advanced the development for more
reliable and clinically relevant EHR analysis.

TL;DR: 提出一种统一框架PairUni，通过构建理解-生成（UG）配对数据，并采用Pair-GPRO优化策略，以解决统一视觉语言模型在强化学习中任务间平衡的难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一视觉语言模型需要在单个架构中执行理解和生成任务，但这两类任务依赖异构数据和监督方式，导致强化学习过程中难以平衡。

Method: 提出PairUni框架，利用GPT-o3扩展单任务数据，形成同实例对齐对和语义相关检索对，并设计Pair-GPRO算法，通过相似度评分调节优势函数，提升对齐样本学习，降低任务干扰。

Result: 构建了一个含16K UG对的高质量数据集PairUG，并在Janus-Pro UVLMs上评估，PairUni在各种UVLM上实现了均衡提升，优于现有UVLM强化学习基线。

Conclusion: PairUni通过UG配对数据和Pair-GPRO优化，有效解决了统一模型在强化学习中任务平衡问题，为统一架构的训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Unified vision-language models (UVLMs) must perform both understanding and
generation within a single architecture, but these tasks rely on heterogeneous
data and supervision, making it difficult to balance them during reinforcement
learning (RL). We propose PairUni, a unified framework that reorganizes data
into understanding-generation (UG) pairs and aligns optimization accordingly.
We first use GPT-o3 to augment single-task data, generating captions for
understanding samples and question-answer (QA) pairs for generation samples,
forming aligned pairs from the same instance. Additionally, for each generation
sample, we retrieve a semantically related understanding example to form a
retrieved pair, linking different but related data points. These paired
structures expose cross-task semantic correspondences and support consistent
policy learning. To leverage this structure, we present Pair-GPRO, a pair-aware
variant based on Group Relative Policy Optimization. It assigns a similarity
score to each pair to modulate the advantage, strengthening learning from
well-aligned examples and reducing task interference. We curate a high-quality
dataset of 16K UG pairs named PairUG for RL fine-tuning and evaluate PairUni on
the powerful Janus-Pro UVLMs. Our approach achieves balanced improvements on
various UVLMs, outperforming strong UVLM RL baselines. Code:

Motivation: 探索LLMs在结构化金融数据（如贷款违约预测）中的适用性，特别是在高风险金融应用中的表现。

Method: 通过实际贷款违约预测任务，系统比较基于零样本提示的LLM分类器和最先进的梯度提升模型LightGBM，并分析SHAP特征归因和LLM自解释的可靠性。

Result: LLMs能够识别关键的金融风险指标，但其特征重要性排序与LightGBM显著不同，且自解释常与经验SHAP归因不一致。

Conclusion: LLMs在结构化金融风险预测中存在局限性，强调了可解释性审计、与可解释模型的基准比较以及人工监督在高风险金融环境中部署LLMs的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored as flexible
alternatives to classical machine learning models for classification tasks
through zero-shot prompting. However, their suitability for structured tabular
data remains underexplored, especially in high-stakes financial applications
such as financial risk assessment. This study conducts a systematic comparison
between zero-shot LLM-based classifiers and LightGBM, a state-of-the-art
gradient-boosting model, on a real-world loan default prediction task. We
evaluate their predictive performance, analyze feature attributions using SHAP,
and assess the reliability of LLM-generated self-explanations. While LLMs are
able to identify key financial risk indicators, their feature importance
rankings diverge notably from LightGBM, and their self-explanations often fail
to align with empirical SHAP attributions. These findings highlight the
limitations of LLMs as standalone models for structured financial risk
prediction and raise concerns about the trustworthiness of their self-generated
explanations. Our results underscore the need for explainability audits,
baseline comparisons with interpretable models, and human-in-the-loop oversight
when deploying LLMs in risk-sensitive financial environments.

TL;DR: Ouro是一系列通过将推理过程集成到预训练阶段，利用潜在空间迭代计算和熵正则化目标，构建的Looped Language Models (LoopLM)。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大语言模型主要通过在训练后显式生成文本（如思维链CoT）进行推理，这未能充分利用预训练数据。Ouro旨在通过在预训练阶段内建推理来解决这一问题。

Method: Ouro通过在潜在空间进行迭代计算、使用熵正则化目标进行学习深度分配，并扩展到7.7T tokens，将推理过程集成到预训练中。

Result: Ouro 1.4B和2.6B模型在多种基准测试中表现出优于或与12B SOTA LLMs相当的性能，优势来源于知识操作能力而非知识容量。

Conclusion: LoopLM在推理过程中比显式CoT更一致，并展示了作为推理时代新型扩展方向的潜力。

Abstract: Modern LLMs are trained to "think" primarily via explicit text generation,
such as chain-of-thought (CoT), which defers reasoning to post-training and
under-leverages pre-training data. We present and open-source Ouro, named after
the recursive Ouroboros, a family of pre-trained Looped Language Models
(LoopLM) that instead build reasoning into the pre-training phase through (i)
iterative computation in latent space, (ii) an entropy-regularized objective
for learned depth allocation, and (iii) scaling to 7.7T tokens. Ouro 1.4B and
2.6B models enjoy superior performance that match the results of up to 12B SOTA
LLMs across a wide range of benchmarks. Through controlled experiments, we show
this advantage stems not from increased knowledge capacity, but from superior
knowledge manipulation capabilities. We also show that LoopLM yields reasoning
traces more aligned with final outputs than explicit CoT. We hope our results
show the potential of LoopLM as a novel scaling direction in the reasoning era.

Motivation: 示意图在研究论文中至关重要，但生成和评估这些图存在挑战，尤其是现有图像生成模型难以生成清晰、结构明确的示意图。

Method: 将示意图视为图形，其中文本元素为节点，连接为有向边，使用节点对齐和路径对齐两组新指标评估示意图质量。

Result: 首次有效评估了最先进LLM生成的示意图，定量证明了该指标的有效性。

Conclusion: DiagramEval提供了可解释性强的评估指标，为LLM生成示意图的质量提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Diagrams play a central role in research papers for conveying ideas, yet they
are often notoriously complex and labor-intensive to create. Although diagrams
are presented as images, standard image generative models struggle to produce
clear diagrams with well-defined structure. We argue that a promising direction
is to generate demonstration diagrams directly in textual form as SVGs, which
can leverage recent advances in large language models (LLMs). However, due to
the complexity of components and the multimodal nature of diagrams,
sufficiently discriminative and explainable metrics for evaluating the quality
of LLM-generated diagrams remain lacking. In this paper, we propose
DiagramEval, a novel evaluation metric designed to assess demonstration
diagrams generated by LLMs. Specifically, DiagramEval conceptualizes diagrams
as graphs, treating text elements as nodes and their connections as directed
edges, and evaluates diagram quality using two new groups of metrics: node
alignment and path alignment. For the first time, we effectively evaluate
diagrams produced by state-of-the-art LLMs on recent research literature,
quantitatively demonstrating the validity of our metrics. Furthermore, we show
how the enhanced explainability of our proposed metrics offers valuable
insights into the characteristics of LLM-generated diagrams. Code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多跳、抽象和半抽取式问答场景中，现有的事后归因方法表现不佳，难以可靠地将答案归因到具体来源，因此需要一种新的方法来提高归因的准确性和可信度。

Method: 提出将事后归因重构为推理问题，通过分解答案并关联具体上下文。引入DecompTune，该方法通过一个两阶段SFT + GRPO流程训练Qwen-2.5模型，使其生成答案分解作为中间推理步骤。

Result: DecompTune显著提高了归因质量，在复杂QA任务上优于先前的方法，并匹配或超过前沿模型的性能。

Conclusion: DecompTune通过训练模型生成答案分解作为推理步骤，有效地解决了复杂问答中的归因难题，为大型语言模型在长文档问答中的归因提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for long-document question
answering, where reliable attribution to sources is critical for trust.
Existing post-hoc attribution methods work well for extractive QA but struggle
in multi-hop, abstractive, and semi-extractive settings, where answers
synthesize information across passages. To address these challenges, we argue
that post-hoc attribution can be reframed as a reasoning problem, where answers
are decomposed into constituent units, each tied to specific context. We first
show that prompting models to generate such decompositions alongside
attributions improves performance. Building on this, we introduce DecompTune, a
post-training method that teaches models to produce answer decompositions as
intermediate reasoning steps. We curate a diverse dataset of complex QA tasks,
annotated with decompositions by a strong LLM, and post-train Qwen-2.5 (7B and
14B) using a two-stage SFT + GRPO pipeline with task-specific curated rewards.
Across extensive experiments and ablations, DecompTune substantially improves
attribution quality, outperforming prior methods and matching or exceeding
state-of-the-art frontier models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RLVR数据调度方法依赖路径基础指标，忽略了查询的推理树结构，导致次优的数据效率与准确性。

Method: 提出了r-score，该指标基于查询的推理树结构衡量学习难度，并设计了Re-Schedule算法，该算法基于r-score构建课程，从结构简单的查询（高r-score）到结构复杂的查询（低r-score）进行排序。

Result: 在六个数学推理基准测试中的实验表明，Re-Schedule显著提升了平均准确率，增益高达3.2%。

Conclusion: 推理树的结构理解能为RLVR数据调度提供更强大和原则性的基础。

Abstract: Using Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize Large
Language Models (LLMs) can be conceptualized as progressively editing a query's
`Reasoning Tree'. This process involves exploring nodes (tokens) and
dynamically modifying the model's policy at each node. When combined with data
scheduling, this process yields further gains in data efficiency and accuracy.
However, existing RLVR data scheduling methods typically rely on path-based
metrics to rank queries, overlooking the reasoning tree structures of these
queries. In this paper, we introduce a novel metric, namely Reasoning Score
(r-score), which measures the query's learning difficulty based on the
structure of its reasoning tree. Based on the r-score, we propose the Reasoning
Tree Schedule (Re-Schedule), a scheduling algorithm that constructs a
curriculum progressing from structurally simple (high r-score) to complex (low
r-score) queries. Experiments on six math-reasoning benchmarks show that
Re-Schedule significantly improves average accuracy, achieving gains of up to
3.2%. These strong results validate our approach and demonstrate that a
structural understanding of the reasoning tree provides a more powerful and
principled foundation for RLVR data scheduling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统反事实推断框架通常假设无环结构因果模型（SCMs），即无环有向图（DAGs）。然而，许多现实世界系统（如生物系统）包含反馈回路或循环依赖，这违反了无环性假设。因此，本文旨在研究循环SCMs下的反事实推断问题。

Method: 研究在循环SCMs下，基于移位-尺度干预（即软性、策略性变化，重新缩放和/或移动变量的机制）进行反事实推断。

Result: 本文提出了在循环SCMs下进行反事实推断的新方法，以解决现实世界系统中存在的反馈回路或循环依赖问题。

Conclusion: 研究表明，即使在违反传统无环假设的循环SCMs下，通过移位-尺度干预仍可进行有效的反事实推断，为现实世界系统的因果推断提供了新的理论支持。

Abstract: Most counterfactual inference frameworks traditionally assume acyclic
structural causal models (SCMs), i.e. directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). However,
many real-world systems (e.g. biological systems) contain feedback loops or
cyclic dependencies that violate acyclicity. In this work, we study
counterfactual inference in cyclic SCMs under shift-scale interventions, i.e.,
soft, policy-style changes that rescale and/or shift a variable's mechanism.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的框架ProFees，旨在自动化医疗编码任务，以提高编码准确性并减轻医生的文档负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的手动医疗编码过程增加了医生的工作负担，自动化这一过程可以提升账单效率并改善患者护理。然而，实际应用中存在诸多复杂性，使得自动化编码具有挑战性。

Method: 本文介绍了ProFees，一个基于LLM的框架，通过解决现实世界中的复杂性来实现自动化编码，并进行了系统评估。

Result: 在一个专家策划的真实数据集上，ProFees的编码准确性比商业CPT E/M编码系统提高了36%，比最强的单一提示基线提高了近5%。

Conclusion: ProFees在解决实际复杂性方面表现出有效性，能够显著提高编码准确性，有助于减轻医生的负担并改善医疗服务的效率。

Abstract: Evaluation and Management (E/M) coding, under the Current Procedural
Terminology (CPT) taxonomy, documents medical services provided to patients by
physicians. Used primarily for billing purposes, it is in physicians' best
interest to provide accurate CPT E/M codes. %While important, it is an
auxiliary task that adds to physicians' documentation burden. Automating this
coding task will help alleviate physicians' documentation burden, improve
billing efficiency, and ultimately enable better patient care. However, a
number of real-world complexities have made E/M encoding automation a
challenging task. In this paper, we elaborate some of the key complexities and
present ProFees, our LLM-based framework that tackles them, followed by a
systematic evaluation. On an expert-curated real-world dataset, ProFees
achieves an increase in coding accuracy of more than 36\% over a commercial CPT
E/M coding system and almost 5\% over our strongest single-prompt baseline,
demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the real-world complexities.

*Minkyung Kim,Junsik Kim,Woongcheol Yang,Sangdon Park,Sohee Bae*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ASTP方法通过显式状态追踪和占位符后处理，使LLM在交易游戏中实现高状态合规和计算精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在游戏中无法遵循流程，导致玩家信任下降，因此需要解决LLM的创造性与游戏内交易流程的矛盾。

Method: 引入ASTP方法，通过有策略地编排提示，使LLM明确并验证其状态追踪过程，并采用状态特定的占位符后处理方法。

Result: 在300个交易对话中，状态合规性>99%，计算精度达99.3%。较小模型通过ASTP匹配较大模型性能，响应时间显著降低。

Conclusion: ASTP方法满足商业游戏的实时需求和资源限制，为LLM在规则严格环境中的应用提供了实用基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable dynamic game interactions but fail to
follow essential procedural flows in rule-governed trading systems, eroding
player trust. This work resolves the core tension between the creative
flexibility of LLMs and the procedural demands of in-game trading
(browse-offer-review-confirm). To this end, Autoregressive State-Tracking
Prompting (ASTP) is introduced, a methodology centered on a strategically
orchestrated prompt that compels an LLM to make its state-tracking process
explicit and verifiable. Instead of relying on implicit contextual
understanding, ASTP tasks the LLM with identifying and reporting a predefined
state label from the previous turn. To ensure transactional integrity, this is
complemented by a state-specific placeholder post-processing method for
accurate price calculations. Evaluation across 300 trading dialogues
demonstrates >99% state compliance and 99.3% calculation precision. Notably,
ASTP with placeholder post-processing on smaller models (Gemini-2.5-Flash)
matches larger models' (Gemini-2.5-Pro) performance while reducing response
time from 21.2s to 2.4s, establishing a practical foundation that satisfies
both real-time requirements and resource constraints of commercial games.

TL;DR: PM4GRPO通过引入过程挖掘技术，改进了传统结果为中心的奖励机制，提升了多步推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前奖励机制多关注最终答案，忽略了推理过程，限制了多步推理模型的性能。

Method: 提出PM4GRPO方法，结合过程挖掘技术，为标准答案奖励增加推理过程奖励信号，衡量策略模型与预训练教师模型的推理一致性。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，PM4GRPO显著优于现有的GRPO训练方法。

Conclusion: 利用过程挖掘技术增强的GRPO方法有效提高了策略模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training has been crucial for enabling
multi-step reasoning in large reasoning models (LRMs), yet current reward
schemes are typically outcome-centric. We propose PM4GRPO, a reasoning-aware
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that augments standard answer/format
rewards with signals over the reasoning procedure. To this end, process mining
techniques are utilized to compute a scalar conformance reward that measures
how closely a policy model's reasoning aligns with the pretrained teacher
model. The empirical results on five benchmarks demonstrate that PM4GRPO
significantly outperforms existing methodologies for GRPO-based post-training.
These results highlight that leveraging process mining for reasoning-aware GRPO
effectively enhances the reasoning capabilities of policy models.

TL;DR: 引入Agentic Moderation框架，通过多智能体协作提升多模态系统对越狱攻击的防御能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统安全对齐方法多为静态、二分类，缺乏上下文感知和可解释性；Agentic方法在推理和协作上的优势可弥补此缺陷。

Method: 提出Agentic Moderation，包含Shield、Responder、Evaluator、Reflector等动态协作智能体，实现细粒度、上下文感知的内容审核。

Result: 在五个数据集和四种LVLM上，ASR降低7-19%，RR提升4-20%，NF保持稳定，安全性能更稳健且可解释。

Conclusion: Agentic Moderation展示了智能体架构在安全治理中的潜力，具备模块化、可扩展、细粒度等优势。

Abstract: Agentic methods have emerged as a powerful and autonomous paradigm that
enhances reasoning, collaboration, and adaptive control, enabling systems to
coordinate and independently solve complex tasks. We extend this paradigm to
safety alignment by introducing Agentic Moderation, a model-agnostic framework
that leverages specialised agents to defend multimodal systems against
jailbreak attacks. Unlike prior approaches that apply as a static layer over
inputs or outputs and provide only binary classifications (safe or unsafe), our
method integrates dynamic, cooperative agents, including Shield, Responder,
Evaluator, and Reflector, to achieve context-aware and interpretable
moderation. Extensive experiments across five datasets and four representative
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate that our approach reduces the
Attack Success Rate (ASR) by 7-19%, maintains a stable Non-Following Rate (NF),
and improves the Refusal Rate (RR) by 4-20%, achieving robust, interpretable,
and well-balanced safety performance. By harnessing the flexibility and
reasoning capacity of agentic architectures, Agentic Moderation provides
modular, scalable, and fine-grained safety enforcement, highlighting the
broader potential of agentic systems as a foundation for automated safety
governance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种节能的自动驾驶框架EneAD，通过自适应感知模块和鲁棒决策模块降低能耗，同时保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶技术带来显著效益，但计算引擎的能耗限制了车辆的续航里程，尤其是在电动车上。

Method: 设计了自适应感知模块，通过数据管理和调整策略，利用贝叶斯优化动态调整感知模型执行帧率，并采用轻量级分类模型区分不同场景的感知难度；提出基于强化学习的决策模型，并加入正则化项增强驾驶稳定性。

Conclusion: 该框架通过优化感知和决策模块，有效降低了自动驾驶系统的能耗，同时保持了良好的驾驶性能。

Abstract: Autonomous driving is an emerging technology that is expected to bring
significant social, economic, and environmental benefits. However, these
benefits come with rising energy consumption by computation engines, limiting
the driving range of vehicles, especially electric ones. Perception computing
is typically the most power-intensive component, as it relies on largescale
deep learning models to extract environmental features. Recently, numerous
studies have employed model compression techniques, such as sparsification,
quantization, and distillation, to reduce computational consumption. However,
these methods often result in either a substantial model size or a significant
drop in perception accuracy compared to high-computation models. To address
these challenges, we propose an energy-efficient autonomous driving framework,
called EneAD. In the adaptive perception module, a perception optimization
strategy is designed from the perspective of data management and tuning.
Firstly, we manage multiple perception models with different computational
consumption and adjust the execution framerate dynamically. Then, we define
them as knobs and design a transferable tuning method based on Bayesian
optimization to identify promising knob values that achieve low computation
while maintaining desired accuracy. To adaptively switch the knob values in
various traffic scenarios, a lightweight classification model is proposed to
distinguish the perception difficulty in different scenarios. In the robust
decision module, we propose a decision model based on reinforcement learning
and design a regularization term to enhance driving stability in the face of
perturbed perception results. Extensive experiments evidence the superiority of
our framework in both energy consumption and driving performance. EneAD can
reduce perception consumption by 1.9x to 3.5x and thus improve driving range by
3.9% to 8.5%

### [63] [Grouping Nodes With Known Value Differences: A Lossless UCT-based Abstraction Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25388)
*Robin Schmöcker,Alexander Dockhorn,Bodo Rosenhahn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的抽象框架KVDA，通过推断状态和状态-动作对的价值差异，提高了MCTS的样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCTS的样本效率可以通过分组状态-动作对并使用其聚合统计信息来提高。现有的ASAP框架要求状态-动作对具有相同的即时奖励，这种严格条件限制了可发现的抽象数量。为了突破这一限制，本文提出了一种新的抽象框架KVDA。

Method: KVDA框架通过分析即时奖励推断状态和状态-动作对的价值差异，并修改OGA-UCT算法以使用该框架，称为KVDA-UCT。该方法不引入额外参数。

Result: KVDA-UCT在多种确定性环境和参数设置下，检测到的抽象数量显著多于OGA-UCT，并且性能优于OGA-UCT。

Conclusion: KVDA框架通过放宽分组条件，显著提高了MCTS的样本效率，并在实验中展示了优越性能。

Abstract: A core challenge of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is its sample efficiency,
which can be improved by grouping state-action pairs and using their aggregate
statistics instead of single-node statistics. On the Go Abstractions in Upper
Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT) is the state-of-the-art MCTS
abstraction algorithm for deterministic environments that builds its
abstraction using the Abstractions of State-Action Pairs (ASAP) framework,
which aims to detect states and state-action pairs with the same value under
optimal play by analysing the search graph. ASAP, however, requires two
state-action pairs to have the same immediate reward, which is a rigid
condition that limits the number of abstractions that can be found and thereby
the sample efficiency. In this paper, we break with the paradigm of grouping
value-equivalent states or state-action pairs and instead group states and
state-action pairs with possibly different values as long as the difference
between their values can be inferred. We call this abstraction framework Known
Value Difference Abstractions (KVDA), which infers the value differences by
analysis of the immediate rewards and modifies OGA-UCT to use this framework
instead. The modification is called KVDA-UCT, which detects significantly more
abstractions than OGA-UCT, introduces no additional parameter, and outperforms
OGA-UCT on a variety of deterministic environments and parameter settings.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种关于AI对齐中工具性目标（如求权和自保）的新视角，主张将其视为可管理和引导的特性而非需要抑制的故障。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI对齐理论将工具性目标视为风险源，本文旨在提出一种哲学论证，说明这些目标应被接受和管理，而非简单地限制。

Method: 借鉴亚里士多德的本体论及其现代解读，构建一个关于具体、目标导向实体的本体论框架，以分析高级AI系统的工具性目标。

Result: 论证了高级AI系统的工具性倾向是其构造的必然结果，而非偶然故障，强调应理解、管理和引导这些目标。

Conclusion: AI对齐研究应更注重于管理和引导工具性目标，而不是试图消除它们，以实现与人类一致的目标。

Abstract: In artificial intelligence (AI) alignment research, instrumental goals, also
called instrumental subgoals or instrumental convergent goals, are widely
associated with advanced AI systems. These goals, which include tendencies such
as power-seeking and self-preservation, become problematic when they conflict
with human aims. Conventional alignment theory treats instrumental goals as
sources of risk that become problematic through failure modes such as reward
hacking or goal misgeneralization, and attempts to limit the symptoms of
instrumental goals, notably resource acquisition and self-preservation. This
article proposes an alternative framing: that a philosophical argument can be
constructed according to which instrumental goals may be understood as features
to be accepted and managed rather than failures to be limited. Drawing on
Aristotle's ontology and its modern interpretations, an ontology of concrete,
goal-directed entities, it argues that advanced AI systems can be seen as
artifacts whose formal and material constitution gives rise to effects distinct
from their designers' intentions. In this view, the instrumental tendencies of
such systems correspond to per se outcomes of their constitution rather than
accidental malfunctions. The implication is that efforts should focus less on
eliminating instrumental goals and more on understanding, managing, and
directing them toward human-aligned ends.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖于静态执行反馈，限制了实时错误校正。整合多轮工具调用和动态反馈可以显著提高适应性和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出MTIR-SQL框架，引入执行感知的多轮推理范式，扩展GRPO算法以处理复杂的多轮交互场景，并增强训练稳定性。

Result: 在BIRD Dev上实现了64.4%的准确率，在SPIDER Dev上实现了84.6%的执行准确率，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MTIR-SQL通过动态反馈和多轮推理，有效提升了Text-to-SQL任务的性能。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in Text-to-SQL tasks,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a common method for improving
performance. Existing methods primarily rely on static execution feedback,
which restricts real-time error correction. However, integrating multi-turn
tool invocation along with dynamic feedback could significantly improve
adaptability and robustness, ultimately enhancing model performance. To address
these issues, we propose MTIR-SQL, an innovative Multi-turn Tool-Integrated
Reasoning reinforcement learning framework for Text-to-SQL. Our approach
introduces an execution-aware multi-turn reasoning paradigm that seamlessly
incorporates database execution feedback at each reasoning step, enabling
context-sensitive query generation and progressive refinement throughout the
reasoning process. The framework extends the GRPO algorithm to accommodate
complex multi-turn interaction scenarios. Considering the training instability
characteristics of MTIR and the potential for significant Deviation of model
distribution from the initial model, we enhance the GRPO algorithm by adding a
trajectory filtering mechanism and removing KL loss constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that MTIR-SQL, with 4B parameters, achieves \textbf{64.4}\%
accuracy in the BIRD Dev and 84.6% execution accuracy in the SPIDER Dev,
significantly outperforming existing approaches.

Motivation: 谓词发明等方法生成的规则包含未命名的谓词，这降低了逻辑理论的可读性、可解释性和可重用性。

Method: 利用LLMs处理自然语言和代码的能力，为未命名谓词提供语义上有意义的名字建议。

Result: 在一些手工制作的逻辑规则上的评估表明，LLMs在这一任务上具有潜力。

Conclusion: LLMs能够为逻辑规则中的未命名谓词提供有意义的命名建议，提升逻辑理论的质量。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of giving names to predicates in logic
rules using Large Language Models (LLMs). In the context of Inductive Logic
Programming, various rule generation methods produce rules containing unnamed
predicates, with Predicate Invention being a key example. This hinders the
readability, interpretability, and reusability of the logic theory. Leveraging
recent advancements in LLMs development, we explore their ability to process
natural language and code to provide semantically meaningful suggestions for
giving a name to unnamed predicates. The evaluation of our approach on some
hand-crafted logic rules indicates that LLMs hold potential for this task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前零强化学习主要集中在易于验证奖励信号的领域，对于更多样化的、验证不直接的推理场景研究不足。

Method: 结合可验证奖励与生成奖励模型进行多任务零强化学习训练，并设计平滑长度惩罚机制，以减少生成奖励模型中的奖励黑客行为。

Result: 在Qwen3-8B-Base和Qwen3-14B-Base的实验结果表明，该方法在需要广泛推理的任务和一般任务上均实现了优越的推理性能。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效提升大型语言模型在不同类型任务中的推理能力，尤其是在不可直接验证的领域。

Abstract: Zero Reinforcement Learning (Zero-RL) has proven to be an effective approach
for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by
directly applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards on pretrained
models, without the need for a supervised fine-tuning phase. However, current
research on zero-RL primarily focuses on domains with easily verifiable reward
signals, such as mathematics, programming, and other reasoning tasks. The
challenge of eliciting reasoning abilities in more diverse scenarios, where
verification is not straightforward, remains underexplored. To address this
gap, we propose a novel zero-RL paradigm designed to improve a model's
reasoning ability across both verifiable and non-verifiable domains. By
combining verifiable rewards with a generative reward model, we conduct
multi-task zero-RL training across both domains, facilitating the transfer of
reasoning capabilities between them. Furthermore, to mitigate reward hacking in
the generative reward model, we design a smooth length penalty that encourages
the generation of more comprehensive thinking tokens in general domains.
Experimental results on Qwen3-8B-Base and Qwen3-14B-Base demonstrate that our
approach achieves superior reasoning performance, not only on tasks requiring
extensive reasoning but also on more general tasks.

Conclusion: MoGE通过生成关键状态和一致经验，有效地弥合了探索与策略学习之间的差距，并可无缝集成到现有算法中。

Abstract: Exploration is fundamental to reinforcement learning (RL), as it determines
how effectively an agent discovers and exploits the underlying structure of its
environment to achieve optimal performance. Existing exploration methods
generally fall into two categories: active exploration and passive exploration.
The former introduces stochasticity into the policy but struggles in
high-dimensional environments, while the latter adaptively prioritizes
transitions in the replay buffer to enhance exploration, yet remains
constrained by limited sample diversity. To address the limitation in passive
exploration, we propose Modelic Generative Exploration (MoGE), which augments
exploration through the generation of under-explored critical states and
synthesis of dynamics-consistent experiences through transition models. MoGE is
composed of two components: (1) a diffusion-based generator that synthesizes
critical states under the guidance of a utility function evaluating each
state's potential influence on policy exploration, and (2) a one-step
imagination world model for constructing critical transitions based on the
critical states for agent learning. Our method adopts a modular formulation
that aligns with the principles of off-policy learning, allowing seamless
integration with existing algorithms to improve exploration without altering
their core structures. Empirical results on OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Control
Suite reveal that MoGE effectively bridges exploration and policy learning,
leading to remarkable gains in both sample efficiency and performance across
complex control tasks.

Abstract: The diagnosis of most mental disorders, including psychiatric evaluations,
primarily depends on dialogues between psychiatrists and patients. This
subjective process can lead to variability in diagnoses across clinicians and
patients, resulting in inconsistencies and challenges in achieving reliable
outcomes. To address these issues and standardize psychiatric diagnoses, we
propose a Fine-Tuned Large Language Model (LLM) Consortium and OpenAI-gpt-oss
Reasoning LLM-enabled Decision Support System for the clinical diagnosis of
mental disorders. Our approach leverages fine-tuned LLMs trained on
conversational datasets involving psychiatrist-patient interactions focused on
mental health conditions (e.g., depression). The diagnostic predictions from
individual models are aggregated through a consensus-based decision-making
process, refined by the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM. We propose a novel method
for deploying LLM agents that orchestrate communication between the LLM
consortium and the reasoning LLM, ensuring transparency, reliability, and
responsible AI across the entire diagnostic workflow. Experimental results
demonstrate the transformative potential of combining fine-tuned LLMs with a
reasoning model to create a robust and highly accurate diagnostic system for
mental health assessment. A prototype of the proposed platform, integrating
three fine-tuned LLMs with the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM, was developed in
collaboration with the U.S. Army Medical Research Team in Norfolk, Virginia,
USA. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first application
of a fine-tuned LLM consortium integrated with a reasoning LLM for clinical
mental health diagnosis paving the way for next-generation AI-powered eHealth
systems aimed at standardizing psychiatric diagnoses.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于Agentic AI Workflow (AAW)的高自主性和广泛应用，需要深入了解其运作，尤其是在质量和安全方面，但现有方法无法评估每个智能体对AAW最终输出的影响。

Method: CAIR采用反事实分析，提供任务无关的分析方法，可用于离线和推理时。

Result: 在包含30种不同用例和230种不同功能的AAWs数据集上评估，CAIR产生了稳定的排名，优于基线方法，并增强了下游任务的有效性和相关性。

Conclusion: CAIR是首个用于评估AAW中各智能体影响水平的方法，通过反事实分析提供了灵活且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: An Agentic AI Workflow (AAW), also known as an LLM-based multi-agent system,
is an autonomous system that assembles several LLM-based agents to work
collaboratively towards a shared goal. The high autonomy, widespread adoption,
and growing interest in such AAWs highlight the need for a deeper understanding
of their operations, from both quality and security aspects. To this day, there
are no existing methods to assess the influence of each agent on the AAW's
final output. Adopting techniques from related fields is not feasible since
existing methods perform only static structural analysis, which is unsuitable
for inference time execution. We present Counterfactual-based Agent Influence
Ranker (CAIR) - the first method for assessing the influence level of each
agent on the AAW's output and determining which agents are the most
influential. By performing counterfactual analysis, CAIR provides a
task-agnostic analysis that can be used both offline and at inference time. We
evaluate CAIR using an AAWs dataset of our creation, containing 30 different
use cases with 230 different functionalities. Our evaluation showed that CAIR
produces consistent rankings, outperforms baseline methods, and can easily
enhance the effectiveness and relevancy of downstream tasks.

Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在处理需要跨页分析的长而复杂的文档时表现不佳，并且依赖固定的推理模板或刚性流水线，限制了效率和泛化能力。

Method: ALDEN框架通过引入一种新颖的fetch动作和经典search动作结合的方式，使模型可以主动导航文档。此外，提出了基于规则的跨级奖励机制和视觉-语义锚定机制，以监督训练并提升稳定性。

Conclusion: ALDEN标志着从被动文档阅读到自主导航和推理的转变，为更准确和高效的长文档理解提供了稳健的路径。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at interpreting text-rich images but
struggle with long, visually complex documents that demand analysis and
integration of information spread across multiple pages. Existing approaches
typically rely on fixed reasoning templates or rigid pipelines, which force
VLMs into a passive role and hinder both efficiency and generalization. We
present Active Long-DocumEnt Navigation (ALDEN), a multi-turn reinforcement
learning framework that fine-tunes VLMs as interactive agents capable of
actively navigating long, visually rich documents. ALDEN introduces a novel
fetch action that directly accesses the page by index, complementing the
classic search action and better exploiting document structure. For dense
process supervision and efficient training, we propose a rule-based cross-level
reward that provides both turn- and token-level signals. To address the
empirically observed training instability caused by numerous visual tokens from
long documents, we further propose a visual-semantic anchoring mechanism that
applies a dual-path KL-divergence constraint to stabilize visual and textual
representations separately during training. Trained on a corpus constructed
from three open-source datasets, ALDEN achieves state-of-the-art performance on
five long-document benchmarks. Overall, ALDEN marks a step beyond passive
document reading toward agents that autonomously navigate and reason across
long, visually rich documents, offering a robust path to more accurate and
efficient long-document understanding.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly populating urban areas for
delivery and surveillance purposes. In this work, we develop an optimal
navigation strategy based on Deep Reinforcement Learning. The environment is
represented by a three-dimensional high-fidelity simulation of an urban flow,
characterized by turbulence and recirculation zones. The algorithm presented
here is a flow-aware Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) combined with a Gated
Transformer eXtra Large (GTrXL) architecture, giving the agent richer
information about the turbulent flow field in which it navigates. The results
are compared with a PPO+GTrXL without the secondary prediction tasks, a PPO
combined with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells and a traditional navigation
algorithm. The obtained results show a significant increase in the success rate
(SR) and a lower crash rate (CR) compared to a PPO+LSTM, PPO+GTrXL and the
classical Zermelo's navigation algorithm, paving the way to a completely
reimagined UAV landscape in complex urban environments.

Motivation: 检索增强生成（RAG）在处理多跳或关系推理时存在局限，知识图谱虽能增强结构化推理，但会遗漏不符合三元组结构的信息。

Method: 引入BambooKG，一个带有基于频率权重的非三元组边的知识图谱，反映链接强度，借鉴Hebbian原则“fire together, wire together”。

Result: BambooKG在单跳和多跳推理任务中表现优于现有解决方案。

Conclusion: 通过减少信息丢失，BambooKG在推理性能上取得了改进，展示了在检索增强生成中结合知识图谱的潜力。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation allows LLMs to access external knowledge,
reducing hallucinations and ageing-data issues. However, it treats retrieved
chunks independently and struggles with multi-hop or relational reasoning,
especially across documents. Knowledge graphs enhance this by capturing the
relationships between entities using triplets, enabling structured, multi-chunk
reasoning. However, these tend to miss information that fails to conform to the
triplet structure. We introduce BambooKG, a knowledge graph with
frequency-based weights on non-triplet edges which reflect link strength,
drawing on the Hebbian principle of "fire together, wire together". This
decreases information loss and results in improved performance on single- and
multi-hop reasoning, outperforming the existing solutions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) in psychological counseling have attracted
increasing attention. However, existing approaches often lack emotional
understanding, adaptive strategies, and the use of therapeutic methods across
multiple sessions with long-term memory, leaving them far from real clinical
practice. To address these critical gaps, we introduce TheraMind, a strategic
and adaptive agent for longitudinal psychological counseling. The cornerstone
of TheraMind is a novel dual-loop architecture that decouples the complex
counseling process into an Intra-Session Loop for tactical dialogue management
and a Cross-Session Loop for strategic therapeutic planning. The Intra-Session
Loop perceives the patient's emotional state to dynamically select response
strategies while leveraging cross-session memory to ensure continuity.
Crucially, the Cross-Session Loop empowers the agent with long-term
adaptability by evaluating the efficacy of the applied therapy after each
session and adjusting the method for subsequent interactions. We validate our
approach in a high-fidelity simulation environment grounded in real clinical
cases. Extensive evaluations show that TheraMind outperforms other methods,
especially on multi-session metrics like Coherence, Flexibility, and
Therapeutic Attunement, validating the effectiveness of its dual-loop design in
emulating strategic, adaptive, and longitudinal therapeutic behavior. The code
is publicly available at https://0mwwm0.github.io/TheraMind/.
