We propose Complexity\nOut of Distribution (Complexity OoD) generalization as a framework and problem\nsetting to define and measure reasoning. A model exhibits Complexity OoD\ngeneralization when it maintains performance on test instances whose minimal\nrequired solution complexity, either representational (richer solution\nstructure) or computational (more reasoning steps/program length), exceeds that\nof all training examples. We formalize complexity via solution description\nKolmogorov complexity and operational proxies (e.g., object/relation counts;\nreasoning step counts), clarifying how Complexity OoD differs from length and\ncompositional OoD. This lens unifies learning and reasoning: many cases\nsolvable with System1 like processing at low complexity become System2 like\nunder complexity pressure, while System2 can be viewed as generalization over\nsolution structures. We translate this perspective into practice with\nrecommendations for operationalizing Complexity OoD across the stack:\nincorporating complexity into benchmark and evaluation metric design,\nrethinking supervision to target solution traces, seeking and designing\ninductive biases for Complexity OoD generalization, addressing learning to\nreason spillovers such as spurious shortcuts, semantic robustness, catastrophic\nforgetting, and step wise calibration.

This transparency also opens a promising\ndirection: multiple reasoners can directly collaborate on each other's thinking\nwithin a shared trajectory, yielding better inference efficiency and\nexploration. A key prerequisite, however, is the ability to assess the\nusefulness and build on another model's partial thinking -- we call this\noff-trajectory reasoning. Our paper investigates a critical question: can\nstandard solo-reasoning training pipelines deliver desired off-trajectory\nbehaviors? We propose twin tests that capture the two extremes of the\noff-trajectory spectrum, namely Recoverability, which tests whether LLMs can\nbacktrack from \"distractions\" induced by misleading reasoning traces, and\nGuidability, which tests their ability to build upon correct reasoning from\nstronger collaborators. Our study evaluates 15 open-weight LLMs (1.5B-32B) and\nreveals a counterintuitive finding -- \"stronger\" LLMs on benchmarks are often\nmore fragile under distraction. Moreover, all models tested fail to effectively\nleverage guiding steps from collaborators on problems beyond their inherent\ncapabilities with solve rates remaining under 9.2%. Finally, we conduct control\nstudies to isolate the effects of three factors in post-training on these\nbehaviors: the choice of distillation teacher, the use of RL, and data\nselection strategy. Our results provide actionable insights for training\nnatively strong reasoning collaborators; e.g., we find that suboptimal\nrecoverability behaviors of teacher models are transferred to distilled\nstudents even if the distillation trajectories are correct. Taken together,\nthis work lays the groundwork for evaluating multi-model collaborations in\nshared reasoning trajectories and highlights the limitations of off-the-shelf\nreasoning LLMs."}

It synthesizes agentic\nsearch trajectories that exhibit these four behaviors and integrates them into\nthe agentic search model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by\nstandard reinforcement learning (RL). Experiments on three benchmarks (GAIA,\nWebWalker, and HLE) demonstrate that behavior priming yields over 35% gains in\nLlama3.2-3B and Qwen3-1.7B compared to directly training agentic search models\nwith RL.

Recently, diffusion models have emerged as a\npowerful paradigm for both visual and textual generation. Existing approaches\ncan be broadly categorized into classifier-free guidance (CFG) and classifier\nguidance (CG) methods. While CFG effectively preserves semantic content, it\noften fails to provide effective attribute control. In contrast, CG modifies\nthe denoising trajectory using classifier gradients, enabling better attribute\nalignment but incurring high computational costs during sampling and suffering\nfrom classifier generalization issues. In this work, we propose RegDiff, a\nregularized diffusion framework that leverages attribute features without\nrequiring a pretrained classifier during sampling, thereby achieving\ncontrollable generation with reduced computational costs. Specifically, RegDiff\nemploys a VAE-based encoder--decoder architecture to ensure reconstruction\nfidelity and a latent diffusion model trained with attribute supervision to\nenable controllable text generation. Attribute information is injected only\nduring training. Experiments on five datasets spanning multiple stylistic\nattributes demonstrate that RegDiff outperforms strong baselines in generating\nstylistic texts.

To\naddress this, we introduce MingTok, a new family of visual tokenizers with a\ncontinuous latent space, for unified autoregressive generation and\nunderstanding. While understanding tasks favor discriminative high-dimensional\nfeatures, generation tasks prefer compact low-level codes. Thus, to reconcile\nthese competing demands, MingTok adopts a three-stage sequential architecture\ninvolving low-level encoding, semantic expansion, and visual reconstruction.\nBuilt on top of it, Ming-UniVision eliminates the need for task-specific visual\nrepresentations, and unifies diverse vision-language tasks under a single\nautoregrsssive prediction paradigm. By formulating both understanding and\ngeneration as next-token prediction in a shared continuous space, it seamlessly\nsupports multi-round, in-context tasks such as iterative understanding,\ngeneration and editing. Empirically, we find that using a unified continuous\nvisual representation reconciles the competing requirements on the tokenizers\nby the understanding and generation tasks, thereby leading to state-of-the-art\nlevel performance across both domains.

Prompts for LLMs generally comprise two components:\nthe \\textit{instruction}, which defines the task or objective, and the\n\\textit{input}, which is tailored to the instruction type. In natural language\ngeneration (NLG) tasks such as machine translation, the \\textit{input}\ncomponent is particularly critical, while the \\textit{instruction} component\ntends to be concise. Existing prompt engineering methods primarily focus on\noptimizing the \\textit{instruction} component for general tasks, often\nrequiring large-parameter LLMs as auxiliary tools. However, these approaches\nexhibit limited applicability for tasks like machine translation, where the\n\\textit{input} component plays a more pivotal role.

In this paper, we address the\nproblem of training land-cover classifiers using high-resolution imagery (e.g.,\nSentinel-2) and weak low-resolution reference data (e.g., MODIS -derived\nland-cover maps). Inspired by recent works in Deep Multiple Instance Learning\n(DMIL), we propose a method that trains pixel-level multi-class classifiers and\npredicts low-resolution labels (i.e., patch-level classification), where the\nactual high-resolution labels are learned implicitly without direct\nsupervision. This is achieved with flexible pooling layers that are able to\nlink the semantics of the pixels in the high-resolution imagery to the\nlow-resolution reference labels. Then, the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)\nproblem is re-framed in a multi-class and in a multi-label setting. In the\nformer, the low-resolution annotation represents the majority of the pixels in\nthe patch. In the latter, the annotation only provides us information on the\npresence of one of the land-cover classes in the patch and thus multiple labels\ncan be considered valid for a patch at a time, whereas the low-resolution\nlabels provide us only one label.

Using this dataset, we demonstrate\nthe insensitivities of existing evaluation metrics to key information errors.\nTo address this gap, we introduce VITAL, a set of metrics that provide greater\nsensitivity in measuring the factuality of responses by incorporating the\nrelevance and importance of claims with respect to the query.

While reliable, such binary feedback is brittle--many\ntasks admit partially correct or alternative answers that verifiers\nunder-credit, and the resulting all-or-nothing supervision limits learning.\nReward models offer richer, continuous feedback, which can serve as a\ncomplementary supervisory signal to verifiers. We introduce HERO (Hybrid\nEnsemble Reward Optimization), a reinforcement learning framework that\nintegrates verifier signals with reward-model scores in a structured way. HERO\nemploys stratified normalization to bound reward-model scores within\nverifier-defined groups, preserving correctness while refining quality\ndistinctions, and variance-aware weighting to emphasize challenging prompts\nwhere dense signals matter most. Across diverse mathematical reasoning\nbenchmarks, HERO consistently outperforms RM-only and verifier-only baselines,\nwith strong gains on both verifiable and hard-to-verify tasks.

This naturally leads to a question: As\nenvironmental action space scales, what is the optimal action representation\nfor long-horizon agents? In this paper, we systematically study the\neffectiveness of two different action representations. The first one is\nconventional planning with actions (PwA) which is predominantly adopted for its\neffectiveness on existing benchmarks. The other one is planning with schemas\n(PwS) which instantiate an action schema into action lists (e.g., \"move [OBJ]\nto [OBJ]\" -> \"move apple to desk\") to ensure concise action space and reliable\nscalability.
