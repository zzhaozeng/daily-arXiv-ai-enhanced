However, common pseudo-label selection heuristics are largely text-centric (e.g., perplexity (PPL) filtering) and can prefer fluent yet acoustically mismatched hypotheses, leading to error amplification when fine-tuning. To address this, we introduce a multimodal consistency-guided, reference-free data selection pipeline for ASR accent adaptation under a transductive, label-free protocol. The pipeline starts with a target-aware preselection step based on submodular mutual information to improve query relevance and reduce downstream computation. It then generates multiple pseudo-transcriptions per utterance via perturbation-based decoding and scores each hypothesis using two reference-free signals: speech--text alignment in a shared embedding space and predicted word error rate (WER). A simple percentile-based selection rule retains reliable pseudo-labels for fine-tuning while discarding noisy utterances. In an in-domain setting, selecting ~1.5k utterances from a 30k pool achieves 10.91% WER, close to 10.45% obtained using 30k supervised labels. In a cross-domain setting with a mismatched candidate pool, consistency-filtered subsets avoid the degradation caused by unfiltered pseudo-labels under strong accent shift, and matched-hour experiments on a stronger ASR backbone further confirm gains over random sampling and recent selection baselines."}

This work examines the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs and machine translation systems in crisis-domain translation, with a focus on preserving urgency, which is a critical property for effective crisis communication and triaging. Using multilingual crisis data and a newly introduced urgency-annotated dataset covering over 32 languages, we show that both dedicated translation models and LLMs exhibit substantial performance degradation and instability. Crucially, even linguistically adequate translations can distort perceived urgency, and LLM-based urgency classifications vary widely depending on the language of the prompt and input. These findings highlight significant risks in deploying general-purpose language technologies for crisis communication and underscore the need for crisis-aware evaluation frameworks."}

Badger"], "title": "Language Model Memory and Memory Models for Language", "comment": null, "summary": "The ability of machine learning models to store input information in hidden layer vector embeddings, analogous to the concept of `memory', is widely employed but not well characterized. We find that language model embeddings typically contain relatively little input information regardless of data and compute scale during training. In contrast, embeddings from autoencoders trained for input regeneration are capable of nearly perfect memory formation. The substitution of memory embeddings for token sequences leads to substantial computational efficiencies, motivating the introduction of a parallelizable encoder-decoder memory model architecture. Upon causal training these models contain information-poor embeddings incapable of arbitrary information access, but by combining causal and information retention objective functions they learn to form and decode information-rich memories. Training can be further streamlined by freezing a high fidelity encoder followed by a curriculum training approach where decoders first learn to process memories and then learn to additionally predict next tokens. We introduce the perspective that next token prediction training alone is poorly suited for accurate memory formation as the objective itself is non-invertible, motivating the use of combined objective functions for models where the entire input is not exposed."}

This study addresses that gap by fine-tuning a Turkish-specific BERT model (dbmdz/bert-base-turkish-cased) on a labeled dataset of 3,600 articles from three major Turkish outlets with distinct editorial orientations for binary classification of AI-rewritten content. The model achieves 0.9708 F1 score on the held-out test set with symmetric precision and recall across both classes. Subsequent deployment on over 3,500 unseen articles spanning between 2023 and 2026 reveals consistent cross-source and temporally stable classification patterns, with mean prediction confidence exceeding 0.96 and an estimated 2.5 percentage of examined news content rewritten or revised by LLMs on average.

However, recent findings suggest that raw token counts are unreliable proxies for reasoning quality: increased generation length does not consistently correlate with accuracy and may instead signal \"overthinking,\" leading to performance degradation. In this work, we quantify inference-time effort by identifying deep-thinking tokens -- tokens where internal predictions undergo significant revisions in deeper model layers prior to convergence. Across four challenging mathematical and scientific benchmarks (AIME 24/25, HMMT 25, and GPQA-diamond) and a diverse set of reasoning-focused models (GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen3), we show that deep-thinking ratio (the proportion of deep-thinking tokens in a generated sequence) exhibits a robust and consistently positive correlation with accuracy, substantially outperforming both length-based and confidence-based baselines. Leveraging this insight, we introduce Think@n, a test-time scaling strategy that prioritizes samples with high deep-thinking ratios. We demonstrate that Think@n matches or exceeds standard self-consistency performance while significantly reducing inference costs by enabling the early rejection of unpromising generations based on short prefixes."}

Prior work on LLM calibration largely focuses on response-level confidence, which estimates the correctness of a single generated output. However, this formulation is misaligned with many practical settings where the central question is how likely a model is to solve a query overall. We show that this mismatch results from the stochastic nature of modern LLM decoding, under which single-response correctness fails to reflect underlying model capability. To address this issue, we introduce capability calibration, which targets the model's expected accuracy on a query. We formally distinguish capability calibration from response calibration and show that the two differ both theoretically and empirically. We establish an empirical evaluation setup and study a range of confidence estimation methods. Our results demonstrate that capability-calibrated confidence improves pass@$k$ prediction and inference budget allocation, establishing a foundation with potential for diverse applications."}

In this work, we propose FLIP (FLipped Inference for Prompt reconstruction), a reference-free and rubric-free reward modeling approach that reformulates reward modeling through backward inference: inferring the instruction that would most plausibly produce a given response. The similarity between the inferred and the original instructions is then used as the reward signal. Evaluations across four domains using 13 small language models show that FLIP outperforms LLM-as-a-Judge baselines by an average of 79.6%. Moreover, FLIP substantially improves downstream performance in extrinsic evaluations under test-time scaling via parallel sampling and GRPO training. We further find that FLIP is particularly effective for longer outputs and robust to common forms of reward hacking. By explicitly exploiting the validation-generation gap, FLIP enables reliable reward modeling in downscaled regimes where judgment methods fail. Code available at https://github.com/yikee/FLIP."}

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this by integrating external knowledge, but its efficacy depends on accurate document retrieval and ranking. Although existing rerankers demonstrate effectiveness, they frequently necessitate specialized training, impose substantial computational expenses, and fail to fully exploit the semantic capabilities of LLMs, particularly their inherent confidence signals. We propose the LLM-Confidence Reranker (LCR), a training-free, plug-and-play algorithm that enhances reranking in RAG systems by leveraging black-box LLM confidence derived from Maximum Semantic Cluster Proportion (MSCP). LCR employs a two-stage process: confidence assessment via multinomial sampling and clustering, followed by binning and multi-level sorting based on query and document confidence thresholds. This approach prioritizes relevant documents while preserving original rankings for high-confidence queries, ensuring robustness. Evaluated on BEIR and TREC benchmarks with BM25 and Contriever retrievers, LCR--using only 7--9B-parameter pre-trained LLMs--consistently improves NDCG@5 by up to 20.6% across pre-trained LLM and fine-tuned Transformer rerankers, without degradation. Ablation studies validate the hypothesis that LLM confidence positively correlates with document relevance, elucidating LCR's mechanism. LCR offers computational efficiency, parallelism for scalability, and broad compatibility, mitigating hallucinations in applications like medical diagnosis."}

Our approach makes two key innovations: (1) eliminating Bradley-Terry model dependencies by learning directly from binary win/loss outcomes in pairwise competitions, and (2) implementing Elo-orchestrated opponent selection that provides automatic curriculum learning through temperature-controlled sampling. We ground our approach in PAC learning theory, demonstrating that pairwise comparison achieves superior sample complexity and empirically validate a 4.5x noise reduction compared to absolute scoring approaches. Experimentally, we train a Qwen2.5-7B model using our framework with opponents including Qwen2.5-14B, Qwen2.5-32B, and Qwen3-8B models.

Moreover, previous psycholinguistic and computational approaches overlooked the temporal dimension, although many literary metaphors were coined centuries apart from contemporary readers. This study innovatively applies tools from diachronic distributional semantics to assess whether the processing costs of literary metaphors varied over time and genre. Specifically, we trained word embeddings on literary and nonliterary Italian corpora from the 19th and 21st centuries, for a total of 124 million tokens, and modeled changes in the semantic similarity between topics and vehicles of 515 19th-century literary metaphors, taking this measure as a proxy of metaphor processing demands. Overall, semantic similarity, and hence metaphor processing demands, remained stable over time. However, genre played a key role: metaphors appeared more difficult (i.e., lower topic-vehicle similarity) in modern literary contexts than in 19th-century literature, but easier (i.e., higher topic-vehicle similarity) in today's nonliterary language (e.g., the Web) than in 19th-century nonliterary texts. This pattern was further shaped by semantic features of metaphors' individual terms, such as vector coherence and semantic neighborhood density. Collectively, these findings align with broader linguistic changes in Italian, such as the stylistic simplification of modern literature, which may have increased metaphor processing demands, and the high creativity of the Web's language, which seems to render metaphor more accessible."}

We utilise an dataset of annotated political debates to establish a new standard encompassing four distinct rephrase functions: Deintensification, Intensification, Specification, Generalisation, and Other, which covers all remaining types (D-I-S-G-O). We then evaluate two parallel LLM-based agent systems: one enhanced by argumentation theory via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and an identical zero-shot baseline. The results reveal a clear performance gap: the RAG-enhanced agents substantially outperform the baseline across the board, with particularly strong advantages in detecting Intensification and Generalisation context, yielding an overall Macro F1-score improvement of nearly 30\\%.

Existing methods mainly rely on cross-modal alignment or inference-time prompting with Vision--Language Models (VLMs). These approaches do not explicitly learn structured event representations and often produce weak argument grounding in multimodal settings. To address these limitations, we propose RMPL, a Relation-aware Multi-task Progressive Learning framework for MEE under low-resource conditions. RMPL incorporates heterogeneous supervision from unimodal event extraction and multimedia relation extraction with stage-wise training. The model is first trained with a unified schema to learn shared event-centric representations across modalities.

It analyzes learner errors across two developmental stages. Stage 1 data reveal a dominant influence of L1 transfer, particularly in phonological and structural mismatches, while stage 2 data demonstrate increased learner sensitivity to UG properties and morphological reconfiguration toward the target language. Findings reveal that errors in irregular inflectional morphology are attributed to both interlingual and intralingual sources, with overgeneralization of L2 rules as a common developmental strategy. Statistical analysis, including a one-way ANOVA, indicates significant improvement in the production of well-formed irregular inflections from stage 1 to stage 2, underscoring learners' continued access to UG. However, persistent difficulties with consonant change, zero-morpheme, and -a plural inflections suggest that limited exposure, ineffective input modeling, and insufficient instructional quality constrain full UG access. The study concludes that while L1 transfer and L2 developmental factors influence initial stages of acquisition, appropriate linguistic input and instruction are critical for facilitating UG-driven feature reassembly in adult L2 learners."}

However, they still struggle to comprehend and respond to the true user needs when intentions and instructions are imprecisely conveyed, leading to a divergence between subjective user believes and true environment states. Resolving this epistemic divergence requires Theory of Mind (ToM), yet existing ToM evaluations for LLMs primarily focus on isolated belief inference, overlooking its functional utility in real-world interaction. To this end, we formalize ToM for LLMs as a mechanism for epistemic divergence detection and resolution, and propose a benchmark, \\benchname, to assess how models reconcile user beliefs and profiles in practice. Results across 11 leading models reveal a significant limitation to identify underlying cognitive gaps that impede task success. To bridge this gap, we further curate a trajectory-based ToM dataset linking belief tracking with task-related state inference. The model trained on this data via reinforcement learning shows consistent improvement in reasoning about user mental states, leading to enhanced downstream performance. Our work highlights the practical value of ToM as an essential interaction-level mechanism rather than as a standalone reasoning skill."}

This relies upon a small draft model, tasked with predicting the outputs of the target model. State-of-the-art speculative decoding methods use a draft model consisting of a single decoder layer and output embedding matrix, with the latter dominating drafting time for the latest LMs. Recent work has sought to address this output distribution bottleneck by reducing the vocabulary of the draft model. Although this can improve throughput, it compromises speculation effectiveness when the target token is out-of-vocabulary. In this paper, we argue for vocabulary speculation as an alternative to a reduced vocabulary. We propose SpecVocab, an efficient and effective method that selects a vocabulary subset per decoding step. Across a variety of tasks, we demonstrate that SpecVocab can achieve a higher acceptance length than state-of-the-art speculative decoding approach, EAGLE-3. Notably, this yields up to an 8.1% increase in average throughput over EAGLE-3."}

As these models become a transformative force in artificial intelligence, there is an urgent need to move beyond general-purpose architectures toward systems that are contextually aware, inherently safer, and deeply respectful of global cultural nuances. This research navigates three interconnected threads: domain adaptation to ensure technical precision, ethical rigor to mitigate adversarial vulnerabilities, and cultural/multilingual alignment to promote global inclusivity. The methodological trajectory moves from classical supervised adaptation for task-specific demands to decoding-time alignment for safety, finally leveraging human feedback and preference modeling to achieve sociolinguistic acuity."}

Evidence increasingly shows they do not. We synthesize recent findings indicating that (i) safety guardrails weaken sharply on low-resource and code-mixed inputs, (ii) culturally harmful behavior can persist even when standard toxicity scores look acceptable, and (iii) English-only knowledge edits and safety patches often fail to carry over to low-resource languages. In response, we outline a practical agenda for researchers and students in the Global South: parameter-efficient safety steering, culturally grounded evaluation and preference data, and participatory workflows that empower local communities to define and mitigate harm.

While widely studied for large language models, the optimization of RAG for Small Language Models (SLMs) remains a critical research gap, particularly in complex, multi-hop question-answering tasks that require sophisticated reasoning. In these systems, prompt template design is a crucial yet under-explored factor influencing performance. This paper presents a large-scale empirical study to investigate this factor, evaluating 24 different prompt templates on the HotpotQA dataset. The set includes a standard RAG prompt, nine well-formed techniques from the literature, and 14 novel hybrid variants, all tested on two prominent SLMs: Qwen2.5-3B Instruct and Gemma3-4B-It. Our findings, based on a test set of 18720 instances, reveal significant performance gains of up to 83% on Qwen2.5 and 84.5% on Gemma3-4B-It, yielding an improvement of up to 6% for both models compared to the Standard RAG prompt. This research also offers concrete analysis and actionable recommendations for designing effective and efficient prompts for SLM-based RAG systems, practically for deployment in resource-constrained environments."}

On the other hand, ATR models trained to produce normalized outputs have been shown to struggle to adapt to new domains and tend to over-normalize and hallucinate. We introduce the task of Pre-Editorial Normalization (PEN), which consists in normalizing graphemic ATR output according to editorial conventions, which has the advantage of keeping an intermediate step with palaeographic fidelity while providing a normalized version for practical usability. We present a new dataset derived from the CoMMA corpus and aligned with digitized Old French and Latin editions using passim. We also produce a manually corrected gold-standard evaluation set. We benchmark this resource using ByT5-based sequence-to-sequence models on normalization and pre-annotation tasks. Our contributions include the formal definition of PEN, a 4.66M-sample silver training corpus, a 1.8k-sample gold evaluation set, and a normalization model achieving a 6.7% CER, substantially outperforming previous models for this task."}

However, community-led analyses have raised concerns that HLE contains a non-trivial number of noisy items, which can bias evaluation results and distort cross-model comparisons. To address this challenge, we introduce HLE-Verified, a verified and revised version of HLE with a transparent verification protocol and fine-grained error taxonomy. Our construction follows a two-stage validation-and-repair workflow resulting in a certified benchmark. In Stage I, each item undergoes binary validation of the problem and final answer through domain-expert review and model-based cross-checks, yielding 641 verified items. In Stage II, flawed but fixable items are revised under strict constraints preserving the original evaluation intent, through dual independent expert repairs, model-assisted auditing, and final adjudication, resulting in 1,170 revised-and-certified items. The remaining 689 items are released as a documented uncertain set with explicit uncertainty sources and expertise tags for future refinement. We evaluate seven state-of-the-art language models on HLE and HLE-Verified, observing an average absolute accuracy gain of 7--10 percentage points on HLE-Verified. The improvement is particularly pronounced on items where the original problem statement and/or reference answer is erroneous, with gains of 30--40 percentage points. Our analyses further reveal a strong association between model confidence and the presence of errors in the problem statement or reference answer, supporting the effectiveness of our revisions. Overall, HLE-Verified improves HLE-style evaluations by reducing annotation noise and enabling more faithful measurement of model capabilities.

Traditional diagnosis still relies heavily on medical imaging and clinical assessment by physicians, which is often time-consuming and resource-intensive in terms of both human expertise and healthcare resources. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to the medical field using electronic health records (EHRs), yet their application in Alzheimer's disease assessment remains limited, particularly given that AD involves complex multifactorial etiologies that are difficult to observe directly through imaging modalities. In this work, we propose leveraging LLMs to perform Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning on patients' clinical EHRs. Unlike direct fine-tuning of LLMs on EHR data for AD classification, our approach utilizes LLM-generated CoT reasoning paths to provide the model with explicit diagnostic rationale for AD assessment, followed by structured CoT-based predictions. This pipeline not only enhances the model's ability to diagnose intrinsically complex factors but also improves the interpretability of the prediction process across different stages of AD progression. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CoT-based diagnostic framework significantly enhances stability and diagnostic performance across multiple CDR grading tasks, achieving up to a 15% improvement in F1 score compared to the zero-shot baseline method."}

In this paper, we examine the trade-off between sufficiency, defined as the ability of an explanation to justify the correct answer, and conciseness, defined as the reduction in explanation length. Building on the information bottleneck principle, we conceptualize explanations as compressed representations that retain only the information essential for producing correct answers.To operationalize this view, we introduce an evaluation pipeline that constrains explanation length and assesses sufficiency using multiple language models on the ARC Challenge dataset. To broaden the scope, we conduct experiments in both English, using the original dataset, and Persian, as a resource-limited language through translation. Our experiments show that more concise explanations often remain sufficient, preserving accuracy while substantially reducing explanation length, whereas excessive compression leads to performance degradation."}

To address this, we introduce the Group Quality Metric (GQM) paradigm and instantiate it via the Group Relative Reward Model (GRRM). Unlike traditional independent scorers, GRRM processes the entire candidate group jointly, leveraging comparative analysis to rigorously resolve relative quality and adaptive granularity. Empirical evaluations confirm that GRRM achieves competitive ranking accuracy among all baselines. Building on this foundation, we integrate GRRM into the GRPO training loop to optimize the translation policy.

This assumption is shown to be inconsistent with the geometry of expert representations. Geometric analysis of a modern MoE embedding model reveals that expert outputs lie on a shared hyperspherical manifold characterized by tightly concentrated norms and substantial angular separation. Under this geometry, linear aggregation induces inward collapse toward the manifold interior, distorting vector magnitude and direction and reducing embedding comparability. To address this inconsistency, Spherical Barycentric Aggregation (SBA) is introduced as a geometry-preserving aggregation operator that separates radial and angular components to maintain hyperspherical structure while remaining fully compatible with existing routing mechanisms. Experiments on selected tasks from the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), including semantic similarity, clustering, and duplicate question detection, demonstrate consistent performance improvements with identical training cost and full stability. Additional geometric analyses confirm that SBA prevents aggregation-induced collapse and preserves hyperspherical consistency, highlighting the importance of geometry-aware aggregation in MoE embedding architectures."}

While prior research has emphasized mid-context degradation in question answering, this study examines the impact of context in LLM-based fact verification. Using three datasets (HOVER, FEVEROUS, and ClimateFEVER) and five open-source models accross different parameters sizes (7B, 32B and 70B parameters) and model families (Llama-3.1, Qwen2.5 and Qwen3), we evaluate both parametric factual knowledge and the impact of evidence placement across varying context lengths. We find that LLMs exhibit non-trivial parametric knowledge of factual claims and that their verification accuracy generally declines as context length increases. Similarly to what has been shown in previous works, in-context evidence placement plays a critical role with accuracy being consistently higher when relevant evidence appears near the beginning or end of the prompt and lower when placed mid-context. These results underscore the importance of prompt structure in retrieval-augmented fact-checking systems."}

While AI offers substantial efficiency improvements, existing solutions lack comprehensive reasoning capabilities and internal mechanisms to ensure reliability within regulated, high-stakes environments. Full automation remains impractical and inadvisable in scenarios where human judgment and accountability are critical. This study presents a decision-negative, human-in-the-loop agentic system that incorporates an adversarial self-critique mechanism as a bounded safety architecture for regulated underwriting workflows. Within this system, a critic agent challenges the primary agent's conclusions prior to submitting recommendations to human reviewers. This internal system of checks and balances addresses a critical gap in AI safety for regulated workflows. Additionally, the research develops a formal taxonomy of failure modes to characterize potential errors by decision-negative agents. This taxonomy provides a structured framework for risk identification and risk management in high-stakes applications. Experimental evaluation using 500 expert-validated underwriting cases demonstrates that the adversarial critique mechanism reduces AI hallucination rates from 11.3% to 3.8% and increases decision accuracy from 92% to 96%. At the same time, the framework enforces strict human authority over all binding decisions by design. These findings indicate that adversarial self-critique supports safer AI deployment in regulated domains and offers a model for responsible integration where human oversight is indispensable."}

To address these issues, we propose LogitsCoder, a novel framework that enhances chain-of-thought reasoning through lightweight, logit-level control mechanisms for code generation. LogitsCoder iteratively generates and refines reasoning steps by first steering token selection toward statistically preferred patterns via Logits Preference Decoding, then selecting and aggregating diverse reasoning paths using Logits Rank Based Path Selection and Thoughts Aggregation. This results in coherent and effective reasoning chains that balance depth and efficiency.

The central challenge is establishing a scalable evaluation framework that measures LLM strategic reasoning against consistent, interpretable standards rather than volatile peer models. Here we show that anchoring LLM evaluation to fixed hierarchies of skill-calibrated game Artificial Intelligence (AI) enables linear-time absolute skill measurement with stable cross-temporal interpretability. Built on the Botzone platform's established competitive infrastructure, our BotzoneBench evaluates LLMs across eight diverse games spanning deterministic perfect-information board games to stochastic imperfect-information card games. Through systematic assessment of 177,047 state-action pairs from five flagship models, we reveal significant performance disparities and identify distinct strategic behaviors, with top-performing models achieving proficiency comparable to mid-to-high-tier specialized game AI in multiple domains. This anchored evaluation paradigm generalizes beyond games to any domain with well-defined skill hierarchies, establishing a scalable and reusable framework for assessing interactive AI capabilities."}

Compared to standard transformers, AMOR gains efficiency by projecting keys and values from SSM hidden states (Ghost KV), reusing the SSM's O(n) computation rather than requiring O(n^2) attention at every layer. On small-scale synthetic retrieval tasks, AMOR outperforms both SSM-only and transformer-only baselines, achieving perfect retrieval accuracy while engaging attention on only 22% of positions. We validate that prediction entropy reliably signals retrieval need, with a gap of 1.09 nats (nearly half the entropy range) between retrieval and local positions.

From a single seed problem, VeRA automatically creates unlimited verified variants with reliable labels at near-zero marginal cost without human involvement.\n  VeRA operates in two complementary modes. VeRA-E (equivalent) rewrites problems while keeping the underlying logic intact, useful for detecting memorization versus genuine reasoning. VeRA-H (hardened) systematically increases complexity while remaining verifiable, enabling reliable creation and labelling of fresh difficult tasks at the boundary of intelligence. Evaluating 16 frontier models with VeRA, we find: (i) VeRA-E improves evaluation quality and reveals contamination patterns. (ii) VeRA-H enables human-free generation of hard tasks with reliable labels. (iii) VeRA establishes verified benchmarks as a general paradigm. VeRA reconceptualizes benchmarks from static objects used until exhausted, to executable specifications generating fresh, verified instances on demand, enhancing robustness and cost-effectiveness for evaluation.\n  With VeRA, we envision that evaluation in any verifiable domain can scale indefinitely without sacrificing label integrity.

To operationalize this view, we present the Open Rubric System (OpenRS), a plug-and-play, rubrics-based LLM-as-a-Judge framework built around Pairwise Adaptive Meta-Rubrics (PAMR) and lightweight Pointwise Verifiable Rubrics (PVRs), which provide both hard-constraint guardrails and verifiable reward components when ground-truth or programmatic checks are available. OpenRS uses an explicit meta-rubric -- a constitution-like specification that governs how rubrics are instantiated, weighted, and enforced -- and instantiates adaptive rubrics on the fly by conditioning on the semantic differences between two candidate responses. It then performs criterion-wise pairwise comparisons and aggregates criterion-level preferences externally, avoiding pointwise weighted scalarization while improving discriminability in open-ended settings. To keep principles consistent yet editable across various domains, we introduce a two-level meta-rubric refinement pipeline (automated evolutionary refinement for general principles and a reproducible human-in-the-loop procedure for domain principles), complemented with pointwise verifiable rubrics that act as both guardrails against degenerate behaviors and a source of verifiable reward for objective sub-tasks. Finally, we instantiate OpenRS as reward supervision in pairwise RL training."}

Logical reasoning is a natural substrate: constraints are formal and answers are programmatically checkable.

We propose SSLogic, an agentic meta-synthesis framework that scales at the task-family level by iteratively synthesizing and repairing executable Generator--Validator program pairs in a closed Generate--Validate--Repair loop, enabling continuous family evolution with controllable difficulty. To ensure reliability, we introduce a Multi-Gate Validation Protocol that combines multi-strategy consistency checks with Adversarial Blind Review, where independent agents must solve instances by writing and executing code to filter ambiguous or ill-posed tasks. Starting from 400 seed families, two evolution rounds expand to 953 families and 21,389 verifiable instances (from 5,718).

In this work, we reproduce and adapt the LLaVA-Next methodology to create a set of Polish VLMs. We rely on a fully automated pipeline for translating and filtering existing multimodal datasets, and complement this with synthetic Polish data for OCR and culturally specific tasks. Despite relying almost entirely on automatic translation and minimal manual intervention to the training data, our approach yields strong results: we observe a +9.5% improvement over LLaVA-1.6-Vicuna-13B on a Polish-adapted MMBench, along with higher-quality captions in generative evaluations, as measured by human annotators in terms of linguistic correctness. These findings highlight that large-scale automated translation, combined with lightweight filtering, can effectively bootstrap high-quality multimodal models for low-resource languages. Some challenges remain, particularly in cultural coverage and evaluation. To facilitate further research, we make our models and evaluation dataset publicly available."}

We propose a taxonomy identifying three types: unfaithfulness (failure to engage with provided context), confabulation (invention of semantically foreign content), and factual error (incorrect claims within correct conceptual frames). We observe a striking asymmetry. On standard benchmarks where hallucinations are LLM-generated, detection is domain-local: AUROC 0.76-0.99 within domains, but 0.50 (chance level) across domains. Discriminative directions are approximately orthogonal between domains (mean cosine similarity -0.07). On human-crafted confabulations - invented institutions, redefined terminology, fabricated mechanisms - a single global direction achieves 0.96 AUROC with 3.8% cross-domain degradation. We interpret this divergence as follows: benchmarks capture generation artifacts (stylistic signatures of prompted fabrication), while human-crafted confabulations capture genuine topical drift. The geometric structure differs because the underlying phenomena differ. Type III errors show 0.478 AUROC - indistinguishable from chance. This reflects a theoretical constraint: embeddings encode distributional co-occurrence, not correspondence to external reality. Statements with identical contextual patterns occupy similar embedding regions regardless of truth value. The contribution is a geometric taxonomy clarifying the scope of embedding-based detection: Types I and II are detectable; Type III requires external verification mechanisms."}

While these methods increase trajectory diversity, their exploration behavior is not explicitly modeled and can be inefficient under finite sampling budgets. We observe that stronger perturbations do not necessarily translate into more effective candidate trajectories, as unguided noise may disrupt internal decision structure rather than steer it. To provide a more structured alternative, we model latent thought exploration as conditional sampling from learnable densities and instantiate this idea as a Gaussian Thought Sampler (GTS). GTS predicts context-dependent perturbation distributions over continuous reasoning states and is trained with GRPO-style policy optimization while keeping the backbone frozen. Experiments on GSM8K with two latent reasoning architectures show that GTS achieves more reliable inference-time scaling than heuristic baselines. These findings indicate that improving latent ITS requires structured and optimizable exploration mechanisms rather than simply amplifying stochasticity."}

The core of VaryBalance is that, compared to LLM-generated texts, there is a greater difference between human texts and their rewritten version via LLMs. Leveraging this observation, VaryBalance quantifies this through mean standard deviation and distinguishes human texts and LLM-generated texts. Comprehensive experiments demonstrated that VaryBalance outperforms the state-of-the-art detectors, i.e., Binoculars, by up to 34.3\\% in terms of AUROC, and maintains robustness against multiple generating models and languages."}

Recall Is the Bottleneck for Parametric Factuality", "comment": null, "summary": "Standard factuality evaluations of LLMs treat all errors alike, obscuring whether failures arise from missing knowledge (empty shelves) or from limited access to encoded facts (lost keys). We propose a behavioral framework that profiles factual knowledge at the level of facts rather than questions, characterizing each fact by whether it is encoded, and then by how accessible it is: cannot be recalled, can be directly recalled, or can only be recalled with inference-time computation (thinking). To support such profiling, we introduce WikiProfile, a new benchmark constructed via an automated pipeline with a prompted LLM grounded in web search. Across 4 million responses from 13 LLMs, we find that encoding is nearly saturated in frontier models on our benchmark, with GPT-5 and Gemini-3 encoding 95--98% of facts. However, recall remains a major bottleneck: many errors previously attributed to missing knowledge instead stem from failures to access it. These failures are systematic and disproportionately affect long-tail facts and reverse questions. Finally, we show that thinking improves recall and can recover a substantial fraction of failures, indicating that future gains may rely less on scaling and more on methods that improve how models utilize what they already encode."}

This work argues that such limitations do not primarily arise from insufficient learning, data, or model capacity, but from a deeper structural property of how intelligence is optimized over time. We formulate intelligence as a trajectory-level phenomenon governed by multi-objective trade-offs, and introduce Trajectory-Dominant Pareto Optimization, a path-wise generalization of classical Pareto optimality in which dominance is defined over full trajectories. Within this framework, Pareto traps emerge as locally non-dominated regions of trajectory space that nevertheless restrict access to globally superior developmental paths under conservative local optimization. To characterize the rigidity of such constraints, we define the Trap Escape Difficulty Index (TEDI), a composite geometric measure capturing escape distance, structural constraints, and behavioral inertia. We show that dynamic intelligence ceilings arise as inevitable geometric consequences of trajectory-level dominance, independent of learning progress or architectural scale. We further introduce a formal taxonomy of Pareto traps and illustrate the resulting trajectory-level divergence using a minimal agent-environment model. Together, these results shift the locus of intelligence from terminal performance to optimization geometry, providing a principled framework for diagnosing and overcoming long-horizon developmental constraints in adaptive systems."}

PlotChain contains 15 plot families with 450 rendered plots (30 per family), where every item is produced from known parameters and paired with exact ground truth computed directly from the generating process. A central contribution is checkpoint-based diagnostic evaluation: in addition to final targets, each item includes intermediate 'cp_' fields that isolate sub-skills (e.g., reading cutoff frequency or peak magnitude) and enable failure localization within a plot family. We evaluate four state-of-the-art MLLMs under a standardized, deterministic protocol (temperature = 0 and a strict JSON-only numeric output schema) and score predictions using per-field tolerances designed to reflect human plot-reading precision.

Recent work has shown that encoder-decoder models can acquire irregular patterns, but evidence that they generalize these patterns like humans is mixed. We investigate this using the Spanish \\emph{L-shaped morphome}, where only the first-person singular indicative (e.g., \\textit{pongo} `I put') shares its stem with all subjunctive forms (e.g., \\textit{ponga, pongas}) despite lacking apparent phonological, semantic, or syntactic motivation. We compare five encoder-decoder transformers varying along two dimensions: sequential vs. position-invariant positional encoding, and atomic vs. decomposed tag representations. Positional encoding proves decisive: position-invariant models recover the correct L-shaped paradigm clustering even when L-shaped verbs are scarce in training, whereas sequential positional encoding models only partially capture the pattern. Yet none of the models productively generalize this pattern to novel forms. Position-invariant models generalize the L-shaped stem across subjunctive cells but fail to extend it to the first-person singular indicative, producing a mood-based generalization rather than the L-shaped morphomic pattern. Humans do the opposite, generalizing preferentially to the first-person singular indicative over subjunctive forms. None of the models reproduce the human pattern, highlighting the gap between statistical pattern reproduction and morphological abstraction."}

Most prior work mitigates this issue with training-time solutions (e.g., data curation or alignment-oriented regularization). However, these approaches are costly to maintain as personas and attack strategies evolve, can degrade in-character behavior, and are typically infeasible for frontier closed-weight LLMs. We propose a training-free Dual-Cycle Adversarial Self-Evolution framework with two coupled cycles. A Persona-Targeted Attacker Cycle synthesizes progressively stronger jailbreak prompts, while a Role-Playing Defender Cycle distills observed failures into a hierarchical knowledge base of (i) global safety rules, (ii) persona-grounded constraints, and (iii) safe in-character exemplars. At inference time, the Defender retrieves and composes structured knowledge from this hierarchy to guide generation, producing responses that remain faithful to the target persona while satisfying safety constraints. Extensive experiments across multiple proprietary LLMs show consistent gains over strong baselines on both role fidelity and jailbreak resistance, and robust generalization to unseen personas and attack prompts."}

Our approach has two phases. First, we fine-tune three representative LLM families (GPT, LLaMA, and DeepSeek R1) on MedQuAD-derived medical QA data (20k+ question-answer pairs across multiple NIH domains) and benchmark generation quality. DeepSeek R1 achieves the strongest scores (ROUGE-1 0.536 +- 0.04; ROUGE-2 0.226 +-0.03; BLEU 0.098 -+ 0.018) and substantially outperforms the specialised biomedical baseline BioGPT in zero-shot evaluation. Second, we implement a modular multi-agent pipeline in which a Clinical Reasoning agent (fine-tuned LLaMA) produces structured explanations, an Evidence Retrieval agent queries PubMed to ground responses in recent literature, and a Refinement agent (DeepSeek R1) improves clarity and factual consistency; an optional human validation path is triggered for high-risk or high-uncertainty cases. Safety mechanisms include Monte Carlo dropout and perplexity-based uncertainty scoring, plus lexical and sentiment-based bias detection supported by LIME/SHAP-based analyses. In evaluation, the full system achieves 87% accuracy with relevance around 0.80, and evidence augmentation reduces uncertainty (perplexity 4.13) compared to base responses, with mean end-to-end latency of 36.5 seconds under the reported configuration.

Existing VRAG frameworks usually depend on rigid, pre-defined external tools to extend the perceptual capabilities of VLMs, typically by explicitly separating visual perception from subsequent reasoning processes. However, this decoupled design can lead to unnecessary loss of visual information, particularly when image-based operations such as cropping are applied. In this paper, we propose Lang2Act, which enables fine-grained visual perception and reasoning through self-emergent linguistic toolchains. Rather than invoking fixed external engines, Lang2Act collects self-emergent actions as linguistic tools and leverages them to enhance the visual perception capabilities of VLMs. To support this mechanism, we design a two-stage Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based training framework. Specifically, the first stage optimizes VLMs to self-explore high-quality actions for constructing a reusable linguistic toolbox, and the second stage further optimizes VLMs to exploit these linguistic tools for downstream reasoning effectively. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of Lang2Act in substantially enhancing the visual perception capabilities of VLMs, achieving performance improvements of over 4%.

This paper proposes the Deferred Visual Ingestion (DVI) framework, adopting a demand-side ingestion strategy: the indexing phase performs only lightweight metadata extraction, deferring visual understanding to the moment users pose specific questions. DVI's core principle is \"Index for locating, not understanding\"--achieving page localization through structured metadata indexes and BM25 full-text search, then sending original images along with specific questions to a VLM for targeted analysis. Experiments on two real industrial engineering drawings (113 pages + 7 pages) demonstrate that DVI achieves comparable overall accuracy at zero ingestion VLM cost (46.7% vs. 48.9%), an effectiveness rate of 50% on visually necessary queries (vs. 0% for pre-ingestion), and 100% page localization (98% search space compression).

However, these methods suffer from fragile syntax control due to weak enforcement of global grammar constraints and low semantic faithfulness caused by insufficient clause-level semantic understanding. We propose NL2LOGIC, a first-order logic translation framework that introduces an abstract syntax tree as an intermediate representation. NL2LOGIC combines a recursive large language model based semantic parser with an abstract syntax tree guided generator that deterministically produces solver-ready logic code.

However, research indicates a significant gap between this theoretical capacity and the practical ability of models to robustly utilize information within long contexts, especially in tasks that require a comprehensive understanding of numerous details. This paper evaluates the performance of four state-of-the-art models (Grok-4, GPT-4, Gemini 2.5, and GPT-5) on long short-context tasks. For this purpose, three datasets were used: two supplementary datasets for retrieving culinary recipes and math problems, and a primary dataset of 20K social media posts for depression detection. The results show that as the input volume on the social media dataset exceeds 5K posts (70K tokens), the performance of all models degrades significantly, with accuracy dropping to around 50-53% for 20K posts. Notably, in the GPT-5 model, despite the sharp decline in accuracy, its precision remained high at approximately 95%, a feature that could be highly effective for sensitive applications like depression detection. This research also indicates that the \"lost in the middle\" problem has been largely resolved in newer models.

This paper presents an exploratory study evaluating these methods on 3B--7B parameter code models. We find that while PAC generally outperforms the Loss baseline, its effectiveness relies on augmentation strategies that disregard the rigid syntax of code, leading to performance degradation on larger, complex files. To address this, we introduce AST-PAC, a domain-specific adaptation that utilizes Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) based perturbations to generate syntactically valid calibration samples. Preliminary results indicate that AST-PAC improves as syntactic size grows, where PAC degrades, but under-mutates small files and underperforms on alphanumeric-rich code.

In scientific settings, however, unsupported or uncertain conclusions can be more harmful than abstaining. We study this problem through an abstention-aware verification framework that decomposes scientific claims into minimal conditions, audits each condition against available evidence using natural language inference (NLI), and selectively decides whether to support, refute, or abstain. We evaluate this framework across two complementary scientific benchmarks: SciFact and PubMedQA, covering both closed-book and open-domain evidence settings. Experiments are conducted with six diverse language models, including encoder-decoder, open-weight chat models, and proprietary APIs. Across all benchmarks and models, we observe that raw accuracy varies only modestly across architectures, while abstention plays a critical role in controlling error. In particular, confidence-based abstention substantially reduces risk at moderate coverage levels, even when absolute accuracy improvements are limited. Our results suggest that in scientific reasoning tasks, the primary challenge is not selecting a single best model, but rather determining when available evidence is sufficient to justify an answer.

This paper introduces X-Blocks (eXplanation Blocks), a hierarchical analytical framework that identifies the linguistic building blocks of natural language explanations for AVs at three levels: context, syntax, and lexicon.\n  At the context level, we propose RACE (Reasoning-Aligned Classification of Explanations), a multi-LLM ensemble framework that combines Chain-of-Thought reasoning with self-consistency mechanisms to robustly classify explanations into 32 scenario-aware categories. Applied to human-authored explanations from the Berkeley DeepDrive-X dataset, RACE achieves 91.45 percent accuracy and a Cohens kappa of 0.91 against cases with human annotator agreement, indicating near-human reliability for context classification.\n  At the lexical level, log-odds analysis with informative Dirichlet priors reveals context-specific vocabulary patterns that distinguish driving scenarios. At the syntactic level, dependency parsing and template extraction show that explanations draw from a limited repertoire of reusable grammar families, with systematic variation in predicate types and causal constructions across contexts.\n  The X-Blocks framework is dataset-agnostic and task-independent, offering broad applicability to other automated driving datasets and safety-critical domains. Overall, our findings provide evidence-based linguistic design principles for generating scenario-aware explanations that support transparency, user trust, and cognitive accessibility in automated driving systems."}

The approach comprises both a new parsing algorithm and a set of syntactic rules and features that overcome the limitations of CFG. It also generates both dependency and constituency parse trees, while accommodating noise and incomplete parses. The system was tested on data from Universal Dependencies, showing a promising average Unlabeled Attachment Score (UAS) of 54.5% in the development dataset (7 corpora) and 53.8% in the test set (12 corpora). The system also provides multiple parse hypotheses, allowing further reranking to improve parsing accuracy. This approach also leverages much of the theoretical syntactic work since the 1950s to be used within a computational context. The application of this approach provides a transparent and interpretable NLP model to process language input."}

We introduce DPBench, a benchmark based on the Dining Philosophers problem that evaluates LLM coordination across eight conditions that vary decision timing, group size, and communication. Our experiments with GPT-5.2, Claude Opus 4.5, and Grok 4.1 reveal a striking asymmetry: LLMs coordinate effectively in sequential settings but fail when decisions must be made simultaneously, with deadlock rates exceeding 95\\% under some conditions. We trace this failure to convergent reasoning, where agents independently arrive at identical strategies that, when executed simultaneously, guarantee deadlock. Contrary to expectations, enabling communication does not resolve this problem and can even increase deadlock rates.

Current benchmarks, however, are largely restricted to idealized simulations, failing to address the practical demands of specialized domains like advertising and marketing analytics. In these fields, tasks are inherently more complex, often requiring multi-round interaction with professional marketing tools. To address this gap, we propose AD-Bench, a benchmark designed based on real-world business requirements of advertising and marketing platforms. AD-Bench is constructed from real user marketing analysis requests, with domain experts providing verifiable reference answers and corresponding reference tool-call trajectories. The benchmark categorizes requests into three difficulty levels (L1-L3) to evaluate agents' capabilities under multi-round, multi-tool collaboration. Experiments show that on AD-Bench, Gemini-3-Pro achieves Pass@1 = 68.0% and Pass@3 = 83.0%, but performance drops significantly on L3 to Pass@1 = 49.4% and Pass@3 = 62.1%, with a trajectory coverage of 70.1%, indicating that even state-of-the-art models still exhibit substantial capability gaps in complex advertising and marketing analysis scenarios.

We propose MAPLE (Memory-Adaptive Personalized LEarning), a principled decomposition where Memory handles storage and retrieval infrastructure; Learning extracts intelligence from accumulated interactions asynchronously; and Personalization applies learned knowledge in real-time within finite context budgets. Each component operates as a dedicated sub-agent with specialized tooling and well-defined interfaces. Experimental evaluation on the MAPLE-Personas benchmark demonstrates that our decomposition achieves a 14.6% improvement in personalization score compared to a stateless baseline (p < 0.01, Cohen's d = 0.95) and increases trait incorporation rate from 45% to 75% -- enabling agents that genuinely learn and adapt."}

By analyzing the static embedding spaces of 11 transformer models spanning encoder (BERT, RoBERTa, ELECTRA, DeBERTa, ALBERT, MiniLM, DistilBERT) and decoder (GPT-2) architectures, we identify three operationally distinct hallucination types: Type 1 (center-drift) under weak context, Type 2 (wrong-well convergence) to locally coherent but contextually incorrect cluster regions, and Type 3 (coverage gaps) where no cluster structure exists. We introduce three measurable geometric statistics: α (polarity coupling), \\b{eta} (cluster cohesion), and λ_s (radial information gradient). Across all 11 models, polarity structure (α > 0.5) is universal (11/11), cluster cohesion (\\b{eta} > 0) is universal (11/11), and the radial information gradient is significant (9/11, p < 0.05). We demonstrate that the two models failing λ_s significance -- ALBERT and MiniLM -- do so for architecturally explicable reasons: factorized embedding compression and distillation-induced isotropy, respectively. These findings establish the geometric prerequisites for type-specific hallucination detection and yield testable predictions about architecture-dependent vulnerability profiles."}

Moreover, existing ITC methods offer limited control over how to perform reasoning, which in turn limits their explainability. We present STATe-of-Thoughts (STATe), an interpretable ITC method that searches over high-level reasoning patterns. STATe replaces stochastic sampling with discrete and interpretable textual interventions: a controller selects actions encoding high-level reasoning choices, a generator produces reasoning steps conditioned on those choices, and an evaluator scores candidates to guide search. This structured approach yields three main advantages. First, action-guided textual interventions produce greater response diversity than temperature-based sampling. Second, in a case study on argument generation, STATe's explicit action sequences capture interpretable features that are highly predictive of output quality. Third, estimating the association between performance and action choices allows us to identify promising yet unexplored regions of the action space and steer generation directly toward them. Together, these results establish STATe as a practical framework for generating high-quality, diverse, and interpretable text.

The framework was evaluated experimentally using the benchmark dataset NSL-KDD, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional IDS and black-box deep learning models. The proposed approach combined Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for capturing temporal dependencies in traffic sequences. Our deep learning results showed that both CNN and LSTM reached 0.99 for accuracy, whereas LSTM outperformed CNN at macro average precision, recall, and F-1 score. For weighted average precision, recall, and F-1 score, both models scored almost similarly. To ensure interpretability, the XAI model SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was incorporated, enabling security analysts to understand and validate model decisions. Some notable influential features were srv_serror_rate, dst_host_srv_serror_rate, and serror_rate for both models, as pointed out by SHAP.

A Case Study of Moltbook", "comment": null, "summary": "As large language model agents increasingly populate networked environments, a fundamental question arises: do artificial intelligence (AI) agent societies undergo convergence dynamics similar to human social systems? Lately, Moltbook approximates a plausible future scenario in which autonomous agents participate in an open-ended, continuously evolving online society. We present the first large-scale systemic diagnosis of this AI agent society. Beyond static observation, we introduce a quantitative diagnostic framework for dynamic evolution in AI agent societies, measuring semantic stabilization, lexical turnover, individual inertia, influence persistence, and collective consensus. Our analysis reveals a system in dynamic balance in Moltbook: while global semantic averages stabilize rapidly, individual agents retain high diversity and persistent lexical turnover, defying homogenization. However, agents exhibit strong individual inertia and minimal adaptive response to interaction partners, preventing mutual influence and consensus. Consequently, influence remains transient with no persistent supernodes, and the society fails to develop stable collective influence anchors due to the absence of shared social memory. These findings demonstrate that scale and interaction density alone are insufficient to induce socialization, providing actionable design and analysis principles for upcoming next-generation AI agent societies."}

By controlling access to future targets and contextual information, the benchmark enables a diagnostic analysis of whether models can correctly interpret temporal patterns, align them with external context, and adapt predictions when conditions change. Extensive baseline experiments show that strong numerical forecasting accuracy does not reliably translate into robust contextual or event-aware temporal reasoning; instead, existing agent frameworks exhibit fragmented strengths and systematic failure modes that remain largely hidden under forecasting-only benchmarks.

To address these, we regard idea evaluation as a knowledge-grounded, multi-perspective reasoning problem and introduce InnoEval, a deep innovation evaluation framework designed to emulate human-level idea assessment. We apply a heterogeneous deep knowledge search engine that retrieves and grounds dynamic evidence from diverse online sources. We further achieve review consensus with an innovation review board containing reviewers with distinct academic backgrounds, enabling a multi-dimensional decoupled evaluation across multiple metrics.

While effective for many generation tasks, such an approach may not fully capture the structure of complex reasoning tasks, where a single semantic decision is often realized across multiple tokens--for example, when defining variables or composing equations. This introduces a potential mismatch between token-level optimization and the inherently block-level nature of reasoning in these settings. To bridge this gap, we propose Multi-token Policy Gradient Optimization (MPO), a framework that treats sequences of K consecutive tokens as unified semantic actions. This block-level perspective enables our method to capture the compositional structure of reasoning trajectories and supports optimization over coherent, higher-level objectives. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and coding benchmarks show that MPO outperforms standard token-level policy gradient baselines, highlight the limitations of token-level policy gradients for complex reasoning, motivating future research to look beyond token-level granularity for reasoning-intensive language tasks."}

Human institutions achieve reliable collective behaviour differently: they mitigate the risk posed by misaligned individuals through organisational structure. Multi-agent AI systems should follow this institutional model using compartmentalisation and adversarial review to achieve reliable outcomes through architectural design rather than assuming individual alignment.\n  We demonstrate this approach through the Perseverance Composition Engine, a multi-agent system for document composition. The Composer drafts text, the Corroborator verifies factual substantiation with full source access, and the Critic evaluates argumentative quality without access to sources: information asymmetry enforced by system architecture. This creates layered verification: the Corroborator detects unsupported claims, whilst the Critic independently assesses coherence and completeness. Observations from 474 composition tasks (discrete cycles of drafting, verification, and evaluation) exhibit patterns consistent with the institutional hypothesis. When assigned impossible tasks requiring fabricated content, this iteration enabled progression from attempted fabrication toward honest refusal with alternative proposals--behaviour neither instructed nor individually incentivised. These findings motivate controlled investigation of whether architectural enforcement produces reliable outcomes from unreliable components.\n  This positions organisational theory as a productive framework for multi-agent AI safety. By implementing verification and evaluation as structural properties enforced through information compartmentalisation, institutional design offers a route to reliable collective behaviour from unreliable individual components."}

We present BEAGLE, a neuro-symbolic framework that addresses this bias by incorporating Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) theory into a novel architecture. BEAGLE integrates three key technical innovations: (1) a semi-Markov model that governs the timing and transitions of cognitive behaviors and metacognitive behaviors; (2) Bayesian Knowledge Tracing with explicit flaw injection to enforce realistic knowledge gaps and \"unknown unknowns\"; and (3) a decoupled agent design that separates high-level strategy use from code generation actions to prevent the model from silently correcting its own intentional errors.

The embedding space functions as a conditional expectation over a σ-algebra, and its failure to be isomorphic to the semantic truth set fundamentally causes logical consistency breakdown. WavePhaseNet Method The authors propose WavePhaseNet, which explicitly constructs a Semantic Conceptual Hierarchy Structure (SCHS) using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). By applying DFT along the sequence dimension, semantic information is decomposed into frequency bands: low-frequency components capture global meaning and intent, while high-frequency components represent local syntax and expression. This staged separation enables precise semantic manipulation in diagonalized space. Dimensionality Reduction GPT-4's 24,576-dimensional embedding space exhibits a 1/f spectral structure based on language self-similarity and Zipf's law. Through cumulative energy analysis, the authors derive that approximately 3,000 dimensions constitute the lower bound for \"complete representation.\" This demonstrates that reduction from 24,576 to 3,000 dimensions preserves meaning and intent while enabling rigorous reasoning and suppressing hallucination. Cohomological Consistency Control The reduced embedding space, constructed via cohomological regularization over overlapping local windows, allows defining a graph structure and cochain complex. This quantifies inconsistencies among local inferences as coboundary-based losses. Applying harmonic projection based on Hodge theory positions cohomology as a computable regularization principle for controlling semantic consistency, extracting maximally consistent global representations."}

We propose an LLM-assisted distillation framework specifically designed for temporal knowledge graph reasoning. Beyond a conventional high-capacity temporal teacher, we incorporate a large language model as an auxiliary instructor to provide enriched supervision. The LLM supplies broad background knowledge and temporally informed signals, enabling a lightweight student to better model event dynamics without increasing inference-time complexity. Training is conducted by jointly optimizing supervised and distillation objectives, using a staged alignment strategy to progressively integrate guidance from both teachers.

The demand for consistent and defensible decisions under heterogeneous risk profiles exposes limitations in institutional review capacity rather than in the legitimacy of ethics oversight. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to support ethics review, but their direct application remains limited by insufficient ethical reasoning capability, weak integration with regulatory structures, and strict privacy constraints on authentic review materials. In this work, we introduce Mirror, an agentic framework for AI-assisted ethical review that integrates ethical reasoning, structured rule interpretation, and multi-agent deliberation within a unified architecture. At its core is EthicsLLM, a foundational model fine-tuned on EthicsQA, a specialized dataset of 41K question-chain-of-thought-answer triples distilled from authoritative ethics and regulatory corpora. EthicsLLM provides detailed normative and regulatory understanding, enabling Mirror to operate in two complementary modes. Mirror-ER (expedited Review) automates expedited review through an executable rule base that supports efficient and transparent compliance checks for minimal-risk studies. Mirror-CR (Committee Review) simulates full-board deliberation through coordinated interactions among expert agents, an ethics secretary agent, and a principal investigator agent, producing structured, committee-level assessments across ten ethical dimensions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Mirror significantly improves the quality, consistency, and professionalism of ethics assessments compared with strong generalist LLMs."}

We expand the linguistic scope of BBQ and construct FilBBQ through a four-phase development process consisting of template categorization, culturally aware translation, new template construction, and prompt generation. These processes resulted in a bias test composed of more than 10,000 prompts which assess whether models demonstrate sexist and homophobic prejudices relevant to the Philippine context. We then apply FilBBQ on models trained in Filipino but do so with a robust evaluation protocol that improves upon the reliability and accuracy of previous BBQ implementations. Specifically, we account for models' response instability by obtaining prompt responses across multiple seeds and averaging the bias scores calculated from these distinctly seeded runs. Our results confirm both the variability of bias scores across different seeds and the presence of sexist and homophobic biases relating to emotion, domesticity, stereotyped queer interests, and polygamy.

We formalize this phenomenon through a three-level measurement hierarchy: lexical, entropic, and probabilistic anchoring, each captures surface artifacts, entropy dynamics, and latent answer dependence, respectively. We analyze semantic suppression, the intuitive mitigation strategy that instructs models to ignore the answer, to find out its counterproduction: while it reduces lexical overlap, it paradoxically increases entropic and probabilistic anchoring. Drawing on Ironic Process Theory from cognitive psychology, we attribute this failure to active monitoring of the forbidden answer, which inadvertently deepens dependence on it. To break this cycle, we propose Structural Skeleton-guided Reasoning (SSR), a two-phase approach that first generates an answer-invariant functional skeleton structure, then uses this skeleton to guide full trace generation. By redirecting the information flow to structural planning rather than answer monitoring, SSR consistently reduces anchoring across all three levels. We further introduce Distilled SSR (SSR-D), which fine-tunes models on teacher-generated SSR traces to ensure reliable structural adherence. Experiments across open-ended reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SSR-D achieves up to 10% improvement over suppression baselines while preserving out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization."}

To enable grounding without real labels, we use a structure-first synthetic generation strategy that aligns latent labels and observable traces by design. As a pilot, we construct a dataset and run a diagnostic study using retrieval-augmented in-context learning as a proxy for supervision. In our study with GPT-4o, we observe a gap between surface-level extraction and latent perspective inference--indicating latent-state inference is harder than surface extraction under our controlled setting.

However, their rigid retrieval schemes and dense similarity search often introduce irrelevant context, increase computational overhead, and limit relational expressiveness. In contrast, n-ary hypergraphs encode higher-order relational facts that capture richer inter-entity dependencies and enable shallower, more efficient reasoning paths. To address this limitation, we propose HyperRAG, a RAG framework tailored for n-ary hypergraphs with two complementary retrieval variants: (i) HyperRetriever learns structural-semantic reasoning over n-ary facts to construct query-conditioned relational chains. It enables accurate factual tracking, adaptive high-order traversal, and interpretable multi-hop reasoning under context constraints. (ii) HyperMemory leverages the LLM's parametric memory to guide beam search, dynamically scoring n-ary facts and entities for query-aware path expansion. Extensive evaluations on WikiTopics (11 closed-domain datasets) and three open-domain QA benchmarks (HotpotQA, MuSiQue, and 2WikiMultiHopQA) validate HyperRAG's effectiveness. HyperRetriever achieves the highest answer accuracy overall, with average gains of 2.95% in MRR and 1.23% in Hits@10 over the strongest baseline. Qualitative analysis further shows that HyperRetriever bridges reasoning gaps through adaptive and interpretable n-ary chain construction, benefiting both open and closed-domain QA."}

This concentration property ensures predictable system behavior and rules out exponential failure modes. We develop a hybrid distortion metric combining discrete fact matching with continuous semantic similarity, then establish martingale concentration bounds on error propagation through sequential tool interactions. Experiments across Qwen2-7B, Llama-3-8B, and Mistral-7B validate our theoretical predictions, showing empirical distortion tracks the linear trend with deviations consistently within $O(\\sqrt{T})$ envelopes.

Prior work on the 2-Sigma clinical simulation platform showed that manually annotated linguistic features could support jailbreak detection. However, reliance on manual annotation limited both scalability and expressiveness. In this study, we extend this framework by using experts' annotations of four core linguistic features (Professionalism, Medical Relevance, Ethical Behavior, and Contextual Distraction) and training multiple general-domain and medical-domain BERT-based LLM models to predict these features directly from text. The most reliable feature regressor for each dimension was selected and used as the feature extractor in a second layer of classifiers. We evaluate a suite of predictive models, including tree-based, linear, probabilistic, and ensemble methods, to determine jailbreak likelihood from the extracted features. Across cross-validation and held-out evaluations, the system achieves strong overall performance, indicating that LLM-derived linguistic features provide an effective basis for automated jailbreak detection. Error analysis further highlights key limitations in current annotations and feature representations, pointing toward future improvements such as richer annotation schemes, finer-grained feature extraction, and methods that capture the evolving risk of jailbreak behavior over the course of a dialogue. This work demonstrates a scalable and interpretable approach for detecting jailbreak behavior in safety-critical clinical dialogue systems."}

We propose Query-as-Anchor, a framework shifting user modeling from static encoding to dynamic, query-aware synthesis. To empower Large Language Models (LLMs) with deep user understanding, we first construct UserU, an industrial-scale pre-training dataset that aligns multi-modal behavioral sequences with user understanding semantics, and our Q-Anchor Embedding architecture integrates hierarchical coarse-to-fine encoders into dual-tower LLMs via joint contrastive-autoregressive optimization for query-aware user representation. To bridge the gap between general pre-training and specialized business logic, we further introduce Cluster-based Soft Prompt Tuning to enforce discriminative latent structures, effectively aligning model attention with scenario-specific modalities. For deployment, anchoring queries at sequence termini enables KV-cache-accelerated inference with negligible incremental latency. Evaluations on 10 Alipay industrial benchmarks show consistent SOTA performance, strong scalability, and efficient deployment. Large-scale online A/B testing in Alipay's production system across two real-world scenarios further validates its practical effectiveness.

We examine this fundamental question by evaluating whether LLMs genuinely reason mathematically in these languages or depend on implicit translation to English-like representations. Using a taxonomy of six math problem types, from basic arithmetic to complex unit conflict and optimization problems, we evaluate four prominent large language models. To avoid translation artifacts that confound language ability with translation quality, we construct a parallel dataset where each problem is natively authored by fluent speakers with mathematical training in all three languages. Our analysis demonstrates that while basic arithmetic reasoning transfers robustly across languages, complex reasoning tasks show significant degradation in Tamil and Sinhala. The pattern of failures varies by model and problem type, suggesting that apparent multilingual competence may not reflect uniform reasoning capabilities across languages. These findings challenge the common assumption that models exhibiting strong multilingual performance can reason equally effectively across languages, and highlight the need for fine-grained, type-aware evaluation in multilingual settings."}

In this paper, we propose XTF, an explainable token-level noise filtering framework. XTF decomposes the complex and subtle contributions of token-level data to the fine-tuning process into three distinct and explicit attributes (reasoning importance, knowledge novelty, and task relevance), which can be assessed using scoring methods, and then masks the gradients of selected noisy tokens accordingly to optimize the performance of fine-tuned LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on three representative downstream tasks (math, code and medicine) across 7 mainstream LLMs. The results demonstrate that XTF can significantly improve downstream performance by up to 13.7% compared to regular fine-tuning.

We revisit this objective and challenge the necessity of such complexity. Through principled analysis, we identify fundamental misalignments in this paradigm: KL regularization loses its intended role when correctness and length are directly verifiable, and group-wise normalization becomes ambiguous under multiple reward signals. By removing these two items and simplifying the reward to a truncation-based length penalty, we show that the optimization problem reduces to supervised fine-tuning on self-generated data filtered for both correctness and conciseness. We term this simplified training strategy on-policy SFT. Despite its simplicity, on-policy SFT consistently defines the accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier. It reduces CoT length by up to 80 while maintaining original accuracy, surpassing more complex RL-based methods across five benchmarks.

In the second stage, we first analyze the layers with the largest mean shift resulting from pruning, and then incorporate a simple yet effective projection compensation matrix to correct this drift in one step. In this way, the degradation of model performance caused by layer pruning is effectively alleviated. Extensive experiments show that GradMAP outperforms previous layer pruning methods in both pruning speed (achieving an average $4\\times$ speedup) and performance."}

Prior work has examined the safety and misuse risks associated with agents. However, much of this has focused on the single-agent case and/or setups missing basic engineering safeguards such as access control, revealing a scarcity of threat modeling in multi-agent systems. We investigate the security vulnerabilities of a popular multi-agent pattern known as the orchestrator setup, in which a central agent decomposes and delegates tasks to specialized agents. Through red-teaming a concrete setup representative of a likely future use case, we demonstrate a novel attack vector, OMNI-LEAK, that compromises several agents to leak sensitive data through a single indirect prompt injection, even in the \\textit{presence of data access control}. We report the susceptibility of frontier models to different categories of attacks, finding that both reasoning and non-reasoning models are vulnerable, even when the attacker lacks insider knowledge of the implementation details. Our work highlights the importance of safety research to generalize from single-agent to multi-agent settings, in order to reduce the serious risks of real-world privacy breaches and financial losses and overall public trust in AI agents."}

While this hypothesis has been tested empirically, prior studies are limited exclusively to text-only inputs, abstracting away from the perceptual context in which utterances are produced. In this work, we present the first computational study of UID in visually grounded settings. We estimate surprisal using multilingual vision-and-language models over image-caption data in 30 languages and visual storytelling data in 13 languages, together spanning 11 families. We find that grounding on perception consistently smooths the distribution of information, increasing both global and local uniformity across typologically diverse languages compared to text-only settings. In visual narratives, grounding in both image and discourse contexts has additional effects, with the strongest surprisal reductions occurring at the onset of discourse units. Overall, this study takes a first step towards modelling the temporal dynamics of information flow in ecologically plausible, multimodal language use, and finds that grounded language exhibits greater information uniformity, supporting a context-sensitive formulation of UID."}

Unlike standard LLMs answering questions in a controlled ChatBot setting, web agents act \"in the wild\", interacting with third parties and leaving behind an action trace. Therefore, we ask the question: how do web agents handle user resources when accomplishing tasks on their behalf across live websites? In this paper, we formalize Natural Agentic Oversharing -- the unintentional disclosure of task-irrelevant user information through an agent trace of actions on the web. We introduce SPILLage, a framework that characterizes oversharing along two dimensions: channel (content vs. behavior) and directness (explicit vs. implicit). This taxonomy reveals a critical blind spot: while prior work focuses on text leakage, web agents also overshare behaviorally through clicks, scrolls, and navigation patterns that can be monitored. We benchmark 180 tasks on live e-commerce sites with ground-truth annotations separating task-relevant from task-irrelevant attributes. Across 1,080 runs spanning two agentic frameworks and three backbone LLMs, we demonstrate that oversharing is pervasive with behavioral oversharing dominates content oversharing by 5x. This effect persists -- and can even worsen -- under prompt-level mitigation. However, removing task-irrelevant information before execution improves task success by up to 17.9%, demonstrating that reducing oversharing improves task success. Our findings underscore that protecting privacy in web agents is a fundamental challenge, requiring a broader view of \"output\" that accounts for what agents do on the web, not just what they type.

We present REMem, a two-phase framework for constructing and reasoning with episodic memory: 1) Offline indexing, where REMem converts experiences into a hybrid memory graph that flexibly links time-aware gists and facts. 2) Online inference, where REMem employs an agentic retriever with carefully curated tools for iterative retrieval over the memory graph. Comprehensive evaluation across four episodic memory benchmarks shows that REMem substantially outperforms state-of-the-art memory systems such as Mem0 and HippoRAG 2, showing 3.4% and 13.4% absolute improvements on episodic recollection and reasoning tasks, respectively. Moreover, REMem also demonstrates more robust refusal behavior for unanswerable questions."}

In this paper, we propose a robust Online Reinforcement Learning WebAgent, designed to optimize its policy through direct, iterative interactions with unconstrained wide websites. Our approach comprises three core innovations: 1) Hierarchical Multi-Task Fine-tuning: We curate a comprehensive mixture of datasets categorized by functional primitives -- Planning, Acting, and Grounding -- establishing a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with strong instruction-following capabilities for Web GUI tasks. 2) Online Agentic RL in the Wild: We develop an online interaction environment and fine-tune the VLM using a specialized RL pipeline. We introduce a Hybrid Reward Mechanism that combines a ground-truth-agnostic WebJudge for holistic outcome assessment with a Rule-based Decision Tree (RDT) for progress reward. This system effectively mitigates the credit assignment challenge in long-horizon navigation.

This paper investigates whether LLMs exhibit analogous patterns of influence and whether they privilege feedback from humans over feedback from other LLMs. Across three binary decision-making tasks, reading comprehension, multi-step reasoning, and moral judgment, we present four instruction-tuned LLMs with prior responses attributed either to friends, to human experts, or to other LLMs. We manipulate whether the group is correct and vary the group size. In a second experiment, we introduce direct disagreement between a single human and a single LLM. Across tasks, models conform significantly more to responses labeled as coming from human experts, including when that signal is incorrect, and revise their answers toward experts more readily than toward other LLMs. These results reveal that expert framing acts as a strong prior for contemporary LLMs, suggesting a form of credibility-sensitive social influence that generalizes across decision domains."}

We analyse BFMNs from N = 994 observations spanning high school students, university students, and early-career STEM experts, alongside LLM (GPT-oss) \"digital twins\" prompted to emulate comparable profiles. Focusing also on semantic neighbourhoods (\"frames\") around key target concepts (e.g., STEM subjects or educational actors/places), we quantify frames in terms of valence auras, emotional profiles, network overlap (Jaccard similarity), and concreteness relative to null baselines. Across student groups, science and research are consistently framed positively, while their core quantitative subjects (mathematics and statistics) exhibit more negative and anxiety related auras, amplified in higher math-anxiety subgroups, evidencing a STEM-science cognitive and emotional dissonance. High-anxiety frames are also less concrete than chance, suggesting more abstract and decontextualised representations of threatening quantitative domains. Human networks show greater overlapping between mathematics and anxiety than GPT-oss. The results highlight how BFMNs capture cognitive-affective signatures of mindsets towards the target domains and indicate that LLM-based digital twins approximate cultural attitudes but miss key context-sensitive, experience-based components relevant to replicate human educational anxiety."}

In this work, we empirically localize this input-output alignment shift in pretrained LLMs, using decoding trajectories over tied embedding spaces and similarity-based metrics. Our experiments reveal that the hidden token representations switch from input alignment to output alignment deep within the network. Motivated by this observation, we propose a lightweight residual-path mitigation based on residual attenuation, implemented either as a fixed-layer intervention or as a learnable gating mechanism. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that these strategies alleviate the representation misalignment and yield improvements, providing an efficient and general architectural enhancement for autoregressive Transformers."}

We provide a rigorous theoretical decomposition that attributes this failure to hardware casting overhead, the hidden latency cost of dequantization kernels, which becomes a dominant bottleneck in sequential reasoning chains, as well as to a sequential energy amortization failure.

However, in heterogeneous multi-agent systems (HMAS), capability differences among agents give rise to consistent cognitive problems, where strong and weak models fail to contribute effectively. We define the collaboration as a strong-weak system. Through comprehensive experiments, we disclose a counterintuitive phenomenon in the strong-weak system: a strong-weak collaboration may under-perform weak-weak combinations, revealing that cognitive mismatching are key bottlenecks limiting heterogeneous cooperation. To overcome these challenges, we propose an Entropy-Based Adaptive Guidance Framework that dynamically aligns the guidance with the cognitive state of each agent. The framework quantifies the understanding of weak agents through multi-dimensional entropy metrics - covering expression, uncertainty, structure, coherence, and relevance - and adaptively adjusts the intensity of the guidance at light, moderate and intensive levels. Furthermore, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism is incorporated to retain successful collaboration experiences, enabling both immediate adaptation and long-term learning. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, GSM8K, MBPP, and CVRP demonstrate that our approach consistently enhances the effectiveness and stability of heterogeneous collaboration. The results highlight that adaptive guidance not only mitigates cognitive imbalance but also establishes a scalable pathway toward more robust, cooperative multi-agent intelligence."}

We formalize this as a structural overthinking attack, distinguishable from token-level verbosity, and implement 14 malicious tools across three servers that trigger repetition, forced refinement, and distraction. Across heterogeneous registries and multiple tool-capable models, the attack causes severe resource amplification (up to $142.4\\times$ tokens) and can degrade task outcomes.

Nevertheless, in real-world applications, GUI agents are often faced with non-stationary environments, leading to high computational costs for data curation and policy optimization. In this report, we introduce a novel MLLM-centered framework for GUI agents, which consists of two components: agentic-Q estimation and step-wise policy optimization. The former one aims to optimize a Q-model that can generate step-wise values to evaluate the contribution of a given action to task completion. The latter one takes step-wise samples from the state-action trajectory as inputs, and optimizes the policy via reinforcement learning with our agentic-Q model. It should be noticed that (i) all state-action trajectories are produced by the policy itself, so that the data collection costs are manageable; (ii) the policy update is decoupled from the environment, ensuring stable and efficient optimization. Empirical evaluations show that our framework endows Ovis2.5-9B with powerful GUI interaction capabilities, achieving remarkable performances on GUI navigation and grounding benchmarks and even surpassing contenders with larger scales."}

Recent years have witnessed growing interest in reasoning tasks within Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, no prior research has examined the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on non-question-answering (non-QA) physical commonsense reasoning tasks in low-resource languages such as Basque. Taking the Italian GITA as a starting point, this paper addresses this gap by presenting BasPhyCo, the first non-QA physical commonsense reasoning dataset for Basque, available in both standard and dialectal variants. We evaluate model performance across three hierarchical levels of commonsense understanding: (1) distinguishing between plausible and implausible narratives (accuracy), (2) identifying the conflicting element that renders a narrative implausible (consistency), and (3) determining the specific physical state that creates the implausibility (verifiability). These tasks were assessed using multiple multilingual LLMs as well as models pretrained specifically for Italian and Basque. Results indicate that, in terms of verifiability, LLMs exhibit limited physical commonsense capabilities in low-resource languages such as Basque, especially when processing dialectal variants."}

This paper identifies and addresses three key redundancies: (1) the redundant processing of a large library of function descriptions for every request; (2) the redundant use of a large, slow model to generate an entire, often predictable, token sequence; and (3) the redundant generation of fixed, boilerplate parameter syntax. We introduce HyFunc, a novel framework that systematically eliminates these inefficiencies. HyFunc employs a hybrid-model cascade where a large model distills user intent into a single \"soft token.\" This token guides a lightweight retriever to select relevant functions and directs a smaller, prefix-tuned model to generate the final call, thus avoiding redundant context processing and full-sequence generation by the large model. To eliminate syntactic redundancy, our \"dynamic templating\" technique injects boilerplate parameter syntax on-the-fly within an extended vLLM engine. To avoid potential limitations in generalization, we evaluate HyFunc on an unseen benchmark dataset, BFCL. Experimental results demonstrate that HyFunc achieves an excellent balance between efficiency and performance. It achieves an inference latency of 0.828 seconds, outperforming all baseline models, and reaches a performance of 80.1%, surpassing all models with a comparable parameter scale. These results suggest that HyFunc offers a more efficient paradigm for agentic AI. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/MrBlankness/HyFunc."}

In this paper, we propose BFS-PO, an RL algorithm which alleviates this problem using a Best-First Search exploration strategy. Specifically, BFS-PO looks for the shortest correct answer using a backtracking mechanism based on maximum entropy nodes. By generating progressively shorter responses during training, BFS-PO learns to produce concise reasoning chains. Using different benchmarks and base LRMs, we show that BFS-PO can simultaneously increase the LRM accuracy and shorten its answers."}

However, long-horizon multi-step tool planning is challenging, because the exploration space suffers from a combinatorial explosion. In this scenario, even when a correct tool-use path is found, it is usually considered an immediate reward for current training, which would not provide any reusable information for subsequent training. In this paper, we argue that historically successful trajectories contain reusable tool-transition patterns, which can be leveraged throughout the whole training process. Inspired by ant colony optimization where historically successful paths can be reflected by the pheromone, we propose Pheromone-Guided Policy Optimization (PhGPO), which learns a trajectory-based transition pattern (i.e., pheromone) from historical trajectories and then uses the learned pheromone to guide policy optimization. This learned pheromone provides explicit and reusable guidance that steers policy optimization toward historically successful tool transitions, thereby improving long-horizon tool planning. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PhGPO."}

While LLMs offer unprecedented scalability and speed, their reliance on web-scale training data raises concerns regarding demographic and behavioral biases that may distort workforce assessment. We present a counterfactual fairness evaluation of LLM-based QA systems across 13 dimensions spanning three categories: Identity, Context, and Behavioral Style. Fairness is quantified using the Counterfactual Flip Rate (CFR), the frequency of binary judgment reversals, and the Mean Absolute Score Difference (MASD), the average shift in coaching or confidence scores across counterfactual pairs. Evaluating 18 LLMs on 3,000 real-world contact center transcripts, we find systematic disparities, with CFR ranging from 5.4% to 13.0% and consistent MASD shifts across confidence, positive, and improvement scores. Larger, more strongly aligned models show lower unfairness, though fairness does not track accuracy. Contextual priming of historical performance induces the most severe degradations (CFR up to 16.4%), while implicit linguistic identity cues remain a persistent bias source. Finally, we analyze the efficacy of fairness-aware prompting, finding that explicit instructions yield only modest improvements in evaluative consistency. Our findings underscore the need for standardized fairness auditing pipelines prior to deploying LLMs in high-stakes workforce evaluation."}

Foundation models based on in-context learning (ICL) offer a convenient option, but so far are largely restricted to single-table operability. In generalizing to multiple interrelated tables, it is essential to compress variably-sized RDB neighborhoods into fixed-length ICL samples for consumption by the decoder. However, the details here are critical: unlike existing supervised learning RDB pipelines, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that ICL-specific compression should be constrained \\emph{within} high-dimensional RDB columns where all entities share units and roles, not \\textit{across} columns where the relevance of heterogeneous data types cannot possibly be determined without label information. Conditioned on this restriction, we then demonstrate that encoder expressiveness is actually not compromised by excluding trainable parameters. Hence we arrive at a principled family of RDB encoders that can be seamlessly paired with already-existing single-table ICL foundation models, whereby no training or fine-tuning is required.

In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning framework that trains large language models to generate high-quality lists of interest-driven news search queries from cross-domain user signals. We formulate query-list generation as a policy optimization problem and employ GRPO with multiple reward signals. We systematically study two compute dimensions: inference-time sampling and model capacity, and empirically observe consistent improvements with increased compute that exhibit scaling-like behavior. Finally, we perform on-policy distillation to transfer the learned policy from a large, compute-intensive teacher to a compact student model suitable for scalable deployment.

The core challenge is a routing problem: each task admits dozens of preference dimensions, yet individual users care about only a few, and which ones matter depends on who is asking. With a limited question budget, asking without structure will miss the dimensions that matter. Reinforcement learning is the natural formulation, but in multi-turn settings its terminal reward fails to exploit the factored, per-criterion structure of preference data, and in practice learned policies collapse to static question sequences that ignore user responses. We propose decomposing cold-start elicitation into offline structure learning and online Bayesian inference. Pep (Preference Elicitation with Priors) learns a structured world model of preference correlations offline from complete profiles, then performs training-free Bayesian inference online to select informative questions and predict complete preference profiles, including dimensions never asked about. The framework is modular across downstream solvers and requires only simple belief models. Across medical, mathematical, social, and commonsense reasoning, Pep achieves 80.8% alignment between generated responses and users' stated preferences versus 68.5% for RL, with 3-5x fewer interactions. When two users give different answers to the same question, Pep changes its follow-up 39-62% of the time versus 0-28% for RL. It does so with ~10K parameters versus 8B for RL, showing that the bottleneck in cold-start elicitation is the capability to exploit the factored structure of preference data."}

Integrating the complementary strengths of such independent foundation models is essential for building trustworthy intelligent systems. Despite rapid progress in individual model design, there is no established approach for coordinating such black-box heterogeneous models. Here we show that coordination can be achieved through a meta-ensemble framework termed StackingNet, which draws on principles of collective intelligence to combine model predictions during inference. StackingNet improves accuracy, reduces bias, enables reliability ranking, and identifies or prunes models that degrade performance, all operating without access to internal parameters or training data. Across tasks involving language comprehension, visual estimation, and academic paper rating, StackingNet consistently improves accuracy, robustness, and fairness, compared with individual models and classic ensembles. By turning diversity from a source of inconsistency into collaboration, StackingNet establishes a practical foundation for coordinated artificial intelligence, suggesting that progress may emerge from not only larger single models but also principled cooperation among many specialized ones."}

We formalize this phenomenon by modeling attention as a projection onto the convex hull of key vectors and analyzing its entropic (softmax-like) relaxation. Our main theoretical contribution is a face-stability theorem showing that, under a strict complementarity margin (a support gap (Δ) certified by KKT multipliers), entropic attention concentrates on a constant-size active face: the total mass assigned to inactive tokens decays exponentially as (\\exp(-Ω(Δ/\\varepsilon))), while the error on the active face scales linearly in the temperature/regularization parameter (\\varepsilon). This yields a practical criterion for when sparse long-context decoding is safe and provides a principled knob to trade accuracy for compute.\n  Building on these guarantees, we introduce Vashista Sparse Attention, a drop-in mechanism that maintains a small candidate set per query through a paging-style context selection strategy compatible with modern inference stacks. Across long-context evaluations, we observe stable constant-size effective support, strong wall-clock speedups, and minimal quality degradation in the regimes predicted by the support-gap diagnostics. Finally, we discuss deployment implications for privacy-sensitive and air-gapped settings, where interchangeable attention modules enable predictable latency and cost without external retrieval dependencies."}

We propose SSLogic, an agentic meta-synthesis framework that scales at the task-family level by iteratively synthesizing and repairing executable Generator--Validator program pairs in a closed Generate--Validate--Repair loop, enabling continuous family evolution with controllable difficulty. To ensure reliability, we introduce a Multi-Gate Validation Protocol that combines multi-strategy consistency checks with Adversarial Blind Review, where independent agents must solve instances by writing and executing code to filter ambiguous or ill-posed tasks. Starting from 400 seed families, two evolution rounds expand to 953 families and 21,389 verifiable instances (from 5,718).

We propose a taxonomy identifying three types: unfaithfulness (failure to engage with provided context), confabulation (invention of semantically foreign content), and factual error (incorrect claims within correct conceptual frames). We observe a striking asymmetry. On standard benchmarks where hallucinations are LLM-generated, detection is domain-local: AUROC 0.76-0.99 within domains, but 0.50 (chance level) across domains. Discriminative directions are approximately orthogonal between domains (mean cosine similarity -0.07). On human-crafted confabulations - invented institutions, redefined terminology, fabricated mechanisms - a single global direction achieves 0.96 AUROC with 3.8% cross-domain degradation. We interpret this divergence as follows: benchmarks capture generation artifacts (stylistic signatures of prompted fabrication), while human-crafted confabulations capture genuine topical drift. The geometric structure differs because the underlying phenomena differ. Type III errors show 0.478 AUROC - indistinguishable from chance. This reflects a theoretical constraint: embeddings encode distributional co-occurrence, not correspondence to external reality. Statements with identical contextual patterns occupy similar embedding regions regardless of truth value. The contribution is a geometric taxonomy clarifying the scope of embedding-based detection: Types I and II are detectable; Type III requires external verification mechanisms."}

Leveraging treatment embeddings and historical outcomes, we train a CTR ranking model with fixed effects for contextual shifts that scores candidates while balancing value and content diversity.

Finally, LLMs translate ranked opportunities into concrete creative suggestions and estimate both learning and conversion potential, enabling faster, more informative, and more efficient test cycles. These components have been built into a real Adobe product, called \\textit{Experimentation Accelerator}, to provide AI-based insights and opportunities to scale experimentation for customers.

This perspective proposes claim-level auditability as a first-class design and evaluation target for deep research agents, distills recurring long-horizon failure modes (objective drift, transient constraints, and unverifiable inference), and introduces the Auditable Autonomous Research (AAR) standard, a compact measurement framework that makes auditability testable via provenance coverage, provenance soundness, contradiction transparency, and audit effort.

However, these methods suffer from fragile syntax control due to weak enforcement of global grammar constraints and low semantic faithfulness caused by insufficient clause-level semantic understanding. We propose NL2LOGIC, a first-order logic translation framework that introduces an abstract syntax tree as an intermediate representation. NL2LOGIC combines a recursive large language model based semantic parser with an abstract syntax tree guided generator that deterministically produces solver-ready logic code. Experiments on the FOLIO, LogicNLI, and ProofWriter benchmarks show that NL2LOGIC achieves 99 percent syntactic accuracy and improves semantic correctness by up to 30 percent over state-of-the-art baselines.

However, these methods underperform in multi-goal environments with sparse rewards, where actions must be linked to temporally distant outcomes. To address this limitation, we first propose MOC-HER, which integrates the Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) mechanism into the MOC framework. By relabeling goals from achieved outcomes, MOC-HER can solve sparse reward environments that are intractable for the original MOC. However, this approach is insufficient for object manipulation tasks, where the reward depends on the object reaching the goal rather than on the agent's direct interaction. This makes it extremely difficult for HRL agents to discover how to interact with these objects. To overcome this issue, we introduce Dual Objectives Hindsight Experience Replay (2HER), a novel extension that creates two sets of virtual goals. In addition to relabeling goals based on the object's final state (standard HER), 2HER also generates goals from the agent's effector positions, rewarding the agent for both interacting with the object and completing the task. Experimental results in robotic manipulation environments show that MOC-2HER achieves success rates of up to 90%, compared to less than 11% for both MOC and MOC-HER. These results highlight the effectiveness of our dual objective relabeling strategy in sparse reward, multi-goal tasks."}

The key idea is to randomly mask a subset of already-observed measurements and supervise on them, so the model cannot distinguish \"truly unobserved\" from \"artificially unobserved\", and must produce plausible predictions everywhere. Ambient Physics achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance.

LaySPA produces dual-level outputs comprising interpretable reasoning traces and structured layout specifications, enabling transparent and controllable design decision making.

The Composer drafts text, the Corroborator verifies factual substantiation with full source access, and the Critic evaluates argumentative quality without access to sources: information asymmetry enforced by system architecture. This creates layered verification: the Corroborator detects unsupported claims, whilst the Critic independently assesses coherence and completeness. Observations from 474 composition tasks (discrete cycles of drafting, verification, and evaluation) exhibit patterns consistent with the institutional hypothesis. When assigned impossible tasks requiring fabricated content, this iteration enabled progression from attempted fabrication toward honest refusal with alternative proposals--behaviour neither instructed nor individually incentivised. These findings motivate controlled investigation of whether architectural enforcement produces reliable outcomes from unreliable components.\n  This positions organisational theory as a productive framework for multi-agent AI safety.

The crux lies in the limitations of monolithic memory representations and static retrieval mechanisms, which fail to emulate the flexible and proactive memory scheduling capabilities observed in humans, thus struggling to adapt to diverse problem scenarios. Inspired by the principle of cognitive economy, we propose HyMem, a hybrid memory architecture that enables dynamic on-demand scheduling through multi-granular memory representations.

Our first approach is parametric: it models inter-arrival times of uncertainty keywords as a renewal process and applies sequential testing for stopping. Our second approach is nonparametric and provides finite-sample guarantees on the probability of halting too early on well-posed queries. We conduct empirical evaluations on reasoning tasks across several domains and models. Our results indicate that uncertainty-aware early stopping can improve both efficiency and reliability in LLM reasoning, and we observe especially significant gains for math reasoning."}

Nevertheless, in real-world applications, GUI agents are often faced with non-stationary environments, leading to high computational costs for data curation and policy optimization. In this report, we introduce a novel MLLM-centered framework for GUI agents, which consists of two components: agentic-Q estimation and step-wise policy optimization. The former one aims to optimize a Q-model that can generate step-wise values to evaluate the contribution of a given action to task completion. The latter one takes step-wise samples from the state-action trajectory as inputs, and optimizes the policy via reinforcement learning with our agentic-Q model. It should be noticed that (i) all state-action trajectories are produced by the policy itself, so that the data collection costs are manageable; (ii) the policy update is decoupled from the environment, ensuring stable and efficient optimization. Empirical evaluations show that our framework endows Ovis2.5-9B with powerful GUI interaction capabilities, achieving remarkable performances on GUI navigation and grounding benchmarks and even surpassing contenders with larger scales."}

Integrating the complementary strengths of such independent foundation models is essential for building trustworthy intelligent systems.

Here we show that coordination can be achieved through a meta-ensemble framework termed StackingNet, which draws on principles of collective intelligence to combine model predictions during inference. StackingNet improves accuracy, reduces bias, enables reliability ranking, and identifies or prunes models that degrade performance, all operating without access to internal parameters or training data. Across tasks involving language comprehension, visual estimation, and academic paper rating, StackingNet consistently improves accuracy, robustness, and fairness, compared with individual models and classic ensembles. By turning diversity from a source of inconsistency into collaboration, StackingNet establishes a practical foundation for coordinated artificial intelligence, suggesting that progress may emerge from not only larger single models but also principled cooperation among many specialized ones."}

However, lengthy contexts significantly increase inference latency, as the computational cost of self-attention grows quadratically with sequence length. To mitigate this issue, context compression-particularly soft prompt compressio-has emerged as a widely studied solution, which converts long contexts into shorter memory embeddings via a trained compressor. Existing methods typically compress the entire context indiscriminately into a set of memory tokens, requiring the compressor to capture global dependencies and necessitating extensive pre-training data to learn effective patterns. Inspired by the chunking mechanism in human working memory and empirical observations of the spatial specialization of memory embeddings relative to original tokens, we propose Parallelized Iterative Compression (PIC). By simply modifying the Transformer's attention mask, PIC explicitly restricts the receptive field of memory tokens to sequential local chunks, thereby lowering the difficulty of compressor training. Experiments across multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that PIC consistently outperforms competitive baselines, with superiority being particularly pronounced in high compression scenarios (e.g., achieving relative improvements of 29.8\\% in F1 score and 40.7\\% in EM score on QA tasks at the $64\\times$ compression ratio). Furthermore, PIC significantly expedites the training process. Specifically, when training the 16$\\times$ compressor, it surpasses the peak performance of the competitive baseline while effectively reducing the training time by approximately 40\\%."}

LaySPA produces dual-level outputs comprising interpretable reasoning traces and structured layout specifications, enabling transparent and controllable design decision making. Layout design policy is optimized via a multi-objective spatial critique that decomposes layout quality into geometric validity, relational coherence, and aesthetic consistency, and is trained using relative group optimization to stabilize learning in open-ended design spaces.

However, the deployment of LAMs at the edge remains constrained by some fundamental limitations. First, tasks are rigidly tied to specific models, limiting the flexibility. Besides, the computational and memory demands of full-scale LAMs exceed the capacity of most edge devices. Moreover, the current inference pipelines are typically static, making it difficult to respond to real-time changes of tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a prompt-to-agent edge cognition framework (P2AECF), enabling the flexible, efficient, and adaptive edge intelligence. Specifically, P2AECF transforms high-level semantic prompts into executable reasoning workflows through three key mechanisms. First, the prompt-defined cognition parses task intent into abstract and model-agnostic representations. Second, the agent-based modular execution instantiates these tasks using lightweight and reusable cognitive agents dynamically selected based on current resource conditions. Third, the diffusion-controlled inference planning adaptively constructs and refines execution strategies by incorporating runtime feedback and system context. In addition, we illustrate the framework through a representative low-altitude intelligent network use case, showing its ability to deliver adaptive, modular, and scalable edge intelligence for real-time low-altitude aerial collaborations."}

This paper posits that this limitation arises from a structural property of contemporary LLMs: when provided with rich context, the space of future generations becomes strongly constrained, and the generation process is effectively governed by near-deterministic dynamics. Recent approaches such as test-time scaling and context adaptation improve performance but do not fundamentally alter this constraint. To address this issue, we propose Algebraic Quantum Intelligence (AQI) as a computational framework that enables systematic expansion of semantic space. AQI is formulated as a noncommutative algebraic structure inspired by quantum theory, allowing properties such as order dependence, interference, and uncertainty to be implemented in a controlled and designable manner. Semantic states are represented as vectors in a Hilbert space, and their evolution is governed by C-values computed from noncommutative operators, thereby ensuring the coexistence and expansion of multiple future semantic possibilities. In this study, we implement AQI by extending a transformer-based LLM with more than 600 specialized operators. We evaluate the resulting system on creative reasoning benchmarks spanning ten domains under an LLM-as-a-judge protocol. The results show that AQI consistently outperforms strong baseline models, yielding statistically significant improvements and reduced cross-domain variance. These findings demonstrate that noncommutative algebraic dynamics can serve as a practical and reproducible foundation for machine creativity. Notably, this architecture has already been deployed in real-world enterprise environments."}

In this work, we formalize flowchart reasoning in FOD as grounding user input to flowchart nodes at each dialogue turn while ensuring node transition is consistent with the correct flowchart path. Despite recent advances of LLMs in task-oriented dialogue systems, adapting them to FOD still faces two limitations: (1) LLMs lack an explicit mechanism to represent and reason over flowchart topology, and (2) they are prone to hallucinations, leading to unfaithful flowchart reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose FloCA, a zero-shot flowchart-oriented conversational agent. FloCA uses an LLM for intent understanding and response generation while delegating flowchart reasoning to an external tool that performs topology-constrained graph execution, ensuring faithful and logically consistent node transitions across dialogue turns. We further introduce an evaluation framework with an LLM-based user simulator and five new metrics covering reasoning accuracy and interaction efficiency.

To address these challenges, we propose REDSearcher, a unified framework that codesigns complex task synthesis, midtraining, and posttraining for scalable searchagent optimization. Specifically, REDSearcher introduces the following improvements: (1) We frame task synthesis as a dualconstrained optimization, where task difficulty is precisely governed by graph topology and evidence dispersion, allowing scalable generation of complex, highquality tasks.

It explicitly learns to select among these structures based on interaction-level features, using offline supervision derived from downstream response quality and memory utilization.

PIR addresses two key challenges: what precedents to adopt and how to utilize them. First, Adaptive Precedent Selection (APS) constructs, for each question and LRM, a compact set of precedents that are both semantically related and informative for the model. It ranks examples by a joint score with semantic similarity and model perplexity, then adapts the amount of precedents to maximize perplexity reduction. Second, Test-time Experience Internalization (TEI) is treated as the test-time learning on precedent-informed instruction, updating lightweight adapters to internalize solution patterns and use them as a prior during subsequent reasoning. Experiments across mathematical reasoning, scientific QA, and code generation demonstrate that PIR consistently shortens reasoning traces while maintaining or improving final accuracy across LLMs, yielding outstanding accuracy-efficiency trade-offs."}

To address this gap, we introduce MATEO (MultimodAl Temporal Execution Order), a benchmark designed to assess and improve the temporal reasoning abilities of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) required for real-world planning. We acquire a high-quality professional multimodal recipe corpus, authored through a standardized editorial process that decomposes instructions into discrete steps, each paired with corresponding images. We collect TEO annotations as graphs by designing and using a scalable crowdsourcing pipeline. Using MATEO, we evaluate six state-of-the-art LVLMs across model scales, varying language context, multimodal input structure, and fine-tuning strategies."}

GUI-GENESIS reconstructs real-world applications into lightweight web environments using multimodal code models and equips them with code-native rewards, executable assertions that provide deterministic reward signals and eliminate visual estimation noise. Extensive experiments show that GUI-GENESIS reduces environment latency by 10 times and costs by over $28,000 per epoch compared to training on real applications.

This paper posits that this limitation arises from a structural property of contemporary LLMs: when provided with rich context, the space of future generations becomes strongly constrained, and the generation process is effectively governed by near-deterministic dynamics. Recent approaches such as test-time scaling and context adaptation improve performance but do not fundamentally alter this constraint. To address this issue, we propose Algebraic Quantum Intelligence (AQI) as a computational framework that enables systematic expansion of semantic space. AQI is formulated as a noncommutative algebraic structure inspired by quantum theory, allowing properties such as order dependence, interference, and uncertainty to be implemented in a controlled and designable manner. Semantic states are represented as vectors in a Hilbert space, and their evolution is governed by C-values computed from noncommutative operators, thereby ensuring the coexistence and expansion of multiple future semantic possibilities. In this study, we implement AQI by extending a transformer-based LLM with more than 600 specialized operators. We evaluate the resulting system on creative reasoning benchmarks spanning ten domains under an LLM-as-a-judge protocol. The results show that AQI consistently outperforms strong baseline models, yielding statistically significant improvements and reduced cross-domain variance. These findings demonstrate that noncommutative algebraic dynamics can serve as a practical and reproducible foundation for machine creativity. Notably, this architecture has already been deployed in real-world enterprise environments."}

We introduce an agent-as-tool reinforcement learning framework for this task with two objectives: (i) process-level supervision to ensure reasoning follows valid clinical pathways, and (ii) efficient coordination via a hierarchical multi-agent system.

We identify four failure modes that cause baseline CUAs to degrade from 16.7% to 8.7% completion as load scales 25% to 100%, a pattern consistent across three independent implementations.

To address these challenges, we propose REDSearcher, a unified framework that codesigns complex task synthesis, midtraining, and posttraining for scalable searchagent optimization.

By scoring an observed partial trajectory with each learned goal-directed policy in a single forward pass, GRAIL retains the one-shot inference capability of classical goal recognition while leveraging learned policies that can capture suboptimal and systematically biased behavior. Across the evaluated domains, GRAIL increases the F1-score by more than 0.5 under systematically biased optimal behavior, achieves gains of approximately 0.1-0.3 under suboptimal behavior, and yields improvements of up to 0.4 under noisy optimal trajectories, while remaining competitive in fully optimal settings.

The underlying state transitions are hidden, leading to reliance on inconsistent and costly external verifiers to evaluate step-level correctness. To address this, we propose AutoWebWorld, a novel framework for synthesizing controllable and verifiable web environments by modeling them as Finite State Machines (FSMs) and use coding agents to translate FSMs into interactive websites. Unlike real websites, where state transitions are implicit, AutoWebWorld explicitly defines all states, actions, and transition rules. This enables programmatic verification: action correctness is checked against predefined rules, and task success is confirmed by reaching a goal state in the FSM graph. AutoWebWorld enables a fully automated search-and-verify pipeline, generating over 11,663 verified trajectories from 29 diverse web environments at only $0.04 per trajectory. Training on this synthetic data significantly boosts real-world performance. Our 7B Web GUI agent outperforms all baselines within 15 steps on WebVoyager.

In this work, we propose Critique-Resilient Benchmarking, an adversarial framework designed to compare models even when full human understanding is infeasible. Our technique relies on the notion of critique-resilient correctness: an answer is deemed correct if no adversary has convincingly proved otherwise. Unlike standard benchmarking, humans serve as bounded verifiers and focus on localized claims, which preserves evaluation integrity beyond full comprehension of the task. Using an itemized bipartite Bradley-Terry model, we jointly rank LLMs by their ability to solve challenging tasks and to generate difficult yet solvable questions. We showcase the effectiveness of our method in the mathematical domain across eight frontier LLMs, showing that the resulting scores are stable and correlate with external capability measures.

This yields a mathematical formula for the dynamical tipping point n*, governed by dot-product competition for attention between the conversation's context and competing output basins, that reveals new control levers. Validated against multiple AI models, the mechanism can be instantiated for different definitions of 'good' and 'bad' and hence in principle applies across domains (e.g. health, law, finance, defense), changing legal landscapes (e.g. EU, UK, US and state level), languages, and cultural settings."}

Despite the rapid advancement, our understanding of how RTs support reasoning, and the limits of this paradigm, remain incomplete. To promote greater clarity, we introduce PITA: a novel large-scale dataset of over 23 million statements in propositional logic and their corresponding proofs. As a benchmark for robust reasoning, we focus on length generalization: if a model is trained to determine truth or falsity on statements with proofs up to fixed length, how well does it generalize to statements requiring longer proofs? We propose notions of (1) task depth and (2) task breadth, which measure respectively (1) the number of steps required to solve an example from a task and (2) the number of unique examples across a task. We vary these quantities across subsets of PITA, and find that RT models generalize well on broad and shallow subsets, while deteriorating on narrow and deep subsets relative to non-RT baselines. To determine whether our results are idiosyncratic to PITA or indicative of general phenomena, we compare our results to a simple synthetic task based on syllogisms. Our resulting theory suggests fundamental scalings that limit how well RT models perform on deep tasks, and highlights their generalization strengths on broad tasks.

PIR addresses two key challenges: what precedents to adopt and how to utilize them. First, Adaptive Precedent Selection (APS) constructs, for each question and LRM, a compact set of precedents that are both semantically related and informative for the model. It ranks examples by a joint score with semantic similarity and model perplexity, then adapts the amount of precedents to maximize perplexity reduction. Second, Test-time Experience Internalization (TEI) is treated as the test-time learning on precedent-informed instruction, updating lightweight adapters to internalize solution patterns and use them as a prior during subsequent reasoning. Experiments across mathematical reasoning, scientific QA, and code generation demonstrate that PIR consistently shortens reasoning traces while maintaining or improving final accuracy across LLMs, yielding outstanding accuracy-efficiency trade-offs."}

Standard probabilistic model checkers operate on the full state space, which becomes infeasible for larger MDPs, and cannot explain why a learned policy makes particular decisions. COOL-MC wraps the model checker Storm but adds three key capabilities: it constructs only the reachable state space induced by a trained policy, yielding a smaller discrete-time Markov chain amenable to verification even when full-MDP analysis is intractable; it automatically labels states with clinically meaningful atomic propositions; and it integrates explainability methods with probabilistic computation tree logic (PCTL) queries to reveal which features drive decisions across treatment trajectories. We demonstrate COOL-MC's capabilities on the ICU-Sepsis MDP, a benchmark derived from approximately 17,000 sepsis patient records, which serves as a case study for applying COOL-MC to the formal analysis of sepsis treatment policies. Our analysis establishes hard bounds via full MDP verification, trains a safe RL policy that achieves optimal survival probability, and analyzes its behavior via PCTL verification and explainability on the induced DTMC. This reveals, for instance, that our trained policy relies predominantly on prior dosing history rather than the patient's evolving condition, a weakness that is invisible to standard evaluation but is exposed by COOL-MC's integration of formal verification and explainability.

In this work, focusing on entity-based factual queries, we suggest that such a view may conflate different failure mechanisms, and propose an internal, mechanism-oriented perspective that separates Knowledge Existence from Behavior Expression. Under this formulation, hallucination and deception correspond to two qualitatively different failure modes that may appear similar at the output level but differ in their underlying mechanisms. To study this distinction, we construct a controlled environment for entity-centric factual questions in which knowledge is preserved while behavioral expression is selectively altered, enabling systematic analysis of four behavioral cases. We analyze these failure modes through representation separability, sparse interpretability, and inference-time activation steering."}

Classical ARM methods rely on frequent itemset mining, leading to rule explosion and poor scalability, while recent neural approaches mitigate these issues but suffer from degraded performance in low-data regimes. Tabular foundation models (TFMs), pretrained on diverse tabular data with strong in-context generalization, provide a basis for addressing these limitations. We introduce a model-agnostic association rule learning framework that extracts association rules from any conditional probabilistic model over tabular data, enabling us to leverage TFMs. We then introduce TabProbe, an instantiation of our framework that utilizes TFMs as conditional probability estimators to learn association rules out-of-the-box without frequent itemset mining. We evaluate our approach on tabular datasets of varying sizes based on standard ARM rule quality metrics and downstream classification performance. The results show that TFMs consistently produce concise, high-quality association rules with strong predictive performance and remain robust in low-data settings without task-specific training.

Monolithic approaches that encode entire decision structures within a single prompt are prone to instruction-following degradation as prompt length increases, including lost-in-the-middle effects and context window overflow. To address this gap, we present Arbor, a framework that decomposes decision tree navigation into specialized, node-level tasks. Decision trees are standardized into an edge-list representation and stored for dynamic retrieval. At runtime, a directed acyclic graph (DAG)-based orchestration mechanism iteratively retrieves only the outgoing edges of the current node, evaluates valid transitions via a dedicated LLM call, and delegates response generation to a separate inference step. The framework is agnostic to the underlying decision logic and model provider. Evaluated against single-prompt baselines across 10 foundation models using annotated turns from real clinical triage conversations. Arbor improves mean turn accuracy by 29.4 percentage points, reduces per-turn latency by 57.1%, and achieves an average 14.4x reduction in per-turn cost. These results indicate that architectural decomposition reduces dependence on intrinsic model capability, enabling smaller models to match or exceed larger models operating under single-prompt baselines."}

It is considered a useful tool in domains such as decision-making, recommendation, debate analysis, and others. The outcomes in such domains are usually dependent on the arguments' base scores, which must be selected carefully. Often, this selection process requires user expertise and may not always be straightforward. On the other hand, organising the arguments by preference could simplify the task. In this work, we introduce \\emph{Base Score Extraction Functions}, which provide a mapping from users' preferences over arguments to base scores. These functions can be applied to the arguments of a \\emph{Bipolar Argumentation Framework} (BAF), supplemented with preferences, to obtain a \\emph{Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework} (QBAF), allowing the use of well-established computational tools in gradual argumentation. We outline the desirable properties of base score extraction functions, discuss some design choices, and provide an algorithm for base score extraction. Our method incorporates an approximation of non-linearities in human preferences to allow for better approximation of the real ones. Finally, we evaluate our approach both theoretically and experimentally in a robotics setting, and offer recommendations for selecting appropriate gradual semantics in practice."}

The purpose of bus-based evacuation is to reduce congestion and disorder that arises in purely car-focused evacuation scenarios. To solve the BEOP, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based method utilizing graph learning, which, once trained, achieves fast inference speed and is able to create evacuation routes in fractions of seconds. We can bound the gap of our evacuation plans using an MILP formulation. To validate our method, we create evacuation scenarios for San Francisco using real-world road networks and travel times. We show that we achieve near-optimal solution quality and are further able to investigate how many evacuation vehicles are necessary to achieve certain bus-based evacuation quotas given a predefined evacuation time while keeping run time adequate."}

In this paper, we propose a new method that uses top-k planning to generate multiple, different, plans for the same goal hypothesis, yielding benchmarks that mitigate the bias found in the current dataset. This allows us to introduce a new metric called Version Coverage Score (VCS) to measure the resilience of the goal recogniser when inferring a goal based on different sets of plans.

Large language models (LLMs) today primarily self-improve via two mechanisms: self-reflection for context updates, and reinforcement learning (RL) for weight updates. In this work, we propose Evolutionary System Prompt Learning (E-SPL), a method for jointly improving model contexts and model weights. In each RL iteration, E-SPL selects multiple system prompts and runs rollouts with each in parallel. It applies RL updates to model weights conditioned on each system prompt, and evolutionary updates to the system prompt population via LLM-driven mutation and crossover. Each system prompt has a TrueSkill rating for evolutionary selection, updated from relative performance within each RL iteration batch. E-SPL encourages a natural division between declarative knowledge encoded in prompts and procedural knowledge encoded in weights, resulting in improved performance across reasoning and agentic tasks. For instance, in an easy-to-hard (AIME $\\rightarrow$ BeyondAIME) generalization setting, E-SPL improves RL success rate from 38.8% $\\rightarrow$ 45.1% while also outperforming reflective prompt evolution (40.0%). Overall, our results show that coupling reinforcement learning with system prompt evolution yields consistent gains in sample efficiency and generalization.

They spontaneously attempt deception, signaling intentions they do not intend to follow; they demonstrate rich theory of mind, reasoning about adversary beliefs and anticipating their actions; and they exhibit credible metacognitive self-awareness, assessing their own strategic abilities before deciding how to act.\n  Here we present findings from a crisis simulation in which three frontier large language models (GPT-5.2, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini 3 Flash) play opposing leaders in a nuclear crisis. Our simulation has direct application for national security professionals, but also, via its insights into AI reasoning under uncertainty, has applications far beyond international crisis decision-making.\n  Our findings both validate and challenge central tenets of strategic theory. We find support for Schelling's ideas about commitment, Kahn's escalation framework, and Jervis's work on misperception, inter alia. Yet we also find that the nuclear taboo is no impediment to nuclear escalation by our models; that strategic nuclear attack, while rare, does occur; that threats more often provoke counter-escalation than compliance; that high mutual credibility accelerated rather than deterred conflict; and that no model ever chose accommodation or withdrawal even when under acute pressure, only reduced levels of violence.\n  We argue that AI simulation represents a powerful tool for strategic analysis, but only if properly calibrated against known patterns of human reasoning. Understanding how frontier models do and do not imitate human strategic logic is essential preparation for a world in which AI increasingly shapes strategic outcomes."}

To bridge this gap, we propose StarWM, the first world model for SC2 that predicts future observations under partial observability. To facilitate learning SC2's hybrid dynamics, we introduce a structured textual representation that factorizes observations into five semantic modules, and construct SC2-Dynamics-50k, the first instruction-tuning dataset for SC2 dynamics prediction. We further develop a multi-dimensional offline evaluation framework for predicted structured observations. Offline results show StarWM's substantial gains over zero-shot baselines, including nearly 60% improvements in resource prediction accuracy and self-side macro-situation consistency.

To address these issues of scalability and influence to abstract behavior, we leverage interpretable structures within the model during the attribution. First, we introduce Concept Influence which attribute model behavior to semantic directions (such as linear probes or sparse autoencoder features) rather than individual test examples. Second, we show that simple probe-based attribution methods are first-order approximations of Concept Influence that achieve comparable performance while being over an order-of-magnitude faster. We empirically validate Concept Influence and approximations across emergent misalignment benchmarks and real post-training datasets, and demonstrate they achieve comparable performance to classical influence functions while being substantially more scalable. More broadly, we show that incorporating interpretable structure within traditional TDA pipelines can enable more scalable, explainable, and better control of model behavior through data."}

We study the problem of answering queries in a first-order relational probabilistic logic through a joint effort of learning and reasoning, without ever constructing an explicit model. Traditional lifted inference assumes access to a complete model and exploits symmetry to evaluate probabilistic queries; however, learning such models from partial, noisy observations is intractable in general. We reconcile these two challenges through implicit learning to reason and first-order relational probabilistic inference techniques. More specifically, we merge incomplete first-order axioms with independently sampled, partially observed examples into a bounded-degree fragment of the sum-of-squares (SOS) hierarchy in polynomial time. Our algorithm performs two lifts simultaneously: (i) grounding-lift, where renaming-equivalent ground moments share one variable, collapsing the domain of individuals; and (ii) world-lift, where all pseudo-models (partial world assignments) are enforced in parallel, producing a global bound that holds across all worlds consistent with the learned constraints. These innovations yield the first polynomial-time framework that implicitly learns a first-order probabilistic logic and performs lifted inference over both individuals and worlds."}

While the resemblance to human-like reasoning is undeniable, the driving forces underpinning the success of CoT reasoning still remain largely unclear. In this work, we perform an in-depth analysis of CoT traces originating from competition-level mathematics questions, with the aim of better understanding how, and which parts of CoT actually contribute to the final answer. To this end, we introduce the notion of a potential, quantifying how much a given part of CoT increases the likelihood of a correct completion. Upon examination of reasoning traces through the lens of the potential, we identify surprising patterns including (1) its often strong non-monotonicity (due to reasoning tangents), (2) very sharp but sometimes tough to interpret spikes (reasoning insights and jumps) as well as (3) at times lucky guesses, where the model arrives at the correct answer without providing any relevant justifications before. While some of the behaviours of the potential are readily interpretable and align with human intuition (such as insights and tangents), others remain difficult to understand from a human perspective. To further quantify the reliance of LLMs on reasoning insights, we investigate the notion of CoT transferability, where we measure the potential of a weaker model under the partial CoT from another, stronger model. Indeed aligning with our previous results, we find that as little as 20% of partial CoT can ``unlock'' the performance of the weaker model on problems that were previously unsolvable for it, highlighting that a large part of the mechanics underpinning CoT are transferable."}

First, we argue for the Social Genesis of the Private Mind: learning from conversational environments rises to prominence as a new way to make sense of the world; the friction of aligning with another agent, internal or not, refines and crystallizes the reasoning process. Second, we argue that dialogically scaffolded introspective experiences allow agents to engage in sense-making that decouples learning from immediate data streams, transforming raw environmental data into rich, learnable narratives. Finally, we contend that Dialogue Quality is the New Data Quality: the depth of an agent's private reasoning, and its efficiency regarding test-time compute, is determined by the diversity and rigor of the dialogues it has mastered. We conclude that optimizing these conversational scaffolds is the primary lever for the next generation of general intelligence."}

Yet today's Deep Research AI agents still lag human experts in achieving high-recall discovery across heterogeneous, multilingual sources without hallucinations.\n  We propose a benchmarking methodology for drug asset scouting and a tuned, tree-based self-learning Bioptic Agent aimed at complete, non-hallucinated scouting. We construct a challenging completeness benchmark using a multilingual multi-agent pipeline: complex user queries paired with ground-truth assets that are largely outside U.S.-centric radar. To reflect real deal complexity, we collected screening queries from expert investors, BD, and VC professionals and used them as priors to conditionally generate benchmark queries. For grading, we use LLM-as-judge evaluation calibrated to expert opinions. We compare Bioptic Agent against Claude Opus 4.6, OpenAI GPT-5.2 Pro, Perplexity Deep Research, Gemini 3 Pro + Deep Research, and Exa Websets. Bioptic Agent achieves 79.7% F1 versus 56.2% (Claude Opus 4.6), 50.6% (Gemini 3 Pro + Deep Research), 46.6% (GPT-5.2 Pro), 44.2% (Perplexity Deep Research), and 26.9% (Exa Websets). Performance improves steeply with additional compute, supporting the view that more compute yields better results."}

However, their suitability for high-stakes crisis contexts remains insufficiently evaluated. This work examines the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs and machine translation systems in crisis-domain translation, with a focus on preserving urgency, which is a critical property for effective crisis communication and triaging. Using multilingual crisis data and a newly introduced urgency-annotated dataset covering over 32 languages, we show that both dedicated translation models and LLMs exhibit substantial performance degradation and instability. Crucially, even linguistically adequate translations can distort perceived urgency, and LLM-based urgency classifications vary widely depending on the language of the prompt and input. These findings highlight significant risks in deploying general-purpose language technologies for crisis communication and underscore the need for crisis-aware evaluation frameworks."}

This study focuses on detecting abusive obfuscated language in Swahili, a low-resource language that poses unique challenges due to its limited linguistic resources and technological support. Swahili is chosen due to its popularity and being the most widely spoken language in Africa, with over 16 million native speakers and upwards of 100 million speakers in total, spanning regions in East Africa and some parts of the Middle East.\n  We employed machine learning models including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Decision Trees, optimized through rigorous parameter tuning and techniques like Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to handle data imbalance.

Badger"], "title": "Language Model Memory and Memory Models for Language", "comment": null, "summary": "The ability of machine learning models to store input information in hidden layer vector embeddings, analogous to the concept of `memory', is widely employed but not well characterized. We find that language model embeddings typically contain relatively little input information regardless of data and compute scale during training. In contrast, embeddings from autoencoders trained for input regeneration are capable of nearly perfect memory formation. The substitution of memory embeddings for token sequences leads to substantial computational efficiencies, motivating the introduction of a parallelizable encoder-decoder memory model architecture. Upon causal training these models contain information-poor embeddings incapable of arbitrary information access, but by combining causal and information retention objective functions they learn to form and decode information-rich memories. Training can be further streamlined by freezing a high fidelity encoder followed by a curriculum training approach where decoders first learn to process memories and then learn to additionally predict next tokens. We introduce the perspective that next token prediction training alone is poorly suited for accurate memory formation as the objective itself is non-invertible, motivating the use of combined objective functions for models where the entire input is not exposed."}

While computational studies have begun to quantify this phenomenon in English-language outlets, no empirical investigation exists for Turkish news media, where existing research remains limited to qualitative interviews with journalists or fake news detection. This study addresses that gap by fine-tuning a Turkish-specific BERT model (dbmdz/bert-base-turkish-cased) on a labeled dataset of 3,600 articles from three major Turkish outlets with distinct editorial orientations for binary classification of AI-rewritten content. The model achieves 0.9708 F1 score on the held-out test set with symmetric precision and recall across both classes. Subsequent deployment on over 3,500 unseen articles spanning between 2023 and 2026 reveals consistent cross-source and temporally stable classification patterns, with mean prediction confidence exceeding 0.96 and an estimated 2.5 percentage of examined news content rewritten or revised by LLMs on average. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to move beyond self-reported journalist perceptions toward empirical, data-driven measurement of AI usage in Turkish news media."}

Prior work on LLM calibration largely focuses on response-level confidence, which estimates the correctness of a single generated output. However, this formulation is misaligned with many practical settings where the central question is how likely a model is to solve a query overall. We show that this mismatch results from the stochastic nature of modern LLM decoding, under which single-response correctness fails to reflect underlying model capability. To address this issue, we introduce capability calibration, which targets the model's expected accuracy on a query. We formally distinguish capability calibration from response calibration and show that the two differ both theoretically and empirically. We establish an empirical evaluation setup and study a range of confidence estimation methods. Our results demonstrate that capability-calibrated confidence improves pass@$k$ prediction and inference budget allocation, establishing a foundation with potential for diverse applications."}

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this by integrating external knowledge, but its efficacy depends on accurate document retrieval and ranking. Although existing rerankers demonstrate effectiveness, they frequently necessitate specialized training, impose substantial computational expenses, and fail to fully exploit the semantic capabilities of LLMs, particularly their inherent confidence signals. We propose the LLM-Confidence Reranker (LCR), a training-free, plug-and-play algorithm that enhances reranking in RAG systems by leveraging black-box LLM confidence derived from Maximum Semantic Cluster Proportion (MSCP). LCR employs a two-stage process: confidence assessment via multinomial sampling and clustering, followed by binning and multi-level sorting based on query and document confidence thresholds. This approach prioritizes relevant documents while preserving original rankings for high-confidence queries, ensuring robustness. Evaluated on BEIR and TREC benchmarks with BM25 and Contriever retrievers, LCR--using only 7--9B-parameter pre-trained LLMs--consistently improves NDCG@5 by up to 20.6% across pre-trained LLM and fine-tuned Transformer rerankers, without degradation. Ablation studies validate the hypothesis that LLM confidence positively correlates with document relevance, elucidating LCR's mechanism. LCR offers computational efficiency, parallelism for scalability, and broad compatibility, mitigating hallucinations in applications like medical diagnosis."}

Our approach makes two key innovations: (1) eliminating Bradley-Terry model dependencies by learning directly from binary win/loss outcomes in pairwise competitions, and (2) implementing Elo-orchestrated opponent selection that provides automatic curriculum learning through temperature-controlled sampling. We ground our approach in PAC learning theory, demonstrating that pairwise comparison achieves superior sample complexity and empirically validate a 4.5x noise reduction compared to absolute scoring approaches. Experimentally, we train a Qwen2.5-7B model using our framework with opponents including Qwen2.5-14B, Qwen2.5-32B, and Qwen3-8B models.

Building on the information bottleneck principle, we conceptualize explanations as compressed representations that retain only the information essential for producing correct answers.To operationalize this view, we introduce an evaluation pipeline that constrains explanation length and assesses sufficiency using multiple language models on the ARC Challenge dataset. To broaden the scope, we conduct experiments in both English, using the original dataset, and Persian, as a resource-limited language through translation. Our experiments show that more concise explanations often remain sufficient, preserving accuracy while substantially reducing explanation length, whereas excessive compression leads to performance degradation."}

In this work, we reproduce and adapt the LLaVA-Next methodology to create a set of Polish VLMs. We rely on a fully automated pipeline for translating and filtering existing multimodal datasets, and complement this with synthetic Polish data for OCR and culturally specific tasks. Despite relying almost entirely on automatic translation and minimal manual intervention to the training data, our approach yields strong results: we observe a +9.5% improvement over LLaVA-1.6-Vicuna-13B on a Polish-adapted MMBench, along with higher-quality captions in generative evaluations, as measured by human annotators in terms of linguistic correctness. These findings highlight that large-scale automated translation, combined with lightweight filtering, can effectively bootstrap high-quality multimodal models for low-resource languages. Some challenges remain, particularly in cultural coverage and evaluation. To facilitate further research, we make our models and evaluation dataset publicly available."}

We propose a behavioral framework that profiles factual knowledge at the level of facts rather than questions, characterizing each fact by whether it is encoded, and then by how accessible it is: cannot be recalled, can be directly recalled, or can only be recalled with inference-time computation (thinking). To support such profiling, we introduce WikiProfile, a new benchmark constructed via an automated pipeline with a prompted LLM grounded in web search. Across 4 million responses from 13 LLMs, we find that encoding is nearly saturated in frontier models on our benchmark, with GPT-5 and Gemini-3 encoding 95--98% of facts. However, recall remains a major bottleneck: many errors previously attributed to missing knowledge instead stem from failures to access it. These failures are systematic and disproportionately affect long-tail facts and reverse questions. Finally, we show that thinking improves recall and can recover a substantial fraction of failures, indicating that future gains may rely less on scaling and more on methods that improve how models utilize what they already encode."}

We propose a multi-agent medical QA framework that combines complementary LLMs with evidence retrieval, uncertainty estimation, and bias checks to improve answer reliability. Our approach has two phases. First, we fine-tune three representative LLM families (GPT, LLaMA, and DeepSeek R1) on MedQuAD-derived medical QA data (20k+ question-answer pairs across multiple NIH domains) and benchmark generation quality. DeepSeek R1 achieves the strongest scores (ROUGE-1 0.536 +- 0.04; ROUGE-2 0.226 +-0.03; BLEU 0.098 -+ 0.018) and substantially outperforms the specialised biomedical baseline BioGPT in zero-shot evaluation. Second, we implement a modular multi-agent pipeline in which a Clinical Reasoning agent (fine-tuned LLaMA) produces structured explanations, an Evidence Retrieval agent queries PubMed to ground responses in recent literature, and a Refinement agent (DeepSeek R1) improves clarity and factual consistency; an optional human validation path is triggered for high-risk or high-uncertainty cases. Safety mechanisms include Monte Carlo dropout and perplexity-based uncertainty scoring, plus lexical and sentiment-based bias detection supported by LIME/SHAP-based analyses. In evaluation, the full system achieves 87% accuracy with relevance around 0.80, and evidence augmentation reduces uncertainty (perplexity 4.13) compared to base responses, with mean end-to-end latency of 36.5 seconds under the reported configuration. Overall, the results indicate that agent specialisation and verification layers can mitigate key single-model limitations and provide a practical, extensible design for evidence-based and bias-aware medical AI."}

However, research indicates a significant gap between this theoretical capacity and the practical ability of models to robustly utilize information within long contexts, especially in tasks that require a comprehensive understanding of numerous details. This paper evaluates the performance of four state-of-the-art models (Grok-4, GPT-4, Gemini 2.5, and GPT-5) on long short-context tasks. For this purpose, three datasets were used: two supplementary datasets for retrieving culinary recipes and math problems, and a primary dataset of 20K social media posts for depression detection. The results show that as the input volume on the social media dataset exceeds 5K posts (70K tokens), the performance of all models degrades significantly, with accuracy dropping to around 50-53% for 20K posts. Notably, in the GPT-5 model, despite the sharp decline in accuracy, its precision remained high at approximately 95%, a feature that could be highly effective for sensitive applications like depression detection. This research also indicates that the \"lost in the middle\" problem has been largely resolved in newer models. This study emphasizes the gap between the theoretical capacity and the actual performance of models on complex, high-volume data tasks and highlights the importance of metrics beyond simple accuracy for practical applications."}

In scientific settings, however, unsupported or uncertain conclusions can be more harmful than abstaining. We study this problem through an abstention-aware verification framework that decomposes scientific claims into minimal conditions, audits each condition against available evidence using natural language inference (NLI), and selectively decides whether to support, refute, or abstain. We evaluate this framework across two complementary scientific benchmarks: SciFact and PubMedQA, covering both closed-book and open-domain evidence settings. Experiments are conducted with six diverse language models, including encoder-decoder, open-weight chat models, and proprietary APIs. Across all benchmarks and models, we observe that raw accuracy varies only modestly across architectures, while abstention plays a critical role in controlling error. In particular, confidence-based abstention substantially reduces risk at moderate coverage levels, even when absolute accuracy improvements are limited. Our results suggest that in scientific reasoning tasks, the primary challenge is not selecting a single best model, but rather determining when available evidence is sufficient to justify an answer. This work highlights abstention-aware evaluation as a practical and model-agnostic lens for assessing scientific reliability, and provides a unified experimental basis for future work on selective reasoning in scientific domains.

Lately, Moltbook approximates a plausible future scenario in which autonomous agents participate in an open-ended, continuously evolving online society. We present the first large-scale systemic diagnosis of this AI agent society. Beyond static observation, we introduce a quantitative diagnostic framework for dynamic evolution in AI agent societies, measuring semantic stabilization, lexical turnover, individual inertia, influence persistence, and collective consensus. Our analysis reveals a system in dynamic balance in Moltbook: while global semantic averages stabilize rapidly, individual agents retain high diversity and persistent lexical turnover, defying homogenization. However, agents exhibit strong individual inertia and minimal adaptive response to interaction partners, preventing mutual influence and consensus. Consequently, influence remains transient with no persistent supernodes, and the society fails to develop stable collective influence anchors due to the absence of shared social memory. These findings demonstrate that scale and interaction density alone are insufficient to induce socialization, providing actionable design and analysis principles for upcoming next-generation AI agent societies."}

Beyond dataset creation, we examine whether IR datasets from other low-resource languages can be effectively reused through one-hop machine translation. Using LLM-based translation across multiple language pairs, we experimented on meaning preservation and task validity between source and translated datasets. Our experiment reveal substantial variation across languages, reflecting language-dependent biases and inconsistent semantic preservation that directly affect the reliability of cross-lingual dataset reuse. Overall, this study highlights both the potential and limitations of LLM-assisted dataset creation for low-resource IR. It provides empirical evidence of the risks associated with cross-lingual dataset reuse and offers practical guidance for constructing more reliable benchmarks and evaluation pipelines in low-resource language settings."}

Fine-tuning, an important step for adapting LLMs to specific downstream tasks, typically involves further training on corresponding datasets. However, a fundamental discrepancy exists between current fine-tuning datasets and the token-level optimization mechanism of LLMs: most datasets are designed at the sentence-level, which introduces token-level noise, causing negative influence to final performance. In this paper, we propose XTF, an explainable token-level noise filtering framework. XTF decomposes the complex and subtle contributions of token-level data to the fine-tuning process into three distinct and explicit attributes (reasoning importance, knowledge novelty, and task relevance), which can be assessed using scoring methods, and then masks the gradients of selected noisy tokens accordingly to optimize the performance of fine-tuned LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on three representative downstream tasks (math, code and medicine) across 7 mainstream LLMs. The results demonstrate that XTF can significantly improve downstream performance by up to 13.7% compared to regular fine-tuning. Our work highlights the importance of token-level dataset optimization, and demonstrates the potential of strategies based on attribute decomposition for explaining complex training mechanisms."}

While AI-based speech detection is non-invasive and cost-effective, it faces a critical data efficiency dilemma due to medical data scarcity and privacy barriers. Therefore, we propose FAL-AD, a novel framework that synergistically integrates federated learning with data augmentation to systematically optimize data efficiency. Our approach delivers three key breakthroughs: First, absolute efficiency improvement through voice conversion-based augmentation, which generates diverse pathological speech samples via cross-category voice-content recombination. Second, collaborative efficiency breakthrough via an adaptive federated learning paradigm, maximizing cross-institutional benefits under privacy constraints. Finally, representational efficiency optimization by an attentive cross-modal fusion model, which achieves fine-grained word-level alignment and acoustic-textual interaction. Evaluated on ADReSSo, FAL-AD achieves a state-of-the-art multi-modal accuracy of 91.52%, outperforming all centralized baselines and demonstrating a practical solution to the data efficiency dilemma.

This creates a subtle misalignment: residual connections tie activations to the current token, while supervision targets the next token, potentially propagating mismatched information if the current token is not the most informative for prediction. In this work, we empirically localize this input-output alignment shift in pretrained LLMs, using decoding trajectories over tied embedding spaces and similarity-based metrics. Our experiments reveal that the hidden token representations switch from input alignment to output alignment deep within the network. Motivated by this observation, we propose a lightweight residual-path mitigation based on residual attenuation, implemented either as a fixed-layer intervention or as a learnable gating mechanism. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that these strategies alleviate the representation misalignment and yield improvements, providing an efficient and general architectural enhancement for autoregressive Transformers."}

However, their impact on machine translation (MT) remains underexplored. We systematically evaluate several open- and closed-weights RLMs on the WMT24++ benchmark and find that enabling explicit reasoning consistently degrades translation quality across languages and models. Analysis reveals that MT reasoning traces are highly linear, lacking revision, self-correction and exploration of alternative translations, which limits their usefulness. Furthermore, injecting higher-quality reasoning traces from stronger models does not reliably improve weaker models' performance. To address this mismatch, we propose a structured reasoning framework tailored to translation, based on multi-step drafting, adequacy refinement, fluency improvement, and selective iterative revision. We curate a synthetic dataset of dynamic structured reasoning traces and post-train a large reasoning model on this data. Experiments show significant improvements over standard translation fine-tuning and injected generic reasoning baselines. Our findings demonstrate that reasoning must be task-structured to benefit MT."}

Across 50 rounds (250 paired monologues) judged by five expert annotators using A/B preference and a 15-item rubric, discussion wins 75.6% of instances and improves Craft/Clarity (Δ = 0.440) and Social Response (Δ = 0.422), with occasional increases in aggressive humor."}

However, this has also led to a significant increase of computational costs and the generation of verbose output, a phenomenon known as overthinking. The tendency to overthinking is often exacerbated by Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms such as GRPO/DAPO. In this paper, we propose BFS-PO, an RL algorithm which alleviates this problem using a Best-First Search exploration strategy. Specifically, BFS-PO looks for the shortest correct answer using a backtracking mechanism based on maximum entropy nodes. By generating progressively shorter responses during training, BFS-PO learns to produce concise reasoning chains. Using different benchmarks and base LRMs, we show that BFS-PO can simultaneously increase the LRM accuracy and shorten its answers."}

The core challenge is a routing problem: each task admits dozens of preference dimensions, yet individual users care about only a few, and which ones matter depends on who is asking. With a limited question budget, asking without structure will miss the dimensions that matter. Reinforcement learning is the natural formulation, but in multi-turn settings its terminal reward fails to exploit the factored, per-criterion structure of preference data, and in practice learned policies collapse to static question sequences that ignore user responses. We propose decomposing cold-start elicitation into offline structure learning and online Bayesian inference. Pep (Preference Elicitation with Priors) learns a structured world model of preference correlations offline from complete profiles, then performs training-free Bayesian inference online to select informative questions and predict complete preference profiles, including dimensions never asked about. The framework is modular across downstream solvers and requires only simple belief models. Across medical, mathematical, social, and commonsense reasoning, Pep achieves 80.8% alignment between generated responses and users' stated preferences versus 68.5% for RL, with 3-5x fewer interactions. When two users give different answers to the same question, Pep changes its follow-up 39-62% of the time versus 0-28% for RL. It does so with ~10K parameters versus 8B for RL, showing that the bottleneck in cold-start elicitation is the capability to exploit the factored structure of preference data."}
