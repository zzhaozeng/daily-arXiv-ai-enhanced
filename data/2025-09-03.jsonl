Ali", "Anis Koubaa", "Bilel Benjdira"], "title": "Dual-Stage Global and Local Feature Framework for Image Dehazing", "comment": null, "summary": "Addressing the challenge of removing atmospheric fog or haze from digital\nimages, known as image dehazing, has recently gained significant traction in\nthe computer vision community. Although contemporary dehazing models have\ndemonstrated promising performance, few have thoroughly investigated\nhigh-resolution imagery. In such scenarios, practitioners often resort to\ndownsampling the input image or processing it in smaller patches, which leads\nto a notable performance degradation. This drop is primarily linked to the\ndifficulty of effectively combining global contextual information with\nlocalized, fine-grained details as the spatial resolution grows. In this\nchapter, we propose a novel framework, termed the Streamlined Global and Local\nFeatures Combinator (SGLC), to bridge this gap and enable robust dehazing for\nhigh-resolution inputs. Our approach is composed of two principal components:\nthe Global Features Generator (GFG) and the Local Features Enhancer (LFE). The\nGFG produces an initial dehazed output by focusing on broad contextual\nunderstanding of the scene. Subsequently, the LFE refines this preliminary\noutput by enhancing localized details and pixel-level features, thereby\ncapturing the interplay between global appearance and local structure. To\nevaluate the effectiveness of SGLC, we integrated it with the Uformer\narchitecture, a state-of-the-art dehazing model. Experimental results on\nhigh-resolution datasets reveal a considerable improvement in peak\nsignal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) when employing SGLC, indicating its potency in\naddressing haze in large-scale imagery. Moreover, the SGLC design is\nmodel-agnostic, allowing any dehazing network to be augmented with the proposed\nglobal-and-local feature fusion mechanism. Through this strategy, practitioners\ncan harness both scene-level cues and granular details, significantly improving\nvisual fidelity in high-resolution environments."}

Therefore, while recent methods (e.g., IntrinsicAnything)\nhave achieved breakthroughs by harnessing powerful diffusion priors, they\nremain predominantly trained on large-scale synthetic datasets (e.g.,\nObjaverse) and applied directly to real-world RGB images, which ignores the\nlarge domain gap between synthetic and real-world data and leads to suboptimal\ngeneralization performance. In this work, we address this gap by proposing\nIntrinsicReal, a novel domain adaptation framework that bridges the\nabove-mentioned domain gap for real-world intrinsic image decomposition.\nSpecifically, our IntrinsicReal adapts IntrinsicAnything to the real domain by\nfine-tuning it using its high-quality output albedos selected by a novel dual\npseudo-labeling strategy: i) pseudo-labeling with an absolute confidence\nthreshold on classifier predictions, and ii) pseudo-labeling using the relative\npreference ranking of classifier predictions for individual input objects. This\nstrategy is inspired by human evaluation, where identifying the highest-quality\noutputs is straightforward, but absolute scores become less reliable for\nsub-optimal cases. In these situations, relative comparisons of outputs become\nmore accurate.

While both approaches prove\neffective independently, the third paradigm of applying RLHF to\ndistillation-trained models presents significant challenges. Our investigation\nreveals two critical phenomena that emerge in this paradigm: Sequence Length\nCollapse, where language generation dramatically reduces during early RLHF\ntraining, and the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, featuring severe reward score\ndrops followed by gradual recovery. These instabilities fundamentally\ncompromise the model's alignment and reasoning capabilities. To address these\nchallenges, we propose Balanced Actor Initialization (BAI), a two-stage\nweighted model merging approach. BAI first merges instruction-following and\ndistillation-based reasoning fine-tuned models, then further combines this\nintermediate model with the pretrained model to preserve foundational\nknowledge. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and\ndetailed analysis of training experiments, we demonstrate that BAI resolves\nSequence Length Collapse, mitigates the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, and enables\ncontinuous sequence length improvement during training.

This paper, therefore, attempts to directly\nleverage point features to calibrate the heterogeneous foundation model of any\nmodality for 3D point cloud analysis. Specifically, we propose the Adaptive\nPoint-Prompt Tuning (APPT) method, which fine-tunes pre-trained models with a\nmodest number of parameters, enabling direct point cloud processing without\nheterogeneous mappings. We convert raw point clouds into point embeddings by\naggregating local geometry to capture spatial features followed by linear\nlayers to ensure seamless utilization of frozen pre-trained models.

Standard decoding methods for MDMs,\nsuch as confidence-based sampling, select tokens independently based on\nindividual token confidences at each diffusion step.

To mitigate this pheonomenon, we propose\nReward-Weighted Sampling (RWS), a novel decoding strategy that leverages an\nexternal reward model to provide a principled global signal during the\niterative diffusion process. Specifically, at each diffusion step, RWS\nevaluates the quality of the entire intermediate sequence and scales token\nlogits accordingly, guiding token selection by integrating global\nsequence-level coherence. This method selectively increases the confidence of\ntokens that initially have lower scores, thereby promoting a more\nnon-autoregressive generation order.

To mitigate the style\ngap, unpaired image-to-image (UI2I) translation methods aim to transfer images\nfrom a source domain, corresponding to new device acquisitions, to a target\ndomain where a frozen task model has been trained for downstream applications.\nHowever, existing UI2I methods have not explicitly considered filtering the\nmost relevant style features, which may result in translated images misaligned\nwith the needs of downstream tasks. In this work, we propose TRUST, a\ntoken-driven dual-stream framework that preserves source content while\ntransferring the common style of the target domain, ensuring that content and\nstyle remain unblended. Given multiple styles in the target domain, we\nintroduce a Token-dRiven (TR) module that operates from two perspectives: (1) a\ndata view--selecting \"suitable\" target tokens corresponding to each source\ntoken, and (2) a model view--identifying ``optimal\" target tokens for the\ndownstream model, guided by a behavior mirror loss. Additionally, we inject\nauxiliary prompts into the source encoder to match content representation with\ndownstream behavior.

Recent work also shows\nthat removing the causal mask in fine-tuning enables decoder-based LLMs to\nbecome effective token classifiers. Less work, however, focused on (supervised)\ngenerative SL, a more natural setting for causal LLMs. Due to their rapid\nscaling, causal LLMs applied to SL are expected to outperform encoders, whose\nown development has stagnated. In this work, we propose supervised in-context\nfine-tuning (SIFT) for generative SL.

SIFT considerably\noutperforms both ICL and decoder-as-encoder fine-tuning baselines on a range of\nstandard SL tasks.

We propose to\nreorganize preference-labeled critic datasets into verifiable training signals\nand perform reinforcement learning directly on a base generative model,\nproducing LLaVA-Critic-R1, a multimodal critic trained to optimize preference\njudgments while retaining full generation ability. Surprisingly,\nLLaVA-Critic-R1 emerges not only as a top-performing critic but also as a\ncompetitive policy model -- matching or surpassing specialized reasoning VLMs\ntrained with in-domain data across 26 visual reasoning and understanding\nbenchmarks, with an average gain of +5.7% over its base model (Qwen-2.5-VL-7B).\nExtending this approach to existing strong reasoning VLMs yields\nLLaVA-Critic-R1+, which further advances policy performance without sacrificing\ncritic quality, achieving a SoTA performance of 71.9 on MMMU at the 7B scale.\nFinally, we show that the enhanced critic ability benefits inference: applying\nself-critique at test time yields an average +13.8% improvement on five\nrepresentative reasoning tasks without additional training.

On the one hand, researchers have been continuously improving the\nbrain decoding framework of visual prostheses by leveraging the powerful image\ngeneration capabilities of diffusion models. On the other hand, the brain\nencoding stage of visual prostheses struggles to generate brain signals with\nsufficient biological similarity. Although existing works have recognized this\nproblem, the quality of predicted stimuli still remains a critical issue, as\nexisting approaches typically lack supervised signals from real brain responses\nto validate the biological plausibility of predicted stimuli. To address this\nissue, we propose a novel image-to-brain framework based on denoising diffusion\nprobabilistic models (DDPMs) enhanced with cross-attention mechanisms. Our\nframework consists of two key architectural components: a pre-trained CLIP\nvisual encoder that extracts rich semantic representations from input images,\nand a cross-attention enhanced U-Net diffusion model that learns to reconstruct\nbiologically plausible brain signals through iterative denoising. Unlike\nconventional generative models that rely on simple concatenation for\nconditioning, our cross-attention modules enable dynamic interaction between\nvisual features and brain signal representations, facilitating fine-grained\nalignment during the generation process. We evaluate our framework on two\nmultimodal datasets (THINGS-EEG2 and THINGS-MEG) to demonstrate its\neffectiveness in generating biologically plausible brain signals. Moreover, we\nvisualize the training and test M/EEG topographies for all subjects on both\ndatasets to intuitively demonstrate the intra-subject variations and\ninter-subject variations in M/EEG signals."}

Experiments demonstrate that compared with previous SOTA\nmethods, SDM not only exhibits stronger attack performance but also achieves\nhigher attack cost-effectiveness. Additionally, SDM can be combined with\nadversarial training methods to enhance their defensive effects. The code is\navailable at https://github.com/X-L-Liu/SDM."}

This, along with\nMarkov transition matrices and metrics such as fixation duration, gaze\nelevation, and azimuth distributions, reveals meaningful behavioral shifts.\nWhile the overall gaze behavior focused on the road with occasional mirror\nchecks remains consistent, rainy conditions lead to more frequent dashboard\nglances, longer fixation durations, and higher gaze elevation, indicating\nincreased cognitive focus. These findings offer valuable insight into visual\nattention patterns under adverse conditions and highlight the potential of\nleveraging gaze modeling to aid in the design of more robust ADAS and DMS."}

To address this issue, this paper investigates a novel perspective\nby incorporating news intent into fake news detection, bridging intents and\nsemantics together. The core insight is that by considering news intents, one\ncan deeply understand the inherent thoughts behind news deception, rather than\nthe surface patterns within words alone. To achieve this goal, we propose\nGraph-based Intent-Semantic Joint Modeling (InSide) for fake news detection,\nwhich models deception clues from both semantic and intent signals via\ngraph-based joint learning.

Moreover, to accommodate various understanding tasks of\nsurgical videos without conflicts, we devise a Surgical Task Dynamic Ensemble\nto efficiently triage a query with optimal learnable parameters in our SurgLLM.\nExtensive experiments performed on diverse surgical video understanding tasks,\nincluding captioning, general VQA, and temporal VQA, demonstrate significant\nimprovements over the state-of-the-art approaches, validating the effectiveness\nof our SurgLLM in versatile surgical video understanding.

To overcome these limitations, we introduce DynaMind, a novel\nframework that reconstructs video by jointly modeling neural dynamics and\nsemantic features via three core modules: a Regional-aware Semantic Mapper\n(RSM), a Temporal-aware Dynamic Aligner (TDA), and a Dual-Guidance Video\nReconstructor (DGVR). The RSM first utilizes a regional-aware encoder to\nextract multimodal semantic features from EEG signals across distinct brain\nregions, aggregating them into a unified diffusion prior.

To this end, we introduce aleatoric\nuncertainty modeling into the 3D hand pose estimation framework, aiming to\nachieve a better trade-off between modeling joint correlations and\ncomputational efficiency. We propose a novel parameterization that leverages a\nsingle linear layer to capture intrinsic correlations among hand joints.

Second, we formalise an\nAdaptive Multi-Dimensional Monitoring (AMDM) algorithm that normalises\nheterogeneous metrics, applies per-axis exponentially weighted moving-average\nthresholds and performs joint anomaly detection via the Mahalanobis distance.\nThird, we conduct simulations and real-world experiments. AMDM cuts\nanomaly-detection latency from 12.3 s to 5.6 s on simulated goal drift and\nreduces false-positive rates from 4.5% to 0.9% compared with static thresholds.\nWe present a comparison table and ROC/PR curves, and we reanalyse case studies\nto surface missing metrics. Code, data and a reproducibility checklist\naccompany this paper to facilitate replication."}

As in legal systems, ambiguity arises both from how\nthese principles are written and how they are applied. But while legal systems\nuse institutional safeguards to manage such ambiguity, such as transparent\nappellate review policing interpretive constraints, AI alignment pipelines\noffer no comparable protections. Different interpretations of the same rule can\nlead to inconsistent or unstable model behavior. Drawing on legal theory, we\nidentify key gaps in current alignment pipelines by examining how legal systems\nconstrain ambiguity at both the rule creation and rule application steps. We\nthen propose a computational framework that mirrors two legal mechanisms: (1) a\nrule refinement pipeline that minimizes interpretive disagreement by revising\nambiguous rules (analogous to agency rulemaking or iterative legislative\naction), and (2) prompt-based interpretive constraints that reduce\ninconsistency in rule application (analogous to legal canons that guide\njudicial discretion). We evaluate our framework on a 5,000-scenario subset of\nthe WildChat dataset and show that both interventions significantly improve\njudgment consistency across a panel of reasonable interpreters.

Currently, the primary methods for point cloud processing are\nvoxel-based and pillarbased approaches. Voxel-based methods offer high accuracy\nthrough fine-grained spatial segmentation but suffer from slower inference\nspeeds. Pillar-based methods enhance inference speed but still fall short of\nvoxel-based methods in accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a novel\npoint cloud processing method, PointSlice, which slices point clouds along the\nhorizontal plane and includes a dedicated detection network. The main\ncontributions of PointSlice are: (1) A new point cloud processing technique\nthat converts 3D point clouds into multiple sets of 2D (x-y) data slices. The\nmodel only learns 2D data distributions, treating the 3D point cloud as\nseparate batches of 2D data, which reduces the number of model parameters and\nenhances inference speed; (2) The introduction of a Slice Interaction Network\n(SIN). To maintain vertical relationships across slices, we incorporate SIN\ninto the 2D backbone network, which improves the model's 3D object perception\ncapability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PointSlice achieves high\ndetection accuracy and inference speed. On the Waymo dataset, PointSlice is\n1.13x faster and has 0.79x fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art\nvoxel-based method (SAFDNet), with only a 1.2 mAPH accuracy reduction.

More importantly, ENA results reveal a\nfundamental divergence in interactional patterns: human dialogues are more\ncognitively guided and diverse, centered around a \"question-factual\nresponse-feedback\" teaching loop that clearly reflects pedagogical guidance and\nstudent-driven thinking; in contrast, simulated dialogues exhibit a pattern of\nstructural simplification and behavioral convergence, revolving around an\n\"explanation-simplistic response\" loop that is essentially a simple information\ntransfer between the teacher and student. These findings illuminate key\nlimitations in current AI-generated tutoring and provide empirical guidance for\ndesigning and evaluating more pedagogically effective generative educational\ndialogue systems."}

This work is intended for future journal submission", "summary": "Recently, the emergence of multitask deep learning models has enhanced\ncatheterization procedures by providing tactile and visual perception data\nthrough an end-to-end architec- ture. This information is derived from a\nsegmentation and force estimation head, which localizes the catheter in X-ray\nimages and estimates the applied pressure based on its deflection within the\nimage. These stereo vision architectures incorporate a CNN- based\nencoder-decoder that captures the dependencies between X-ray images from two\nviewpoints, enabling simultaneous 3D force estimation and stereo segmentation\nof the catheter. With these tasks in mind, this work approaches the problem\nfrom a new perspective. We propose a novel encoder-decoder Vision Transformer\nmodel that processes two input X-ray images as separate sequences. Given\nsequences of X-ray patches from two perspectives, the transformer captures\nlong-range dependencies without the need to gradually expand the receptive\nfield for either image. The embeddings generated by both the encoder and\ndecoder are fed into two shared segmentation heads, while a regression head\nemploys the fused information from the decoder for 3D force estimation. The\nproposed model is a stereo Vision Transformer capable of simultaneously\nsegmenting the catheter from two angles while estimating the generated forces\nat its tip in 3D. This model has undergone extensive experiments on synthetic\nX-ray images with various noise levels and has been compared against\nstate-of-the-art pure segmentation models, vision-based catheter force\nestimation methods, and a multitask catheter segmentation and force estimation\napproach. It outperforms existing models, setting a new state-of-the-art in\nboth catheter segmentation and force estimation."}

Previous work on\ndetecting AI-generated text has made effective progress, but has not involved\nmodern Chinese poetry. Due to the distinctive characteristics of modern Chinese\npoetry, it is difficult to identify whether a poem originated from humans or\nAI. The proliferation of AI-generated modern Chinese poetry has significantly\ndisrupted the poetry ecosystem. Based on the urgency of identifying\nAI-generated poetry in the real Chinese world, this paper proposes a novel\nbenchmark for detecting LLMs-generated modern Chinese poetry. We first\nconstruct a high-quality dataset, which includes both 800 poems written by six\nprofessional poets and 41,600 poems generated by four mainstream LLMs.\nSubsequently, we conduct systematic performance assessments of six detectors on\nthis dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that current detectors cannot be\nused as reliable tools to detect modern Chinese poems generated by LLMs. The\nmost difficult poetic features to detect are intrinsic qualities, especially\nstyle.

In the first stage, a transformer-based diffusion model\nconditioned exclusively on metadata, including acquisition parameters, patient\ndemographics, and diagnostic impressions, generates coarse anatomical priors\nfrom noise. The second stage further refines the images by integrating both the\ncoarse prior and metadata to produce high-fidelity results.

We show that\nLGDiST outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in gene expression completion,\nwith an average Mean Squared Error that is 18% lower across 26 datasets.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that completing ST data with LGDiST improves gene\nexpression prediction performance on six state-of-the-art methods up to 10% in\nMSE. A key innovation of LGDiST is using context genes previously considered\nuninformative to build a rich and biologically meaningful genetic latent space.\nOur experiments show that removing key components of LGDiST, such as the\ncontext genes, the ST latent space, and the neighbor conditioning, leads to\nconsiderable drops in performance. These findings underscore that the full\narchitecture of LGDiST achieves substantially better performance than any of\nits isolated components."}

Object-centric learning aims\nto mimic this process in an unsupervised manner. Recently, the slot\nattention-based framework has emerged as a leading approach in this area and\nhas been widely used in various downstream tasks. However, existing slot\nattention methods face two key limitations: (1) a lack of high-level semantic\ninformation. In current methods, image areas are assigned to slots based on\nlow-level features such as color and texture. This makes the model overly\nsensitive to low-level features and limits its understanding of object\ncontours, shapes, or other semantic characteristics. (2) The inability to\nfine-tune the encoder.

This paper addresses\nthe problem of detecting and correcting label noise in ordinal image\nclassification tasks. To this end, a novel data-centric method called ORDinal\nAdaptive Correction (ORDAC) is proposed for adaptive correction of noisy\nlabels. The proposed approach leverages the capabilities of Label Distribution\nLearning (LDL) to model the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty present in\nordinal labels.

RiverScope\ncomprises 1,145 high-resolution images (covering 2,577 square kilometers) with\nexpert-labeled river and surface water masks, requiring over 100 hours of\nmanual annotation. Each image is co-registered with Sentinel-2, SWOT, and the\nSWOT River Database (SWORD), enabling the evaluation of cost-accuracy\ntrade-offs across sensors -- a key consideration for operational water\nmonitoring. We also establish the first global, high-resolution benchmark for\nriver width estimation, achieving a median error of 7.2 meters -- significantly\noutperforming existing satellite-derived methods. We extensively evaluate deep\nnetworks across multiple architectures (e.g., CNNs and transformers),\npretraining strategies (e.g., supervised and self-supervised), and training\ndatasets (e.g., ImageNet and satellite imagery). Our best-performing models\ncombine the benefits of transfer learning with the use of all the multispectral\nPlanetScope channels via learned adaptors. RiverScope provides a valuable\nresource for fine-scale and multi-sensor hydrological modeling, supporting\nclimate adaptation and sustainable water management."}

Recent Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based facial models achieve fast,\nhigh-quality rendering but still depend solely on a mesh-based 3DMM prior for\nexpression control, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained geometry,\nexpressions, and full-head coverage. We introduce GRMM, the first full-head\nGaussian 3D morphable model that augments a base 3DMM with residual geometry\nand appearance components, additive refinements that recover high-frequency\ndetails such as wrinkles, fine skin texture, and hairline variations. GRMM\nprovides disentangled control through low-dimensional, interpretable parameters\n(e.g., identity shape, facial expressions) while separately modelling residuals\nthat capture subject- and expression-specific detail beyond the base model's\ncapacity. Coarse decoders produce vertex-level mesh deformations, fine decoders\nrepresent per-Gaussian appearance, and a lightweight CNN refines rasterised\nimages for enhanced realism, all while maintaining 75 FPS real-time rendering.\nTo learn consistent, high-fidelity residuals, we present EXPRESS-50, the first\ndataset with 60 aligned expressions across 50 identities, enabling robust\ndisentanglement of identity and expression in Gaussian-based 3DMMs. Across\nmonocular 3D face reconstruction, novel-view synthesis, and expression\ntransfer, GRMM surpasses state-of-the-art methods in fidelity and expression\naccuracy while delivering interactive real-time performance."}

This paper identifies four core problems that must be\nsolved for mobile agents to deliver practical, scalable impact: (1)\ngeneralization across tasks, modalities, apps, and devices; (2) accuracy,\nspecifically precise on-screen interaction and click targeting; (3)\nlong-horizon capability for sustained, multi-step goals; and (4) efficiency,\nspecifically high-performance runtime on resource-constrained devices. We\npresent AppCopilot, a multimodal, multi-agent, general-purpose on-device\nassistant that operates across applications and constitutes a full-stack,\nclosed-loop system from data to deployment. AppCopilot operationalizes this\nposition through an end-to-end autonomous pipeline spanning data collection,\ntraining, deployment, high-quality and efficient inference, and mobile\napplication development. At the model layer, it integrates multimodal\nfoundation models with robust Chinese-English support. At the reasoning and\ncontrol layer, it combines chain-of-thought reasoning, hierarchical task\nplanning and decomposition, and multi-agent collaboration. At the execution\nlayer, it enables user personalization and experiential adaptation, voice\ninteraction, function calling, cross-app and cross-device orchestration, and\ncomprehensive mobile app support. The system design incorporates\nprofiling-driven optimization for latency, memory, and energy across\nheterogeneous hardware. Empirically, AppCopilot achieves significant\nimprovements along all four dimensions: stronger generalization,\nhigher-precision on-screen actions, more reliable long-horizon task completion,\nand faster, more resource-efficient runtime."}

Unlike the well-established\npixel-based representation in images, 3D representations remain diverse and\nfragmented, encompassing a wide variety of approaches such as voxel grids,\nneural radiance fields, signed distance functions, point clouds, or octrees,\neach offering distinct advantages and limitations. In this work, we present a\nunified evaluation framework designed to assess the performance of 3D\nrepresentations in reconstruction and generation. We compare these\nrepresentations based on multiple criteria: quality, computational efficiency,\nand generalization performance. Beyond standard model benchmarking, our\nexperiments aim to derive best practices over all steps involved in the 3D\ngeneration pipeline, including preprocessing, mesh reconstruction, compression\nwith autoencoders, and generation. Our findings highlight that reconstruction\nerrors significantly impact overall performance, underscoring the need to\nevaluate generation and reconstruction jointly. We provide insights that can\ninform the selection of suitable 3D models for various applications,\nfacilitating the development of more robust and application-specific solutions\nin 3D generation.

While recent advances in\nnative agent models have shown promise by unifying perception, reasoning,\naction, and memory through end-to-end learning, open problems remain in data\nscalability, multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL), the limitations of\nGUI-only operation, and environment stability. In this technical report, we\npresent UI-TARS-2, a native GUI-centered agent model that addresses these\nchallenges through a systematic training methodology: a data flywheel for\nscalable data generation, a stabilized multi-turn RL framework, a hybrid GUI\nenvironment that integrates file systems and terminals, and a unified sandbox\nplatform for large-scale rollouts. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that\nUI-TARS-2 achieves significant improvements over its predecessor UI-TARS-1.5.\nOn GUI benchmarks, it reaches 88.2 on Online-Mind2Web, 47.5 on OSWorld, 50.6 on\nWindowsAgentArena, and 73.3 on AndroidWorld, outperforming strong baselines\nsuch as Claude and OpenAI agents. In game environments, it attains a mean\nnormalized score of 59.8 across a 15-game suite-roughly 60% of human-level\nperformance-and remains competitive with frontier proprietary models (e.g.,\nOpenAI o3) on LMGame-Bench. Additionally, the model can generalize to\nlong-horizon information-seeking tasks and software engineering benchmarks,\nhighlighting its robustness across diverse agent tasks. Detailed analyses of\ntraining dynamics further provide insights into achieving stability and\nefficiency in large-scale agent RL. These results underscore UI-TARS-2's\npotential to advance the state of GUI agents and exhibit strong generalization\nto real-world interactive scenarios."}
