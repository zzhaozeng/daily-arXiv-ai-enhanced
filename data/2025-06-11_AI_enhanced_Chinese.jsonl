Recent\napproaches attempt to address this challenge by leveraging the rich world\nknowledge of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), but these methods suffer from\nseveral limitations: (1) a significant domain gap between the pre-training data\nof VLMs and real-world driving data, (2) a dimensionality mismatch between the\ndiscrete language space and the continuous action space, and (3) imitation\nlearning tends to capture the average behavior present in the dataset, which\nmay be suboptimal even dangerous. In this paper, we propose ReCogDrive, an\nautonomous driving system that integrates VLMs with diffusion planner, which\nadopts a three-stage paradigm for training. In the first stage, we use a\nlarge-scale driving question-answering datasets to train the VLMs, mitigating\nthe domain discrepancy between generic content and real-world driving\nscenarios. In the second stage, we employ a diffusion-based planner to perform\nimitation learning, mapping representations from the latent language space to\ncontinuous driving actions. Finally, we fine-tune the diffusion planner using\nreinforcement learning with NAVSIM non-reactive simulator, enabling the model\nto generate safer, more human-like driving trajectories.

High-speed cameras are used to measure the\nimpact location; however, their excessive memory consumption limits prolonged\nscene capture, and manual digitization for position detection is time-consuming\nand prone to human error. These limitations make it difficult to effectively\ncapture the entire playing scene, hindering the ability to analyze the player's\nperformance. We propose a method for locating the tennis ball impact on the\nracket in real time using an event camera. Event cameras efficiently measure\nbrightness changes (called `events') with microsecond accuracy under high-speed\nmotion while using lower memory consumption. These cameras enable users to\ncontinuously monitor their performance over extended periods. Our method\nconsists of three identification steps: time range of swing, timing at impact,\nand contours of ball and racket.

Text embedding models have become foundational in modern NLP,\npowering a wide range of applications and drawing increasing research\nattention.

In contrast, linguistic theory emphasizes that meaning is often\nimplicit, shaped by pragmatics, speaker intent, and sociocultural context.\nCurrent embedding models are typically trained on data that lacks such depth\nand evaluated on benchmarks that reward the capture of surface meaning. As a\nresult, they struggle with tasks requiring interpretive reasoning, speaker\nstance, or social meaning. Our pilot study highlights this gap, showing that\neven state-of-the-art models perform only marginally better than simplistic\nbaselines on implicit semantics tasks.

However, it is difficult to construct a dense radio map as a\nlimited number of samples can be measured in practical scenarios. While\nexisting works have used deep learning to estimate dense radio maps from sparse\nsamples, they are hard to integrate with the physical characteristics of the\nradio map. To address this challenge, we cast radio map estimation as the\nsparse signal recovery problem. A physical propagation model is further\nincorporated to decompose the problem into multiple factor optimization\nsub-problems, thereby reducing recovery complexity. Inspired by the existing\ncompressive sensing methods, we propose the Radio Deep Unfolding Network\n(RadioDUN) to unfold the optimization process, achieving adaptive parameter\nadjusting and prior fitting in a learnable manner. To account for the radio\npropagation characteristics, we develop a dynamic reweighting module (DRM) to\nadaptively model the importance of each factor for the radio map. Inspired by\nthe shadowing factor in the physical propagation model, we integrate\nobstacle-related factors to express the obstacle-induced signal stochastic\ndecay. The shadowing loss is further designed to constrain the factor\nprediction and act as a supplementary supervised objective, which enhances the\nperformance of RadioDUN.

To improve the visual controllability,\nrecent works have considered fine-tuning pre-trained T2V models to support\nimage-to-video (I2V) generation. However, such adaptation frequently suppresses\nmotion dynamics of generated outputs, resulting in more static videos compared\nto their T2V counterparts. In this work, we analyze this phenomenon and\nidentify that it stems from the premature exposure to high-frequency details in\nthe input image, which biases the sampling process toward a shortcut trajectory\nthat overfits to the static appearance of the reference image. To address this,\nwe propose adaptive low-pass guidance (ALG), a simple fix to the I2V model\nsampling procedure to generate more dynamic videos without compromising\nper-frame image quality. Specifically, ALG adaptively modulates the frequency\ncontent of the conditioning image by applying low-pass filtering at the early\nstage of denoising. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ALG significantly\nimproves the temporal dynamics of generated videos, while preserving image\nfidelity and text alignment. Especially, under VBench-I2V test suite, ALG\nachieves an average improvement of 36% in dynamic degree without a significant\ndrop in video quality or image fidelity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f4e\u901a\u5f15\u5bfc\uff08ALG\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u89c6\u9891\uff08I2V\uff09\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u56e0\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\u8fc7\u65e9\u66b4\u9732\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9759\u6001\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709I2V\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\uff08T2V\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u5e38\u56e0\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\u8fc7\u65e9\u66b4\u9732\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u9759\u6001\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faALG\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u53bb\u566a\u65e9\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u4f4e\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\u5bf9\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "result": "ALG\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891\u52a8\u6001\u6027\uff08VBench-I2V\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u5ea6\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u534736%\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "conclusion": "ALG\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86I2V\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u727a\u7272\u5176\u4ed6\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Recent studies\nhave explored multi-agent systems to decompose complex translation tasks into\ncollaborative subtasks, showing initial promise in enhancing translation\nquality through agent cooperation and specialization. Nevertheless, existing\nmulti-agent translation frameworks largely neglect foundational insights from\ncognitive translation studies. These insights emphasize how human translators\nemploy different cognitive strategies, such as balancing literal and free\ntranslation, refining expressions based on context, and iteratively evaluating\noutputs. To address this limitation, we propose a cognitively informed\nmulti-agent framework called TACTIC, which stands for T ranslation A gents with\nCognitive- T heoretic Interactive Collaboration. The framework comprises six\nfunctionally distinct agents that mirror key cognitive processes observed in\nhuman translation behavior.

While Chain-of-Thought prompting enhances performance via explicit\nintermediate steps, it suffers from sufficient token overhead and a fixed\nreasoning trajectory, preventing step-wise refinement. Recent advances in\nlatent reasoning address these limitations by refining internal reasoning\nprocesses directly in the model's latent space, without producing explicit\noutputs. However, a key challenge remains: how to effectively update reasoning\nembeddings during post-training to guide the model toward more accurate\nsolutions. To overcome this challenge, we propose a lightweight post-training\nframework that refines latent reasoning trajectories using two novel\nstrategies: 1) Contrastive reasoning feedback, which compares reasoning\nembeddings against strong and weak baselines to infer effective update\ndirections via embedding enhancement; 2) Residual embedding refinement, which\nstabilizes updates by progressively integrating current and historical\ngradients, enabling fast yet controlled convergence.

This extreme wildfire season is symptomatic of a\nclimate-change-induced increase in the length and severity of the fire season\nthat affects the boreal ecosystem. Therefore, it is critical to empower\nwildfire management in boreal communities with better mitigation solutions.\nWildfire probability maps represent an important tool for understanding the\nlikelihood of wildfire occurrence and the potential severity of future\nwildfires. The massive increase in the availability of Earth observation data\nhas enabled the development of deep learning-based wildfire forecasting models,\naiming at providing precise wildfire probability maps at different spatial and\ntemporal scales. A main limitation of such methods is their reliance on\ncoarse-resolution environmental drivers and satellite products, leading to\nwildfire occurrence prediction of reduced resolution, typically around $\\sim\n0.1${\\deg}. This paper presents a benchmark dataset: CanadaFireSat, and\nbaseline methods for high-resolution: 100 m wildfire forecasting across Canada,\nleveraging multi-modal data from high-resolution multi-spectral satellite\nimages (Sentinel-2 L1C), mid-resolution satellite products (MODIS), and\nenvironmental factors (ERA5 reanalysis data).

Existing approaches struggle as they\nrely on static augmentations that fail under object deformations, occlusions,\nand camera movement, leading to inconsistent feature learning over time. We\npropose a motion-guided self-supervised learning framework that clusters dense\npoint tracks to learn spatiotemporally consistent representations. By\nleveraging an off-the-shelf point tracker, we extract long-range motion\ntrajectories and optimize feature clustering through a momentum-encoder-based\noptimal transport mechanism. To ensure temporal coherence, we propagate cluster\nassignments along tracked points, enforcing feature consistency across views\ndespite viewpoint changes. Integrating motion as an implicit supervisory\nsignal, our method learns representations that generalize across frames,\nimproving robustness in dynamic scenes and challenging occlusion scenarios. By\ninitializing from strong image-pretrained models and leveraging video data for\ntraining, we improve state-of-the-art by 1% to 6% on six image and video\ndatasets and four evaluation benchmarks.

AAAs may rupture, with a survival rate of only 20\\%. Current\nclinical guidelines recommend elective surgical repair when the maximum AAA\ndiameter exceeds 55 mm in men or 50 mm in women. Patients that do not meet\nthese criteria are periodically monitored, with surveillance intervals based on\nthe maximum AAA diameter. However, this diameter does not take into account the\ncomplex relation between the 3D AAA shape and its growth, making standardized\nintervals potentially unfit. Personalized AAA growth predictions could improve\nmonitoring strategies. We propose to use an SE(3)-symmetric transformer model\nto predict AAA growth directly on the vascular model surface enriched with\nlocal, multi-physical features. In contrast to other works which have\nparameterized the AAA shape, this representation preserves the vascular\nsurface's anatomical structure and geometric fidelity. We train our model using\na longitudinal dataset of 113 computed tomography angiography (CTA) scans of 24\nAAA patients at irregularly sampled intervals. After training, our model\npredicts AAA growth to the next scan moment with a median diameter error of\n1.18 mm. We further demonstrate our model's utility to identify whether a\npatient will become eligible for elective repair within two years (acc = 0.93).\nFinally, we evaluate our model's generalization on an external validation set\nconsisting of 25 CTAs from 7 AAA patients from a different hospital.

Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSS) offers a\npromising alternative to mitigate this data dependency. However, existing SSS\nmethods often struggle with the inherent distribution mismatch between limited\nlabeled data and abundant unlabeled data, leading to suboptimal generalization.\nWe propose that Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), pre-trained on vast and\ndiverse datasets, possess robust generalization capabilities that can\neffectively bridge this distribution gap and provide strong semantic priors for\nSSS. Inspired by this, we introduce RS-MTDF (Multi-Teacher Distillation and\nFusion), a novel framework that leverages the powerful semantic knowledge\nembedded in VFMs to guide semi-supervised learning in remote sensing.\nSpecifically, RS-MTDF employs multiple frozen VFMs (\\textit{e.g.}, DINOv2 and\nCLIP) as expert teachers, utilizing feature-level distillation to align student\nfeatures with their robust representations. To further enhance discriminative\npower, the distilled knowledge is seamlessly fused into the student decoder.\nExtensive experiments on three challenging remote sensing datasets (ISPRS\nPotsdam, LoveDA, and DeepGlobe) demonstrate that RS-MTDF consistently achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance.

While NL-to-SQL promises ease of use, it poses\nsignificant risks: end-users cannot easily validate generated SQL queries, and\nlegacy nuclear plant databases -- often complex and poorly structured --\ncomplicate query generation due to decades of incremental modifications. These\nchallenges increase the likelihood of inaccuracies and reduce trust in the\napproach. In this work, we propose an alternative paradigm: leveraging\nfunction-calling large language models (LLMs) to address these challenges.\nInstead of directly generating SQL queries, we define a set of pre-approved,\npurpose-specific functions representing common use cases. Queries are processed\nby invoking these functions, which encapsulate validated SQL logic. This hybrid\napproach mitigates the risks associated with direct NL-to-SQL translations by\nensuring that SQL queries are reviewed and optimized by experts before\ndeployment.

At the scene level, existing SSL methods often\nincorporate volume rendering into the pre-training framework, using RGB-D\nimages as reconstruction signals to facilitate cross-modal learning. This\nstrategy promotes alignment between 2D and 3D modalities and enables the model\nto benefit from rich visual cues in the RGB-D inputs. However, these approaches\nare limited by their reliance on implicit scene representations and high memory\ndemands. Furthermore, since their reconstruction objectives are applied only in\n2D space, they often fail to capture underlying 3D geometric structures. To\naddress these challenges, we propose Gaussian2Scene, a novel scene-level SSL\nframework that leverages the efficiency and explicit nature of 3D Gaussian\nSplatting (3DGS) for pre-training. The use of 3DGS not only alleviates the\ncomputational burden associated with volume rendering but also supports direct\n3D scene reconstruction, thereby enhancing the geometric understanding of the\nbackbone network. Our approach follows a progressive two-stage training\nstrategy. In the first stage, a dual-branch masked autoencoder learns both 2D\nand 3D scene representations. In the second stage, we initialize training with\nreconstructed point clouds and further supervise learning using the geometric\nlocations of Gaussian primitives and rendered RGB images.

A two-step procedure is\nproposed: first, segmenting the document identifying the most relevant\nsegments, and then extracting the entities. For text segmentation, two\nmethodologies are compared: a classic method based on regular expressions and a\nsecond approach that divides the document into blocks of n-tokens, which are\nthen vectorized using multilingual models for semantic searches\n(text-embedding-ada-002/MiniLM-L12-v2 ). Subsequently, large language models\n(LLaMA-2 7b, 70b, LLaMA-3 8b, and GPT-4 Turbo) are applied with prompting to\nthe selected segments for entity extraction.

We expose a critical geometric blind spot in alignment: adversarial\nprompts exploit latent camouflage, embedding perilously close to the safe\nrepresentation manifold while encoding unsafe intent thereby evading surface\nlevel defenses like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which remain blind to\nthe latent geometry. We introduce ALKALI, the first rigorously curated\nadversarial benchmark and the most comprehensive to date spanning 9,000 prompts\nacross three macro categories, six subtypes, and fifteen attack families.\nEvaluation of 21 leading LLMs reveals alarmingly high Attack Success Rates\n(ASRs) across both open and closed source models, exposing an underlying\nvulnerability we term latent camouflage, a structural blind spot where\nadversarial completions mimic the latent geometry of safe ones.

GRACE enforces two constraints: latent\nseparation between safe and adversarial completions, and adversarial cohesion\namong unsafe and jailbreak behaviors.

Although a straight-line\nconnection between the noisy and natural data distributions is intuitive, fast,\nand easy to optimize, it still inevitably leads to: 1) Diversity concerns,\nwhich arise since straight-line paths only cover a fairly restricted sampling\nspace. 2) Multi-scale noise modeling concerns, since the straight line flow\nonly needs to optimize the constant velocity field $\\bm v$ between the two\ndistributions $\\bm\\pi_0$ and $\\bm\\pi_1$. In this work, we present\nDiscretized-RF, a new family of rectified flow (also called momentum flow\nmodels since they refer to the previous velocity component and the random\nvelocity component in each diffusion step), which discretizes the straight path\ninto a series of variable velocity field sub-paths (namely ``momentum fields'')\nto expand the search space, especially when close to the distribution\n$p_\\text{noise}$. Different from the previous case where noise is directly\nsuperimposed on $\\bm x$, we introduce noise on the velocity $\\bm v$ of the\nsub-path to change its direction in order to improve the diversity and\nmulti-scale noise modeling abilities. Experimental results on several\nrepresentative datasets demonstrate that learning momentum flow matching by\nsampling random velocity fields will produce trajectories that are both diverse\nand efficient, and can consistently generate high-quality and diverse results.\nCode is available at https://github.com/liuruixun/momentum-fm.", "AI": {"tldr": "Discretized-RF\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u76f4\u7ebf\u8def\u5f84\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u53d8\u901f\u5ea6\u5b50\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u4e8e\u901f\u5ea6\u800c\u975e\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u566a\u58f0\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u76f4\u7ebf\u8def\u5f84RF\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u566a\u58f0\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDiscretized-RF\uff0c\u5c06\u76f4\u7ebf\u8def\u5f84\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u4e3a\u52a8\u91cf\u573a\u5b50\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5f15\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u4ee5\u6539\u53d8\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u6301\u7eed\u4ea7\u751f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "Discretized-RF\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86RF\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Specifically, we\ntrain a 1.5B parameter mathematical reasoning model on RTX 3080 Ti of 16GB\nmemory that achieves comparable or better performance on mathematical reasoning\nbenchmarks than models several times larger, in resource-constrained\nenvironments.

To this end, we\nintroduce StreamSplat, the first fully feed-forward framework that transforms\nuncalibrated video streams of arbitrary length into dynamic 3D Gaussian\nSplatting (3DGS) representations in an online manner, capable of recovering\nscene dynamics from temporally local observations. We propose two key technical\ninnovations: a probabilistic sampling mechanism in the static encoder for 3DGS\nposition prediction, and a bidirectional deformation field in the dynamic\ndecoder that enables robust and efficient dynamic modeling. Extensive\nexperiments on static and dynamic benchmarks demonstrate that StreamSplat\nconsistently outperforms prior works in both reconstruction quality and dynamic\nscene modeling, while uniquely supporting online reconstruction of arbitrarily\nlong video streams.

However, prior work\nhas predominantly focused on atomic tasks -- such as shot-chain execution tasks\nand single-screen grounding tasks -- while overlooking the generalization to\ncompositional tasks, which are indispensable for real-world applications. This\nwork introduces UI-NEXUS, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate mobile\nagents on three categories of compositional operations: Simple Concatenation,\nContext Transition, and Deep Dive. UI-NEXUS supports interactive evaluation in\n20 fully controllable local utility app environments, as well as 30 online\nChinese and English service apps.

However, the underlying computational\nredundancy involved in these steps has yet to be thoroughly investigated. In\nthis paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the VAR inference process and\nidentify two primary sources of inefficiency: step redundancy and unconditional\nbranch redundancy. To address step redundancy, we propose an automatic\nstep-skipping strategy that selectively omits unnecessary generation steps to\nimprove efficiency. For unconditional branch redundancy, we observe that the\ninformation gap between the conditional and unconditional branches is minimal.\nLeveraging this insight, we introduce unconditional branch replacement, a\ntechnique that bypasses the unconditional branch to reduce computational cost.\nNotably, we observe that the effectiveness of acceleration strategies varies\nsignificantly across different samples. Motivated by this, we propose SkipVAR,\na sample-adaptive framework that leverages frequency information to dynamically\nselect the most suitable acceleration strategy for each instance. To evaluate\nthe role of high-frequency information, we introduce high-variation benchmark\ndatasets that test model sensitivity to fine details.

Inspired by the ability of Vision Foundation Models\n(e.g., SAM-2) to provide rich prior knowledge, we propose SSS (Semi-Supervised\nSAM-2), a novel approach that leverages SAM-2's robust feature extraction\ncapabilities to uncover latent knowledge in unlabeled medical images, thus\neffectively enhancing feature support for fully supervised medical image\nsegmentation. Specifically, building upon the single-stream \"weak-to-strong\"\nconsistency regularization framework, this paper introduces a Discriminative\nFeature Enhancement (DFE) mechanism to further explore the feature\ndiscrepancies introduced by various data augmentation strategies across\nmultiple views. By leveraging feature similarity and dissimilarity across\nmulti-scale augmentation techniques, the method reconstructs and models the\nfeatures, thereby effectively optimizing the salient regions. Furthermore, a\nprompt generator is developed that integrates Physical Constraints with a\nSliding Window (PCSW) mechanism to generate input prompts for unlabeled data,\nfulfilling SAM-2's requirement for additional prompts.

However, existing preference optimization approaches for LMMs\ndo not focus on restraining the internal biases of their Large Language Model\n(LLM) backbones when curating the training data.

In this paper, we propose a novel preference learning framework,\nModality-Balancing Preference Optimization (MBPO), to address the modality\nimbalance in LMMs. MBPO constructs a more effective offline preference dataset\nby generating hard negatives, i.e., rejected responses misled by LLM biases due\nto limited usage of visual information, through adversarial perturbation of\ninput images. Moreover, MBPO leverages the easy-to-verify nature of close-ended\ntasks to generate online responses with verified rewards. GRPO is then employed\nto train the model with offline-online hybrid data.

It then updates the evader model parameters using feedback from victim\ndetectors, achieving high attack success with minimal text modification. To\naddress the issue of tokenizer mismatch between the evader and the detector, we\nintroduce a warm-started evader method, enabling GradEscape to adapt to\ndetectors across any language model architecture. Moreover, we employ novel\ntokenizer inference and model extraction techniques, facilitating effective\nevasion even in query-only access.\n  We evaluate GradEscape on four datasets and three widely-used language\nmodels, benchmarking it against four state-of-the-art AIGT evaders.\nExperimental results demonstrate that GradEscape outperforms existing evaders\nin various scenarios, including with an 11B paraphrase model, while utilizing\nonly 139M parameters.

However, aligning them to avoid\ngenerating content with unacceptable concepts (e.g., offensive or copyrighted\ncontent, or celebrity likenesses) remains a significant challenge. Concept\nreplacement techniques (CRTs) aim to address this challenge, often by trying to\n\"erase\" unacceptable concepts from models. Recently, model providers have\nstarted offering image editing services which accept an image and a text prompt\nas input, to produce an image altered as specified by the prompt. These are\nknown as image-to-image (I2I) models. In this paper, we first use an I2I model\nto empirically demonstrate that today's state-of-the-art CRTs do not in fact\nerase unacceptable concepts. Existing CRTs are thus likely to be ineffective in\nemerging I2I scenarios, despite their proven ability to remove unwanted\nconcepts in T2I pipelines, highlighting the need to understand this discrepancy\nbetween T2I and I2I settings.

High definition (HD) maps offer a promising solution, but\ntheir high maintenance cost poses a significant barrier to scalable deployment.\nThis challenge is addressed by online HD map construction methods, which\ngenerate local HD maps from live sensor data. However, these methods are\ninherently limited by the short perception range of onboard sensors. To\novercome this limitation and improve general performance, recent approaches\nhave explored the use of standard definition (SD) maps as prior, which are\nsignificantly easier to maintain. We propose SDTagNet, the first online HD map\nconstruction method that fully utilizes the information of widely available SD\nmaps, like OpenStreetMap, to enhance far range detection accuracy. Our approach\nintroduces two key innovations. First, in contrast to previous work, we\nincorporate not only polyline SD map data with manually selected classes, but\nadditional semantic information in the form of textual annotations. In this\nway, we enrich SD vector map tokens with NLP-derived features, eliminating the\ndependency on predefined specifications or exhaustive class taxonomies. Second,\nwe introduce a point-level SD map encoder together with orthogonal element\nidentifiers to uniformly integrate all types of map elements.

Effective OOD detection after deployment could benefit\nfrom access to the training data, enabling direct comparison between test\nsamples and the training data distribution to identify differences.\nState-of-the-art OOD detection methods, however, either discard training data\nafter deployment or assume that test samples and training data are centrally\nstored together, an assumption that rarely holds in real-world settings.

We evaluate DIsoN on\nfour medical imaging datasets (dermatology, chest X-ray, breast ultrasound,\nhistopathology) across 12 OOD detection tasks. DIsoN performs favorably against\nexisting methods while respecting data-privacy.

This results in three key limitations: (1) an\ninability to utilize images without accompanying captions, (2) the risk that\ncaptions omit critical visual details, and (3) the challenge that certain\nvision-centric content cannot be adequately conveyed through text. As a result,\ncurrent LVLMs often prioritize vision-to-language alignment while potentially\noverlooking fine-grained visual information. While some prior works have\nexplored autoregressive image generation, effectively leveraging autoregressive\nvisual supervision to enhance image understanding remains an open challenge. In\nthis paper, we introduce Autoregressive Semantic Visual Reconstruction (ASVR),\nwhich enables joint learning of visual and textual modalities within a unified\nautoregressive framework. We show that autoregressively reconstructing the raw\nvisual appearance of images does not enhance and may even impair multimodal\nunderstanding. In contrast, autoregressively reconstructing the semantic\nrepresentation of images consistently improves comprehension. Notably, we find\nthat even when models are given continuous image features as input, they can\neffectively reconstruct discrete semantic tokens, resulting in stable and\nconsistent improvements across a wide range of multimodal understanding\nbenchmarks. Our approach delivers significant performance gains across varying\ndata scales (556k-2M) and types of LLM bacbones.

Rodents are the most widely\nstudied animal subjects for such research because of their economic advantage\nand hardiness. Recently, video based eye trackers that use image processing\ntechniques have become a popular option for gaze tracking because they are easy\nto use and are completely noninvasive. Although significant progress has been\nmade in improving the accuracy and robustness of eye tracking algorithms,\nunfortunately, almost all of the techniques have focused on human eyes, which\ndoes not account for the unique characteristics of the rodent eye images, e.g.,\nvariability in eye parameters, abundance of surrounding hair, and their small\nsize. To overcome these unique challenges, this work presents a flexible,\nrobust, and highly accurate model for pupil and corneal reflection\nidentification in rodent gaze determination that can be incrementally trained\nto account for variability in eye parameters encountered in the field.

Surprisingly, we find that most existing reasoning\nmodels do not extrapolate well. We show that one way to enable extrapolation is\nby training the LLM to perform in-context exploration: training the LLM to\neffectively spend its test time budget by chaining operations (such as\ngeneration, verification, refinement, etc.), or testing multiple hypotheses\nbefore it commits to an answer.

Its ability to safeguard privacy,\nat the heart of FL, has recently been a hot-button debate topic. To elaborate,\nseveral studies have introduced a type of attacks known as gradient leakage\nattacks (GLAs), which exploit the gradients shared during training to\nreconstruct clients' raw data. On the flip side, some literature, however,\ncontends no substantial privacy risk in practical FL environments due to the\neffectiveness of such GLAs being limited to overly relaxed conditions, such as\nsmall batch sizes and knowledge of clients' data distributions.\n  This paper bridges this critical gap by empirically demonstrating that\nclients' data can still be effectively reconstructed, even within realistic FL\nenvironments. Upon revisiting GLAs, we recognize that their performance\nfailures stem from their inability to handle the gradient matching problem. To\nalleviate the performance bottlenecks identified above, we develop FedLeak,\nwhich introduces two novel techniques, partial gradient matching and gradient\nregularization. Moreover, to evaluate the performance of FedLeak in real-world\nFL environments, we formulate a practical evaluation protocol grounded in a\nthorough review of extensive FL literature and industry practices.

While\nrecent progress in smoothing the loss landscape has improved generalization,\nexisting methods often falter under long-tailed class distributions and\nconflicting optimization objectives. We introduce FedTAIL, a federated domain\ngeneralization framework that explicitly addresses these challenges through\nsharpness-guided, gradient-aligned optimization. Our method incorporates a\ngradient coherence regularizer to mitigate conflicts between classification and\nadversarial objectives, leading to more stable convergence. To combat class\nimbalance, we perform class-wise sharpness minimization and propose a\ncurvature-aware dynamic weighting scheme that adaptively emphasizes\nunderrepresented tail classes. Furthermore, we enhance conditional distribution\nalignment by integrating sharpness-aware perturbations into entropy\nregularization, improving robustness under domain shift. FedTAIL unifies\noptimization harmonization, class-aware regularization, and conditional\nalignment into a scalable, federated-compatible framework. Extensive\nevaluations across standard domain generalization benchmarks demonstrate that\nFedTAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in the presence of\ndomain shifts and label imbalance, validating its effectiveness in both\ncentralized and federated settings.

It is closely related to the sliced Wasserstein distance and\nprovably guaranties the linear separability of image classes that emerge from\ntranslations or scalings. In many real-world applications, like the recognition\nof watermarks in filigranology, however, the data is subject to general affine\ntransformations originating from the measurement process. To overcome this\nissue, we recently introduced the so-called max-normalized R-CDT that only\nrequires elementary operations and guaranties the separability under arbitrary\naffine transformations. The aim of this paper is to continue our study of the\nmax-normalized R-CDT especially with respect to its robustness against\nnon-affine image deformations. Our sensitivity analysis shows that its\nseparability properties are stable provided the Wasserstein-infinity distance\nbetween the samples can be controlled. Since the Wasserstein-infinity distance\nonly allows small local image deformations, we moreover introduce a\nmean-normalized version of the R-CDT. In this case, robustness relates to the\nWasserstein-2 distance and also covers image deformations caused by impulsive\nnoise for instance.
