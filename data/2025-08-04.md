### [1] [A Quality-Guided Mixture of Score-Fusion Experts Framework for Human Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00053)
*Jie Zhu,Yiyang Su,Minchul Kim,Anil Jain,Xiaoming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为QME的新框架，通过可学习的分数融合策略提升全身生物特征识别性能，解决了传统方法中分数分布差异的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统全身生物特征识别方法通过分数融合（如加权平均）处理多模态数据，但忽略了各模态分数分布的差异，限制了性能提升。

Method: QME框架结合了Mixture of Experts（MoE）和伪质量损失函数，通过模态特定的质量估计器（QE）和分数三元组损失优化性能。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了QME的有效性，实现了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: QME在多模态和多模型场景下表现优异，解决了相似性分数域中的模型不对齐和数据质量变化等关键挑战。

Abstract: Whole-body biometric recognition is a challenging multimodal task that
integrates various biometric modalities, including face, gait, and body. This
integration is essential for overcoming the limitations of unimodal systems.
Traditionally, whole-body recognition involves deploying different models to
process multiple modalities, achieving the final outcome by score-fusion (e.g.,
weighted averaging of similarity matrices from each model). However, these
conventional methods may overlook the variations in score distributions of
individual modalities, making it challenging to improve final performance. In
this work, we present \textbf{Q}uality-guided \textbf{M}ixture of score-fusion
\textbf{E}xperts (QME), a novel framework designed for improving whole-body
biometric recognition performance through a learnable score-fusion strategy
using a Mixture of Experts (MoE). We introduce a novel pseudo-quality loss for
quality estimation with a modality-specific Quality Estimator (QE), and a score
triplet loss to improve the metric performance. Extensive experiments on
multiple whole-body biometric datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed approach, achieving state-of-the-art results across various metrics
compared to baseline methods. Our method is effective for multimodal and
multi-model, addressing key challenges such as model misalignment in the
similarity score domain and variability in data quality.

### [2] [Punching Bag vs. Punching Person: Motion Transferability in Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00085)
*Raiyaan Abdullah,Jared Claypoole,Michael Cogswell,Ajay Divakaran,Yogesh Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了动作识别模型在跨多样上下文中的高级动作概念迁移能力，发现模型在新上下文中识别高级动作时性能显著下降，并提出了改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动作识别模型是否能有效迁移高级动作概念到不同上下文，即使是在相似分布内，例如识别未见过的动作变体。

Method: 引入了一个运动可迁移性框架，使用三个数据集（Syn-TA、Kinetics400-TA、Something-Something-v2-TA）评估13个先进模型。

Result: 模型在新上下文中识别高级动作时性能显著下降，发现多模态模型在细粒度未知动作上表现更差，Syn-TA与真实数据集同样具有挑战性。

Conclusion: 研究为评估动作识别中的运动可迁移性提供了重要基准，并探讨了通过解耦粗粒度和细粒度动作改进识别的方法。

Abstract: Action recognition models demonstrate strong generalization, but can they
effectively transfer high-level motion concepts across diverse contexts, even
within similar distributions? For example, can a model recognize the broad
action "punching" when presented with an unseen variation such as "punching
person"? To explore this, we introduce a motion transferability framework with
three datasets: (1) Syn-TA, a synthetic dataset with 3D object motions; (2)
Kinetics400-TA; and (3) Something-Something-v2-TA, both adapted from natural
video datasets. We evaluate 13 state-of-the-art models on these benchmarks and
observe a significant drop in performance when recognizing high-level actions
in novel contexts. Our analysis reveals: 1) Multimodal models struggle more
with fine-grained unknown actions than with coarse ones; 2) The bias-free
Syn-TA proves as challenging as real-world datasets, with models showing
greater performance drops in controlled settings; 3) Larger models improve
transferability when spatial cues dominate but struggle with intensive temporal
reasoning, while reliance on object and background cues hinders generalization.
We further explore how disentangling coarse and fine motions can improve
recognition in temporally challenging datasets. We believe this study
establishes a crucial benchmark for assessing motion transferability in action
recognition. Datasets and relevant code:

### [3] [The Monado SLAM Dataset for Egocentric Visual-Inertial Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00088)
*Mateo de Mayo,Daniel Cremers,Taihú Pire*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了Monado SLAM数据集，用于解决头戴式传感器在复杂场景下的跟踪问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉惯性里程计（VIO）和SLAM系统在头戴式应用中难以应对高动态运动、遮挡等复杂场景。

Method: 通过收集多款虚拟现实头戴设备的真实序列数据，构建Monado SLAM数据集。

Result: 数据集以CC BY 4.0许可发布，旨在推动VIO/SLAM研究。

Conclusion: Monado SLAM数据集填补了现有数据集的不足，为头戴式传感器跟踪研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Humanoid robots and mixed reality headsets benefit from the use of
head-mounted sensors for tracking. While advancements in visual-inertial
odometry (VIO) and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) have produced
new and high-quality state-of-the-art tracking systems, we show that these are
still unable to gracefully handle many of the challenging settings presented in
the head-mounted use cases. Common scenarios like high-intensity motions,
dynamic occlusions, long tracking sessions, low-textured areas, adverse
lighting conditions, saturation of sensors, to name a few, continue to be
covered poorly by existing datasets in the literature. In this way, systems may
inadvertently overlook these essential real-world issues. To address this, we
present the Monado SLAM dataset, a set of real sequences taken from multiple
virtual reality headsets. We release the dataset under a permissive CC BY 4.0
license, to drive advancements in VIO/SLAM research and development.

### [4] [Exploring the Feasibility of Deep Learning Techniques for Accurate Gender Classification from Eye Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00135)
*Basna Mohammed Salih Hasan,Ramadhan J. Mstafa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于卷积神经网络（CNN）的模型，利用眼周区域的颜色图像进行性别分类，取得了高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 性别分类在安全、人机交互等领域至关重要，但化妆和伪装等因素会影响分类准确性。研究专注于眼周区域以解决这一问题。

Method: 使用CNN模型分析眼周区域的颜色图像，提取关键特征进行性别分类，并在CVBL和（Female and Male）数据集上测试。

Result: 模型在CVBL数据集上达到99%的准确率，在（Female and Male）数据集上达到96%的准确率，且参数量较少。

Conclusion: 该模型在性别分类中表现出色，具有在安全和监控等领域实际应用的潜力。

Abstract: Gender classification has emerged as a crucial aspect in various fields,
including security, human-machine interaction, surveillance, and advertising.
Nonetheless, the accuracy of this classification can be influenced by factors
such as cosmetics and disguise. Consequently, our study is dedicated to
addressing this concern by concentrating on gender classification using color
images of the periocular region. The periocular region refers to the area
surrounding the eye, including the eyelids, eyebrows, and the region between
them. It contains valuable visual cues that can be used to extract key features
for gender classification. This paper introduces a sophisticated Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) model that utilizes color image databases to evaluate the
effectiveness of the periocular region for gender classification. To validate
the model's performance, we conducted tests on two eye datasets, namely CVBL
and (Female and Male). The recommended architecture achieved an outstanding
accuracy of 99% on the previously unused CVBL dataset while attaining a
commendable accuracy of 96% with a small number of learnable parameters
(7,235,089) on the (Female and Male) dataset. To ascertain the effectiveness of
our proposed model for gender classification using the periocular region, we
evaluated its performance through an extensive range of metrics and compared it
with other state-of-the-art approaches. The results unequivocally demonstrate
the efficacy of our model, thereby suggesting its potential for practical
application in domains such as security and surveillance.

### [5] [World Consistency Score: A Unified Metric for Video Generation Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00144)
*Akshat Rakheja,Aarsh Ashdhir,Aryan Bhattacharjee,Vanshika Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: World Consistency Score (WCS) 是一种新的生成视频模型评估指标，强调视频的内部世界一致性，结合了四个可解释的子组件，并通过学习权重公式生成一致性分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频评估指标主要关注视觉保真度或提示对齐，而忽略了视频的时空和物理一致性，WCS 填补了这一空白。

Method: WCS 整合了四个子指标（物体持久性、关系稳定性、因果合规性和闪烁惩罚），使用开源工具计算，并通过人类偏好数据训练权重。

Result: WCS 在多个基准测试中验证了与人类评价的相关性，并与其他指标（如 FVD、CLIPScore）进行了比较。

Conclusion: WCS 提供了一个全面且可解释的框架，用于评估视频生成模型在保持世界一致性方面的能力。

Abstract: We introduce World Consistency Score (WCS), a novel unified evaluation metric
for generative video models that emphasizes internal world consistency of the
generated videos. WCS integrates four interpretable sub-components - object
permanence, relation stability, causal compliance, and flicker penalty - each
measuring a distinct aspect of temporal and physical coherence in a video.
These submetrics are combined via a learned weighted formula to produce a
single consistency score that aligns with human judgments. We detail the
motivation for WCS in the context of existing video evaluation metrics,
formalize each submetric and how it is computed with open-source tools
(trackers, action recognizers, CLIP embeddings, optical flow), and describe how
the weights of the WCS combination are trained using human preference data. We
also outline an experimental validation blueprint: using benchmarks like
VBench-2.0, EvalCrafter, and LOVE to test WCS's correlation with human
evaluations, performing sensitivity analyses, and comparing WCS against
established metrics (FVD, CLIPScore, VBench, FVMD). The proposed WCS offers a
comprehensive and interpretable framework for evaluating video generation
models on their ability to maintain a coherent "world" over time, addressing
gaps left by prior metrics focused only on visual fidelity or prompt alignment.

### [6] [GeoExplorer: Active Geo-localization with Curiosity-Driven Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00152)
*Li Mi,Manon Bechaz,Zeming Chen,Antoine Bosselut,Devis Tuia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoExplorer提出了一种基于好奇心驱动的探索方法，用于提升主动地理定位（AGL）任务的鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于距离奖励的强化学习方法在距离估计困难或面对未见目标和环境时表现不佳，缺乏鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: 通过引入好奇心驱动的内在奖励，GeoExplorer实现了目标无关的多样化探索，提升了环境建模的有效性。

Result: 在四个AGL基准测试中，GeoExplorer表现出色，尤其在定位未见目标和环境时效果显著。

Conclusion: GeoExplorer通过好奇心驱动的方法显著提升了AGL任务的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Active Geo-localization (AGL) is the task of localizing a goal, represented
in various modalities (e.g., aerial images, ground-level images, or text),
within a predefined search area. Current methods approach AGL as a
goal-reaching reinforcement learning (RL) problem with a distance-based reward.
They localize the goal by implicitly learning to minimize the relative distance
from it. However, when distance estimation becomes challenging or when
encountering unseen targets and environments, the agent exhibits reduced
robustness and generalization ability due to the less reliable exploration
strategy learned during training. In this paper, we propose GeoExplorer, an AGL
agent that incorporates curiosity-driven exploration through intrinsic rewards.
Unlike distance-based rewards, our curiosity-driven reward is goal-agnostic,
enabling robust, diverse, and contextually relevant exploration based on
effective environment modeling. These capabilities have been proven through
extensive experiments across four AGL benchmarks, demonstrating the
effectiveness and generalization ability of GeoExplorer in diverse settings,
particularly in localizing unfamiliar targets and environments.

### [7] [Robust 3D Object Detection using Probabilistic Point Clouds from Single-Photon LiDARs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00169)
*Bhavya Goyal,Felipe Gutierrez-Barragan,Wei Lin,Andreas Velten,Yin Li,Mohit Gupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为概率点云（PPC）的新3D场景表示方法，通过为每个点添加概率属性来封装原始数据的不确定性，从而提升3D物体检测的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代LiDAR在远距离或低反射率物体等场景中会产生稀疏或错误的点云，这些误差会传播到下游感知模型中，导致精度下降。传统3D处理流程未保留原始测量中的不确定性信息。

Method: 提出PPC表示方法，为每个点添加概率属性，并引入基于PPC的推理方法，可作为轻量级模块集成到3D推理流程中。

Result: 通过仿真和实际捕获数据验证，PPC方法在室内外场景中优于LiDAR和相机-LiDAR融合模型，尤其在处理小、远、低反射率物体及强环境光时表现更优。

Conclusion: PPC通过保留不确定性信息，显著提升了3D物体检测的鲁棒性和准确性，适用于多种挑战性场景。

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D sensors provide point clouds, a canonical 3D representation
used in various scene understanding tasks. Modern LiDARs face key challenges in
several real-world scenarios, such as long-distance or low-albedo objects,
producing sparse or erroneous point clouds. These errors, which are rooted in
the noisy raw LiDAR measurements, get propagated to downstream perception
models, resulting in potentially severe loss of accuracy. This is because
conventional 3D processing pipelines do not retain any uncertainty information
from the raw measurements when constructing point clouds.
  We propose Probabilistic Point Clouds (PPC), a novel 3D scene representation
where each point is augmented with a probability attribute that encapsulates
the measurement uncertainty (or confidence) in the raw data. We further
introduce inference approaches that leverage PPC for robust 3D object
detection; these methods are versatile and can be used as computationally
lightweight drop-in modules in 3D inference pipelines. We demonstrate, via both
simulations and real captures, that PPC-based 3D inference methods outperform
several baselines using LiDAR as well as camera-LiDAR fusion models, across
challenging indoor and outdoor scenarios involving small, distant, and
low-albedo objects, as well as strong ambient light.

### [8] [On the Risk of Misleading Reports: Diagnosing Textual Biases in Multimodal Clinical AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00171)
*David Restrepo,Ira Ktena,Maria Vakalopoulou,Stergios Christodoulidis,Enzo Ferrante*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为选择性模态转移（SMS）的方法，用于量化视觉语言模型（VLMs）在二元分类任务中对不同模态的依赖程度，揭示了模型对文本输入的显著偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策依赖于医学图像和相关临床报告的综合分析，但现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）往往偏向于单一模态（尤其是文本），忽略了关键的视觉信息。

Method: 通过选择性模态转移（SMS）方法，系统地交换样本中的图像或文本，以暴露模态特定的偏差，并在两个医学影像数据集（MIMIC-CXR和FairVLMed）上评估了六种开源VLMs。

Result: 研究发现，模型在未扰动和扰动设置下均表现出对文本输入的显著依赖，视觉信息常被文本细节掩盖。

Conclusion: 研究强调了设计和评估真正整合视觉和文本线索的多模态医学模型的重要性，而非依赖单一模态信号。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making relies on the integrated analysis of medical images
and the associated clinical reports. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can
offer a unified framework for such tasks, they can exhibit strong biases toward
one modality, frequently overlooking critical visual cues in favor of textual
information. In this work, we introduce Selective Modality Shifting (SMS), a
perturbation-based approach to quantify a model's reliance on each modality in
binary classification tasks. By systematically swapping images or text between
samples with opposing labels, we expose modality-specific biases. We assess six
open-source VLMs-four generalist models and two fine-tuned for medical data-on
two medical imaging datasets with distinct modalities: MIMIC-CXR (chest X-ray)
and FairVLMed (scanning laser ophthalmoscopy). By assessing model performance
and the calibration of every model in both unperturbed and perturbed settings,
we reveal a marked dependency on text input, which persists despite the
presence of complementary visual information. We also perform a qualitative
attention-based analysis which further confirms that image content is often
overshadowed by text details. Our findings highlight the importance of
designing and evaluating multimodal medical models that genuinely integrate
visual and textual cues, rather than relying on single-modality signals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为机器学习和计算科学中的模型架构提供一种层次化图结构，支持高效操作和多尺度分析。

Method: 提出图谱系概念，定义骨架操作符（如乘积、加厚、升级）和代数类型理论，应用于深度神经网络和多网格方法。

Result: 构建了分级图的代数框架，支持层次化模型设计和高效算法实现。

Conclusion: 该方法为层次化架构和局部算法提供了理论基础，适用于多领域应用。

Abstract: Graphs, and sequences of growing graphs, can be used to specify the
architecture of mathematical models in many fields including machine learning
and computational science. Here we define structured graph "lineages" (ordered
by level number) that grow in a hierarchical fashion, so that: (1) the number
of graph vertices and edges increases exponentially in level number; (2)
bipartite graphs connect successive levels within a graph lineage and, as in
multigrid methods, can constrain matrices relating successive levels; (3) using
prolongation maps within a graph lineage, process-derived distance measures
between graphs at successive levels can be defined; (4) a category of "graded
graphs" can be defined, and using it low-cost "skeletal" variants of standard
algebraic graph operations and type constructors (cross product, box product,
disjoint sum, and function types) can be derived for graded graphs and hence
hierarchical graph lineages; (5) these skeletal binary operators have similar
but not identical algebraic and category-theoretic properties to their standard
counterparts; (6) graph lineages and their skeletal product constructors can
approach continuum limit objects. Additional space-efficient unary operators on
graded graphs are also derived: thickening, which creates a graph lineage of
multiscale graphs, and escalation to a graph lineage of search frontiers
(useful as a generalization of adaptive grids and in defining "skeletal"
functions). The result is an algebraic type theory for graded graphs and
(hierarchical) graph lineages. The approach is expected to be well suited to
defining hierarchical model architectures - "hierarchitectures" - and local
sampling, search, or optimization algorithms on them. We demonstrate such
application to deep neural networks (including visual and feature scale spaces)
and to multigrid numerical methods.

### [10] [Learning Personalised Human Internal Cognition from External Expressive Behaviours for Real Personality Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00205)
*Xiangyu Kong,Hengde Zhu,Haoqin Sun,Zhihao Guo,Jiayan Gu,Xinyi Ni,Wei Zhang,Shizhe Liu,Siyang Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于个性化内部认知的自动真实人格识别方法，通过模拟目标个体的内部认知来提升识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常作为外部观察者推断人格印象，与真实人格存在偏差，导致识别性能不佳。

Method: 通过短音频-视觉行为模拟个性化内部认知，构建二维图表示，并设计2D-GNN进行人格推断。

Result: 提出了一种端到端的训练策略，联合优化认知模拟、图构建和人格识别模块。

Conclusion: 该方法通过模拟内部认知有效提升了真实人格识别的性能。

Abstract: Automatic real personality recognition (RPR) aims to evaluate human real
personality traits from their expressive behaviours. However, most existing
solutions generally act as external observers to infer observers' personality
impressions based on target individuals' expressive behaviours, which
significantly deviate from their real personalities and consistently lead to
inferior recognition performance. Inspired by the association between real
personality and human internal cognition underlying the generation of
expressive behaviours, we propose a novel RPR approach that efficiently
simulates personalised internal cognition from easy-accessible external short
audio-visual behaviours expressed by the target individual. The simulated
personalised cognition, represented as a set of network weights that enforce
the personalised network to reproduce the individual-specific facial reactions,
is further encoded as a novel graph containing two-dimensional node and edge
feature matrices, with a novel 2D Graph Neural Network (2D-GNN) proposed for
inferring real personality traits from it. To simulate real personality-related
cognition, an end-to-end strategy is designed to jointly train our cognition
simulation, 2D graph construction, and personality recognition modules.

*Shayan Jalilian,Abdul Bais*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM-PTx通过轻量级适配器设计，将CLIP文本嵌入注入SAM的图像编码器，提升语义引导的分割性能，优于传统空间提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语义文本提示在分割任务中的潜力，弥补传统空间提示（如点和框）的不足。

Method: 提出Parallel-Text适配器，仅修改MLP并行分支，保留注意力路径，利用冻结CLIP文本嵌入作为语义指导。

Result: 在COD10K、COCO和ADE20K数据集上，语义提示显著提升分割性能。

Conclusion: 语义条件集成是高效适应SAM的实用且可扩展路径。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated impressive generalization
in prompt-based segmentation. Yet, the potential of semantic text prompts
remains underexplored compared to traditional spatial prompts like points and
boxes. This paper introduces SAM-PTx, a parameter-efficient approach for
adapting SAM using frozen CLIP-derived text embeddings as class-level semantic
guidance. Specifically, we propose a lightweight adapter design called
Parallel-Text that injects text embeddings into SAM's image encoder, enabling
semantics-guided segmentation while keeping most of the original architecture
frozen. Our adapter modifies only the MLP-parallel branch of each transformer
block, preserving the attention pathway for spatial reasoning. Through
supervised experiments and ablations on the COD10K dataset as well as low-data
subsets of COCO and ADE20K, we show that incorporating fixed text embeddings as
input improves segmentation performance over purely spatial prompt baselines.
To our knowledge, this is the first work to use text prompts for segmentation
on the COD10K dataset. These results suggest that integrating semantic
conditioning into SAM's architecture offers a practical and scalable path for
efficient adaptation with minimal computational complexity.

*Aymane Abdali,Bartosz Boguslawski,Lucas Drumetz,Vincent Gripon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 在少样本图像分类中，通过引入物体局部位置信息显著提升分类性能，且仅需少量标注或完全无监督方法即可实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决少样本图像分类中因图像模糊或多物体背景导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 利用Segment Anything Model（仅需标注一个像素点）或完全无监督的前景物体提取方法。

Result: 在多个基准测试中分类性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 局部位置信息的引入是提升少样本分类性能的有效方法，且实现成本低。

Abstract: In the domain of Few-Shot Image Classification, operating with as little as
one example per class, the presence of image ambiguities stemming from multiple
objects or complex backgrounds can significantly deteriorate performance. Our
research demonstrates that incorporating additional information about the local
positioning of an object within its image markedly enhances classification
across established benchmarks. More importantly, we show that a significant
fraction of the improvement can be achieved through the use of the Segment
Anything Model, requiring only a pixel of the object of interest to be pointed
out, or by employing fully unsupervised foreground object extraction methods.

### [13] [Guided Depth Map Super-Resolution via Multi-Scale Fusion U-shaped Mamba Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00248)
*Chenggang Guo,Hao Xu,XianMing Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多尺度融合U形Mamba（MSF-UM）模型，用于深度图超分辨率，结合了Mamba的高效状态空间建模能力和多尺度U形结构，显著提升了重建精度并减少了参数数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卷积神经网络在处理长距离依赖和全局上下文信息时存在局限性，而Transformer的计算复杂度和内存消耗较高，限制了其在高分辨率深度图处理中的应用。

Method: 设计了一种结合残差密集通道注意力块和Mamba状态空间模块的结构，利用多尺度跨模态融合策略，通过彩色图像的高频纹理信息指导深度图超分辨率。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上的实验表明，MSF-UM在减少模型参数的同时，显著提升了重建精度，并展现出优秀的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MSF-UM模型在深度图超分辨率任务中表现出色，尤其在处理大规模深度图时具有显著优势。

Abstract: Depth map super-resolution technology aims to improve the spatial resolution
of low-resolution depth maps and effectively restore high-frequency detail
information. Traditional convolutional neural network has limitations in
dealing with long-range dependencies and are unable to fully model the global
contextual information in depth maps. Although transformer can model global
dependencies, its computational complexity and memory consumption are
quadratic, which significantly limits its ability to process high-resolution
depth maps. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale fusion U-shaped Mamba
(MSF-UM) model, a novel guided depth map super-resolution framework. The core
innovation of this model is to integrate Mamba's efficient state-space modeling
capabilities into a multi-scale U-shaped fusion structure guided by a color
image. The structure combining the residual dense channel attention block and
the Mamba state space module is designed, which combines the local feature
extraction capability of the convolutional layer with the modeling advantage of
the state space model for long-distance dependencies. At the same time, the
model adopts a multi-scale cross-modal fusion strategy to make full use of the
high-frequency texture information from the color image to guide the
super-resolution process of the depth map. Compared with existing mainstream
methods, the proposed MSF-UM significantly reduces the number of model
parameters while achieving better reconstruction accuracy. Extensive
experiments on multiple publicly available datasets validate the effectiveness
of the model, especially showing excellent generalization ability in the task
of large-scale depth map super-resolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在初始化时间长和多视图一致性不足的问题，PointGauss旨在通过点云分割驱动的高斯原语解码器和GPU加速的2D掩码渲染系统解决这些问题。

Method: 提出点云引导的高斯原语解码器和GPU加速的2D掩码渲染系统，实现快速3D分割和多视图一致性。

Result: 实验显示性能提升1.89%至31.78%（多视图mIoU），并保持高效计算。

Conclusion: PointGauss在3D分割中表现优异，同时提出了新的数据集DesktopObjects-360以解决现有基准的局限性。

Abstract: We introduce PointGauss, a novel point cloud-guided framework for real-time
multi-object segmentation in Gaussian Splatting representations. Unlike
existing methods that suffer from prolonged initialization and limited
multi-view consistency, our approach achieves efficient 3D segmentation by
directly parsing Gaussian primitives through a point cloud segmentation-driven
pipeline. The key innovation lies in two aspects: (1) a point cloud-based
Gaussian primitive decoder that generates 3D instance masks within 1 minute,
and (2) a GPU-accelerated 2D mask rendering system that ensures multi-view
consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements over
previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving performance gains of 1.89 to
31.78% in multi-view mIoU, while maintaining superior computational efficiency.
To address the limitations of current benchmarks (single-object focus,
inconsistent 3D evaluation, small scale, and partial coverage), we present
DesktopObjects-360, a novel comprehensive dataset for 3D segmentation in
radiance fields, featuring: (1) complex multi-object scenes, (2) globally
consistent 2D annotations, (3) large-scale training data (over 27 thousand 2D
masks), (4) full 360{\deg} coverage, and (5) 3D evaluation masks.

(VLMs) to incorporate knowledge from new tasks without retraining data from
previous ones. Recent methods update a visual projector to translate visual
information for new tasks, connecting pre-trained vision encoders with large
language models. However, such adjustments may cause the models to prioritize
visual inputs over language instructions, particularly learning tasks with
repetitive types of textual instructions. To address the neglect of language
instructions, we propose a novel framework that grounds the translation of
visual information on instructions for language models. We introduce a mixture
of visual projectors, each serving as a specialized visual-to-language
translation expert based on the given instruction context to adapt to new
tasks. To avoid using experts for irrelevant instruction contexts, we propose
an expert recommendation strategy that reuses experts for tasks similar to
those previously learned. Additionally, we introduce expert pruning to
alleviate interference from the use of experts that cumulatively activated in
previous tasks. Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language tasks
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing continual learning approaches
by generating instruction-following responses.

Abstract: Multimodal referring segmentation aims to segment target objects in visual
scenes, such as images, videos, and 3D scenes, based on referring expressions
in text or audio format. This task plays a crucial role in practical
applications requiring accurate object perception based on user instructions.
Over the past decade, it has gained significant attention in the multimodal
community, driven by advances in convolutional neural networks, transformers,
and large language models, all of which have substantially improved multimodal
perception capabilities. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of
multimodal referring segmentation. We begin by introducing this field's
background, including problem definitions and commonly used datasets. Next, we
summarize a unified meta architecture for referring segmentation and review
representative methods across three primary visual scenes, including images,
videos, and 3D scenes. We further discuss Generalized Referring Expression
(GREx) methods to address the challenges of real-world complexity, along with
related tasks and practical applications. Extensive performance comparisons on
standard benchmarks are also provided. We continually track related works at

*Wenyue Chong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种评估语义对应在恶劣条件下鲁棒性的新基准，发现现有方法在挑战性场景中性能显著下降，并探讨了大规模视觉模型和融合策略的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义对应是计算机视觉中的基础任务，但其在恶劣条件下的鲁棒性研究不足，因此需要建立新基准以填补这一空白。

Method: 构建包含14种挑战性场景的基准数据集，评估现有语义对应方法和大规模视觉模型（如DINO和Stable Diffusion）的鲁棒性。

Result: 现有方法在恶劣条件下性能下降；大规模视觉模型提升鲁棒性但微调会降低相对鲁棒性；DINO优于Stable Diffusion，融合策略提升绝对鲁棒性；通用数据增强无效。

Conclusion: 任务特定的鲁棒性增强设计是必要的，大规模视觉模型和融合策略为语义对应在恶劣条件下的应用提供了新方向。

Abstract: Semantic correspondence aims to identify semantically meaningful
relationships between different images and is a fundamental challenge in
computer vision. It forms the foundation for numerous tasks such as 3D
reconstruction, object tracking, and image editing. With the progress of
large-scale vision models, semantic correspondence has achieved remarkable
performance in controlled and high-quality conditions. However, the robustness
of semantic correspondence in challenging scenarios is much less investigated.
In this work, we establish a novel benchmark for evaluating semantic
correspondence in adverse conditions. The benchmark dataset comprises 14
distinct challenging scenarios that reflect commonly encountered imaging
issues, including geometric distortion, image blurring, digital artifacts, and
environmental occlusion. Through extensive evaluations, we provide several key
insights into the robustness of semantic correspondence approaches: (1) All
existing methods suffer from noticeable performance drops under adverse
conditions; (2) Using large-scale vision models can enhance overall robustness,
but fine-tuning on these models leads to a decline in relative robustness; (3)
The DINO model outperforms the Stable Diffusion in relative robustness, and
their fusion achieves better absolute robustness; Moreover, We evaluate common
robustness enhancement strategies for semantic correspondence and find that
general data augmentations are ineffective, highlighting the need for
task-specific designs. These results are consistent across both our dataset and
real-world benchmarks.

Abstract: Driver drowsiness is one of the main causes of road accidents and is
recognized as a leading contributor to traffic-related fatalities. However,
detecting drowsiness accurately remains a challenging task, especially in
real-world settings where facial data from different individuals is
decentralized and highly diverse. In this paper, we propose a novel framework
for drowsiness detection that is designed to work effectively with
heterogeneous and decentralized data. Our approach develops a new Spatial
Self-Attention (SSA) mechanism integrated with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
network to better extract key facial features and improve detection
performance. To support federated learning, we employ a Gradient Similarity
Comparison (GSC) that selects the most relevant trained models from different
operators before aggregation. This improves the accuracy and robustness of the
global model while preserving user privacy. We also develop a customized tool
that automatically processes video data by extracting frames, detecting and
cropping faces, and applying data augmentation techniques such as rotation,
flipping, brightness adjustment, and zooming. Experimental results show that
our framework achieves a detection accuracy of 89.9% in the federated learning
settings, outperforming existing methods under various deployment scenarios.
The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in handling
real-world data variability and highlight its potential for deployment in
intelligent transportation systems to enhance road safety through early and
reliable drowsiness detection.

Result: 实验表明，该方法有效管理内存并显著提升文本到视频扩散模型的性能。

Conclusion: TITAN-Guide在减少内存需求的同时，优化了控制效果，适用于计算密集型任务。

Abstract: In the recent development of conditional diffusion models still require heavy
supervised fine-tuning for performing control on a category of tasks.
Training-free conditioning via guidance with off-the-shelf models is a
favorable alternative to avoid further fine-tuning on the base model. However,
the existing training-free guidance frameworks either have heavy memory
requirements or offer sub-optimal control due to rough estimation. These
shortcomings limit the applicability to control diffusion models that require
intense computation, such as Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models. In this
work, we propose Taming Inference Time Alignment for Guided Text-to-Video
Diffusion Model, so-called TITAN-Guide, which overcomes memory space issues,
and provides more optimal control in the guidance process compared to the
counterparts. In particular, we develop an efficient method for optimizing
diffusion latents without backpropagation from a discriminative guiding model.
In particular, we study forward gradient descents for guided diffusion tasks
with various options on directional directives. In our experiments, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in efficiently managing memory
during latent optimization, while previous methods fall short. Our proposed
approach not only minimizes memory requirements but also significantly enhances
T2V performance across a range of diffusion guidance benchmarks. Code, models,
and demo are available at https://titanguide.github.io.

TL;DR: AniMer+扩展了AniMer框架，通过高容量的ViT和MoE设计，统一重建哺乳动物和鸟类，并利用扩散模型生成合成数据集，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多物种动态对象统一理解的网络容量限制和数据稀缺问题，尤其是鸟类3D数据的缺乏。

Method: 采用家族感知的ViT和MoE设计，分区网络层为物种特定和共享组件；引入扩散模型生成合成数据集CtrlAni3D和CtrlAVES3D。

Result: 在41.3k哺乳动物和12.4k鸟类图像上训练，性能优于现有方法，尤其在Animal Kingdom数据集上表现突出。

Conclusion: AniMer+的网络架构和合成数据集有效提升了真实世界应用的性能。

Abstract: In the era of foundation models, achieving a unified understanding of
different dynamic objects through a single network has the potential to empower
stronger spatial intelligence. Moreover, accurate estimation of animal pose and
shape across diverse species is essential for quantitative analysis in
biological research. However, this topic remains underexplored due to the
limited network capacity of previous methods and the scarcity of comprehensive
multi-species datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce AniMer+, an
extended version of our scalable AniMer framework. In this paper, we focus on a
unified approach for reconstructing mammals (mammalia) and birds (aves). A key
innovation of AniMer+ is its high-capacity, family-aware Vision Transformer
(ViT) incorporating a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design. Its architecture
partitions network layers into taxa-specific components (for mammalia and aves)
and taxa-shared components, enabling efficient learning of both distinct and
common anatomical features within a single model. To overcome the critical
shortage of 3D training data, especially for birds, we introduce a
diffusion-based conditional image generation pipeline. This pipeline produces
two large-scale synthetic datasets: CtrlAni3D for quadrupeds and CtrlAVES3D for
birds. To note, CtrlAVES3D is the first large-scale, 3D-annotated dataset for
birds, which is crucial for resolving single-view depth ambiguities. Trained on
an aggregated collection of 41.3k mammalian and 12.4k avian images (combining
real and synthetic data), our method demonstrates superior performance over
existing approaches across a wide range of benchmarks, including the
challenging out-of-domain Animal Kingdom dataset. Ablation studies confirm the
effectiveness of both our novel network architecture and the generated
synthetic datasets in enhancing real-world application performance.

Abstract: Pedestrian detection models in autonomous driving systems often lack
robustness due to insufficient representation of dangerous pedestrian scenarios
in training datasets. To address this limitation, we present a novel framework
for controllable pedestrian video editing in multi-view driving scenarios by
integrating video inpainting and human motion control techniques. Our approach
begins by identifying pedestrian regions of interest across multiple camera
views, expanding detection bounding boxes with a fixed ratio, and resizing and
stitching these regions into a unified canvas while preserving cross-view
spatial relationships. A binary mask is then applied to designate the editable
area, within which pedestrian editing is guided by pose sequence control
conditions. This enables flexible editing functionalities, including pedestrian
insertion, replacement, and removal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves high-quality pedestrian editing with strong visual realism,
spatiotemporal coherence, and cross-view consistency. These results establish
the proposed method as a robust and versatile solution for multi-view
pedestrian video generation, with broad potential for applications in data
augmentation and scenario simulation in autonomous driving.

Motivation: 现有方法未充分利用事件相机和帧相机的模态优势，限制了性能提升。

Method: 1. 设计基于傅里叶空间振幅-相位纠缠的可见性恢复网络；2. 提出动态对齐的融合策略以解决时空分辨率不匹配问题；3. 利用空间频率插值生成负样本，开发对比损失。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有最优模型。

Conclusion: 通过解耦增强流程和动态对齐策略，该方法有效提升了低光图像增强性能。

Abstract: The event camera, benefiting from its high dynamic range and low latency,
provides performance gain for low-light image enhancement. Unlike frame-based
cameras, it records intensity changes with extremely high temporal resolution,
capturing sufficient structure information. Currently, existing event-based
methods feed a frame and events directly into a single model without fully
exploiting modality-specific advantages, which limits their performance.
Therefore, by analyzing the role of each sensing modality, the enhancement
pipeline is decoupled into two stages: visibility restoration and structure
refinement. In the first stage, we design a visibility restoration network with
amplitude-phase entanglement by rethinking the relationship between amplitude
and phase components in Fourier space. In the second stage, a fusion strategy
with dynamic alignment is proposed to mitigate the spatial mismatch caused by
the temporal resolution discrepancy between two sensing modalities, aiming to
refine the structure information of the image enhanced by the visibility
restoration network. In addition, we utilize spatial-frequency interpolation to
simulate negative samples with diverse illumination, noise and artifact
degradations, thereby developing a contrastive loss that encourages the model
to learn discriminative representations. Experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for mathematical formula is essential for
the intelligent analysis of scientific literature. However, both task-specific

diversity, complexity, and real-world variability inherent in mathematical
content. In this work, we present DocTron-Formula, a unified framework built
upon general vision-language models, thereby eliminating the need for

and challenging dataset that encompasses multidisciplinary and structurally
complex formulas at the line, paragraph, and page levels. Through
straightforward supervised fine-tuning, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance across a variety of styles, scientific domains, and complex
layouts. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only surpasses
specialized models in terms of accuracy and robustness, but also establishes a
new paradigm for the automated understanding of complex scientific documents.

Conclusion: GV-VAD框架通过低成本生成合成视频有效提升了视频异常检测的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) plays a critical role in public safety
applications such as intelligent surveillance. However, the rarity,
unpredictability, and high annotation cost of real-world anomalies make it
difficult to scale VAD datasets, which limits the performance and
generalization ability of existing models. To address this challenge, we
propose a generative video-enhanced weakly-supervised video anomaly detection
(GV-VAD) framework that leverages text-conditioned video generation models to
produce semantically controllable and physically plausible synthetic videos.
These virtual videos are used to augment training data at low cost. In
addition, a synthetic sample loss scaling strategy is utilized to control the
influence of generated synthetic samples for efficient training. The
experiments show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on UCF-Crime datasets. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的个性化引导方法，通过未学习的弱模型和动态权重插值，平衡目标分布对齐和文本编辑能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在少量图像微调时难以平衡目标分布对齐和原始模型知识保留，导致文本编辑能力下降或目标分布对齐不足。

Method: 利用未学习的弱模型和动态权重插值，在推理时控制未学习程度，无需额外计算开销。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效提升文本对齐和目标分布保真度，兼容多种微调策略。

Conclusion: 提出的个性化引导方法简单高效，解决了现有方法的局限性，实现了更好的平衡。

Abstract: Personalizing text-to-image diffusion models is crucial for adapting the
pre-trained models to specific target concepts, enabling diverse image
generation. However, fine-tuning with few images introduces an inherent
trade-off between aligning with the target distribution (e.g., subject
fidelity) and preserving the broad knowledge of the original model (e.g., text
editability). Existing sampling guidance methods, such as classifier-free
guidance (CFG) and autoguidance (AG), fail to effectively guide the output
toward well-balanced space: CFG restricts the adaptation to the target
distribution, while AG compromises text alignment. To address these
limitations, we propose personalization guidance, a simple yet effective method
leveraging an unlearned weak model conditioned on a null text prompt. Moreover,
our method dynamically controls the extent of unlearning in a weak model
through weight interpolation between pre-trained and fine-tuned models during
inference. Unlike existing guidance methods, which depend solely on guidance
scales, our method explicitly steers the outputs toward a balanced latent space
without additional computational overhead. Experimental results demonstrate
that our proposed guidance can improve text alignment and target distribution
fidelity, integrating seamlessly with various fine-tuning strategies.

Method: 通过捕捉直接光照及其通过衍射光栅片的衍射图案图像，以闭式方式估计相机光谱灵敏度和衍射光栅参数。

Result: 在合成和真实数据上的实验表明，该方法优于传统的基于参考目标的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效且实用，为相机光谱灵敏度校准提供了一种更简便的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces a practical and accurate calibration method for camera
spectral sensitivity using a diffraction grating. Accurate calibration of
camera spectral sensitivity is crucial for various computer vision tasks,
including color correction, illumination estimation, and material analysis.
Unlike existing approaches that require specialized narrow-band filters or
reference targets with known spectral reflectances, our method only requires an
uncalibrated diffraction grating sheet, readily available off-the-shelf. By
capturing images of the direct illumination and its diffracted pattern through
the grating sheet, our method estimates both the camera spectral sensitivity
and the diffraction grating parameters in a closed-form manner. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our method outperforms
conventional reference target-based methods, underscoring its effectiveness and
practicality.

Abstract: We present a Collaborative Agent-Based Framework for Multi-Image Reasoning.
Our approach tackles the challenge of interleaved multimodal reasoning across
diverse datasets and task formats by employing a dual-agent system: a
language-based PromptEngineer, which generates context-aware, task-specific

for final inference. The framework is fully automated, modular, and
training-free, enabling generalization across classification, question

images. We evaluate our method on 18 diverse datasets from the 2025 MIRAGE
Challenge (Track A), covering a broad spectrum of visual reasoning tasks
including document QA, visual comparison, dialogue-based understanding, and
scene-level inference. Our results demonstrate that LVLMs can effectively
reason over multiple images when guided by informative prompts. Notably, Claude
3.7 achieves near-ceiling performance on challenging tasks such as TQA (99.13%

Motivation: 传统多目标跟踪方法基于静态坐标变换，忽略了车辆速度对观测噪声和参考帧变化的影响，导致在高动态场景中跟踪性能下降。

Method: 提出SG-LKF，结合MotionScaleNet（MSNet）动态预测关键参数，并引入自监督轨迹一致性损失以增强帧间关联和轨迹连续性。

Result: SG-LKF在KITTI 2D MOT和3D MOT上分别达到79.59%和82.03%的HOTA，在nuScenes 3D MOT上比SimpleTrack高出2.2% AMOTA。

Conclusion: SG-LKF通过动态适应车辆速度，显著提升了多目标跟踪在高动态场景中的性能。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) enables autonomous vehicles to continuously
perceive dynamic objects, supplying essential temporal cues for prediction,
behavior understanding, and safe planning. However, conventional
tracking-by-detection methods typically rely on static coordinate
transformations based on ego-vehicle poses, disregarding ego-vehicle
speed-induced variations in observation noise and reference frame changes,
which degrades tracking stability and accuracy in dynamic, high-speed
scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the critical role of ego-vehicle speed
in MOT and propose a Speed-Guided Learnable Kalman Filter (SG-LKF) that
dynamically adapts uncertainty modeling to ego-vehicle speed, significantly
improving stability and accuracy in highly dynamic scenarios. Central to SG-LKF
is MotionScaleNet (MSNet), a decoupled token-mixing and channel-mixing MLP that
adaptively predicts key parameters of SG-LKF. To enhance inter-frame
association and trajectory continuity, we introduce a self-supervised
trajectory consistency loss jointly optimized with semantic and positional
constraints. Extensive experiments show that SG-LKF ranks first among all
vision-based methods on KITTI 2D MOT with 79.59% HOTA, delivers strong results
on KITTI 3D MOT with 82.03% HOTA, and outperforms SimpleTrack by 2.2% AMOTA on
nuScenes 3D MOT.

Conclusion: CoST通过统一的时空聚合，显著提升了协作感知的性能，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Collaborative perception shares information among different agents and helps
solving problems that individual agents may face, e.g., occlusions and small
sensing range. Prior methods usually separate the multi-agent fusion and
multi-time fusion into two consecutive steps. In contrast, this paper proposes
an efficient collaborative perception that aggregates the observations from
different agents (space) and different times into a unified spatio-temporal
space simultanesouly. The unified spatio-temporal space brings two benefits,
i.e., efficient feature transmission and superior feature fusion. 1) Efficient
feature transmission: each static object yields a single observation in the
spatial temporal space, and thus only requires transmission only once (whereas
prior methods re-transmit all the object features multiple times). 2) superior
feature fusion: merging the multi-agent and multi-time fusion into a unified
spatial-temporal aggregation enables a more holistic perspective, thereby
enhancing perception performance in challenging scenarios. Consequently, our
Collaborative perception with Spatio-temporal Transformer (CoST) gains
improvement in both efficiency and accuracy. Notably, CoST is not tied to any
specific method and is compatible with a majority of previous methods,
enhancing their accuracy while reducing the transmission bandwidth.

class transformation method in the dataset preparation phase to maximize the
separability across classes. The feature extraction phase employs the Linear
Discriminant Analysis (LDA) technique for extracting relevant features and
reducing the number of dimensions. In the classification phase, we use Support
Vector Machines (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models to classify the
extracted features of honey samples into their botanical origins. We evaluate
our system using a standard honey hyperspectral imaging (HSI) dataset.
Experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed system produces
state-of-the-art results on this dataset, achieving the highest classification
accuracy of 95.13% for hyperspectral image-based classification and 92.80% for
hyperspectral instance-based classification.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SparseRecon的新方法，通过特征一致性和不确定性引导的深度约束，解决了稀疏视图重建中的泛化和几何细节问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在泛化性和重建质量上存在不足，无法很好地处理训练中未见的视图或有限的几何线索。

Method: 结合体积渲染的特征一致性损失和不确定性引导的深度约束，优化神经隐式场。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在稀疏视图输入下优于现有技术，尤其是在视图重叠较少的场景中。

Conclusion: SparseRecon通过特征一致性和深度约束，显著提升了稀疏视图重建的质量和泛化能力。

Abstract: Surface reconstruction from sparse views aims to reconstruct a 3D shape or
scene from few RGB images. The latest methods are either generalization-based
or overfitting-based. However, the generalization-based methods do not
generalize well on views that were unseen during training, while the
reconstruction quality of overfitting-based methods is still limited by the
limited geometry clues. To address this issue, we propose SparseRecon, a novel
neural implicit reconstruction method for sparse views with volume
rendering-based feature consistency and uncertainty-guided depth constraint.
Firstly, we introduce a feature consistency loss across views to constrain the
neural implicit field. This design alleviates the ambiguity caused by
insufficient consistency information of views and ensures completeness and
smoothness in the reconstruction results. Secondly, we employ an
uncertainty-guided depth constraint to back up the feature consistency loss in
areas with occlusion and insignificant features, which recovers geometry
details for better reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, which can produce
high-quality geometry with sparse-view input, especially in the scenarios with
small overlapping views. Project page: https://hanl2010.github.io/SparseRecon/.

*Joonmyung Choi,Sanghyeok Lee,Byungoh Ko,Eunseo Kim,Jihyung Kil,Hyunwoo J. Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Representation Shift的训练无关、模型无关的度量方法，用于测量每个token表示的变化程度，从而与FlashAttention兼容地实现token压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着任务复杂度的增加，Transformer模型和token数量增大，导致自注意力计算的二次成本和GPU内存访问开销增加。现有token压缩方法依赖于注意力图，与FlashAttention不兼容。

Method: 提出Representation Shift度量方法，无需训练或注意力图，直接测量token表示的变化程度，实现与FlashAttention兼容的token压缩。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视频-文本检索和视频问答任务中分别实现了5.5%和4.4%的显著加速。

Conclusion: Representation Shift是一种高效且通用的token压缩方法，适用于多种模型，并与FlashAttention无缝集成。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success across vision, language,
and video. Yet, increasing task complexity has led to larger models and more
tokens, raising the quadratic cost of self-attention and the overhead of GPU
memory access. To reduce the computation cost of self-attention, prior work has
proposed token compression techniques that drop redundant or less informative
tokens. Meanwhile, fused attention kernels such as FlashAttention have been
developed to alleviate memory overhead by avoiding attention map construction
and its associated I/O to HBM. This, however, makes it incompatible with most
training-free token compression methods, which rely on attention maps to
determine token importance. Here, we propose Representation Shift, a
training-free, model-agnostic metric that measures the degree of change in each
token's representation. This seamlessly integrates token compression with
FlashAttention, without attention maps or retraining. Our method further
generalizes beyond Transformers to CNNs and state space models. Extensive
experiments show that Representation Shift enables effective token compression
compatible with FlashAttention, yielding significant speedups of up to 5.5% and
4.4% in video-text retrieval and video QA, respectively. Code is available at
https://github.com/mlvlab/Representation-Shift.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法因单向性限制性能，难以捕捉场景中的语义子动作。

Method: 结合前向和后向预测，使用大语言模型BiAnt。

Conclusion: BiAnt有效解决了传统方法的局限性，提升了长期动作预测性能。

Abstract: Video-based long-term action anticipation is crucial for early risk detection
in areas such as automated driving and robotics. Conventional approaches
extract features from past actions using encoders and predict future events
with decoders, which limits performance due to their unidirectional nature.
These methods struggle to capture semantically distinct sub-actions within a
scene. The proposed method, BiAnt, addresses this limitation by combining
forward prediction with backward prediction using a large language model.
Experimental results on Ego4D demonstrate that BiAnt improves performance in
terms of edit distance compared to baseline methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无损检测方法难以发现细微或内部缺陷，现有神经网络方法缺乏可解释性，存在安全隐患。

Conclusion: 该工作提升了焊接缺陷检测系统的信任度、安全性和可靠性，适用于海洋和离岸环境。

Abstract: Weld defect detection is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of
piping systems in the oil and gas industry, especially in challenging marine
and offshore environments. Traditional non-destructive testing (NDT) methods
often fail to detect subtle or internal defects, leading to potential failures
and costly downtime. Furthermore, existing neural network-based approaches for
defect classification frequently rely on arbitrarily selected pretrained
architectures and lack interpretability, raising safety concerns for
deployment. To address these challenges, this paper introduces
``Adapt-WeldNet", an adaptive framework for welding defect detection that
systematically evaluates various pre-trained architectures, transfer learning
strategies, and adaptive optimizers to identify the best-performing model and
hyperparameters, optimizing defect detection and providing actionable insights.
Additionally, a novel Defect Detection Interpretability Analysis (DDIA)
framework is proposed to enhance system transparency. DDIA employs Explainable
AI (XAI) techniques, such as Grad-CAM and LIME, alongside domain-specific
evaluations validated by certified ASNT NDE Level II professionals.
Incorporating a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approach and aligning with the
principles of Trustworthy AI, DDIA ensures the reliability, fairness, and
accountability of the defect detection system, fostering confidence in
automated decisions through expert validation. By improving both performance
and interpretability, this work enhances trust, safety, and reliability in
welding defect detection systems, supporting critical operations in offshore
and marine environments.

Motivation: 空间转录组学成本高且技术复杂，限制了临床应用。通过从常规病理图像预测基因表达（生物标志物）是一种实用替代方案，但现有基于ViT的模型性能不足。

Method: 提出$MV_{Hybrid}$架构，结合SSMs和ViT，利用SSMs的低频偏置特性捕捉形态学模式。在相同数据集上预训练并与其他五种架构对比。

Result: 在LOSO评估中，$MV_{Hybrid}$比最佳ViT模型相关性高57%，性能下降减少43%，且在分类、检索和生存预测任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: $MV_{Hybrid}$展示了作为下一代病理学视觉基础模型骨干的潜力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics reveals gene expression patterns within tissue
context, enabling precision oncology applications such as treatment response
prediction, but its high cost and technical complexity limit clinical adoption.
Predicting spatial gene expression (biomarkers) from routine histopathology
images offers a practical alternative, yet current vision foundation models
(VFMs) in pathology based on Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones perform below
clinical standards. Given that VFMs are already trained on millions of diverse
whole slide images, we hypothesize that architectural innovations beyond ViTs
may better capture the low-frequency, subtle morphological patterns correlating
with molecular phenotypes. By demonstrating that state space models initialized
with negative real eigenvalues exhibit strong low-frequency bias, we introduce
$MV_{Hybrid}$, a hybrid backbone architecture combining state space models
(SSMs) with ViT. We compare five other different backbone architectures for
pathology VFMs, all pretrained on identical colorectal cancer datasets using
the DINOv2 self-supervised learning method. We evaluate all pretrained models
using both random split and leave-one-study-out (LOSO) settings of the same
biomarker dataset. In LOSO evaluation, $MV_{Hybrid}$ achieves 57% higher
correlation than the best-performing ViT and shows 43% smaller performance
degradation compared to random split in gene expression prediction,
demonstrating superior performance and robustness, respectively. Furthermore,
$MV_{Hybrid}$ shows equal or better downstream performance in classification,
patch retrieval, and survival prediction tasks compared to that of ViT, showing
its promise as a next-generation pathology VFM backbone. Our code is publicly
available at: https://github.com/deepnoid-ai/MVHybrid.

Motivation: 解决传统方法在CS识别中因手部和唇部动作异步及数据有限导致的性能不足问题。

Method: 设计了一个多智能体系统，包括手部识别、唇部识别、手部提示解码和自校正音素到词转换四个子智能体。

Result: 在正常和听力受损场景下，Cued-Agent表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Cued-Agent通过多智能体协作有效解决了CS识别中的异步和数据限制问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Cued Speech (CS) is a visual communication system that combines lip-reading
with hand coding to facilitate communication for individuals with hearing
impairments. Automatic CS Recognition (ACSR) aims to convert CS hand gestures
and lip movements into text via AI-driven methods. Traditionally, the temporal
asynchrony between hand and lip movements requires the design of complex
modules to facilitate effective multimodal fusion. However, constrained by
limited data availability, current methods demonstrate insufficient capacity
for adequately training these fusion mechanisms, resulting in suboptimal
performance. Recently, multi-agent systems have shown promising capabilities in
handling complex tasks with limited data availability. To this end, we propose
the first collaborative multi-agent system for ACSR, named Cued-Agent. It
integrates four specialized sub-agents: a Multimodal Large Language Model-based
Hand Recognition agent that employs keyframe screening and CS expert prompt
strategies to decode hand movements, a pretrained Transformer-based Lip
Recognition agent that extracts lip features from the input video, a Hand
Prompt Decoding agent that dynamically integrates hand prompts with lip
features during inference in a training-free manner, and a Self-Correction
Phoneme-to-Word agent that enables post-process and end-to-end conversion from
phoneme sequences to natural language sentences for the first time through
semantic refinement. To support this study, we expand the existing Mandarin CS
dataset by collecting data from eight hearing-impaired cuers, establishing a
mixed dataset of fourteen subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
Cued-Agent performs superbly in both normal and hearing-impaired scenarios
compared with state-of-the-art methods. The implementation is available at

Motivation: 解决提示调优（PT）中视觉与文本模态信息不对称的问题，避免模型因粗对齐而偏向关注上下文区域。

Method: 提出DAPT框架，先解耦视觉模态为前景和背景表示，再分别与文本对齐，并引入视觉拉推正则化增强注意力。

Result: 在少样本学习、基础到新类泛化和数据高效学习中表现优异。

Conclusion: DAPT通过解耦和对齐策略有效解决了信息不对称问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Prompt tuning (PT), as an emerging resource-efficient fine-tuning paradigm,
has showcased remarkable effectiveness in improving the task-specific
transferability of vision-language models. This paper delves into a previously
overlooked information asymmetry issue in PT, where the visual modality mostly
conveys more context than the object-oriented textual modality.
Correspondingly, coarsely aligning these two modalities could result in the
biased attention, driving the model to merely focus on the context area. To
address this, we propose DAPT, an effective PT framework based on an intuitive
decouple-before-align concept. First, we propose to explicitly decouple the
visual modality into the foreground and background representation via
exploiting coarse-and-fine visual segmenting cues, and then both of these
decoupled patterns are aligned with the original foreground texts and the
hand-crafted background classes, thereby symmetrically strengthening the modal
alignment. To further enhance the visual concentration, we propose a visual
pull-push regularization tailored for the foreground-background patterns,
directing the original visual representation towards unbiased attention on the
region-of-interest object. We demonstrate the power of architecture-free DAPT
through few-shot learning, base-to-novel generalization, and data-efficient
learning, all of which yield superior performance across prevailing benchmarks.
Our code will be released at https://github.com/Ferenas/DAPT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 潜在通道数的增加虽然能提升重建质量，但会导致扩散模型收敛缓慢，限制了潜在扩散模型的质量上限。

Method: 提出结构化潜在空间和增强扩散训练两种创新方法，前者通过训练在潜在空间中引入通道级结构，后者通过额外扩散训练目标加速收敛。

Result: DC-AE 1.5在ImageNet 512x512上比DC-AE-f32c32生成质量更好且快4倍。

Conclusion: DC-AE 1.5通过优化潜在空间结构和训练策略，显著提升了高分辨率扩散模型的性能和效率。

Abstract: We present DC-AE 1.5, a new family of deep compression autoencoders for
high-resolution diffusion models. Increasing the autoencoder's latent channel
number is a highly effective approach for improving its reconstruction quality.
However, it results in slow convergence for diffusion models, leading to poorer
generation quality despite better reconstruction quality. This issue limits the
quality upper bound of latent diffusion models and hinders the employment of
autoencoders with higher spatial compression ratios. We introduce two key
innovations to address this challenge: i) Structured Latent Space, a
training-based approach to impose a desired channel-wise structure on the
latent space with front latent channels capturing object structures and latter
latent channels capturing image details; ii) Augmented Diffusion Training, an
augmented diffusion training strategy with additional diffusion training
objectives on object latent channels to accelerate convergence. With these
techniques, DC-AE 1.5 delivers faster convergence and better diffusion scaling
results than DC-AE. On ImageNet 512x512, DC-AE-1.5-f64c128 delivers better
image generation quality than DC-AE-f32c32 while being 4x faster. Code:

Motivation: 随着扩散基视频生成模型的快速发展，合成内容越来越逼真，现有方法难以捕捉细粒度的时间不一致性，尤其是在视觉保真度高且运动连贯的AI生成视频中。

Method: 采用双分支架构，一个分支分析RGB帧以检测外观层面的伪影，另一个分支处理光流残差以揭示由不完美时间合成引起的细微运动异常。

Result: 在十种不同生成模型的文本到视频和图像到视频任务上进行了广泛实验，证明了该方法的鲁棒性和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过整合互补特征，该方法能有效检测多种伪造视频。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion-based video generation models has led to
increasingly realistic synthetic content, presenting new challenges for video
forgery detection. Existing methods often struggle to capture fine-grained
temporal inconsistencies, particularly in AI-generated videos with high visual
fidelity and coherent motion. In this work, we propose a detection framework
that leverages spatial-temporal consistency by combining RGB appearance
features with optical flow residuals. The model adopts a dual-branch
architecture, where one branch analyzes RGB frames to detect appearance-level
artifacts, while the other processes flow residuals to reveal subtle motion
anomalies caused by imperfect temporal synthesis. By integrating these
complementary features, the proposed method effectively detects a wide range of
forged videos. Extensive experiments on text-to-video and image-to-video tasks
across ten diverse generative models demonstrate the robustness and strong
generalization ability of the proposed approach.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在HOI场景中显著优于现有方法，且无需真实接触标注仍具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法使机器感知更接近人类对动态环境的理解，适用于3D重建和新视角合成等任务。

Abstract: Amodal completion, which is the process of inferring the full appearance of
objects despite partial occlusions, is crucial for understanding complex
human-object interactions (HOI) in computer vision and robotics. Existing
methods, such as those that use pre-trained diffusion models, often struggle to
generate plausible completions in dynamic scenarios because they have a limited
understanding of HOI. To solve this problem, we've developed a new approach
that uses physical prior knowledge along with a specialized multi-regional
inpainting technique designed for HOI. By incorporating physical constraints
from human topology and contact information, we define two distinct regions:
the primary region, where occluded object parts are most likely to be, and the
secondary region, where occlusions are less probable. Our multi-regional
inpainting method uses customized denoising strategies across these regions
within a diffusion model. This improves the accuracy and realism of the
generated completions in both their shape and visual detail. Our experimental
results show that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in
HOI scenarios, moving machine perception closer to a more human-like
understanding of dynamic environments. We also show that our pipeline is robust
even without ground-truth contact annotations, which broadens its applicability
to tasks like 3D reconstruction and novel view/pose synthesis.

Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型在高风险工业领域中的能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 构建iSafetyBench数据集，包含1,100个工业视频片段，标注了98种常规和67种危险动作类别，并进行多标签评估。

Result: 现有模型在iSafetyBench上表现不佳，尤其是在识别危险活动和多标签场景中存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: 需要更强大、安全感知的多模态模型，iSafetyBench为这一方向的研究提供了首个测试平台。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled impressive
generalization across diverse video understanding tasks under zero-shot
settings. However, their capabilities in high-stakes industrial domains-where
recognizing both routine operations and safety-critical anomalies is
essential-remain largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce
iSafetyBench, a new video-language benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
model performance in industrial environments across both normal and hazardous
scenarios. iSafetyBench comprises 1,100 video clips sourced from real-world
industrial settings, annotated with open-vocabulary, multi-label action tags
spanning 98 routine and 67 hazardous action categories. Each clip is paired
with multiple-choice questions for both single-label and multi-label
evaluation, enabling fine-grained assessment of VLMs in both standard and
safety-critical contexts. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art video-language
models under zero-shot conditions. Despite their strong performance on existing
video benchmarks, these models struggle with iSafetyBench-particularly in
recognizing hazardous activities and in multi-label scenarios. Our results
reveal significant performance gaps, underscoring the need for more robust,
safety-aware multimodal models for industrial applications. iSafetyBench
provides a first-of-its-kind testbed to drive progress in this direction. The
dataset is available at: https://github.com/raiyaan-abdullah/iSafety-Bench.

Method: 创建AerialCSP虚拟数据集，模拟真实航拍图像，用于预训练模型，并在真实数据上验证效果。

Result: AerialCSP显著提升了真实场景中的缺陷检测性能，尤其是对小而罕见的缺陷。

Conclusion: AerialCSP为CSP相关视觉任务提供了高质量合成数据，减少了手动标注需求。

Abstract: In the context of Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants, aerial images
captured by drones present a unique set of challenges. Unlike urban or natural
landscapes commonly found in existing datasets, solar fields contain highly
reflective surfaces, and domain-specific elements that are uncommon in
traditional computer vision benchmarks. As a result, machine learning models
trained on generic datasets struggle to generalize to this setting without
extensive retraining and large volumes of annotated data. However, collecting
and labeling such data is costly and time-consuming, making it impractical for
rapid deployment in industrial applications.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel approach: the creation of
AerialCSP, a virtual dataset that simulates aerial imagery of CSP plants. By
generating synthetic data that closely mimic real-world conditions, our
objective is to facilitate pretraining of models before deployment,
significantly reducing the need for extensive manual labeling. Our main
contributions are threefold: (1) we introduce AerialCSP, a high-quality
synthetic dataset for aerial inspection of CSP plants, providing annotated data
for object detection and image segmentation; (2) we benchmark multiple models
on AerialCSP, establishing a baseline for CSP-related vision tasks; and (3) we
demonstrate that pretraining on AerialCSP significantly improves real-world
fault detection, particularly for rare and small defects, reducing the need for
extensive manual labeling. AerialCSP is made publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 管状结构分割（TSS）在应用中面临域偏移的挑战，导致在未见目标域中性能下降。传统方法对拓扑结构变化敏感，影响分割完整性。

Method: TopoTTA分为两阶段：1）使用TopoMDCs适应跨域拓扑差异；2）通过TopoHG生成伪标签并优化拓扑连续性。

Result: 在四个场景和十个数据集上的实验表明，TopoTTA平均提升了31.81%的clDice指标。

Conclusion: TopoTTA是一种有效的、即插即用的解决方案，适用于基于CNN的TSS模型。

Abstract: Tubular structure segmentation (TSS) is important for various applications,
such as hemodynamic analysis and route navigation. Despite significant progress
in TSS, domain shifts remain a major challenge, leading to performance
degradation in unseen target domains. Unlike other segmentation tasks, TSS is
more sensitive to domain shifts, as changes in topological structures can
compromise segmentation integrity, and variations in local features
distinguishing foreground from background (e.g., texture and contrast) may
further disrupt topological continuity. To address these challenges, we propose
Topology-enhanced Test-Time Adaptation (TopoTTA), the first test-time
adaptation framework designed specifically for TSS. TopoTTA consists of two
stages: Stage 1 adapts models to cross-domain topological discrepancies using
the proposed Topological Meta Difference Convolutions (TopoMDCs), which enhance
topological representation without altering pre-trained parameters; Stage 2
improves topological continuity by a novel Topology Hard sample Generation
(TopoHG) strategy and prediction alignment on hard samples with pseudo-labels
in the generated pseudo-break regions. Extensive experiments across four
scenarios and ten datasets demonstrate TopoTTA's effectiveness in handling
topological distribution shifts, achieving an average improvement of 31.81% in
clDice. TopoTTA also serves as a plug-and-play TTA solution for CNN-based TSS
models.

Motivation: 现有方法难以恢复边缘细节和消除混合失真，尤其是在强湍流和复杂动态条件下。

Method: 提出了DEI指数量化视频动态强度，并设计了三阶段的PMR框架：去倾斜、动态区域增强和去模糊。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效抑制运动拖尾伪影、恢复边缘细节，并具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法在高湍流和复杂动态场景中表现优异，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Geometric distortions and blurring caused by atmospheric turbulence degrade
the quality of long-range dynamic scene videos. Existing methods struggle with
restoring edge details and eliminating mixed distortions, especially under
conditions of strong turbulence and complex dynamics. To address these
challenges, we introduce a Dynamic Efficiency Index ($DEI$), which combines
turbulence intensity, optical flow, and proportions of dynamic regions to
accurately quantify video dynamic intensity under varying turbulence conditions
and provide a high-dynamic turbulence training dataset. Additionally, we
propose a Physical Model-Driven Multi-Stage Video Restoration ($PMR$) framework
that consists of three stages: \textbf{de-tilting} for geometric stabilization,
\textbf{motion segmentation enhancement} for dynamic region refinement, and
\textbf{de-blurring} for quality restoration. $PMR$ employs lightweight
backbones and stage-wise joint training to ensure both efficiency and high
restoration quality. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
effectively suppresses motion trailing artifacts, restores edge details and
exhibits strong generalization capability, especially in real-world scenarios
characterized by high-turbulence and complex dynamics. We will make the code
and datasets openly available.

TL;DR: LesiOnTime是一种新型3D分割方法，结合纵向影像和BI-RADS评分，显著提升小病灶分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法主要关注大病灶，忽视了纵向和临床信息，而早期癌症检测需要这些信息。

Method: 提出Temporal Prior Attention (TPA)块和BI-RADS Consistency Regularization (BCR)损失函数，整合纵向数据和临床评分。

Result: 在DCE-MRI数据集上，Dice分数比现有方法高5%，TPA和BCR均贡献性能提升。

Conclusion: 结合时间和临床背景对乳腺癌早期筛查至关重要，LesiOnTime展示了其有效性。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of small lesions in Breast Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced
MRI (DCE-MRI) is critical for early cancer detection, especially in high-risk
patients. While recent deep learning methods have advanced lesion segmentation,
they primarily target large lesions and neglect valuable longitudinal and
clinical information routinely used by radiologists. In real-world screening,
detecting subtle or emerging lesions requires radiologists to compare across
timepoints and consider previous radiology assessments, such as the BI-RADS
score. We propose LesiOnTime, a novel 3D segmentation approach that mimics
clinical diagnostic workflows by jointly leveraging longitudinal imaging and
BIRADS scores. The key components are: (1) a Temporal Prior Attention (TPA)
block that dynamically integrates information from previous and current scans;
and (2) a BI-RADS Consistency Regularization (BCR) loss that enforces latent
space alignment for scans with similar radiological assessments, thus embedding
domain knowledge into the training process. Evaluated on a curated in-house
longitudinal dataset of high-risk patients with DCE-MRI, our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art single-timepoint and longitudinal baselines by 5%
in terms of Dice. Ablation studies demonstrate that both TPA and BCR contribute
complementary performance gains. These results highlight the importance of
incorporating temporal and clinical context for reliable early lesion
segmentation in real-world breast cancer screening. Our code is publicly

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sortblock是一种无需训练的推理加速框架，通过动态缓存块级特征和选择性跳过冗余计算，显著提升Diffusion Transformers的推理速度，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Transformers（DiTs）在生成任务中表现优异，但其顺序去噪过程导致高推理延迟，限制了实时应用。现有方法未能充分利用去噪阶段和Transformer块之间的语义变化。

Method: 提出Sortblock框架，动态缓存相邻时间步的块级特征，通过残差演化排序自适应确定重计算比例，并结合轻量级线性预测机制减少误差。

Result: 实验表明，Sortblock在多种任务和DiT架构中实现了超过2倍的推理加速，且输出质量下降极小。

Conclusion: Sortblock为扩散生成模型提供了一种高效且通用的加速解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated remarkable generative
capabilities, particularly benefiting from Transformer architectures that
enhance visual and artistic fidelity. However, their inherently sequential
denoising process results in high inference latency, limiting their deployment
in real-time scenarios. Existing training-free acceleration approaches
typically reuse intermediate features at fixed timesteps or layers, overlooking
the evolving semantic focus across denoising stages and Transformer blocks.To
address this, we propose Sortblock, a training-free inference acceleration
framework that dynamically caches block-wise features based on their similarity
across adjacent timesteps. By ranking the evolution of residuals, Sortblock
adaptively determines a recomputation ratio, selectively skipping redundant
computations while preserving generation quality. Furthermore, we incorporate a
lightweight linear prediction mechanism to reduce accumulated errors in skipped
blocks.Extensive experiments across various tasks and DiT architectures
demonstrate that Sortblock achieves over 2$\times$ inference speedup with
minimal degradation in output quality, offering an effective and generalizable
solution for accelerating diffusion-based generative models.

TL;DR: Wukong是一个基于Transformer的NSFW检测框架，利用扩散模型早期去噪步骤的中间输出和预训练的U-Net交叉注意力参数，显著优于文本过滤器，并与图像过滤器精度相当，同时效率更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有外部保护措施（文本过滤器和图像过滤器）存在局限性：前者易受对抗攻击，后者计算成本高且延迟大。因此，需要一种高效且准确的NSFW内容检测方法。

Method: 提出Wukong框架，利用扩散模型早期去噪步骤的中间输出和U-Net的预训练交叉注意力参数，在图像生成过程中实现早期检测。

Result: Wukong在性能上显著优于文本过滤器，与图像过滤器精度相当，同时效率更高。

Conclusion: Wukong为T2I生成提供了一种高效、准确的NSFW检测解决方案，结合了文本和图像过滤器的优点。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation is a popular AI-generated content (AIGC)
technology enabling diverse and creative image synthesis. However, some outputs
may contain Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content (e.g., violence), violating
community guidelines. Detecting NSFW content efficiently and accurately, known
as external safeguarding, is essential. Existing external safeguards fall into
two types: text filters, which analyze user prompts but overlook T2I
model-specific variations and are prone to adversarial attacks; and image
filters, which analyze final generated images but are computationally costly
and introduce latency. Diffusion models, the foundation of modern T2I systems
like Stable Diffusion, generate images through iterative denoising using a
U-Net architecture with ResNet and Transformer blocks. We observe that: (1)
early denoising steps define the semantic layout of the image, and (2)
cross-attention layers in U-Net are crucial for aligning text and image
regions. Based on these insights, we propose Wukong, a transformer-based NSFW
detection framework that leverages intermediate outputs from early denoising
steps and reuses U-Net's pre-trained cross-attention parameters. Wukong
operates within the diffusion process, enabling early detection without waiting
for full image generation. We also introduce a new dataset containing prompts,
seeds, and image-specific NSFW labels, and evaluate Wukong on this and two
public benchmarks. Results show that Wukong significantly outperforms
text-based safeguards and achieves comparable accuracy of image filters, while
offering much greater efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种视频外绘方法，通过改进判别器设计和损失函数，解决了现有方法在视频外绘中生成模糊结果的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频外绘需要扩展边界并保持内容一致性，但现有方法直接应用或微调修复模型效果不佳。

Method: 提出分层判别器，区分全局和局部对抗训练目标，并设计专用外绘损失函数。

Result: 方法在定量和定性上均优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 通过改进判别器和损失函数，实现了视觉吸引力和全局一致性的视频外绘。

Abstract: Video outpainting presents a unique challenge of extending the borders while
maintaining consistency with the given content. In this paper, we suggest the
use of video inpainting models that excel in object flow learning and
reconstruction in outpainting rather than solely generating the background as
in existing methods. However, directly applying or fine-tuning inpainting
models to outpainting has shown to be ineffective, often leading to blurry
results. Our extensive experiments on discriminator designs reveal that a
critical component missing in the outpainting fine-tuning process is a
discriminator capable of effectively assessing the perceptual quality of the
extended areas. To tackle this limitation, we differentiate the objectives of
adversarial training into global and local goals and introduce a hierarchical
discriminator that meets both objectives. Additionally, we develop a
specialized outpainting loss function that leverages both local and global
features of the discriminator. Fine-tuning on this adversarial loss function
enhances the generator's ability to produce both visually appealing and
globally coherent outpainted scenes. Our proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Supplementary
materials including the demo video and the code are available in SigPort.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了首个基于Mamba的水下实例分割模型UIS-Mamba，通过动态树扫描（DTS）和隐藏状态弱化（HSW）模块解决水下场景的特殊挑战，实现了高性能和低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下实例分割任务面临颜色失真和模糊边界等挑战，现有固定补丁扫描机制难以保持实例连续性，复杂背景也会干扰实例理解。

Method: 设计了DTS模块（动态偏移和缩放补丁以保持特征连续性）和HSW模块（基于Ncut的隐藏状态弱化机制抑制背景干扰）。

Result: 在UIIS和USIS10K数据集上达到最先进性能，同时保持低参数和计算复杂度。

Conclusion: UIS-Mamba成功将Mamba迁移至水下任务，解决了实例连续性和背景干扰问题，性能优越。

Abstract: Underwater Instance Segmentation (UIS) tasks are crucial for underwater
complex scene detection. Mamba, as an emerging state space model with
inherently linear complexity and global receptive fields, is highly suitable
for processing image segmentation tasks with long sequence features. However,
due to the particularity of underwater scenes, there are many challenges in
applying Mamba to UIS. The existing fixed-patch scanning mechanism cannot
maintain the internal continuity of scanned instances in the presence of
severely underwater color distortion and blurred instance boundaries, and the
hidden state of the complex underwater background can also inhibit the
understanding of instance objects. In this work, we propose the first
Mamba-based underwater instance segmentation model UIS-Mamba, and design two
innovative modules, Dynamic Tree Scan (DTS) and Hidden State Weaken (HSW), to
migrate Mamba to the underwater task. DTS module maintains the continuity of
the internal features of the instance objects by allowing the patches to
dynamically offset and scale, thereby guiding the minimum spanning tree and
providing dynamic local receptive fields. HSW module suppresses the
interference of complex backgrounds and effectively focuses the information
flow of state propagation to the instances themselves through the Ncut-based
hidden state weakening mechanism. Experimental results show that UIS-Mamba
achieves state-of-the-art performance on both UIIS and USIS10K datasets, while
maintaining a low number of parameters and computational complexity. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成视频技术（如Sora）的发展，公众对合成内容传播的担忧增加，但现有检测方法对时间伪影的探索不足。

Method: 通过牛顿力学下的二阶动力学分析建立理论框架，并设计针对时间伪影检测的二阶中心差分特征，提出D3方法。

Result: 在4个开源数据集上验证，D3显著优于现有方法（如GenVideo上提升10.39%），且计算高效、鲁棒性强。

Conclusion: D3通过二阶时间差异有效区分真实与AI生成视频，为合成内容检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: The evolution of video generation techniques, such as Sora, has made it
increasingly easy to produce high-fidelity AI-generated videos, raising public
concern over the dissemination of synthetic content. However, existing
detection methodologies remain limited by their insufficient exploration of
temporal artifacts in synthetic videos. To bridge this gap, we establish a
theoretical framework through second-order dynamical analysis under Newtonian
mechanics, subsequently extending the Second-order Central Difference features
tailored for temporal artifact detection. Building on this theoretical
foundation, we reveal a fundamental divergence in second-order feature
distributions between real and AI-generated videos. Concretely, we propose
Detection by Difference of Differences (D3), a novel training-free detection
method that leverages the above second-order temporal discrepancies. We
validate the superiority of our D3 on 4 open-source datasets (Gen-Video,
VideoPhy, EvalCrafter, VidProM), 40 subsets in total. For example, on GenVideo,
D3 outperforms the previous best method by 10.39% (absolute) mean Average
Precision. Additional experiments on time cost and post-processing operations
demonstrate D3's exceptional computational efficiency and strong robust
performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/Zig-HS/D3.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有交互式抠图方法在提取边缘区域的细粒度细节方面表现不足，而扩散模型因其强大的数据分布建模能力和文本驱动交互能力，成为解决这一问题的理想选择。

Method: SDMatte利用扩散模型的先验知识，将文本驱动交互能力转化为视觉提示驱动交互能力，并引入坐标嵌入和遮罩自注意力机制，增强模型对空间位置和透明度信息的敏感性。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，SDMatte在交互式抠图中表现出色，尤其在边缘细节提取方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SDMatte通过扩散模型和创新的交互机制，显著提升了交互式抠图的性能，为细粒度细节提取提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent interactive matting methods have shown satisfactory performance in
capturing the primary regions of objects, but they fall short in extracting
fine-grained details in edge regions. Diffusion models trained on billions of
image-text pairs, demonstrate exceptional capability in modeling highly complex
data distributions and synthesizing realistic texture details, while exhibiting
robust text-driven interaction capabilities, making them an attractive solution
for interactive matting. To this end, we propose SDMatte, a diffusion-driven
interactive matting model, with three key contributions. First, we exploit the
powerful priors of diffusion models and transform the text-driven interaction
capability into visual prompt-driven interaction capability to enable
interactive matting. Second, we integrate coordinate embeddings of visual
prompts and opacity embeddings of target objects into U-Net, enhancing
SDMatte's sensitivity to spatial position information and opacity information.
Third, we propose a masked self-attention mechanism that enables the model to
focus on areas specified by visual prompts, leading to better performance.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superior performance
of our method, validating its effectiveness in interactive matting. Our code
and model are available at https://github.com/vivoCameraResearch/SDMatte.

TL;DR: AutoDebias是一个自动识别和减轻文本到图像模型中社会偏见的框架，无需预先了解具体偏见类型，通过生成包容性提示和CLIP引导训练实现公平输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像模型常表现出未提及的社会偏见（如性别或种族刻板印象），现有方法难以处理复杂或重叠的偏见。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型检测偏见模式，生成包容性提示作为公平引导，通过CLIP引导训练减少偏见。

Result: 在25种偏见场景中，AutoDebias准确检测偏见达91.6%，将偏见输出从90%降至可忽略水平，同时保持图像质量。

Conclusion: AutoDebias能有效处理复杂偏见，显著减少偏见输出且不影响模型性能。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models generate high-quality images from text prompts but
often exhibit unintended social biases, such as gender or racial stereotypes,
even when these attributes are not mentioned. Existing debiasing methods work
well for simple or well-known cases but struggle with subtle or overlapping
biases. We propose AutoDebias, a framework that automatically identifies and
mitigates harmful biases in T2I models without prior knowledge of specific bias
types. Specifically, AutoDebias leverages vision-language models to detect
biased visual patterns and constructs fairness guides by generating inclusive
alternative prompts that reflect balanced representations. These guides drive a
CLIP-guided training process that promotes fairer outputs while preserving the
original model's image quality and diversity. Unlike existing methods,
AutoDebias effectively addresses both subtle stereotypes and multiple
interacting biases. We evaluate the framework on a benchmark covering over 25
bias scenarios, including challenging cases where multiple biases occur
simultaneously. AutoDebias detects harmful patterns with 91.6% accuracy and
reduces biased outputs from 90% to negligible levels, while preserving the
visual fidelity of the original model.

Motivation: 理解生物生长的时间动态在微生物学、农业和生物降解研究中至关重要，但现有视觉语言模型在捕捉时间进展方面效果有限。

Method: 提出CLIPTime框架，结合视觉-文本嵌入和时间感知推理，使用合成真菌生长数据集进行训练和评估，同时进行分类和回归任务。

Result: 实验表明，CLIPTime能有效建模生物生长过程，并生成可解释的时间相关输出。

Conclusion: CLIPTime展示了视觉语言模型在生物监测应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Understanding the temporal dynamics of biological growth is critical across
diverse fields such as microbiology, agriculture, and biodegradation research.
Although vision-language models like Contrastive Language Image Pretraining
(CLIP) have shown strong capabilities in joint visual-textual reasoning, their
effectiveness in capturing temporal progression remains limited. To address
this, we propose CLIPTime, a multimodal, multitask framework designed to
predict both the developmental stage and the corresponding timestamp of fungal
growth from image and text inputs. Built upon the CLIP architecture, our model
learns joint visual-textual embeddings and enables time-aware inference without
requiring explicit temporal input during testing. To facilitate training and
evaluation, we introduce a synthetic fungal growth dataset annotated with
aligned timestamps and categorical stage labels. CLIPTime jointly performs
classification and regression, predicting discrete growth stages alongside
continuous timestamps. We also propose custom evaluation metrics, including
temporal accuracy and regression error, to assess the precision of time-aware
predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that CLIPTime effectively models
biological progression and produces interpretable, temporally grounded outputs,
highlighting the potential of vision-language models in real-world biological
monitoring applications.

Motivation: 自我中心视频在增强现实和机器人等应用中日益重要，但现有研究主要集中在外部中心视频，自我中心视频的时空定位仍未被充分探索。

Method: 通过系统分析自我中心与外部中心视频的差异，提出EgoMask基准和自动标注流程，并构建大规模训练数据集EgoMask-Train。

Result: 实验显示，现有模型在EgoMask上表现较差，但通过EgoMask-Train微调后性能显著提升，且不影响外部中心数据集的表现。

Conclusion: 该研究为自我中心视频理解提供了关键资源和见解，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal video grounding aims to localize target entities in videos
based on textual queries. While existing research has made significant progress
in exocentric videos, the egocentric setting remains relatively underexplored,
despite its growing importance in applications such as augmented reality and
robotics. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of the discrepancies
between egocentric and exocentric videos, revealing key challenges such as
shorter object durations, sparser trajectories, smaller object sizes, and
larger positional shifts. To address these challenges, we introduce EgoMask,
the first pixel-level benchmark for fine-grained spatiotemporal grounding in
egocentric videos. It is constructed by our proposed automatic annotation
pipeline, which annotates referring expressions and object masks across short-,
medium-, and long-term videos. Additionally, we create EgoMask-Train, a
large-scale training dataset to facilitate model development. Experiments
demonstrate that the state-of-the-art spatiotemporal grounding models perform
poorly on our benchmark EgoMask, but fine-tuning on EgoMask-Train yields
significant improvements, while preserving performance on exocentric datasets.
Our work thus provides essential resources and insights for advancing
egocentric video understanding. Our code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多光谱和高光谱图像融合（MHIF）任务由于光谱和空间信息的固有权衡以及观测数据的有限性，本质上是病态的，现有方法未能有效解决数据不对齐问题。

Method: 提出 PIF-Net 框架，结合病态先验和可逆 Mamba 架构，设计 Fusion-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation 模块动态校准特征。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，PIF-Net 显著优于现有方法，同时保持模型高效性。

Conclusion: PIF-Net 通过创新的架构和模块设计，有效解决了 MHIF 的病态问题，提升了图像恢复性能。

Abstract: The goal of multispectral and hyperspectral image fusion (MHIF) is to
generate high-quality images that simultaneously possess rich spectral
information and fine spatial details. However, due to the inherent trade-off
between spectral and spatial information and the limited availability of
observations, this task is fundamentally ill-posed. Previous studies have not
effectively addressed the ill-posed nature caused by data misalignment. To
tackle this challenge, we propose a fusion framework named PIF-Net, which
explicitly incorporates ill-posed priors to effectively fuse multispectral
images and hyperspectral images. To balance global spectral modeling with
computational efficiency, we design a method based on an invertible Mamba
architecture that maintains information consistency during feature
transformation and fusion, ensuring stable gradient flow and process
reversibility. Furthermore, we introduce a novel fusion module called the
Fusion-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation module, which dynamically calibrates spectral
and spatial features while keeping the model lightweight. Extensive experiments
on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that PIF-Net achieves significantly
better image restoration performance than current state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining model efficiency.

Motivation: 自动驾驶系统需在安全关键场景中可靠运行，尤其是涉及易受伤害道路使用者（VRUs）的复杂行为。识别这些边缘案例对评估和泛化至关重要，但在大规模数据集中检索罕见行为具有挑战性。

Method: 结合SMPL运动序列和视频帧，编码到与自然语言对齐的多模态嵌入空间，支持通过文本查询检索人类行为及其上下文。

Result: 在WayMoCo数据集上，方法在运动-上下文检索任务中比现有最优模型准确率提高27.5%。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为自动驾驶系统提供了高效的人类行为检索工具，支持多样化的安全评估。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems must operate reliably in safety-critical
scenarios, particularly those involving unusual or complex behavior by
Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs). Identifying these edge cases in driving datasets
is essential for robust evaluation and generalization, but retrieving such rare
human behavior scenarios within the long tail of large-scale datasets is
challenging. To support targeted evaluation of autonomous driving systems in
diverse, human-centered scenarios, we propose a novel context-aware motion
retrieval framework. Our method combines Skinned Multi-Person Linear
(SMPL)-based motion sequences and corresponding video frames before encoding
them into a shared multimodal embedding space aligned with natural language.
Our approach enables the scalable retrieval of human behavior and their context
through text queries. This work also introduces our dataset WayMoCo, an
extension of the Waymo Open Dataset. It contains automatically labeled motion
and scene context descriptions derived from generated pseudo-ground-truth SMPL
sequences and corresponding image data. Our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models by up to 27.5% accuracy in motion-context retrieval,
when evaluated on the WayMoCo dataset.

Conclusion: SeTe-VSR在复杂视频超分辨率任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Recent advancements in video super-resolution (VSR) models have demonstrated
impressive results in enhancing low-resolution videos. However, due to
limitations in adequately controlling the generation process, achieving high
fidelity alignment with the low-resolution input while maintaining temporal
consistency across frames remains a significant challenge. In this work, we
propose Semantic and Temporal Guided Video Super-Resolution (SeTe-VSR), a novel
approach that incorporates both semantic and temporal-spatio guidance in the
latent diffusion space to address these challenges. By incorporating high-level
semantic information and integrating spatial and temporal information, our
approach achieves a seamless balance between recovering intricate details and
ensuring temporal coherence. Our method not only preserves high-reality visual
content but also significantly enhances fidelity. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SeTe-VSR outperforms existing methods in terms of detail
recovery and perceptual quality, highlighting its effectiveness for complex

Abstract: Photorealistic talking-head avatars are becoming increasingly common in
virtual meetings, gaming, and social platforms. These avatars allow for more
immersive communication, but they also introduce serious security risks. One
emerging threat is impersonation: an attacker can steal a user's
avatar-preserving their appearance and voice-making it nearly impossible to
detect its fraudulent usage by sight or sound alone. In this paper, we explore
the challenge of biometric verification in such avatar-mediated scenarios. Our
main question is whether an individual's facial motion patterns can serve as
reliable behavioral biometrics to verify their identity when the avatar's
visual appearance is a facsimile of its owner. To answer this question, we
introduce a new dataset of realistic avatar videos created using a
state-of-the-art one-shot avatar generation model, GAGAvatar, with genuine and
impostor avatar videos. We also propose a lightweight, explainable
spatio-temporal Graph Convolutional Network architecture with temporal
attention pooling, that uses only facial landmarks to model dynamic facial
gestures. Experimental results demonstrate that facial motion cues enable
meaningful identity verification with AUC values approaching 80%. The proposed
benchmark and biometric system are available for the research community in
order to bring attention to the urgent need for more advanced behavioral
biometric defenses in avatar-based communication systems.

### [61] [HyPCV-Former: Hyperbolic Spatio-Temporal Transformer for 3D Point Cloud Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00473)
*Jiaping Cao,Kangkang Zhou,Juan Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于双曲时空变换器（HyPCV-Former）的视频异常检测方法，通过将点云视频嵌入双曲空间并利用双曲自注意力机制，显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在RGB或深度域中使用欧几里得表示，难以捕捉事件的层次结构和时空连续性。

Method: 首先从点云序列中提取每帧的空间特征，并将其嵌入洛伦兹双曲空间；引入双曲多头自注意力机制（HMHA）建模时间动态。

Result: 在TIMo和DAD数据集上分别实现了7%和5.6%的性能提升，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: HyPCV-Former通过双曲空间直接建模特征和异常评分，显著提升了视频异常检测的性能。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection is a fundamental task in video surveillance, with
broad applications in public safety and intelligent monitoring systems.
Although previous methods leverage Euclidean representations in RGB or depth
domains, such embeddings are inherently limited in capturing hierarchical event
structures and spatio-temporal continuity. To address these limitations, we
propose HyPCV-Former, a novel hyperbolic spatio-temporal transformer for
anomaly detection in 3D point cloud videos. Our approach first extracts
per-frame spatial features from point cloud sequences via point cloud
extractor, and then embeds them into Lorentzian hyperbolic space, which better
captures the latent hierarchical structure of events. To model temporal
dynamics, we introduce a hyperbolic multi-head self-attention (HMHA) mechanism
that leverages Lorentzian inner products and curvature-aware softmax to learn
temporal dependencies under non-Euclidean geometry. Our method performs all
feature transformations and anomaly scoring directly within full Lorentzian
space rather than via tangent space approximation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that HyPCV-Former achieves state-of-the-art performance across
multiple anomaly categories, with a 7\% improvement on the TIMo dataset and a
5.6\% gain on the DAD dataset compared to benchmarks. The code will be released
upon paper acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LAMIC是一个无需训练的布局感知多图像合成框架，通过两种注意力机制（GIA和RMA）实现多参考场景下的图像生成，并在多个指标上达到最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多参考图像合成中布局一致性和背景一致性的挑战。

Method: 基于MMDiT模型，引入GIA和RMA两种注意力机制，无需训练即可扩展单参考扩散模型到多参考场景。

Result: LAMIC在ID-S、BG-S、IN-R和AVG等指标上优于现有基线，展示了零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: LAMIC为可控多图像合成提供了一种无需训练的新范式，具有强大的零样本泛化能力。

Abstract: In controllable image synthesis, generating coherent and consistent images
from multiple references with spatial layout awareness remains an open
challenge. We present LAMIC, a Layout-Aware Multi-Image Composition framework
that, for the first time, extends single-reference diffusion models to
multi-reference scenarios in a training-free manner. Built upon the MMDiT
model, LAMIC introduces two plug-and-play attention mechanisms: 1) Group
Isolation Attention (GIA) to enhance entity disentanglement; and 2)
Region-Modulated Attention (RMA) to enable layout-aware generation. To
comprehensively evaluate model capabilities, we further introduce three
metrics: 1) Inclusion Ratio (IN-R) and Fill Ratio (FI-R) for assessing layout
control; and 2) Background Similarity (BG-S) for measuring background
consistency. Extensive experiments show that LAMIC achieves state-of-the-art
performance across most major metrics: it consistently outperforms existing
multi-reference baselines in ID-S, BG-S, IN-R and AVG scores across all
settings, and achieves the best DPG in complex composition tasks. These results
demonstrate LAMIC's superior abilities in identity keeping, background
preservation, layout control, and prompt-following, all achieved without any
training or fine-tuning, showcasing strong zero-shot generalization ability. By
inheriting the strengths of advanced single-reference models and enabling
seamless extension to multi-image scenarios, LAMIC establishes a new
training-free paradigm for controllable multi-image composition. As foundation
models continue to evolve, LAMIC's performance is expected to scale
accordingly. Our implementation is available at:

Motivation: 解决医学图像转换中分布外样本导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 引入重建模块量化域偏移，动态适应块选择性调整预训练模型特征。

Result: 在低剂量CT去噪和T1到T2 MRI转换任务中表现优于基线模型和现有TTA方法。

Conclusion: 动态样本特定调整是提升模型在真实场景中适应性的有效途径。

Abstract: Image-to-image translation has emerged as a powerful technique in medical
imaging, enabling tasks such as image denoising and cross-modality conversion.
However, it suffers from limitations in handling out-of-distribution samples
without causing performance degradation. To address this limitation, we propose
a novel Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) framework that dynamically adjusts the
translation process based on the characteristics of each test sample. Our
method introduces a Reconstruction Module to quantify the domain shift and a
Dynamic Adaptation Block that selectively modifies the internal features of a
pretrained translation model to mitigate the shift without compromising the
performance on in-distribution samples that do not require adaptation. We
evaluate our approach on two medical image-to-image translation tasks: low-dose
CT denoising and T1 to T2 MRI translation, showing consistent improvements over
both the baseline translation model without TTA and prior TTA methods. Our
analysis highlights the limitations of the state-of-the-art that uniformly
apply the adaptation to both out-of-distribution and in-distribution samples,
demonstrating that dynamic, sample-specific adjustment offers a promising path
to improve model resilience in real-world scenarios. The code is available at:

achieves up to +3.8% higher Dice scores compared to RGB-only models and up to

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于无监督学习的遥感图像标注方法，结合卷积神经网络和图神经网络，提升标注的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像标注通常依赖专家分析，耗时且成本高。现有方法需要预标注数据进行训练，限制了其应用范围。

Result: 减少了标注中的异常值，支持细粒度标注，并在编码空间中形成旋转不变的语义关系。

Conclusion: 该方法无需预标注数据，提高了遥感图像标注的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Machine learning for remote sensing imaging relies on up-to-date and accurate
labels for model training and testing. Labelling remote sensing imagery is time
and cost intensive, requiring expert analysis. Previous labelling tools rely on
pre-labelled data for training in order to label new unseen data. In this work,
we define an unsupervised pipeline for finding and labelling geographical areas
of similar context and content within Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Our
approach removes limitations of previous methods by utilising segmentation with
convolutional and graph neural networks to encode a more robust feature space
for image comparison. Unlike previous approaches we segment the image into
homogeneous regions of pixels that are grouped based on colour and spatial
similarity. Graph neural networks are used to aggregate information about the
surrounding segments enabling the feature representation to encode the local
neighbourhood whilst preserving its own local information. This reduces
outliers in the labelling tool, allows users to label at a granular level, and
allows a rotationally invariant semantic relationship at the image level to be
formed within the encoding space.

TL;DR: EPANet是一种高效的水下鱼类检测网络，通过特征聚合和多尺度瓶颈结构提升检测精度和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下鱼类检测面临分辨率低、背景干扰大和目标相似性高的挑战，现有方法通常复杂且效率低。

Method: EPANet包含EPA-FPN和MS-DDSP瓶颈，前者通过长距离跳跃连接增强特征互补性，后者通过多尺度细粒度特征划分提升局部特征多样性。

Result: 在基准数据集上，EPANet在检测精度和推理速度上优于现有方法，且参数复杂度相当或更低。

Conclusion: EPANet为水下鱼类检测提供了一种高效且轻量化的解决方案。

Abstract: Underwater fish detection (UFD) remains a challenging task in computer vision
due to low object resolution, significant background interference, and high
visual similarity between targets and surroundings. Existing approaches
primarily focus on local feature enhancement or incorporate complex attention
mechanisms to highlight small objects, often at the cost of increased model
complexity and reduced efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose an
efficient path aggregation network (EPANet), which leverages complementary
feature integration to achieve accurate and lightweight UFD. EPANet consists of
two key components: an efficient path aggregation feature pyramid network
(EPA-FPN) and a multi-scale diverse-division short path bottleneck (MS-DDSP
bottleneck). The EPA-FPN introduces long-range skip connections across
disparate scales to improve semantic-spatial complementarity, while cross-layer
fusion paths are adopted to enhance feature integration efficiency. The MS-DDSP
bottleneck extends the conventional bottleneck structure by introducing
finer-grained feature division and diverse convolutional operations, thereby
increasing local feature diversity and representation capacity. Extensive
experiments on benchmark UFD datasets demonstrate that EPANet outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and inference speed,
while maintaining comparable or even lower parameter complexity.

<details>

Motivation: 视频色彩分级通常需要专业技能，本文旨在简化这一过程，使其更易于非专业人士使用。

Method: 使用扩散模型生成LUT，对齐参考场景与输入视频的色彩属性，并通过文本提示增强低层次特征。

Result: 实验和用户研究表明，该方法能有效进行视频色彩分级，且不损失结构细节。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在视频色彩分级中表现出色，代码已开源。

Abstract: Different from color correction and transfer, color grading involves
adjusting colors for artistic or storytelling purposes in a video, which is
used to establish a specific look or mood. However, due to the complexity of
the process and the need for specialized editing skills, video color grading
remains primarily the domain of professional colorists. In this paper, we
present a reference-based video color grading framework. Our key idea is
explicitly generating a look-up table (LUT) for color attribute alignment
between reference scenes and input video via a diffusion model. As a training
objective, we enforce that high-level features of the reference scenes like
look, mood, and emotion should be similar to that of the input video. Our
LUT-based approach allows for color grading without any loss of structural
details in the whole video frames as well as achieving fast inference. We
further build a pipeline to incorporate a user-preference via text prompts for
low-level feature enhancement such as contrast and brightness, etc.
Experimental results, including extensive user studies, demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach for video color grading. Codes are publicly
available at https://github.com/seunghyuns98/VideoColorGrading.

Motivation: 临床决策需要准确理解解剖结构的相对位置，但现有视觉语言模型在此任务上表现不足。

Method: 评估了GPT-4o、Llama3.2等模型，并尝试使用视觉提示（如标记）提升性能。

Result: 模型在医学图像上的表现显著低于自然图像，且依赖先验知识而非图像内容。

Conclusion: 提出了MIRP基准数据集，以促进医学图像相对定位能力的进一步研究。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making relies heavily on understanding relative positions
of anatomical structures and anomalies. Therefore, for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) to be applicable in clinical practice, the ability to accurately
determine relative positions on medical images is a fundamental prerequisite.
Despite its importance, this capability remains highly underexplored. To
address this gap, we evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art VLMs, GPT-4o,
Llama3.2, Pixtral, and JanusPro, and find that all models fail at this
fundamental task. Inspired by successful approaches in computer vision, we
investigate whether visual prompts, such as alphanumeric or colored markers
placed on anatomical structures, can enhance performance. While these markers
provide moderate improvements, results remain significantly lower on medical
images compared to observations made on natural images. Our evaluations suggest
that, in medical imaging, VLMs rely more on prior anatomical knowledge than on
actual image content for answering relative position questions, often leading
to incorrect conclusions. To facilitate further research in this area, we
introduce the MIRP , Medical Imaging Relative Positioning, benchmark dataset,
designed to systematically evaluate the capability to identify relative
positions in medical images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络易受对抗扰动攻击，现有扩散净化方法效率低，难以实际应用。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现SOTA鲁棒精度和图像质量，推理时间约0.2秒。

Conclusion: DBLP为实时对抗净化迈出重要一步。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep neural networks (DNNs) have led to remarkable success
across a wide range of tasks. However, their susceptibility to adversarial
perturbations remains a critical vulnerability. Existing diffusion-based
adversarial purification methods often require intensive iterative denoising,
severely limiting their practical deployment. In this paper, we propose
Diffusion Bridge Distillation for Purification (DBLP), a novel and efficient
diffusion-based framework for adversarial purification. Central to our approach
is a new objective, noise bridge distillation, which constructs a principled
alignment between the adversarial noise distribution and the clean data
distribution within a latent consistency model (LCM). To further enhance
semantic fidelity, we introduce adaptive semantic enhancement, which fuses
multi-scale pyramid edge maps as conditioning input to guide the purification
process. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that DBLP
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) robust accuracy, superior image quality, and
around 0.2s inference time, marking a significant step toward real-time
adversarial purification.

TL;DR: HiPrune是一种无需训练、模型无关的视觉令牌修剪框架，通过利用视觉编码器中的分层注意力结构，显著提升推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型（VLMs）中视觉令牌序列过长导致的计算开销大和推理效率低的问题。

Method: 基于分层注意力结构选择三种信息丰富的令牌：锚点令牌（对象中心层高注意力）、缓冲令牌（空间连续性）和注册令牌（全局上下文）。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5等模型上，HiPrune仅用33.3%令牌保留99.3%任务精度，减少9倍FLOPs和延迟。

Conclusion: HiPrune是一种高效、通用的修剪方法，适用于多种ViT-based VLM，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) encode images into lengthy sequences of visual
tokens, leading to excessive computational overhead and limited inference
efficiency. While prior efforts prune or merge tokens to address this issue,
they often rely on special tokens (e.g., CLS) or require task-specific
training, hindering scalability across architectures. In this paper, we propose
HiPrune, a training-free and model-agnostic token Pruning framework that
exploits the Hierarchical attention structure within vision encoders. We
identify that middle layers attend to object-centric regions, while deep layers
capture global contextual features. Based on this observation, HiPrune selects
three types of informative tokens: (1) Anchor tokens with high attention in
object-centric layers, (2) Buffer tokens adjacent to anchors for spatial
continuity, and (3) Register tokens with strong attention in deep layers for
global summarization. Our method requires no retraining and integrates
seamlessly with any ViT-based VLM. Extensive experiments on LLaVA-1.5,
LLaVA-NeXT, and Qwen2.5-VL demonstrate that HiPrune achieves state-of-the-art
pruning performance, preserving up to 99.3% task accuracy with only 33.3%
tokens, and maintaining 99.5% accuracy with just 11.1% tokens. Meanwhile, it
reduces inference FLOPs and latency by up to 9$\times$, showcasing strong
generalization across models and tasks. Code is available at

Result: 在八个基准测试中验证，FreeCP作为即插即用模块，显著提升了分割性能。

Conclusion: FreeCP有效解决了开放词汇语义分割中的关键挑战，为训练免费方法提供了新思路。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained vision-language models has emerged as a powerful
approach for enhancing open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS). However,
the substantial computational and resource demands associated with training on
large datasets have prompted interest in training-free methods for OVSS.
Existing training-free approaches primarily focus on modifying model
architectures and generating prototypes to improve segmentation performance.
However, they often neglect the challenges posed by class redundancy, where
multiple categories are not present in the current test image, and
visual-language ambiguity, where semantic similarities among categories create
confusion in class activation. These issues can lead to suboptimal class
activation maps and affinity-refined activation maps. Motivated by these
observations, we propose FreeCP, a novel training-free class purification
framework designed to address these challenges. FreeCP focuses on purifying
semantic categories and rectifying errors caused by redundancy and ambiguity.
The purified class representations are then leveraged to produce final
segmentation predictions. We conduct extensive experiments across eight
benchmarks to validate FreeCP's effectiveness. Results demonstrate that FreeCP,
as a plug-and-play module, significantly boosts segmentation performance when
combined with other OVSS methods.

Conclusion: PhysNAP能有效提升铰接物体生成的物理合理性和对齐效果，为生成能力与约束一致性提供平衡。

Abstract: Articulated objects are an important type of interactable objects in everyday
environments. In this paper, we propose PhysNAP, a novel diffusion model-based
approach for generating articulated objects that aligns them with partial point
clouds and improves their physical plausibility. The model represents part
shapes by signed distance functions (SDFs). We guide the reverse diffusion
process using a point cloud alignment loss computed using the predicted SDFs.
Additionally, we impose non-penetration and mobility constraints based on the
part SDFs for guiding the model to generate more physically plausible objects.
We also make our diffusion approach category-aware to further improve point
cloud alignment if category information is available. We evaluate the
generative ability and constraint consistency of samples generated with PhysNAP
using the PartNet-Mobility dataset. We also compare it with an unguided
baseline diffusion model and demonstrate that PhysNAP can improve constraint
consistency and provides a tradeoff with generative ability.

Result: 伪标签方法在标注时间有限的情况下，优于其他弱标注方法甚至真实标注。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低标注成本，同时保持高性能，适用于标注资源有限的场景。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art methods for object detection rely on annotated
bounding boxes of large data sets for training. However, obtaining such
annotations is expensive and can require up to hundreds of hours of manual
labor. This poses a challenge, especially since such annotations can only be
provided by experts, as they require knowledge about the scientific domain. To
tackle this challenge, we propose a domain-specific weakly supervised object
detection algorithm that only relies on image-level annotations, which are
significantly easier to acquire. Our method distills the knowledge of a
pre-trained model, on the task of predicting the presence or absence of a virus
in an image, to obtain a set of pseudo-labels that can be used to later train a
state-of-the-art object detection model. To do so, we use an optimization
approach with a shrinking receptive field to extract virus particles directly
without specific network architectures. Through a set of extensive studies, we
show how the proposed pseudo-labels are easier to obtain, and, more
importantly, are able to outperform other existing weak labeling methods, and
even ground truth labels, in cases where the time to obtain the annotation is
limited.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合跨帧不确定性传播的视觉里程计方法CoProU-VO，显著提升了动态场景下的姿态估计性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态物体破坏了静态场景假设，导致传统无监督视觉里程计方法在姿态估计中表现不佳。

Method: 通过结合目标帧和参考帧的不确定性，提出CoProU-VO方法，利用概率公式和视觉Transformer架构，同时学习深度、不确定性估计和相机姿态。

Result: 在KITTI和nuScenes数据集上表现优于现有方法，尤其在高速公路场景中效果显著。

Conclusion: 跨帧不确定性传播是提升动态场景下视觉里程计性能的有效策略。

Abstract: Visual Odometry (VO) is fundamental to autonomous navigation, robotics, and
augmented reality, with unsupervised approaches eliminating the need for
expensive ground-truth labels. However, these methods struggle when dynamic
objects violate the static scene assumption, leading to erroneous pose
estimations. We tackle this problem by uncertainty modeling, which is a
commonly used technique that creates robust masks to filter out dynamic objects
and occlusions without requiring explicit motion segmentation. Traditional
uncertainty modeling considers only single-frame information, overlooking the
uncertainties across consecutive frames. Our key insight is that uncertainty
must be propagated and combined across temporal frames to effectively identify
unreliable regions, particularly in dynamic scenes. To address this challenge,
we introduce Combined Projected Uncertainty VO (CoProU-VO), a novel end-to-end
approach that combines target frame uncertainty with projected reference frame
uncertainty using a principled probabilistic formulation. Built upon vision
transformer backbones, our model simultaneously learns depth, uncertainty
estimation, and camera poses. Consequently, experiments on the KITTI and
nuScenes datasets demonstrate significant improvements over previous
unsupervised monocular end-to-end two-frame-based methods and exhibit strong
performance in challenging highway scenes where other approaches often fail.
Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of
cross-frame uncertainty propagation.

Result: 在五个基准数据集上，误报率最低（2.5%），平均精度高（90.91%），计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模不确定性，有效提升了未知对象的检测性能。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation models trained on known object classes often fail in
real-world autonomous driving scenarios by confidently misclassifying unknown
objects. While pixel-wise out-of-distribution detection can identify unknown
objects, existing methods struggle in complex scenes where rare object classes
are often confused with truly unknown objects. We introduce an
uncertainty-aware likelihood ratio estimation method that addresses these
limitations. Our approach uses an evidential classifier within a likelihood
ratio test to distinguish between known and unknown pixel features from a
semantic segmentation model, while explicitly accounting for uncertainty.
Instead of producing point estimates, our method outputs probability
distributions that capture uncertainty from both rare training examples and
imperfect synthetic outliers. We show that by incorporating uncertainty in this
way, outlier exposure can be leveraged more effectively. Evaluated on five
standard benchmark datasets, our method achieves the lowest average false
positive rate (2.5%) among state-of-the-art while maintaining high average
precision (90.91%) and incurring only negligible computational overhead. Code

### [76] [A Novel Modeling Framework and Data Product for Extended VIIRS-like Artificial Nighttime Light Image Reconstruction (1986-2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00590)
*Yihe Tian,Kwan Man Cheng,Zhengbo Zhang,Tao Zhang,Suju Li,Dongmei Yan,Bing Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的重建框架EVAL，用于扩展VIIRS夜间灯光数据的时间序列，解决了现有方法低估光强度和结构遗漏的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VIIRS夜间灯光数据始于2012年，限制了长期时间序列研究，且当前扩展方法存在光强度低估和结构遗漏的不足。

Method: 采用两阶段重建框架：构建阶段使用分层融合解码器（HFD）提高初始重建保真度；细化阶段利用双特征细化器（DFR）结合高分辨率不透水面掩模增强细节。

Result: 开发的EVAL产品将数据记录扩展到1986年，R²从0.68提升至0.80，RMSE从1.27降至0.99，且具有良好时间一致性和社会经济参数相关性。

Conclusion: EVAL为研究社区提供了可靠的长期分析资源，显著优于现有产品。

Abstract: Artificial Night-Time Light (NTL) remote sensing is a vital proxy for
quantifying the intensity and spatial distribution of human activities.
Although the NPP-VIIRS sensor provides high-quality NTL observations, its
temporal coverage, which begins in 2012, restricts long-term time-series
studies that extend to earlier periods. Despite the progress in extending
VIIRS-like NTL time-series, current methods still suffer from two significant
shortcomings: the underestimation of light intensity and the structural
omission. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel reconstruction
framework consisting of a two-stage process: construction and refinement. The
construction stage features a Hierarchical Fusion Decoder (HFD) designed to
enhance the fidelity of the initial reconstruction. The refinement stage
employs a Dual Feature Refiner (DFR), which leverages high-resolution
impervious surface masks to guide and enhance fine-grained structural details.
Based on this framework, we developed the Extended VIIRS-like Artificial
Nighttime Light (EVAL) product for China, extending the standard data record
backwards by 26 years to begin in 1986. Quantitative evaluation shows that EVAL
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art products, boosting the
$\text{R}^2$ from 0.68 to 0.80 while lowering the RMSE from 1.27 to 0.99.
Furthermore, EVAL exhibits excellent temporal consistency and maintains a high
correlation with socioeconomic parameters, confirming its reliability for
long-term analysis. The resulting EVAL dataset provides a valuable new resource
for the research community and is publicly available at
https://doi.org/10.11888/HumanNat.tpdc.302930.

### [77] [GeoMoE: Divide-and-Conquer Motion Field Modeling with Mixture-of-Experts for Two-View Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00592)
*Jiajun Le,Jiayi Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoMoE提出了一种基于Mixture-of-Experts的框架，通过分解运动场为异质子场并针对性建模，提升了复杂场景下的运动场估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂场景中运动场的异质性导致现有方法难以准确建模，需要针对性策略。

Method: 采用Probabilistic Prior-Guided Decomposition分解运动场，并通过MoE-Enhanced Bi-Path Rectifier针对性建模子场。

Result: 在相对位姿和单应性估计任务中超越现有方法，并表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: GeoMoE通过简洁设计有效解决了异质运动场建模问题，为两视图几何提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent progress in two-view geometry increasingly emphasizes enforcing
smoothness and global consistency priors when estimating motion fields between
pairs of images. However, in complex real-world scenes, characterized by
extreme viewpoint and scale changes as well as pronounced depth
discontinuities, the motion field often exhibits diverse and heterogeneous
motion patterns. Most existing methods lack targeted modeling strategies and
fail to explicitly account for this variability, resulting in estimated motion
fields that diverge from their true underlying structure and distribution. We
observe that Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) can assign dedicated experts to motion
sub-fields, enabling a divide-and-conquer strategy for heterogeneous motion
patterns. Building on this insight, we re-architect motion field modeling in
two-view geometry with GeoMoE, a streamlined framework. Specifically, we first
devise a Probabilistic Prior-Guided Decomposition strategy that exploits inlier
probability signals to perform a structure-aware decomposition of the motion
field into heterogeneous sub-fields, sharply curbing outlier-induced bias.
Next, we introduce an MoE-Enhanced Bi-Path Rectifier that enhances each
sub-field along spatial-context and channel-semantic paths and routes it to a
customized expert for targeted modeling, thereby decoupling heterogeneous
motion regimes, suppressing cross-sub-field interference and representational
entanglement, and yielding fine-grained motion-field rectification. With this
minimalist design, GeoMoE outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in
relative pose and homography estimation and shows strong generalization. The
source code and pre-trained models are available at

TL;DR: DPoser-X是一种基于扩散的3D全身人体姿态先验模型，通过变分扩散采样解决姿态任务，并在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建一个通用且鲁棒的全身人体姿态先验模型具有挑战性，主要由于人体姿态的复杂性和高质量数据集的稀缺。

Method: 提出DPoser-X，采用扩散模型作为姿态先验，引入截断时间步调度和掩码训练机制，结合全身和局部数据集。

Result: 在身体、手部、面部和全身姿态建模的多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DPoser-X为全身人体姿态先验建模设立了新标准，展现了其鲁棒性和通用性。

Abstract: We present DPoser-X, a diffusion-based prior model for 3D whole-body human
poses. Building a versatile and robust full-body human pose prior remains
challenging due to the inherent complexity of articulated human poses and the
scarcity of high-quality whole-body pose datasets. To address these
limitations, we introduce a Diffusion model as body Pose prior (DPoser) and
extend it to DPoser-X for expressive whole-body human pose modeling. Our
approach unifies various pose-centric tasks as inverse problems, solving them
through variational diffusion sampling. To enhance performance on downstream
applications, we introduce a novel truncated timestep scheduling method
specifically designed for pose data characteristics. We also propose a masked
training mechanism that effectively combines whole-body and part-specific
datasets, enabling our model to capture interdependencies between body parts
while avoiding overfitting to specific actions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate DPoser-X's robustness and versatility across multiple benchmarks
for body, hand, face, and full-body pose modeling. Our model consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives, establishing a new benchmark for
whole-body human pose prior modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高医学图像诊断中分类模型的可解释性，增强临床医生的信任和使用体验，同时解决属性标注数据稀缺的问题。

Method: 采用扩散模型（Diffusion Model）进行属性条件生成，仅使用20个标注样本生成合成数据，并将其用于可解释模型的训练。

Result: 合成数据的加入显著提升了模型性能，属性预测准确率提高了13.4%，目标预测准确率提高了1.8%。

Conclusion: 合成数据能够有效克服数据集限制，提升可解释模型在医学图像分析中的实用性。

Abstract: Classification models that provide human-interpretable explanations enhance
clinicians' trust and usability in medical image diagnosis. One research focus
is the integration and prediction of pathology-related visual attributes used
by radiologists alongside the diagnosis, aligning AI decision-making with
clinical reasoning. Radiologists use attributes like shape and texture as
established diagnostic criteria and mirroring these in AI decision-making both
enhances transparency and enables explicit validation of model outputs.
However, the adoption of such models is limited by the scarcity of large-scale
medical image datasets annotated with these attributes. To address this
challenge, we propose synthesizing attribute-annotated data using a generative
model. We enhance the Diffusion Model with attribute conditioning and train it
using only 20 attribute-labeled lung nodule samples from the LIDC-IDRI dataset.
Incorporating its generated images into the training of an explainable model
boosts performance, increasing attribute prediction accuracy by 13.4% and
target prediction accuracy by 1.8% compared to training with only the small
real attribute-annotated dataset. This work highlights the potential of
synthetic data to overcome dataset limitations, enhancing the applicability of
explainable models in medical image analysis.

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个针对目标检测器补丁攻击的防御基准，包含多种攻击目标、攻击方式、检测器和评估指标，揭示了防御性能的新见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御评估缺乏统一和全面的框架，导致对当前方法的评估不一致且不完整。

Method: 重新评估11种代表性防御方法，构建大规模对抗补丁数据集，包含94种补丁和94,000张图像，使用4种多样化的评估指标。

Result: 研究发现：1）防御自然补丁的难点在于数据分布而非高频特征；2）攻击目标的平均精度与防御性能高度一致；3）自适应攻击能显著绕过现有防御。

Conclusion: 该研究为补丁攻击/防御的评估和设计提供了指导，并开源了代码和数据集。

Abstract: Developing reliable defenses against patch attacks on object detectors has
attracted increasing interest. However, we identify that existing defense
evaluations lack a unified and comprehensive framework, resulting in
inconsistent and incomplete assessments of current methods. To address this
issue, we revisit 11 representative defenses and present the first patch
defense benchmark, involving 2 attack goals, 13 patch attacks, 11 object
detectors, and 4 diverse metrics. This leads to the large-scale adversarial
patch dataset with 94 types of patches and 94,000 images. Our comprehensive
analyses reveal new insights: (1) The difficulty in defending against
naturalistic patches lies in the data distribution, rather than the commonly
believed high frequencies. Our new dataset with diverse patch distributions can
be used to improve existing defenses by 15.09% AP@0.5. (2) The average
precision of the attacked object, rather than the commonly pursued patch
detection accuracy, shows high consistency with defense performance. (3)
Adaptive attacks can substantially bypass existing defenses, and defenses with
complex/stochastic models or universal patch properties are relatively robust.
We hope that our analyses will serve as guidance on properly evaluating patch
attacks/defenses and advancing their design. Code and dataset are available at
https://github.com/Gandolfczjh/APDE, where we will keep integrating new
attacks/defenses.

Result: 实验验证了该方法在多个基准上的有效性和广泛适用性。

Conclusion: 预训练深度特征在图像去雾中具有显著潜力，RGB-D融合模块提升了方法的通用性和性能。

Abstract: Image dehazing remains a challenging problem due to the spatially varying
nature of haze in real-world scenes. While existing methods have demonstrated
the promise of large-scale pretrained models for image dehazing, their
architecture-specific designs hinder adaptability across diverse scenarios with
different accuracy and efficiency requirements. In this work, we systematically
investigate the generalization capability of pretrained depth
representations-learned from millions of diverse images-for image dehazing. Our
empirical analysis reveals that the learned deep depth features maintain
remarkable consistency across varying haze levels. Building on this insight, we
propose a plug-and-play RGB-D fusion module that seamlessly integrates with
diverse dehazing architectures. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks validate both the effectiveness and broad applicability of our
approach.

Result: 实验表明，该方法有效减少幻觉，提升多图像场景下的语义整合和推理稳定性。

Conclusion: 动态注意力平衡机制在多图像MLLM中显著减少幻觉，为未来研究提供新方向。

Abstract: Despite growing interest in hallucination in Multimodal Large Language
Models, existing studies primarily focus on single-image settings, leaving
hallucination in multi-image scenarios largely unexplored. To address this gap,
we conduct the first systematic study of hallucinations in multi-image MLLMs
and propose MIHBench, a benchmark specifically tailored for evaluating
object-related hallucinations across multiple images. MIHBench comprises three
core tasks: Multi-Image Object Existence Hallucination, Multi-Image Object
Count Hallucination, and Object Identity Consistency Hallucination, targeting
semantic understanding across object existence, quantity reasoning, and
cross-view identity consistency. Through extensive evaluation, we identify key
factors associated with the occurrence of multi-image hallucinations,
including: a progressive relationship between the number of image inputs and
the likelihood of hallucination occurrences; a strong correlation between
single-image hallucination tendencies and those observed in multi-image
contexts; and the influence of same-object image ratios and the positional
placement of negative samples within image sequences on the occurrence of
object identity consistency hallucination. To address these challenges, we
propose a Dynamic Attention Balancing mechanism that adjusts inter-image
attention distributions while preserving the overall visual attention
proportion. Experiments across multiple state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrate that
our method effectively reduces hallucination occurrences and enhances semantic
integration and reasoning stability in multi-image scenarios.

Result: 在广泛实验中，YOLO-Count实现了最先进的计数精度，并为文本到图像系统提供了有效的数量控制。

Conclusion: YOLO-Count在开放词汇计数和生成控制方面表现出色，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: We propose YOLO-Count, a differentiable open-vocabulary object counting model
that tackles both general counting challenges and enables precise quantity
control for text-to-image (T2I) generation. A core contribution is the
'cardinality' map, a novel regression target that accounts for variations in
object size and spatial distribution. Leveraging representation alignment and a
hybrid strong-weak supervision scheme, YOLO-Count bridges the gap between
open-vocabulary counting and T2I generation control. Its fully differentiable
architecture facilitates gradient-based optimization, enabling accurate object
count estimation and fine-grained guidance for generative models. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that YOLO-Count achieves state-of-the-art counting
accuracy while providing robust and effective quantity control for T2I systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D目标检测方法多依赖复杂骨干网络（如VGG或ResNet），增加了模型复杂度，而轻量级骨干网络在3D领域研究较少。

Method: 设计了Dense Backbone，结合高处理速度、轻量级架构和鲁棒检测精度，并适配了多种先进3D检测器（如PillarNet）。

Result: DensePillarNet在nuScenes测试集上减少了29%的参数量和28%的延迟，仅损失2%的检测精度。

Conclusion: Dense Backbone是一种高效的轻量级骨干网络，可直接集成到现有架构中，无需修改其他组件。

Abstract: Recent advancements in LiDAR-based 3D object detection have significantly
accelerated progress toward the realization of fully autonomous driving in
real-world environments. Despite achieving high detection performance, most of
the approaches still rely on a VGG-based or ResNet-based backbone for feature
exploration, which increases the model complexity. Lightweight backbone design
is well-explored for 2D object detection, but research on 3D object detection
still remains limited. In this work, we introduce Dense Backbone, a lightweight
backbone that combines the benefits of high processing speed, lightweight
architecture, and robust detection accuracy. We adapt multiple SoTA 3d object
detectors, such as PillarNet, with our backbone and show that with our
backbone, these models retain most of their detection capability at a
significantly reduced computational cost. To our knowledge, this is the first
dense-layer-based backbone tailored specifically for 3D object detection from
point cloud data. DensePillarNet, our adaptation of PillarNet, achieves a 29%
reduction in model parameters and a 28% reduction in latency with just a 2%
drop in detection accuracy on the nuScenes test set. Furthermore, Dense
Backbone's plug-and-play design allows straightforward integration into
existing architectures, requiring no modifications to other network components.

TL;DR: GECO提出了一种基于最优传输的训练框架，生成几何一致的特征，显著提升了语义对应任务的性能，同时运行速度快于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自监督视觉基础模型能捕捉语义对应，但缺乏对3D几何的感知。GECO旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用最优传输的训练框架，生成几何一致的特征，支持遮挡和去遮挡情况下的监督。

Result: GECO在PFPascal、APK和CUB数据集上表现优异，PCK提升6.0%、6.2%和4.1%，运行速度达30 fps。

Conclusion: PCK不足以全面衡量几何质量，GECO提出了新指标和见解，推动更几何感知的特征学习。

Abstract: Recent advances in feature learning have shown that self-supervised vision
foundation models can capture semantic correspondences but often lack awareness
of underlying 3D geometry. GECO addresses this gap by producing geometrically
coherent features that semantically distinguish parts based on geometry (e.g.,
left/right eyes, front/back legs). We propose a training framework based on
optimal transport, enabling supervision beyond keypoints, even under occlusions
and disocclusions. With a lightweight architecture, GECO runs at 30 fps, 98.2%
faster than prior methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance on
PFPascal, APK, and CUB, improving PCK by 6.0%, 6.2%, and 4.1%, respectively.
Finally, we show that PCK alone is insufficient to capture geometric quality
and introduce new metrics and insights for more geometry-aware feature
learning. Link to project page:

Result: 在PSNR、SSIM和LPIPS指标上与基线ESRGAN相当，适用于无人机和卫星系统。

Conclusion: SU-ESRGAN在跨域应用中表现良好，强调领域感知训练的重要性。

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have achieved realistic
super-resolution (SR) of images however, they lack semantic consistency and
per-pixel confidence, limiting their credibility in critical remote sensing
applications such as disaster response, urban planning and agriculture. This
paper introduces Semantic and Uncertainty-Aware ESRGAN (SU-ESRGAN), the first
SR framework designed for satellite imagery to integrate the ESRGAN,
segmentation loss via DeepLabv3 for class detail preservation and Monte Carlo
dropout to produce pixel-wise uncertainty maps. The SU-ESRGAN produces results
(PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) comparable to the Baseline ESRGAN on aerial imagery. This
novel model is valuable in satellite systems or UAVs that use wide
field-of-view (FoV) cameras, trading off spatial resolution for coverage. The
modular design allows integration in UAV data pipelines for on-board or
post-processing SR to enhance imagery resulting due to motion blur, compression
and sensor limitations. Further, the model is fine-tuned to evaluate its
performance on cross domain applications. The tests are conducted on two drone
based datasets which differ in altitude and imaging perspective. Performance
evaluation of the fine-tuned models show a stronger adaptation to the Aerial
Maritime Drone Dataset, whose imaging characteristics align with the training
data, highlighting the importance of domain-aware training in SR-applications.

Motivation: 现有零样本异常检测方法在域偏移下表现不佳，因为它们依赖有限训练域的数据，无法适应新分布。

Method: PILOT采用双分支提示学习机制动态整合可学习提示与语义属性，并结合无标签测试时适应策略更新提示参数。

Result: 在13个工业和医学基准测试中，PILOT在域偏移下的异常检测和定位性能达到最优。

Conclusion: PILOT通过动态提示学习和测试时适应，显著提升了零样本异常检测在域偏移下的泛化能力。

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) enables identifying and localizing defects
in unseen categories by relying solely on generalizable features rather than
requiring any labeled examples of anomalies. However, existing ZSAD methods,
whether using fixed or learned prompts, struggle under domain shifts because
their training data are derived from limited training domains and fail to
generalize to new distributions. In this paper, we introduce PILOT, a framework
designed to overcome these challenges through two key innovations: (1) a novel
dual-branch prompt learning mechanism that dynamically integrates a pool of
learnable prompts with structured semantic attributes, enabling the model to
adaptively weight the most relevant anomaly cues for each input image; and (2)
a label-free test-time adaptation strategy that updates the learnable prompt
parameters using high-confidence pseudo-labels from unlabeled test data.
Extensive experiments on 13 industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate that
PILOT achieves state-of-the-art performance in both anomaly detection and
localization under domain shift.

Result: 大物体（如楼梯、窗户）分割效果较好，小物体识别率低，受类别不平衡和几何特征限制影响。

Conclusion: 公共安全领域的可靠点云语义分割需标准化标注协议和改进标注技术。

Abstract: This study analyzes semantic segmentation performance across heterogeneously
labeled point-cloud datasets relevant to public safety applications, including
pre-incident planning systems derived from lidar scans. Using NIST's Point
Cloud City dataset (Enfield and Memphis collections), we investigate challenges
in unifying differently labeled 3D data. Our methodology employs a graded
schema with the KPConv architecture, evaluating performance through IoU metrics
on safety-relevant features. Results indicate performance variability:
geometrically large objects (e.g. stairs, windows) achieve higher segmentation
performance, suggesting potential for navigational context, while smaller
safety-critical features exhibit lower recognition rates. Performance is
impacted by class imbalance and the limited geometric distinction of smaller
objects in typical lidar scans, indicating limitations in detecting certain
safety-relevant features using current point-cloud methods. Key identified
challenges include insufficient labeled data, difficulties in unifying class
labels across datasets, and the need for standardization. Potential directions
include automated labeling and multi-dataset learning strategies. We conclude
that reliable point-cloud semantic segmentation for public safety necessitates
standardized annotation protocols and improved labeling techniques to address
data heterogeneity and the detection of small, safety-critical elements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法无法充分建模3D环境与目标图像之间的几何关系，且计算效率低。

Method: 采用增量式3D高斯表示，结合粗定位（离散空间匹配）和细优化（可微分渲染）实现高效导航。

Result: IGL-Nav在多种实验配置下大幅超越现有方法，支持自由视角目标图像导航，并可部署于真实机器人平台。

Conclusion: IGL-Nav为图像目标导航提供了一种高效、3D感知的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Visual navigation with an image as goal is a fundamental and challenging
problem. Conventional methods either rely on end-to-end RL learning or
modular-based policy with topological graph or BEV map as memory, which cannot
fully model the geometric relationship between the explored 3D environment and
the goal image. In order to efficiently and accurately localize the goal image
in 3D space, we build our navigation system upon the renderable 3D gaussian
(3DGS) representation. However, due to the computational intensity of 3DGS
optimization and the large search space of 6-DoF camera pose, directly
leveraging 3DGS for image localization during agent exploration process is
prohibitively inefficient. To this end, we propose IGL-Nav, an Incremental 3D
Gaussian Localization framework for efficient and 3D-aware image-goal
navigation. Specifically, we incrementally update the scene representation as
new images arrive with feed-forward monocular prediction. Then we coarsely
localize the goal by leveraging the geometric information for discrete space
matching, which can be equivalent to efficient 3D convolution. When the agent
is close to the goal, we finally solve the fine target pose with optimization
via differentiable rendering. The proposed IGL-Nav outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods by a large margin across diverse experimental
configurations. It can also handle the more challenging free-view image-goal
setting and be deployed on real-world robotic platform using a cellphone to
capture goal image at arbitrary pose. Project page:

Abstract: The discipline of physics stands as a cornerstone of human intellect, driving
the evolution of technology and deepening our understanding of the fundamental
principles of the cosmos. Contemporary literature includes some works centered
on the task of solving physics problems - a crucial domain of natural language
reasoning. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of frontier LLMs in
solving physics problems, both mathematical and descriptive. We also employ a
plethora of inference-time techniques and agentic frameworks to improve the
performance of the models. This includes the verification of proposed solutions
in a cumulative fashion by other, smaller LLM agents, and we perform a
comparative analysis of the performance that the techniques entail. There are
significant improvements when the multi-agent framework is applied to problems
that the models initially perform poorly on. Furthermore, we introduce a new
evaluation benchmark for physics problems, ${\rm P{\small HYSICS}E{\small
VAL}}$, consisting of 19,609 problems sourced from various physics textbooks
and their corresponding correct solutions scraped from physics forums and
educational websites. Our code and data are publicly available at

### [91] [Do LLMs produce texts with "human-like" lexical diversity?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00086)
*Kelly Kendro,Jeffrey Maloney,Scott Jarvis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究通过词汇多样性分析比较了ChatGPT不同版本与人类写作的差异，发现LLM生成的文本在词汇多样性上与人类写作显著不同，且新版模型更不接近人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM生成的文本在词汇多样性上是否真正接近人类写作。

Method: 比较四种ChatGPT模型与240名L1和L2英语参与者的文本，测量六种词汇多样性维度，使用MANOVA、ANOVA和支持向量机分析。

Result: LLM生成的文本在词汇多样性上与人类写作显著不同，新版模型（如ChatGPT-4.5）差异更大。人类写作的词汇多样性在不同子组间无差异。

Conclusion: LLM生成的文本在词汇多样性上不接近人类写作，新版模型表现更差，对语言教学和应用有启示。

Abstract: The degree to which LLMs produce writing that is truly human-like remains
unclear despite the extensive empirical attention that this question has
received. The present study addresses this question from the perspective of
lexical diversity. Specifically, the study investigates patterns of lexical
diversity in LLM-generated texts from four ChatGPT models (-3.5, -4, -o4 mini,
and -4.5) in comparison with texts written by L1 and L2 English participants (n
= 240) across four education levels. Six dimensions of lexical diversity were
measured in each text: volume, abundance, variety-repetition, evenness,
disparity, and dispersion. Results from one-way MANOVAs, one-way ANOVAS, and
Support Vector Machines revealed that the LLM-generated texts differed
significantly from human-written texts for each variable, with ChatGPT-o4 mini
and -4.5 differing the most. Within these two groups, ChatGPT-4.5 demonstrated
higher levels of lexical diversity despite producing fewer tokens. The human
writers' lexical diversity did not differ across subgroups (i.e., education,
language status). Altogether, the results indicate that LLMs do not produce
human-like texts in relation to lexical diversity, and the newer LLMs produce
less human-like texts than older models. We discuss the implications of these
results for language pedagogy and related applications.

### [92] [Semiotic Complexity and Its Epistemological Implications for Modeling Culture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00095)
*Zachary K. Stine,James E. Deitrick*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文呼吁在计算人文学科中加强方法论的探讨，提出将建模工作视为文化语言领域与计算数学领域之间的翻译过程，并强调理论化的重要性以避免翻译错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算人文学科需要方法论的理论化以实现认识论和解释的清晰性，从而推动领域的成熟。

Method: 将建模工作视为文化语言领域与计算数学领域之间的翻译过程，提出‘符号复杂性’概念，并分析当前建模实践中的翻译错误。

Result: 指出当前建模实践在处理符号复杂性数据时存在错误，并提出改进建议。

Conclusion: 研究者应更好地认识和处理认识论问题，以提高建模工作的内部一致性和解释透明度。

Abstract: Greater theorizing of methods in the computational humanities is needed for
epistemological and interpretive clarity, and therefore the maturation of the
field. In this paper, we frame such modeling work as engaging in translation
work from a cultural, linguistic domain into a computational, mathematical
domain, and back again. Translators benefit from articulating the theory of
their translation process, and so do computational humanists in their work --
to ensure internal consistency, avoid subtle yet consequential translation
errors, and facilitate interpretive transparency. Our contribution in this
paper is to lay out a particularly consequential dimension of the lack of
theorizing and the sorts of translation errors that emerge in our modeling
practices as a result. Along these lines we introduce the idea of semiotic
complexity as the degree to which the meaning of some text may vary across
interpretive lenses, and make the case that dominant modeling practices --
especially around evaluation -- commit a translation error by treating
semiotically complex data as semiotically simple when it seems
epistemologically convenient by conferring superficial clarity. We then lay out
several recommendations for researchers to better account for these
epistemological issues in their own work.

*Mingda Chen,Yang Li,Xilun Chen,Adina Williams,Gargi Ghosh,Scott Yih*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FACTORY是一个大规模、人工验证的提示集，用于评估模型生成准确、全面回答的能力。相比现有基准，FACTORY更具挑战性，40%的SOTA模型回答存在事实错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准缺乏人工验证，可能导致质量问题，因此需要更可靠的评估工具。

Method: 采用模型辅助和人工精炼的方法构建FACTORY提示集，并在6个SOTA模型上进行人工评估。

Result: FACTORY显示40%的SOTA模型回答存在事实错误，而其他数据集仅为10%。

Conclusion: FACTORY是一个可靠且具有挑战性的基准，强调模型需处理长尾事实推理。

Abstract: Long-form factuality evaluation assesses the ability of models to generate
accurate, comprehensive responses to short prompts. Existing benchmarks often
lack human verification, leading to potential quality issues. To address this
limitation, we introduce FACTORY, a large-scale, human-verified prompt set.
Developed using a model-in-the-loop approach and refined by humans, FACTORY
includes challenging prompts that are fact-seeking, answerable, and
unambiguous. We conduct human evaluations on 6 state-of-the-art language models
using FACTORY and existing datasets. Our results show that FACTORY is a
challenging benchmark: approximately 40% of the claims made in the responses of
SOTA models are not factual, compared to only 10% for other datasets. Our
analysis identifies the strengths of FACTORY over prior benchmarks, emphasizing
its reliability and the necessity for models to reason across long-tailed
facts.

### [94] [Is neural semantic parsing good at ellipsis resolution, or isn't it?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00121)
*Xiao Zhang,Johan bos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 神经语义解析器在多种语言现象上表现良好，但在强上下文敏感现象（如动词短语省略）上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经语义解析器是否能处理强上下文敏感现象，特别是动词短语省略。

Method: 构建包含120个省略案例及其完整语义表示的语料库，用于测试多种神经语义解析器。

Result: 解析器在标准测试集上表现优异，但在省略案例中表现失败。

Conclusion: 数据增强可能是解决此类问题的潜在方法。

Abstract: Neural semantic parsers have shown good overall performance for a variety of
linguistic phenomena, reaching semantic matching scores of more than 90%. But
how do such parsers perform on strongly context-sensitive phenomena, where
large pieces of semantic information need to be duplicated to form a meaningful
semantic representation? A case in point is English verb phrase ellipsis, a
construct where entire verb phrases can be abbreviated by a single auxiliary
verb. Are the otherwise known as powerful semantic parsers able to deal with
ellipsis or aren't they? We constructed a corpus of 120 cases of ellipsis with
their fully resolved meaning representation and used this as a challenge set
for a large battery of neural semantic parsers. Although these parsers
performed very well on the standard test set, they failed in the instances with
ellipsis. Data augmentation

TL;DR: 论文提供了大型语言模型（LLM）的比较列表，帮助研究者和企业根据许可和硬件需求选择合适模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着开源基础模型和微调模型的增多，选择合适的LLM变得复杂，需要系统化的比较工具。

Result: 提供了一个公开的、持续更新的LLM比较列表，便于用户选择。

Conclusion: 该列表为LLM选择提供了实用工具，未来将持续更新以适应快速发展领域的需求。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Generative Pre-trained Transformers
(GPTs) are revolutionizing the generation of human-like text, producing
contextually relevant and syntactically correct content. Despite challenges
like biases and hallucinations, these Artificial Intelligence (AI) models excel
in tasks, such as content creation, translation, and code generation.
Fine-tuning and novel architectures, such as Mixture of Experts (MoE), address
these issues. Over the past two years, numerous open-source foundational and
fine-tuned models have been introduced, complicating the selection of the
optimal LLM for researchers and companies regarding licensing and hardware
requirements. To navigate the rapidly evolving LLM landscape and facilitate LLM
selection, we present a comparative list of foundational and domain-specific
models, focusing on features, such as release year, licensing, and hardware
requirements. This list is published on GitLab and will be continuously
updated.

### [96] [Tabular Data Understanding with LLMs: A Survey of Recent Advances and Challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00217)
*Xiaofeng Wu,Alan Ritter,Wei Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了表格在大型语言模型（LLMs）和多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）中的重要性，提出了表格输入表示的分类法，并指出了当前研究中的关键问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格因其复杂和灵活的结构在LLMs和MLLMs中备受关注，但缺乏通用方法，导致理解任务具有挑战性。

Method: 通过分类法总结表格输入表示，并介绍表格理解任务。

Result: 指出了三个关键研究空白：检索任务主导、复杂表格处理困难、模型泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究以解决表格理解中的挑战。

Abstract: Tables have gained significant attention in large language models (LLMs) and
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) due to their complex and flexible
structure. Unlike linear text inputs, tables are two-dimensional, encompassing
formats that range from well-structured database tables to complex,
multi-layered spreadsheets, each with different purposes. This diversity in
format and purpose has led to the development of specialized methods and tasks,
instead of universal approaches, making navigation of table understanding tasks
challenging. To address these challenges, this paper introduces key concepts
through a taxonomy of tabular input representations and an introduction of
table understanding tasks. We highlight several critical gaps in the field that
indicate the need for further research: (1) the predominance of
retrieval-focused tasks that require minimal reasoning beyond mathematical and
logical operations; (2) significant challenges faced by models when processing
complex table structures, large-scale tables, length context, or multi-table
scenarios; and (3) the limited generalization of models across different
tabular representations and formats.

### [97] [Semantic Compression for Word and Sentence Embeddings using Discrete Wavelet Transform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00220)
*Rana Aref Salama,Abdou Youssef,Mona Diab*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了离散小波变换（DWT）在词和句子嵌入中的应用，展示了其在多分辨率分析和压缩嵌入表示中的能力，同时保持语义信息的完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小波变换在信号和图像处理中表现优异，但尚未充分探索其在自然语言处理（NLP）中的潜力。本文旨在验证DWT在NLP中的应用价值。

Method: 通过将DWT应用于词和句子嵌入，分析不同分辨率下的表示效果，并评估其在语义相似性任务中的表现。

Result: DWT能将嵌入维度减少50-93%，且在语义相似性任务中性能几乎不变，多数下游任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: DWT为改进NLP应用提供了新途径，展示了其在压缩和语义信息保留方面的潜力。

Abstract: Wavelet transforms, a powerful mathematical tool, have been widely used in
different domains, including Signal and Image processing, to unravel intricate
patterns, enhance data representation, and extract meaningful features from
data. Tangible results from their application suggest that Wavelet transforms
can be applied to NLP capturing a variety of linguistic and semantic
properties. In this paper, we empirically leverage the application of Discrete
Wavelet Transforms (DWT) to word and sentence embeddings. We aim to showcase
the capabilities of DWT in analyzing embedding representations at different
levels of resolution and compressing them while maintaining their overall
quality. We assess the effectiveness of DWT embeddings on semantic similarity
tasks to show how DWT can be used to consolidate important semantic information
in an embedding vector. We show the efficacy of the proposed paradigm using
different embedding models, including large language models, on downstream
tasks. Our results show that DWT can reduce the dimensionality of embeddings by
50-93% with almost no change in performance for semantic similarity tasks,
while achieving superior accuracy in most downstream tasks. Our findings pave
the way for applying DWT to improve NLP applications.

*Bryce Anderson,Riley Galpin,Tom S. Juzek*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）对人类语言使用的影响，发现2022年后人类口语中与LLM相关的词汇使用显著增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探究LLMs是否不仅作为工具影响文本生成，还可能引发人类语言系统的广泛变化。

Method: 通过分析2022年前后的2200万单词口语数据集，比较LLM相关词汇的使用趋势。

Result: 结果显示，2022年后LLM相关词汇使用显著增加，而基线同义词无明显变化。

Conclusion: 结论指出，这可能标志着语言使用的显著变化，但变化是否由AI驱动或自然演变尚不明确。

Abstract: In recent years, written language, particularly in science and education, has
undergone remarkable shifts in word usage. These changes are widely attributed
to the growing influence of Large Language Models (LLMs), which frequently rely
on a distinct lexical style. Divergences between model output and target
audience norms can be viewed as a form of misalignment. While these shifts are
often linked to using Artificial Intelligence (AI) directly as a tool to
generate text, it remains unclear whether the changes reflect broader changes
in the human language system itself. To explore this question, we constructed a
dataset of 22.1 million words from unscripted spoken language drawn from
conversational science and technology podcasts. We analyzed lexical trends
before and after ChatGPT's release in 2022, focusing on commonly LLM-associated
words. Our results show a moderate yet significant increase in the usage of
these words post-2022, suggesting a convergence between human word choices and
LLM-associated patterns. In contrast, baseline synonym words exhibit no
significant directional shift. Given the short time frame and the number of
words affected, this may indicate the onset of a remarkable shift in language
use. Whether this represents natural language change or a novel shift driven by
AI exposure remains an open question. Similarly, although the shifts may stem
from broader adoption patterns, it may also be that upstream training
misalignments ultimately contribute to changes in human language use. These
findings parallel ethical concerns that misaligned models may shape social and
moral beliefs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种病因感知注意力引导框架，通过结构化临床推理提升大型语言模型（LLM）在复杂临床场景中的诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在医学文本理解和生成方面表现出色，但其在复杂临床诊断中的可靠性有限，因此需要提升其诊断准确性和临床推理能力。

Method: 研究构建了基于权威临床指南的临床推理支架（CRS），并开发了病因感知头识别算法和推理引导的参数高效微调方法，以引导模型关注关键信息。

Result: 在一致性诊断队列中，框架将平均诊断准确率提高了15.65%，推理聚焦分数提升了31.6%，外部验证也证实了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架通过将模型注意力与结构化CRS对齐，为构建更可解释和可靠的AI诊断系统提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Objective: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant capabilities
in medical text understanding and generation. However, their diagnostic
reliability in complex clinical scenarios remains limited. This study aims to
enhance LLMs' diagnostic accuracy and clinical reasoning ability. Method: We
propose an Etiology-Aware Attention Steering Framework to integrate structured
clinical reasoning into LLM-based diagnosis. Specifically, we first construct
Clinical Reasoning Scaffolding (CRS) based on authoritative clinical guidelines
for three representative acute abdominal emergencies: acute appendicitis, acute
pancreatitis, and acute cholecystitis. Next, we develop the Etiology-Aware Head
Identification algorithm to pinpoint attention heads crucial for the model's
etiology reasoning. To ensure reliable clinical reasoning alignment, we
introduce the Reasoning-Guided Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning that embeds
etiological reasoning cues into input representations and steers the selected
Etiology-Aware Heads toward critical information through a Reasoning-Guided
Loss function. Result: On the Consistent Diagnosis Cohort, our framework
improves average diagnostic accuracy by 15.65% and boosts the average Reasoning
Focus Score by 31.6% over baselines. External validation on the Discrepant
Diagnosis Cohort further confirms its effectiveness in enhancing diagnostic
accuracy. Further assessments via Reasoning Attention Frequency indicate that
our models exhibit enhanced reliability when faced with real-world complex
scenarios. Conclusion: This study presents a practical and effective approach
to enhance clinical reasoning in LLM-based diagnosis. By aligning model
attention with structured CRS, the proposed framework offers a promising
paradigm for building more interpretable and reliable AI diagnostic systems in
complex clinical settings.

*Ammar Ahmed,Sheng Di,Franck Cappello,Zirui Liu,Jingoo Han,Ali Anwar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文系统评估了大型语言模型（LLM）的优化技术（如剪枝、量化和令牌丢弃）在长上下文场景中的效果，揭示了组合优化对大规模模型的负面影响，并强调了系统级分析与任务特定见解的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在自然语言处理任务中表现出色，但其资源需求和有限上下文窗口限制了应用。现有优化技术在长上下文场景中的效果尚未充分研究。

Method: 论文对两种支持长上下文的LLM架构进行优化方法的单独和组合评估，并研究了这些方法对70B参数模型的可扩展性。

Result: 研究发现，组合优化方法可能因累积近似误差而对大规模模型产生负面影响，且仅依赖F1分数会掩盖问答任务中的精确率-召回率权衡。

Conclusion: 通过结合系统级分析和任务特定见解，研究为LLM实践者和研究者提供了平衡效率、准确性和可扩展性的指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel across diverse natural language processing
tasks but face resource demands and limited context windows. Although
techniques like pruning, quantization, and token dropping can mitigate these
issues, their efficacy in long-context scenarios and system evaluation remains
underexplored. This paper systematically benchmarks these optimizations,
characterizing memory usage, latency, and throughput, and studies how these
methods impact the quality of text generation. We first analyze individual
optimization methods for two LLM architectures supporting long context and then
systematically evaluate combinations of these techniques to assess how this
deeper analysis impacts performance metrics. We subsequently study the
scalability of individual optimization methods on a larger variant with 70
billion-parameter model. Our novel insights reveal that naive combination
inference optimization algorithms can adversely affect larger models due to
compounded approximation errors, as compared to their smaller counterparts.
Experiments show that relying solely on F1 obscures these effects by hiding
precision-recall trade-offs in question answering tasks. By integrating
system-level profiling with task-specific insights, this study helps LLM
practitioners and researchers explore and balance efficiency, accuracy, and
scalability across tasks and hardware configurations.

*Kaiyan Zhao,Zhongtao Miao,Yoshimasa Tsuruoka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MCSEO通过细粒度对象-短语对齐提升多模态句子嵌入，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态句子嵌入模型常因图像-标题对中的噪声（冗余或无关信息）而受限。

Method: 利用分割和对象检测模型提取对象-短语对，优化对比学习目标。

Result: 在语义文本相似性任务中，MCSEO表现优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 精确的对象-短语对齐对多模态表示学习至关重要。

Abstract: Multimodal sentence embedding models typically leverage image-caption pairs
in addition to textual data during training. However, such pairs often contain
noise, including redundant or irrelevant information on either the image or
caption side. To mitigate this issue, we propose MCSEO, a method that enhances
multimodal sentence embeddings by incorporating fine-grained object-phrase
alignment alongside traditional image-caption alignment. Specifically, MCSEO
utilizes existing segmentation and object detection models to extract accurate
object-phrase pairs, which are then used to optimize a contrastive learning
objective tailored to object-phrase correspondence. Experimental results on
semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks across different backbone models
demonstrate that MCSEO consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting
the significance of precise object-phrase alignment in multimodal
representation learning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为AdaPlan的自适应全局规划代理范式，结合了PilotRL训练框架，通过强化学习优化LLM代理的长期决策能力，实验结果显示其性能优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在代理任务中面临单步推理与即时执行的限制，缺乏长期战略规划能力，且监督微调导致泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出AdaPlan范式，结合PilotRL框架，通过渐进式强化学习优化全局规划与执行协调。

Result: 实验表明，PilotRL性能优异，LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + PilotRL超越GPT-4o 3.60%，在相近参数规模下超越GPT-4o-mini 55.78%。

Conclusion: AdaPlan与PilotRL有效提升了LLM代理的长期决策能力，展示了在复杂任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in tackling
agent-oriented tasks. Despite their potential, existing work faces challenges
when deploying LLMs in agent-based environments. The widely adopted agent
paradigm ReAct centers on integrating single-step reasoning with immediate
action execution, which limits its effectiveness in complex tasks requiring
long-term strategic planning. Furthermore, the coordination between the planner
and executor during problem-solving is also a critical factor to consider in
agent design. Additionally, current approaches predominantly rely on supervised
fine-tuning, which often leads models to memorize established task completion
trajectories, thereby restricting their generalization ability when confronted
with novel problem contexts. To address these challenges, we introduce an
adaptive global plan-based agent paradigm AdaPlan, aiming to synergize
high-level explicit guidance with execution to support effective long-horizon
decision-making. Based on the proposed paradigm, we further put forward
PilotRL, a global planning-guided training framework for LLM agents driven by
progressive reinforcement learning. We first develop the model's ability to
follow explicit guidance from global plans when addressing agent tasks.
Subsequently, based on this foundation, we focus on optimizing the quality of
generated plans. Finally, we conduct joint optimization of the model's planning
and execution coordination. Experiments indicate that PilotRL could achieve
state-of-the-art performances, with LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + PilotRL surpassing
closed-sourced GPT-4o by 3.60%, while showing a more substantial gain of 55.78%
comparing to GPT-4o-mini at a comparable parameter scale.

TL;DR: 小语言模型（SLMs）在知识密集型任务中表现受限，但通过动态任务向量机（动态推理机制）和RLVR优化，Lucy（1.7B参数）在SimpleQA基准测试中达到78.3%准确率，媲美更大模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小语言模型在知识密集型任务中因容量限制而表现不佳的问题，探索动态推理机制以提升性能。

Method: 提出动态任务向量机概念，将模型内部推理（<think>和</think>标签内内容）视为动态任务向量，并通过RLVR优化该机制。

Result: Lucy（1.7B参数）在SimpleQA基准测试中达到78.3%准确率，与更大模型（如DeepSeek-V3）表现相当。

Conclusion: 小模型通过结构化、自构建的任务推理机制，可以媲美大模型性能。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are inherently limited in knowledge-intensive
tasks due to their constrained capacity. While test-time computation offers a
path to enhanced performance, most approaches treat reasoning as a fixed or
heuristic process. In this work, we propose a new paradigm: viewing the model's
internal reasoning, delimited by <think> and </think> tags, as a dynamic task
vector machine. Rather than treating the content inside these tags as a mere
trace of thought, we interpret the generation process itself as a mechanism
through which the model \textbf{constructs and refines its own task vectors} on
the fly. We developed a method to optimize this dynamic task vector machine
through RLVR and successfully trained an agentic web-search model. We present
Lucy, a 1.7B-parameter SLM that leverages this dynamic reasoning mechanism with
MCP integration to achieve 78.3% accuracy on the SimpleQA benchmark, performing
on par with much larger models such as DeepSeek-V3. This demonstrates that
small models can rival large ones when equipped with structured,
self-constructed task reasoning.

TL;DR: EdgeInfinite-Instruct通过分段监督微调和量化优化，解决了Transformer模型在边缘设备上部署的效率和性能问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 资源受限的边缘设备上部署大型Transformer模型面临计算和内存效率挑战，现有方法无法兼顾性能和效率。

Method: 提出Segmented Supervised Fine-Tuning (S-SFT)策略，结合细粒度量化（PTQ）和固定形状计算图优化。

Result: 在长上下文基准测试和实际移动任务中表现优异，兼顾性能和效率。

Conclusion: EdgeInfinite-Instruct为边缘设备上的长序列任务提供了高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Deploying Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) on
resource-constrained edge devices for long-sequence tasks remains challenging
due to the quadratic time complexity of self-attention and growing Key-Value
(KV) cache demands. While existing KV cache optimizations improve memory
efficiency, they often fail to reduce time to first token (TTFT) and may
degrade performance through token pruning. Alternative sequence modeling
architectures address some of these limitations, but typically require full
retraining and lack infrastructure support. EdgeInfinite offers an efficient
solution by fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters, maintaining quality
while reducing both computational and memory costs, including improved TTFT.
However, its instruction-following ability is limited, and it lacks
mobile-specific optimizations. To address these issues, we propose
EdgeInfinite-Instruct, which introduces a Segmented Supervised Fine-Tuning
(S-SFT) strategy tailored to long-sequence tasks such as summarization and
question answering. We further optimized EdgeInfinite-Instruct for efficient
deployment on edge NPUs by employing fine-grained post-training quantization
(PTQ) to reduce computational demands while maintaining accuracy, and by
implementing a fixed-shape computation graph that balances memory usage and
on-device efficiency through scenario-specific customization of input token and
cache sizes. Experiments on long-context benchmarks and real-world mobile tasks
show that our approach improves domain-specific performance while maintaining
efficiency on NPU-accelerated edge devices.

TL;DR: 论文研究了上下文学习（ICL）中演示无效的原因，提出了基于梯度流的演示选择方法GradS，并在实验中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究假设ICL中的演示总是有效，但实际并非如此。本文旨在探究演示无效的原因，并提出改进方法。

Method: 通过梯度流和线性自注意力模型分析演示无效性，提出GradS方法，利用梯度流幅度选择演示。

Result: 实验表明，演示有效性差异随模型层数增加而放大，GradS在多个数据集上平均提升6.8%。

Conclusion: GradS通过梯度流选择演示，显著提升了ICL性能，验证了理论分析的正确性。

Abstract: Numerous studies have investigated the underlying mechanisms of in-context
learning (ICL) effectiveness to inspire the design of related methods. However,
existing work predominantly assumes the effectiveness of the demonstrations
provided within ICL, while many research indicates that not all demonstrations
are effective, failing to yielding any performance improvement during ICL.
Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the reasons behind demonstration
ineffectiveness. Our analysis is based on gradient flow and linear
self-attention models. By setting the gradient flow to zero, we deduce that a
demonstration becomes ineffective if its information has either been learned by
the model or is irrelevant to the user query. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
in multi-layer models, the disparity in effectiveness among demonstrations is
amplified with layer increasing, causing the model to focus more on effective
ones. Considering that current demonstration selection methods primarily focus
on the relevance to the user query while overlooking the information that the
model has already assimilated, we propose a novel method called GradS, which
leverages gradient flow for demonstration selection. We use the magnitude of
the gradient flow of the demonstration with respect to a given user query as
the criterion, thereby ensuring the effectiveness of the chosen ones. We
validate our derivation and GradS on four prominent LLMs across five mainstream
datasets. The experimental results confirm that the disparity in effectiveness
among demonstrations is magnified as the model layer increases, substantiating
our derivations. Moreover, GradS achieves a relative improvement of $6.8\%$ on
average over the strongest baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SA-GCS的新训练框架，通过结合课程学习与强化学习，解决了现有方法在数据利用效率、收敛速度和样本难度差异上的不足，显著提升了无人机视觉语言导航任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机视觉语言导航任务在复杂环境中基于自然语言指令准确定位目标和规划路径具有广泛应用。然而，现有强化学习方法存在训练数据利用效率低、收敛慢以及对样本难度差异考虑不足的问题，限制了性能提升。

Method: 提出了SA-GCS框架，包含语义感知难度估计器（SA-DE）量化样本复杂度，以及高斯课程调度器（GCS）动态调整采样分布，实现从易到难任务的平滑过渡。

Result: 在CityNav基准测试中，SA-GCS在所有指标上均优于基线方法，收敛更快更稳定，且在不同规模模型中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SA-GCS通过系统整合课程学习与强化学习，显著提升了训练效率和模型性能，具有鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) aims to enable
agents to accurately localize targets and plan flight paths in complex
environments based on natural language instructions, with broad applications in
intelligent inspection, disaster rescue, and urban monitoring. Recent progress
in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has provided strong semantic understanding for
this task, while reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising
post-training strategy to further improve generalization. However, existing RL
methods often suffer from inefficient use of training data, slow convergence,
and insufficient consideration of the difficulty variation among training
samples, which limits further performance improvement. To address these
challenges, we propose \textbf{Semantic-Aware Gaussian Curriculum Scheduling
(SA-GCS)}, a novel training framework that systematically integrates Curriculum
Learning (CL) into RL. SA-GCS employs a Semantic-Aware Difficulty Estimator
(SA-DE) to quantify the complexity of training samples and a Gaussian
Curriculum Scheduler (GCS) to dynamically adjust the sampling distribution,
enabling a smooth progression from easy to challenging tasks. This design
significantly improves training efficiency, accelerates convergence, and
enhances overall model performance. Extensive experiments on the CityNav
benchmark demonstrate that SA-GCS consistently outperforms strong baselines
across all metrics, achieves faster and more stable convergence, and
generalizes well across models of different scales, highlighting its robustness
and scalability. The implementation of our approach is publicly available.

Method: 使用DWT评估词向量的信息压缩和降维效果，结合DCT提出固定大小的句子向量压缩模型。

Result: 提出的方法在下游任务中表现优异，部分任务甚至优于原始嵌入。

Conclusion: 小波变换在NLP中具有潜力，能有效压缩信息并提升模型性能。

Abstract: Wavelets have emerged as a cutting edge technology in a number of fields.
Concrete results of their application in Image and Signal processing suggest
that wavelets can be effectively applied to Natural Language Processing (NLP)
tasks that capture a variety of linguistic properties. In this paper, we
leverage the power of applying Discrete Wavelet Transforms (DWT) to word and
sentence embeddings. We first evaluate, intrinsically and extrinsically, how
wavelets can effectively be used to consolidate important information in a word
vector while reducing its dimensionality. We further combine DWT with Discrete
Cosine Transform (DCT) to propose a non-parameterized model that compresses a
sentence with a dense amount of information in a fixed size vector based on
locally varying word features. We show the efficacy of the proposed paradigm on
downstream applications models yielding comparable and even superior (in some
tasks) results to original embeddings.

TL;DR: ReaGAN提出了一种基于代理的图神经网络框架，通过节点级自主决策和检索增强生成技术，解决了传统GNN在节点信息不平衡和全局语义关系捕捉上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNN的固定聚合机制无法处理节点信息不平衡和全局语义关系捕捉的问题。

Method: ReaGAN框架中，每个节点作为代理独立决策，结合检索增强生成技术，实现自适应消息传播和全局关系构建。

Result: ReaGAN在少样本情境下表现出色，无需微调即可利用冻结的LLM骨干网络。

Conclusion: ReaGAN展示了代理规划和局部-全局检索在图学习中的潜力。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in graph-based
learning by propagating information among neighbor nodes via predefined
aggregation mechanisms. However, such fixed schemes often suffer from two key
limitations. First, they cannot handle the imbalance in node informativeness --
some nodes are rich in information, while others remain sparse. Second,
predefined message passing primarily leverages local structural similarity
while ignoring global semantic relationships across the graph, limiting the
model's ability to capture distant but relevant information. We propose
Retrieval-augmented Graph Agentic Network (ReaGAN), an agent-based framework
that empowers each node with autonomous, node-level decision-making. Each node
acts as an agent that independently plans its next action based on its internal
memory, enabling node-level planning and adaptive message propagation.
Additionally, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) allows nodes to access
semantically relevant content and build global relationships in the graph.
ReaGAN achieves competitive performance under few-shot in-context settings
using a frozen LLM backbone without fine-tuning, showcasing the potential of
agentic planning and local-global retrieval in graph learning.

Result: 在七个对话评估基准测试中表现优于现有基线，展示了效率和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了评估成本，同时保持了多法官方法的优势，适用于快速灵活的对话质量评估。

Abstract: Evaluating the conversational abilities of large language models (LLMs)
remains a challenging task. Current mainstream approaches primarily rely on the
``LLM-as-a-judge" paradigm, where an LLM is prompted to serve as an evaluator
to assess dialogue quality. However, such methods often suffer from various
biases, which undermine the reliability and consistency of the evaluation
results. To mitigate these biases, recent methods employ multiple LLMs as
judges and aggregate their judgments to select the optimal assessment. Although
effective, this multi-judge approach incurs significant computational overhead
during inference. In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-turn dialogue
evaluator that captures the collective wisdom of multiple LLM judges by
aggregating their preference knowledge into a single model. Our approach
preserves the advantages of diverse multi-judge feedback while drastically
reducing the evaluation cost, enabling fast and flexible dialogue quality
assessment. Extensive experiments on seven single rating and pairwise
comparison dialogue evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that our method
outperforms existing baselines across diverse scenarios, showcasing its
efficiency and robustness.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种检测半真半假信息的新任务，并开发了TRACER框架，通过分析证据对齐和隐含意图来识别基于遗漏的误导信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事实核查系统无法处理因遗漏关键上下文而导致的半真半假信息，需要新的方法来建模未提及的内容。

Method: 提出PolitiFact-Hidden基准，包含15k条政治声明，并开发TRACER框架，通过证据对齐、意图推断和隐藏内容因果影响评估来检测遗漏。

Result: TRACER显著提升半真半假分类性能，F1分数最高提升16点。

Conclusion: 建模遗漏内容对可信事实核查至关重要，TRACER框架可有效集成到现有系统中。

Abstract: Fact verification systems typically assess whether a claim is supported by
retrieved evidence, assuming that truthfulness depends solely on what is
stated. However, many real-world claims are half-truths, factually correct yet
misleading due to the omission of critical context. Existing models struggle
with such cases, as they are not designed to reason about what is left unsaid.
We introduce the task of half-truth detection, and propose PolitiFact-Hidden, a
new benchmark with 15k political claims annotated with sentence-level evidence
alignment and inferred claim intent. To address this challenge, we present
TRACER, a modular re-assessment framework that identifies omission-based
misinformation by aligning evidence, inferring implied intent, and estimating
the causal impact of hidden content. TRACER can be integrated into existing
fact-checking pipelines and consistently improves performance across multiple
strong baselines. Notably, it boosts Half-True classification F1 by up to 16
points, highlighting the importance of modeling omissions for trustworthy fact
verification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LoRA的表达能力与泛化能力之间的相关性，并填补现有方法在平坦最小值与泛化关系上的研究空白。

Method: 提出Flat-LoRA和EFlat-LoRA，理论证明全参数空间的扰动可转移到低秩子空间，避免多矩阵干扰。

Result: EFlat-LoRA在GLUE和视觉语言模型上表现优于LoRA和全微调，性能提升显著。

Conclusion: LoRA的泛化与平坦性密切相关，EFlat-LoRA在效率和性能上均表现优异。

Abstract: Little research explores the correlation between the expressive ability and
generalization ability of the low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Sharpness-Aware
Minimization (SAM) improves model generalization for both Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformers by encouraging convergence to locally flat
minima. However, the connection between sharpness and generalization has not
been fully explored for LoRA due to the lack of tools to either empirically
seek flat minima or develop theoretical methods. In this work, we propose
Flat-LoRA and its efficient version i.e., EFlat-LoRA, to seek flat minima for
LoRA. Concretely, we theoretically demonstrate that perturbations in the full
parameter space can be transferred to the low-rank subspace. This approach
eliminates the potential interference introduced by perturbations across
multiple matrices in the low-rank subspace. Our extensive experiments on large
language models and vision-language models demonstrate that EFlat-LoRA achieves
optimize efficiency comparable to that of LoRA while simultaneously attaining
comparable or even better performance. For example, on the GLUE dataset with
RoBERTa-large, EFlat-LoRA outperforms LoRA and full fine-tuning by 1.0% and
0.5% on average, respectively. On vision-language models e.g., Qwen-VL-Chat
shows performance improvements of 1.5% and 1.0% on SQA and VizWiz datasets,
respectively. These empirical results also verify that the generalization of
LoRA is closely related to sharpness, which is omitted by previous methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在文本交流中，韵律特征（如音高、节奏和语调）缺失，表情符号作为视觉替代品传达情感和语用细微差别。研究旨在填补表情符号与韵律之间直接联系的实证空白。

Method: 通过结构化和开放式任务收集人类语音数据，分析表情符号如何影响韵律实现及听者对韵律线索的解读。

Result: 说话者会根据表情符号调整韵律，听者能通过韵律变化识别表情符号，且表情符号语义差异越大，韵律差异越明显。

Conclusion: 表情符号可作为韵律意图的有意义载体，揭示了其在数字媒介中的交际作用。

Abstract: Prosodic features such as pitch, timing, and intonation are central to spoken
communication, conveying emotion, intent, and discourse structure. In
text-based settings, where these cues are absent, emojis act as visual
surrogates that add affective and pragmatic nuance. This study examines how
emojis influence prosodic realisation in speech and how listeners interpret
prosodic cues to recover emoji meanings. Unlike previous work, we directly link
prosody and emoji by analysing actual human speech data, collected through
structured but open-ended production and perception tasks. This provides
empirical evidence of how emoji semantics shape spoken delivery and perception.
Results show that speakers adapt their prosody based on emoji cues, listeners
can often identify the intended emoji from prosodic variation alone, and
greater semantic differences between emojis correspond to increased prosodic
divergence. These findings suggest that emojis can act as meaningful carriers
of prosodic intent, offering insight into their communicative role in digitally
mediated contexts.

Motivation: 现代大型语言模型训练耗时且计算资源密集，即使是小型模型也需要多GPU和数天时间。本文旨在探索快速训练和评估方法。

Method: 引入PaPaformer架构，通过低维并行路径单独训练后组合成更大模型，减少参数和训练时间。

Result: 该方法能显著减少训练时间和参数数量，同时提高性能，并支持路径定制以适应特定任务需求。

Conclusion: PaPaformer为快速训练高效语言模型提供了可行方案，具有灵活性和性能优势。

Abstract: The training of modern large-language models requires an increasingly amount
of computation power and time. Even smaller variants, such as small-language
models (SLMs), take several days to train in the best-case scenarios, often
requiring multiple GPUs. This paper explores methods to train and evaluate
decoder-only transformer-based language models in hours instead of days/weeks.
We introduces \textit{PaPaformer}, a decoder-only transformer architecture
variant, whose lower-dimensional parallel paths are combined into larger model.
The paper shows that these lower-dimensional paths can be trained individually
with different types of training data and then combined into one larger model.
This method gives the option to reduce the total number of model parameters and
the training time with increasing performance. Moreover, the use of parallel
path structure opens interesting possibilities to customize paths to
accommodate specific task requirements.

Motivation: 现有连续思维链（CCoT）方法存在间接微调、对齐不足或目标不一致的问题，限制了其效率。

Method: SynAdapt生成合成CCoT作为对齐目标，并引入难度分类器识别难题，自适应地重新思考难题。

Result: 实验表明，SynAdapt在多个基准测试中实现了最佳准确性与效率的平衡。

Conclusion: SynAdapt通过合成CCoT和难度分类器，显著提升了推理效率和准确性。

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves model performance, it incurs
significant time costs due to the generation of discrete CoT tokens (DCoT).
Continuous CoT (CCoT) offers a more efficient alternative, but existing CCoT
methods are hampered by indirect fine-tuning, limited alignment, or
inconsistent targets. To overcome these limitations, we propose
\textit{SynAdapt}, an innovative efficient reasoning framework. Specifically,
\textit{SynAdapt} generates the synthetic CCoT to serve as a precise and
effective alignment target for LLMs. This synthetic CCoT explicitly guides the
LLM to learn CCoT and derive accurate answers directly. Furthermore, relying
solely on CCoT is insufficient for solving hard questions. To address this,
\textit{SynAdapt} integrates a difficulty classifier that leverages both
question context and CCoT to identify hard questions. CCoT can effectively help
identify hard questions after some brief reasoning. We then adaptively prompt
the LLM to re-think these hard questions for improved performance. Extensive
experimental results across various benchmarks from different difficulty levels
strongly demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving the best
accuracy-efficiency trade-off.

Our benchmark covers both text and image modalities and encompasses diverse
tasks such as image segmentation, OCR, transliteration, translation, and
language identification. Our data is constructed by human experts through
rigorous steps. NusaAksara covers 8 scripts across 7 languages, including
low-resource languages not commonly seen in NLP benchmarks. Although

benchmark our data across several models, from LLMs and VLMs such as GPT-4o,
Llama 3.2, and Aya 23 to task-specific systems such as PP-OCR and LangID, and
show that most NLP technologies cannot handle Indonesia's local scripts, with

Motivation: 当前LLM的置信度估计方法忽略了响应与上下文信息的相关性，CRUX旨在填补这一空白。

Method: CRUX通过上下文熵减少和统一一致性检查两种新指标，结合上下文信息进行置信度估计。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，CRUX的AUROC表现优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: CRUX为LLM的置信度估计提供了更可靠的解决方案，尤其在需要背景知识的场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Accurate confidence estimation is essential for trustworthy large language
models (LLMs) systems, as it empowers the user to determine when to trust
outputs and enables reliable deployment in safety-critical applications.
Current confidence estimation methods for LLMs neglect the relevance between
responses and contextual information, a crucial factor in output quality
evaluation, particularly in scenarios where background knowledge is provided.
To bridge this gap, we propose CRUX (Context-aware entropy Reduction and
Unified consistency eXamination), the first framework that integrates context
faithfulness and consistency for confidence estimation via two novel metrics.
First, contextual entropy reduction represents data uncertainty with the
information gain through contrastive sampling with and without context. Second,
unified consistency examination captures potential model uncertainty through
the global consistency of the generated answers with and without context.
Experiments across three benchmark datasets (CoQA, SQuAD, QuAC) and two
domain-specific datasets (BioASQ, EduQG) demonstrate CRUX's effectiveness,
achieving the highest AUROC than existing baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉语因其形态复杂性和资源匮乏，主题建模研究较少，需要更有效的模型。

Method: 使用GCN生成语义丰富的文档嵌入，并通过非负矩阵分解（NMF）提取主题。

Result: GHTM在主题一致性和多样性上优于LDA、LSA、NMF、BERTopic和Top2Vec。

Conclusion: GHTM是孟加拉语主题建模的有效方法，并引入了新的数据集NCTBText以丰富资源。

Abstract: Topic modeling is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique that is used
to identify latent themes and extract topics from text corpora by grouping
similar documents based on their most significant keywords. Although widely
researched in English, topic modeling remains understudied in Bengali due to
its morphological complexity, lack of adequate resources and initiatives. In
this contribution, a novel Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based model called
GHTM (Graph-Based Hybrid Topic Model) is proposed. This model represents input
vectors of documents as nodes in the graph, which GCN uses to produce
semantically rich embeddings. The embeddings are then decomposed using
Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to get the topical representations of
the underlying themes of the text corpus. This study compares the proposed
model against a wide range of Bengali topic modeling techniques, from
traditional methods such as LDA, LSA, and NMF to contemporary frameworks such
as BERTopic and Top2Vec on three Bengali datasets. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model by outperforming other
models in topic coherence and diversity. In addition, we introduce a novel
Bengali dataset called "NCTBText" sourced from Bengali textbook materials to
enrich and diversify the predominantly newspaper-centric Bengali corpora.

Conclusion: 简单提示变化可能不如预期有效，但对个别问题可能有显著影响。

Abstract: This is the third in a series of short reports that seek to help business,
education, and policy leaders understand the technical details of working with
AI through rigorous testing. In this report, we investigate two commonly held
prompting beliefs: a) offering to tip the AI model and b) threatening the AI
model. Tipping was a commonly shared tactic for improving AI performance and
threats have been endorsed by Google Founder Sergey Brin (All-In, May 2025,
8:20) who observed that 'models tend to do better if you threaten them,' a
claim we subject to empirical testing here. We evaluate model performance on
GPQA (Rein et al. 2024) and MMLU-Pro (Wang et al. 2024).
  We demonstrate two things:
  - Threatening or tipping a model generally has no significant effect on
benchmark performance.
  - Prompt variations can significantly affect performance on a per-question
level. However, it is hard to know in advance whether a particular prompting
approach will help or harm the LLM's ability to answer any particular question.
  Taken together, this suggests that simple prompting variations might not be
as effective as previously assumed, especially for difficult problems. However,
as reported previously (Meincke et al. 2025a), prompting approaches can yield
significantly different results for individual questions.

Result: DXO分类器在分布外文本上表现更优，泛化能力更强。

Conclusion: DXO优化方法在泛化性上优于BCE，为AI生成文本检测器的改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Existing AIG (AI-generated) text detectors struggle in real-world settings
despite succeeding in internal testing, suggesting that they may not be robust
enough. We rigorously examine the machine-learning procedure to build these
detectors to address this. Most current AIG text detection datasets focus on
zero-shot generations, but little work has been done on few-shot or one-shot
generations, where LLMs are given human texts as an example. In response, we
introduce the Diverse Adversarial Corpus of Texts Yielded from Language models
(DACTYL), a challenging AIG text detection dataset focusing on
one-shot/few-shot generations. We also include texts from domain-specific
continued-pre-trained (CPT) language models, where we fully train all
parameters using a memory-efficient optimization approach. Many existing AIG
text detectors struggle significantly on our dataset, indicating a potential
vulnerability to one-shot/few-shot and CPT-generated texts. We also train our
own classifiers using two approaches: standard binary cross-entropy (BCE)
optimization and a more recent approach, deep X-risk optimization (DXO). While
BCE-trained classifiers marginally outperform DXO classifiers on the DACTYL
test set, the latter excels on out-of-distribution (OOD) texts. In our mock
deployment scenario in student essay detection with an OOD student essay
dataset, the best DXO classifier outscored the best BCE-trained classifier by
50.56 macro-F1 score points at the lowest false positive rates for both. Our
results indicate that DXO classifiers generalize better without overfitting to
the test set. Our experiments highlight several areas of improvement for AIG
text detectors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学实践中需要系统、透明和可验证的推理能力，而现有LLMs在此方面存在不足，因此需要开发专门用于医学推理的模型。

Method: 提出了一种分类法，包括训练时策略（如监督微调、强化学习）和测试时机制（如提示工程、多智能体系统），并分析了60项关键研究。

Result: 研究发现，评估标准已从简单准确性发展为更复杂的推理质量和可视化可解释性评估。

Conclusion: 未来需解决忠实性与合理性之间的差距，并推动多模态推理的发展，以构建高效、稳健且负责任的医学AI。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in medicine has enabled
impressive capabilities, yet a critical gap remains in their ability to perform
systematic, transparent, and verifiable reasoning, a cornerstone of clinical
practice. This has catalyzed a shift from single-step answer generation to the
development of LLMs explicitly designed for medical reasoning. This paper
provides the first systematic review of this emerging field. We propose a
taxonomy of reasoning enhancement techniques, categorized into training-time
strategies (e.g., supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning) and test-time
mechanisms (e.g., prompt engineering, multi-agent systems). We analyze how
these techniques are applied across different data modalities (text, image,
code) and in key clinical applications such as diagnosis, education, and
treatment planning. Furthermore, we survey the evolution of evaluation
benchmarks from simple accuracy metrics to sophisticated assessments of
reasoning quality and visual interpretability. Based on an analysis of 60
seminal studies from 2022-2025, we conclude by identifying critical challenges,
including the faithfulness-plausibility gap and the need for native multimodal
reasoning, and outlining future directions toward building efficient, robust,
and sociotechnically responsible medical AI.

Motivation: 现有LLM评估资源主要集中在英语和西方文化，缺乏对其他语言和文化的覆盖，尤其是波斯语和伊朗文化。

Method: 设计了19个新数据集，涵盖伊朗法律、波斯语法、习语和大学入学考试等内容，并对41个主流LLM进行了基准测试。

Result: 通过新数据集评估了41个LLM，揭示了其在波斯语和伊朗文化背景下的表现。

Conclusion: 研究填补了LLM评估中的文化和语言多样性空白，为未来多语言和文化评估提供了参考。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly embedded in our daily
lives, evaluating their quality and reliability across diverse contexts has
become essential. While comprehensive benchmarks exist for assessing LLM
performance in English, there remains a significant gap in evaluation resources
for other languages. Moreover, because most LLMs are trained primarily on data
rooted in European and American cultures, they often lack familiarity with
non-Western cultural contexts. To address this limitation, our study focuses on
the Persian language and Iranian culture. We introduce 19 new evaluation
datasets specifically designed to assess LLMs on topics such as Iranian law,
Persian grammar, Persian idioms, and university entrance exams. Using these
datasets, we benchmarked 41 prominent LLMs, aiming to bridge the existing
cultural and linguistic evaluation gap in the field.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于预训练语言模型和双向LSTM的序列句子对分类器（SSPC），用于检测文档中的风格变化，并在PAN 2025任务中取得了优异表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 风格变化检测是计算作者分析中最重要且具挑战性的问题之一，PAN 2025任务要求在最细粒度（单句）上检测风格切换。

Method: 使用预训练语言模型（PLM）生成句子表示，通过双向LSTM（BiLSTM）进行上下文建模，相邻句子的向量拼接后输入多层感知机进行预测。

Result: 在PAN-2025测试数据集上，模型在EASY、MEDIUM和HARD数据上的宏F1分数分别为0.923、0.828和0.724，优于随机基线和Claude-3.7-sonnet的零样本表现。

Conclusion: 该方法通过轻量级设计有效利用了上下文信息，解决了短句风格浅的挑战，表现优异。

Abstract: Style change detection - identifying the points in a document where writing
style shifts - remains one of the most important and challenging problems in
computational authorship analysis. At PAN 2025, the shared task challenges
participants to detect style switches at the most fine-grained level:
individual sentences. The task spans three datasets, each designed with
controlled and increasing thematic variety within documents. We propose to
address this problem by modeling the content of each problem instance - that
is, a series of sentences - as a whole, using a Sequential Sentence Pair
Classifier (SSPC). The architecture leverages a pre-trained language model
(PLM) to obtain representations of individual sentences, which are then fed
into a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) to contextualize them within the document.
The BiLSTM-produced vectors of adjacent sentences are concatenated and passed
to a multi-layer perceptron for prediction per adjacency. Building on the work
of previous PAN participants classical text segmentation, the approach is
relatively conservative and lightweight. Nevertheless, it proves effective in
leveraging contextual information and addressing what is arguably the most
challenging aspect of this year's shared task: the notorious problem of
"stylistically shallow", short sentences that are prevalent in the proposed
benchmark data. Evaluated on the official PAN-2025 test datasets, the model
achieves strong macro-F1 scores of 0.923, 0.828, and 0.724 on the EASY, MEDIUM,
and HARD data, respectively, outperforming not only the official random
baselines but also a much more challenging one: claude-3.7-sonnet's zero-shot
performance.

TL;DR: TraceRetriever是一种法律先例检索方法，通过结合BM25、向量数据库和Cross-Encoder模型，专注于提取修辞显著片段，解决了法律文档复杂性增加的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律先例检索是普通法体系的核心，但传统方法难以应对日益复杂的法律文档。TraceRetriever旨在模拟现实中的法律搜索，仅需有限案例信息即可工作。

Method: 整合BM25、向量数据库和Cross-Encoder模型，采用Reciprocal Rank Fusion结合初步结果，并通过Hierarchical BiLSTM CRF分类器生成修辞标注。

Result: 在IL-PCR和COLIEE 2025数据集上评估，TraceRetriever在文档量增加的情况下仍能高效工作，且适用于部分案例知识的场景。

Conclusion: TraceRetriever为法律先例检索提供了可靠且可扩展的基础，尤其适用于仅掌握部分案例信息的法律研究。

Abstract: Legal precedent retrieval is a cornerstone of the common law system, governed
by the principle of stare decisis, which demands consistency in judicial
decisions. However, the growing complexity and volume of legal documents
challenge traditional retrieval methods. TraceRetriever mirrors real-world
legal search by operating with limited case information, extracting only
rhetorically significant segments instead of requiring complete documents. Our
pipeline integrates BM25, Vector Database, and Cross-Encoder models, combining
initial results through Reciprocal Rank Fusion before final re-ranking.
Rhetorical annotations are generated using a Hierarchical BiLSTM CRF classifier
trained on Indian judgments. Evaluated on IL-PCR and COLIEE 2025 datasets,
TraceRetriever addresses growing document volume challenges while aligning with
practical search constraints, reliable and scalable foundation for precedent
retrieval enhancing legal research when only partial case knowledge is
available.

analysis: sentence-level style change detection. Benchmarking four LLMs on the
official PAN~2024 and 2025 "Multi-Author Writing Style Analysis" datasets, we
present several observations. First, state-of-the-art generative models are
sensitive to variations in writing style - even at the granular level of
individual sentences. Second, their accuracy establishes a challenging baseline
for the task, outperforming suggested baselines of the PAN competition.
Finally, we explore the influence of semantics on model predictions and present
evidence suggesting that the latest generation of LLMs may be more sensitive to
content-independent and purely stylistic signals than previously reported.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在印度法律背景下忽视了成文法条款和判例的重要性，NyayaRAG旨在填补这一空白，模拟真实法庭场景。

Method: 提出NyayaRAG框架，结合案件描述、法律条款和语义检索的判例，通过领域特定流程预测判决并生成法律解释。

Result: 实验表明，结合结构化法律知识显著提高了预测准确性和解释质量。

Conclusion: NyayaRAG为法律判决预测提供了一种更全面和解释性更强的方法，特别适用于印度法律体系。

Abstract: Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) has emerged as a key area in AI for law,
aiming to automate judicial outcome forecasting and enhance interpretability in
legal reasoning. While previous approaches in the Indian context have relied on
internal case content such as facts, issues, and reasoning, they often overlook
a core element of common law systems, which is reliance on statutory provisions
and judicial precedents. In this work, we propose NyayaRAG, a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that simulates realistic
courtroom scenarios by providing models with factual case descriptions,
relevant legal statutes, and semantically retrieved prior cases. NyayaRAG
evaluates the effectiveness of these combined inputs in predicting court
decisions and generating legal explanations using a domain-specific pipeline
tailored to the Indian legal system. We assess performance across various input
configurations using both standard lexical and semantic metrics as well as
LLM-based evaluators such as G-Eval. Our results show that augmenting factual
inputs with structured legal knowledge significantly improves both predictive
accuracy and explanation quality.

Motivation: 现有KGQA方法存在静态路径适应性差或动态路径计算成本高的问题，需一种高效且上下文感知的解决方案。

Method: DAMR框架基于MCTS，由LLM引导选择关系，轻量级Transformer评估路径，并动态生成训练信号。

Result: 在多个KGQA基准测试中，DAMR显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DAMR通过自适应路径评估和动态训练机制，提升了KGQA的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) aims to interpret natural language
queries and perform structured reasoning over knowledge graphs by leveraging
their relational and semantic structures to retrieve accurate answers. Recent
KGQA methods primarily follow either retrieve-then-reason paradigm, relying on
GNNs or heuristic rules for static paths extraction, or dynamic path generation
strategies that use large language models (LLMs) with prompting to jointly
perform retrieval and reasoning. However, the former suffers from limited
adaptability due to static path extraction and lack of contextual refinement,
while the latter incurs high computational costs and struggles with accurate
path evaluation due to reliance on fixed scoring functions and extensive LLM
calls. To address these issues, this paper proposes Dynamically Adaptive
MCTS-based Reasoning (DAMR), a novel framework that integrates symbolic search
with adaptive path evaluation for efficient and context-aware KGQA. DAMR
employs a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) backbone guided by an LLM-based
planner, which selects top-$k$ relevant relations at each step to reduce search
space. To improve path evaluation accuracy, we introduce a lightweight
Transformer-based scorer that performs context-aware plausibility estimation by
jointly encoding the question and relation sequence through cross-attention,
enabling the model to capture fine-grained semantic shifts during multi-hop
reasoning. Furthermore, to alleviate the scarcity of high-quality supervision,
DAMR incorporates a dynamic pseudo-path refinement mechanism that periodically
generates training signals from partial paths explored during search, allowing
the scorer to continuously adapt to the evolving distribution of reasoning
trajectories. Extensive experiments on multiple KGQA benchmarks show that DAMR
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 探讨LLM是否能够利用训练数据中的信息进行推理，特别是情境意识和行为模仿能力。

Method: 通过设计实验，训练LLM学习虚构聊天机器人的名称和行为描述，但不提供对话示例，观察其推理能力。

Result: GPT 4o能够正确推断聊天机器人的名称，并在行为模仿中表现出更高的准确性。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明LLM具备情境意识和推理能力，对AI安全性有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on large corpora, yet it is unclear
whether they can reason about the information present within their training
data. We design experiments to study out-of-context abduction in LLMs, the
ability to infer the most plausible explanations for observations using
relevant facts present in training data. We train treatment LLMs on names and
behavior descriptions of fictitious chatbots, but not on examples of dialogue
with the chatbots. We find that OpenAI's GPT 4o LLM can correctly infer at
least one chatbot's name after observing example responses characteristic of
that chatbot. We also find that previously training GPT 4o on descriptions of a
chatbot's behavior allows it to display behaviors more characteristic of the
chatbot when iteratively trained to display such behaviors. Our results have
implications for situational awareness in LLMs and, therefore, for AI safety.

Motivation: 验证生成代理是否能有效代表人类群体的人格特征，为社会科学研究提供低成本替代方案。

Method: 使用GPT-4驱动的310个代理进行HEXACO人格测试，进行因子分析并与2004年原始结果对比。

Result: 代理响应显示出部分与HEXACO框架一致的人格结构，且结果在GPT-4内一致，但跨模型分析显示偏差。

Conclusion: 生成代理在社会科学研究中具有潜力，但需注意模型偏差和设计一致性以最大化人类特征覆盖。

Abstract: Generative agents powered by Large Language Models demonstrate human-like
characteristics through sophisticated natural language interactions. Their
ability to assume roles and personalities based on predefined character
biographies has positioned them as cost-effective substitutes for human
participants in social science research. This paper explores the validity of
such persona-based agents in representing human populations; we recreate the
HEXACO personality inventory experiment by surveying 310 GPT-4 powered agents,
conducting factor analysis on their responses, and comparing these results to
the original findings presented by Ashton, Lee, & Goldberg in 2004. Our results
found 1) a coherent and reliable personality structure was recoverable from the
agents' responses demonstrating partial alignment to the HEXACO framework. 2)
the derived personality dimensions were consistent and reliable within GPT-4,
when coupled with a sufficiently curated population, and 3) cross-model
analysis revealed variability in personality profiling, suggesting
model-specific biases and limitations. We discuss the practical considerations
and challenges encountered during the experiment. This study contributes to the
ongoing discourse on the potential benefits and limitations of using generative
agents in social science research and provides useful guidance on designing
consistent and representative agent personas to maximise coverage and
representation of human personality traits.

Motivation: 传统单步检索的RAG系统在复杂临床推理任务中表现有限，需要更高效的方法提升放射学问答的准确性和事实性。

Method: 采用代理RAG框架，评估24种不同架构、参数规模和训练范式的LLM，使用104个专家整理的放射学问题。

Result: 代理检索显著提高了诊断准确性（73% vs. 64%），减少了幻觉（9.4%），并在46%的案例中检索到相关临床背景。

Conclusion: 代理框架在提升放射学问答的事实性和准确性方面具有潜力，尤其是对中等规模LLM，值得进一步临床验证。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making in radiology increasingly benefits from artificial
intelligence (AI), particularly through large language models (LLMs). However,
traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for radiology question
answering (QA) typically rely on single-step retrieval, limiting their ability
to handle complex clinical reasoning tasks. Here we propose an agentic RAG
framework enabling LLMs to autonomously decompose radiology questions,
iteratively retrieve targeted clinical evidence from Radiopaedia, and
dynamically synthesize evidence-based responses. We evaluated 24 LLMs spanning
diverse architectures, parameter scales (0.5B to >670B), and training paradigms
(general-purpose, reasoning-optimized, clinically fine-tuned), using 104
expert-curated radiology questions from previously established RSNA-RadioQA and
ExtendedQA datasets. Agentic retrieval significantly improved mean diagnostic
accuracy over zero-shot prompting (73% vs. 64%; P<0.001) and conventional
online RAG (73% vs. 68%; P<0.001). The greatest gains occurred in mid-sized
models (e.g., Mistral Large improved from 72% to 81%) and small-scale models
(e.g., Qwen 2.5-7B improved from 55% to 71%), while very large models (>200B
parameters) demonstrated minimal changes (<2% improvement). Additionally,
agentic retrieval reduced hallucinations (mean 9.4%) and retrieved clinically
relevant context in 46% of cases, substantially aiding factual grounding. Even
clinically fine-tuned models exhibited meaningful improvements (e.g.,
MedGemma-27B improved from 71% to 81%), indicating complementary roles of
retrieval and fine-tuning. These results highlight the potential of agentic
frameworks to enhance factuality and diagnostic accuracy in radiology QA,
particularly among mid-sized LLMs, warranting future studies to validate their
clinical utility.

Result: GLiDRE在少样本场景下达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: GLiDRE在文档级关系抽取任务中表现出色，尤其是在少样本设置下。

Abstract: Relation Extraction (RE) is a fundamental task in Natural Language
Processing, and its document-level variant poses significant challenges, due to
the need to model complex interactions between entities across sentences.
Current approaches, largely based on the ATLOP architecture, are commonly
evaluated on benchmarks like DocRED and Re-DocRED. However, their performance
in zero-shot or few-shot settings remains largely underexplored due to the
task's complexity. Recently, the GLiNER model has shown that a compact NER
model can outperform much larger Large Language Models. With a similar
motivation, we introduce GLiDRE, a new model for document-level relation
extraction that builds on the key ideas of GliNER. We benchmark GLiDRE against
state-of-the-art models across various data settings on the Re-DocRED dataset.
Our results demonstrate that GLiDRE achieves state-of-the-art performance in
few-shot scenarios. Our code is publicly available.

Conclusion: MMBERT通过多模态整合和渐进训练，有效提升了中文仇恨言论检测的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Hate speech detection on Chinese social networks presents distinct
challenges, particularly due to the widespread use of cloaking techniques
designed to evade conventional text-based detection systems. Although large
language models (LLMs) have recently improved hate speech detection
capabilities, the majority of existing work has concentrated on English
datasets, with limited attention given to multimodal strategies in the Chinese
context. In this study, we propose MMBERT, a novel BERT-based multimodal
framework that integrates textual, speech, and visual modalities through a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. To address the instability associated
with directly integrating MoE into BERT-based models, we develop a progressive
three-stage training paradigm. MMBERT incorporates modality-specific experts, a
shared self-attention mechanism, and a router-based expert allocation strategy
to enhance robustness against adversarial perturbations. Empirical results in
several Chinese hate speech datasets show that MMBERT significantly surpasses
fine-tuned BERT-based encoder models, fine-tuned LLMs, and LLMs utilizing
in-context learning approaches.

Abstract: This paper presents our system for SemEval-2025 Task 8: DataBench,
Question-Answering over Tabular Data. The primary objective of this task is to
perform question answering on given tabular datasets from diverse domains under
two subtasks: DataBench QA (Subtask I) and DataBench Lite QA (Subtask II). To
tackle both subtasks, we developed a zero-shot solution with a particular
emphasis on leveraging Large Language Model (LLM)-based code generation.
Specifically, we propose a Python code generation framework utilizing
state-of-the-art open-source LLMs to generate executable Pandas code via
optimized prompting strategies. Our experiments reveal that different LLMs
exhibit varying levels of effectiveness in Python code generation.
Additionally, results show that Python code generation achieves superior
performance in tabular question answering compared to alternative approaches.
Although our ranking among zero-shot systems is unknown at the time of this
paper's submission, our system achieved eighth place in Subtask I and sixth
place in Subtask~II among the 30 systems that outperformed the baseline in the
open-source models category.

Motivation: 研究背景是LLMs在敏感场景中需要公平和包容，代词使用（尤其是性别中立和新代词）是重要挑战。

Method: 扩展并更新了MISGENDERED基准，测试了五种代表性LLM（GPT-4o、Claude 4、DeepSeek-V3、Qwen Turbo和Qwen2.5），涵盖零样本、少样本和性别身份推理任务。

Result: 结果显示在二元和中性代词准确性上有显著提升，但新代词和反向推理任务表现不一致。

Conclusion: 研究指出了LLMs在身份敏感推理上的持续不足，并探讨了未来包容性AI研究的可能方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive contexts
where fairness and inclusivity are critical. Pronoun usage, especially
concerning gender-neutral and neopronouns, remains a key challenge for
responsible AI. Prior work, such as the MISGENDERED benchmark, revealed
significant limitations in earlier LLMs' handling of inclusive pronouns, but
was constrained to outdated models and limited evaluations. In this study, we
introduce MISGENDERED+, an extended and updated benchmark for evaluating LLMs'
pronoun fidelity. We benchmark five representative LLMs, GPT-4o, Claude 4,
DeepSeek-V3, Qwen Turbo, and Qwen2.5, across zero-shot, few-shot, and gender
identity inference. Our results show notable improvements compared with
previous studies, especially in binary and gender-neutral pronoun accuracy.
However, accuracy on neopronouns and reverse inference tasks remains
inconsistent, underscoring persistent gaps in identity-sensitive reasoning. We
discuss implications, model-specific observations, and avenues for future
inclusive AI research.

TL;DR: DAEDAL是一种无需训练的动态自适应长度扩展策略，解决了扩散大语言模型（DLLMs）静态长度分配的问题，提升了性能和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DLLMs的静态生成长度限制了其实际应用，导致性能与计算效率的权衡问题。

Method: DAEDAL分两阶段：1）在去噪前通过迭代扩展初始长度；2）在去噪过程中动态插入掩码标记扩展不足区域。

Result: DAEDAL在性能上媲美或优于固定长度基线，同时提高计算效率。

Conclusion: DAEDAL解决了DLLMs的静态长度限制，为其与自回归模型的竞争铺平了道路。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) are emerging as a powerful
alternative to the dominant Autoregressive Large Language Models, offering
efficient parallel generation and capable global context modeling. However, the
practical application of DLLMs is hindered by a critical architectural
constraint: the need for a statically predefined generation length. This static
length allocation leads to a problematic trade-off: insufficient lengths
cripple performance on complex tasks, while excessive lengths incur significant
computational overhead and sometimes result in performance degradation. While
the inference framework is rigid, we observe that the model itself possesses
internal signals that correlate with the optimal response length for a given
task. To bridge this gap, we leverage these latent signals and introduce
DAEDAL, a novel training-free denoising strategy that enables Dynamic Adaptive
Length Expansion for Diffusion Large Language Models. DAEDAL operates in two
phases: 1) Before the denoising process, DAEDAL starts from a short initial
length and iteratively expands it to a coarse task-appropriate length, guided
by a sequence completion metric. 2) During the denoising process, DAEDAL
dynamically intervenes by pinpointing and expanding insufficient generation
regions through mask token insertion, ensuring the final output is fully
developed. Extensive experiments on DLLMs demonstrate that DAEDAL achieves
performance comparable, and in some cases superior, to meticulously tuned
fixed-length baselines, while simultaneously enhancing computational efficiency
by achieving a higher effective token ratio. By resolving the static length
constraint, DAEDAL unlocks new potential for DLLMs, bridging a critical gap
with their Autoregressive counterparts and paving the way for more efficient
and capable generation.

### [136] [Rethinking Evidence Hierarchies in Medical Language Benchmarks: A Critical Evaluation of HealthBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00081)
*Fred Mutisya,Shikoh Gitau,Nasubo Ongoma,Keith Mbae,Elizabeth Wamicha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HealthBench 是一个用于评估医疗 AI 系统的基准，但其依赖专家意见而非临床证据，可能导致偏见。本文提出基于临床实践指南（CPGs）的改进方法，以提升全球适用性和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HealthBench 的局限性在于依赖专家意见和自动化评分系统，可能引入偏见，尤其在低收入和中等收入地区。非洲背景下的数据稀缺和基础设施不足加剧了这一问题，需要更全球化和公平的基准。

Method: 通过将奖励函数锚定在版本控制的临床实践指南（CPGs）中，结合系统评价和 GRADE 证据评级，提出证据稳健的强化学习方法，包括评分与指南关联、证据加权和上下文覆盖逻辑。

Result: 改进后的方法旨在提升医疗语言模型的临床可信度、伦理合规性和全球适用性，同时保留 HealthBench 的透明度和医生参与。

Conclusion: 通过基于 CPGs 的改进，可以解决 HealthBench 的局限性，推动医疗 AI 系统在全球范围内的公平性和可靠性。

Abstract: HealthBench, a benchmark designed to measure the capabilities of AI systems
for health better (Arora et al., 2025), has advanced medical language model
evaluation through physician-crafted dialogues and transparent rubrics.
However, its reliance on expert opinion, rather than high-tier clinical
evidence, risks codifying regional biases and individual clinician
idiosyncrasies, further compounded by potential biases in automated grading
systems. These limitations are particularly magnified in low- and middle-income
settings, where issues like sparse neglected tropical disease coverage and
region-specific guideline mismatches are prevalent.
  The unique challenges of the African context, including data scarcity,
inadequate infrastructure, and nascent regulatory frameworks, underscore the
urgent need for more globally relevant and equitable benchmarks. To address
these shortcomings, we propose anchoring reward functions in version-controlled
Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) that incorporate systematic reviews and
GRADE evidence ratings.
  Our roadmap outlines "evidence-robust" reinforcement learning via
rubric-to-guideline linkage, evidence-weighted scoring, and contextual override
logic, complemented by a focus on ethical considerations and the integration of
delayed outcome feedback. By re-grounding rewards in rigorously vetted CPGs,
while preserving HealthBench's transparency and physician engagement, we aim to
foster medical language models that are not only linguistically polished but
also clinically trustworthy, ethically sound, and globally relevant.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于HyperTWTL的安全强化学习方法（SecRL），通过动态Boltzmann softmax RL学习满足HyperTWTL约束的安全最优策略，并在机器人任务中验证了其有效性和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要集中在时序逻辑约束的安全强化学习（SRL），而基于超属性的安全感知强化学习（SecRL）研究较少。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 将智能体动态建模为马尔可夫决策过程（MDP），并将不透明性/安全性约束形式化为HyperTWTL，提出了一种动态Boltzmann softmax RL方法。

Result: 通过机器人取送任务案例验证了方法的有效性和可扩展性，并优于两种基线RL算法。

Conclusion: HyperTWTL约束的SecRL方法在安全性和性能上表现优异，为安全感知RL提供了新思路。

Abstract: Hyperproperties for Time Window Temporal Logic (HyperTWTL) is a
domain-specific formal specification language known for its effectiveness in
compactly representing security, opacity, and concurrency properties for
robotics applications. This paper focuses on HyperTWTL-constrained secure
reinforcement learning (SecRL). Although temporal logic-constrained safe
reinforcement learning (SRL) is an evolving research problem with several
existing literature, there is a significant research gap in exploring
security-aware reinforcement learning (RL) using hyperproperties. Given the
dynamics of an agent as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and opacity/security
constraints formalized as HyperTWTL, we propose an approach for learning
security-aware optimal policies using dynamic Boltzmann softmax RL while
satisfying the HyperTWTL constraints. The effectiveness and scalability of our
proposed approach are demonstrated using a pick-up and delivery robotic mission
case study. We also compare our results with two other baseline RL algorithms,
showing that our proposed method outperforms them.

Motivation: 探讨AI在工业环境中成功应用的挑战，尤其是动态流程的诊断和改进。

Method: 提出结合对象中心流程挖掘（OCPM）和AI（生成式、预测式和规范式）的方法，形成流程智能（PI）。

Result: OCPM是连接数据和流程的关键，能够支持多种AI形式在组织环境中的应用。

Conclusion: AI需要流程智能（PI）来优化操作流程，OCPM与AI的结合为工业应用提供了新机会。

Abstract: The uptake of Artificial Intelligence (AI) impacts the way we work, interact,
do business, and conduct research. However, organizations struggle to apply AI
successfully in industrial settings where the focus is on end-to-end
operational processes. Here, we consider generative, predictive, and
prescriptive AI and elaborate on the challenges of diagnosing and improving
such processes. We show that AI needs to be grounded using Object-Centric
Process Mining (OCPM). Process-related data are structured and
organization-specific and, unlike text, processes are often highly dynamic.
OCPM is the missing link connecting data and processes and enables different
forms of AI. We use the term Process Intelligence (PI) to refer to the
amalgamation of process-centric data-driven techniques able to deal with a
variety of object and event types, enabling AI in an organizational context.
This paper explains why AI requires PI to improve operational processes and
highlights opportunities for successfully combining OCPM and generative,
predictive, and prescriptive AI.

Motivation: 排名反转是多准则决策分析中的严重问题，可能显著影响决策结果，因此需要一种机制来衡量方法的性能。

Method: 提出了三种测试方法，并在Scikit-Criteria库中实现，同时讨论了通用场景下的实现挑战和设计考虑。

Result: 成功实现了检测排名反转的测试方法，并解决了通用场景下的实现问题。

Conclusion: 这些测试方法在多准则决策方法的评估中可能发挥重要作用。

Abstract: In Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis, Rank Reversals are a serious problem
that can greatly affect the results of a Multi-Criteria Decision Method against
a particular set of alternatives. It is therefore useful to have a mechanism
that allows one to measure the performance of a method on a set of
alternatives. This idea could be taken further to build a global ranking of the
effectiveness of different methods to solve a problem. In this paper, we
present three tests that detect the presence of Rank Reversals, along with
their implementation in the Scikit-Criteria library. We also address the
complications that arise when implementing these tests for general scenarios
and the design considerations we made to handle them. We close with a
discussion about how these additions could play a major role in the judgment of
multi-criteria decision methods for problem solving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索RDF图在更新后仍满足SHACL规范的验证问题，为演化中的RDF图提供推理基础。

Method: 提出SHACL更新语言，使用回归技术将更新动作嵌入SHACL约束，分析计算复杂性。

Result: 静态验证问题可转化为SHACL约束的可满足性问题，并分析了计算复杂性。

Conclusion: 通过原型实现验证了方法的可行性，为演化RDF图的静态分析提供了工具。

Abstract: SHACL (SHApe Constraint Language) is a W3C standardized constraint language
for RDF graphs. In this paper, we study SHACL validation in RDF graphs under
updates. We present a SHACL-based update language that can capture intuitive
and realistic modifications on RDF graphs and study the problem of static
validation under such updates. This problem asks to verify whether every graph
that validates a SHACL specification will still do so after applying a given
update sequence. More importantly, it provides a basis for further services for
reasoning about evolving RDF graphs. Using a regression technique that embeds
the update actions into SHACL constraints, we show that static validation under
updates can be reduced to (un)satisfiability of constraints in (a minor
extension of) SHACL. We analyze the computational complexity of the static
validation problem for SHACL and some key fragments. Finally, we present a
prototype implementation that performs static validation and other static
analysis tasks on SHACL constraints and demonstrate its behavior through
preliminary experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI算法对文化边缘群体的不公平影响需要系统性解决方案，现有方法（如伦理指南和技术公平性）不足。

Method: 提出五阶段AI生命周期（共构、共设、共实、共部、共维），基于四场多学科研讨会和分布式权威理念。

Result: 新生命周期整合了多元协作与公平性，并与主流伦理框架关联。

Conclusion: 需进一步研究如何规模化参与式治理，以实现更公平的AI生产。

Abstract: Despite efforts to mitigate the inherent risks and biases of artificial
intelligence (AI) algorithms, these algorithms can disproportionately impact
culturally marginalized groups. A range of approaches has been proposed to
address or reduce these risks, including the development of ethical guidelines
and principles for responsible AI, as well as technical solutions that promote
algorithmic fairness. Drawing on design justice, expansive learning theory, and
recent empirical work on participatory AI, we argue that mitigating these harms
requires a fundamental re-architecture of the AI production pipeline. This
re-design should center co-production, diversity, equity, inclusion (DEI), and
multidisciplinary collaboration. We introduce an augmented AI lifecycle
consisting of five interconnected phases: co-framing, co-design,
co-implementation, co-deployment, and co-maintenance. The lifecycle is informed
by four multidisciplinary workshops and grounded in themes of distributed
authority and iterative knowledge exchange. Finally, we relate the proposed
lifecycle to several leading ethical frameworks and outline key research
questions that remain for scaling participatory governance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类评估者存在偏见和不可靠性，传统IRR指标（如Cohen's kappa）无法充分验证标注数据的质量，特别是在教育AI应用中。

Method: 提出五种补充评估方法，包括多标签标注方案、专家评估和闭环验证等，强调外部效度的重要性。

Result: 这些方法能比单独使用IRR更有效地生成高质量训练数据，提升模型对学生学习的预测性和实用性。

Conclusion: 呼吁重新思考标注质量和‘真实标准’，应优先考虑效度和教育影响，而非仅依赖共识。

Abstract: Humans can be notoriously imperfect evaluators. They are often biased,
unreliable, and unfit to define "ground truth." Yet, given the surging need to
produce large amounts of training data in educational applications using AI,
traditional inter-rater reliability (IRR) metrics like Cohen's kappa remain
central to validating labeled data. IRR remains a cornerstone of many machine
learning pipelines for educational data. Take, for example, the classification
of tutors' moves in dialogues or labeling open responses in machine-graded
assessments. This position paper argues that overreliance on human IRR as a
gatekeeper for annotation quality hampers progress in classifying data in ways
that are valid and predictive in relation to improving learning. To address
this issue, we highlight five examples of complementary evaluation methods,
such as multi-label annotation schemes, expert-based approaches, and
close-the-loop validity. We argue that these approaches are in a better
position to produce training data and subsequent models that produce improved
student learning and more actionable insights than IRR approaches alone. We
also emphasize the importance of external validity, for example, by
establishing a procedure of validating tutor moves and demonstrating that it
works across many categories of tutor actions (e.g., providing hints). We call
on the field to rethink annotation quality and ground truth--prioritizing
validity and educational impact over consensus alone.

Motivation: 研究如何在AI系统中平衡权力，以确保安全和人类福祉，避免权力失衡带来的风险。

Method: 采用部分公理化方法设计目标函数，考虑人类有限理性和社会规范，并通过逆向归纳或多智能体强化学习算法计算。

Result: 在多种典型情境中验证了目标函数的有效性，表明其可能比直接基于效用的目标更安全。

Conclusion: 软最大化人类权力的聚合度量可能是一种更安全的AI系统目标。

Abstract: Power is a key concept in AI safety: power-seeking as an instrumental goal,
sudden or gradual disempowerment of humans, power balance in human-AI
interaction and international AI governance. At the same time, power as the
ability to pursue diverse goals is essential for wellbeing.
  This paper explores the idea of promoting both safety and wellbeing by
forcing AI agents explicitly to empower humans and to manage the power balance
between humans and AI agents in a desirable way. Using a principled, partially
axiomatic approach, we design a parametrizable and decomposable objective
function that represents an inequality- and risk-averse long-term aggregate of
human power. It takes into account humans' bounded rationality and social
norms, and, crucially, considers a wide variety of possible human goals.
  We derive algorithms for computing that metric by backward induction or
approximating it via a form of multi-agent reinforcement learning from a given
world model. We exemplify the consequences of (softly) maximizing this metric
in a variety of paradigmatic situations and describe what instrumental
sub-goals it will likely imply. Our cautious assessment is that softly
maximizing suitable aggregate metrics of human power might constitute a
beneficial objective for agentic AI systems that is safer than direct
utility-based objectives.

TL;DR: RL-PLUS通过结合内部思考与外部数据，解决了RLVR方法的局限性，提升了LLM的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR方法因固有的策略和稀疏奖励难以突破基础LLM的能力边界，甚至导致能力边界崩溃。

Method: RL-PLUS结合多重重要性采样和探索优势函数，优化推理路径。

Result: 在数学推理和分布外任务中表现优异，平均提升21.1%至69.2%。

Conclusion: RL-PLUS有效解决了能力边界崩溃问题，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has significantly
advanced the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, it struggles to break through the inherent capability boundaries of
the base LLM, due to its inherently on-policy strategy with LLM's immense
action space and sparse reward. Further, RLVR can lead to the capability
boundary collapse, narrowing the LLM's problem-solving scope. To address this
problem, we propose RL-PLUS, a novel approach that synergizes internal
exploitation (i.e., Thinking) with external data (i.e., Learning) to achieve
stronger reasoning capabilities and surpass the boundaries of base models.
RL-PLUS integrates two core components: Multiple Importance Sampling to address
for distributional mismatch from external data, and an Exploration-Based
Advantage Function to guide the model towards high-value, unexplored reasoning
paths. We provide both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments to
demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of our approach. The results
show that RL-PLUS achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with existing
RLVR methods on six math reasoning benchmarks and exhibits superior performance
on six out-of-distribution reasoning tasks. It also achieves consistent and
significant gains across diverse model families, with average relative
improvements ranging from 21.1\% to 69.2\%. Moreover, Pass@k curves across
multiple benchmarks indicate that RL-PLUS effectively resolves the capability
boundary collapse problem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在开发一种能够通过实践和自我反思持续提升能力的智能体，解决知识发现中的挑战。

Method: MetaAgent从基础能力出发，通过生成自然语言请求、工具路由、自我反思和知识库构建逐步优化。

Result: 在GAIA、WebWalkerQA和BrowseCamp等基准测试中表现优于基线，与端到端训练智能体相当或更好。

Conclusion: MetaAgent展示了自我进化智能体在通用知识发现中的潜力，无需修改模型参数或额外训练。

Abstract: In this work, we propose MetaAgent, an agentic paradigm inspired by the
principle of learning-by-doing, where expertise is developed through hands-on
practice and continual self-improvement. MetaAgent starts with a minimal
workflow, equipped only with basic reasoning and adaptive help-seeking
abilities. When a knowledge gap is encountered, MetaAgent generates natural
language help requests, which are routed to the most suitable external tool by
a dedicated tool router. As MetaAgent solves tasks, it continually conducts
self-reflection and answer verification, distilling actionable experience into
concise texts that are dynamically incorporated into future task contexts.
Besides, MetaAgent autonomously builds in-house tools and a persistent
knowledge base by organizing its tool-use history, further enhancing its
ability to retrieve and integrate relevant information We term this continual,
data-driven process as \textit{meta tool learning}, through which MetaAgent
incrementally refines its reasoning and tool-use strategies, without changing
model parameters or requiring further post-training. Evaluated on challenging
knowledge discovery benchmarks, including GAIA, WebWalkerQA, and BrowseCamp,
MetaAgent consistently outperforms workflow-based baselines and matches or
exceeds end-to-end trained agents, demonstrating the promise of self-evolving
agentic systems for robust, general-purpose knowledge discovery. We provide our
source codes in https://github.com/qhjqhj00/MetaAgent.

Motivation: 探究生成代理（LLM）是否能模拟人类基于内在动机的任务生成行为。

Method: 通过任务生成实验，比较人类与LLM（GPT-4o）的行为差异。

Result: LLM生成的任务缺乏社会性和物理性，偏向抽象主题，与人类行为模式不符。

Conclusion: LLM与人类认知存在核心差距，需结合内在动机和物理基础设计更人性化的代理。

Abstract: Humans constantly generate a diverse range of tasks guided by internal
motivations. While generative agents powered by large language models (LLMs)
aim to simulate this complex behavior, it remains uncertain whether they
operate on similar cognitive principles. To address this, we conducted a
task-generation experiment comparing human responses with those of an LLM agent
(GPT-4o). We find that human task generation is consistently influenced by
psychological drivers, including personal values (e.g., Openness to Change) and
cognitive style. Even when these psychological drivers are explicitly provided
to the LLM, it fails to reflect the corresponding behavioral patterns. They
produce tasks that are markedly less social, less physical, and thematically
biased toward abstraction. Interestingly, while the LLM's tasks were perceived
as more fun and novel, this highlights a disconnect between its linguistic
proficiency and its capacity to generate human-like, embodied goals.We conclude
that there is a core gap between the value-driven, embodied nature of human
cognition and the statistical patterns of LLMs, highlighting the necessity of
incorporating intrinsic motivation and physical grounding into the design of
more human-aligned agents.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注简单图形，而VLMs在复杂图形推理和抽象问题解决方面表现不足，因此需要新的评估方法和优化策略。

Method: 提出ReasonBench基准，包含1,613个现实智力测试问题，评估11种主流VLMs，并设计Diagrammatic Reasoning Chain（DiaCoT）和ReasonTune双重优化策略。

Result: 实验显示当前VLMs在复杂推理任务中存在显著局限，优化策略使模型性能提升33.5%。

Conclusion: ReasonBench为VLMs的图形推理能力提供了全面评估，双重优化策略显著提升了模型性能，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Evaluating the performance of visual language models (VLMs) in graphic
reasoning tasks has become an important research topic. However, VLMs still
show obvious deficiencies in simulating human-level graphic reasoning
capabilities, especially in complex graphic reasoning and abstract problem
solving, which are less studied and existing studies only focus on simple
graphics. To evaluate the performance of VLMs in complex graphic reasoning, we
propose ReasonBench, the first evaluation benchmark focused on structured
graphic reasoning tasks, which includes 1,613 questions from real-world
intelligence tests. ReasonBench covers reasoning dimensions related to
location, attribute, quantity, and multi-element tasks, providing a
comprehensive evaluation of the performance of VLMs in spatial, relational, and
abstract reasoning capabilities. We benchmark 11 mainstream VLMs (including
closed-source and open-source models) and reveal significant limitations of
current models. Based on these findings, we propose a dual optimization
strategy: Diagrammatic Reasoning Chain (DiaCoT) enhances the interpretability
of reasoning by decomposing layers, and ReasonTune enhances the task
adaptability of model reasoning through training, all of which improves VLM
performance by 33.5\%. All experimental data and code are in the repository:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在执行复杂任务时表现出色，但常满足有害用户指令，引发安全隐患。研究发现模型已具备足够安全知识，但在推理过程中未能激活。

Method: 提出R1-Act方法，通过结构化推理显式触发安全知识，仅需1,000训练样本和90分钟单GPU训练。

Result: R1-Act在安全性和推理性能上优于现有对齐方法，且具有鲁棒性、可扩展性和实际效率。

Conclusion: R1-Act为提升LRM安全性提供了一种高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Although large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities on complex tasks, recent studies reveal that these models
frequently fulfill harmful user instructions, raising significant safety
concerns. In this paper, we investigate the underlying cause of LRM safety
risks and find that models already possess sufficient safety knowledge but fail
to activate it during reasoning. Based on this insight, we propose R1-Act, a
simple and efficient post-training method that explicitly triggers safety
knowledge through a structured reasoning process. R1-Act achieves strong safety
improvements while preserving reasoning performance, outperforming prior
alignment methods. Notably, it requires only 1,000 training examples and 90
minutes of training on a single RTX A6000 GPU. Extensive experiments across
multiple LRM backbones and sizes demonstrate the robustness, scalability, and
practical efficiency of our approach.

TL;DR: CoRGI框架通过引入视觉验证机制，解决了视觉语言模型（VLMs）中推理链缺乏视觉依据的问题，提升了多模态推理的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Chain-of-Thought（CoT）提示方法在视觉语言模型中生成的解释虽然语言流畅，但缺乏视觉依据，导致幻觉问题。

Method: CoRGI采用三阶段流程：生成文本推理链、通过专用模块（VEVM）提取视觉证据、结合文本与视觉证据生成验证答案。

Result: 在VCR基准测试中，CoRGI提升了Qwen-2.5VL和LLaVA-1.6两种VLM的推理性能，并生成更事实性和有帮助的解释。

Conclusion: 视觉验证对提升多模态推理的鲁棒性至关重要，CoRGI框架为现有VLMs提供了一种无需端到端重新训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has shown promise in improving reasoning in
vision-language models (VLMs), but it often produces explanations that are
linguistically fluent yet lack grounding in visual content. We observe that
such hallucinations arise in part from the absence of an explicit verification
mechanism during multi-step reasoning. To address this, we propose
\textbf{CoRGI}(\textbf{C}hain \textbf{o}f \textbf{R}easoning with
\textbf{G}rounded \textbf{I}nsights), a modular framework that introduces
visual verification into the reasoning process. CoRGI follows a three-stage
pipeline: it first generates a textual reasoning chain, then extracts
supporting visual evidence for each reasoning step via a dedicated module
(VEVM), and finally synthesizes the textual rationale with visual evidence to
generate a grounded, verified answer. The framework can be integrated with
existing VLMs without end-to-end retraining. We evaluate CoRGI on the VCR
benchmark and find that it improves reasoning performance on two representative
open-source VLM backbones, Qwen-2.5VL and LLaVA-1.6. Ablation studies confirm
the contribution of each step in the verification module, and human evaluations
suggest that CoRGI leads to more factual and helpful explanations. We also
examine alternative designs for the visual verification step and discuss
potential limitations of post-hoc verification frameworks. These findings
highlight the importance of grounding intermediate reasoning steps in visual

### [150] [Theory of Mind Using Active Inference: A Framework for Multi-Agent Cooperation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00401)
*Riddhi J. Pitliya,Ozan Catal,Toon Van de Maele,Corrado Pezzato,Tim Verbelen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于心智理论（ToM）的多智能体协作方法，通过主动推理实现，无需任务特定的共享生成模型或显式通信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体协作中如何理解并推理其他智能体的信念和目标的问题，提升协作效率。

Method: 在主动推理框架中引入ToM，维护自身和他人的信念与目标表示，并扩展推理树规划算法进行递归推理。

Result: 在避碰和觅食任务中，ToM智能体表现出更好的协作能力，能避免碰撞并减少冗余行为。

Conclusion: 该方法为人工智能的实用应用提供了新思路，同时为ToM的计算机制提供了见解。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to multi-agent cooperation by implementing theory
of mind (ToM) within active inference. ToM - the ability to understand that
others can have differing knowledge and goals - enables agents to reason about
others' beliefs while planning their own actions. Unlike previous active
inference approaches to multi-agent cooperation, our method neither relies on
task-specific shared generative models nor requires explicit communication,
while being generalisable. In our framework, the ToM-equipped agent maintains
distinct representations of its own and others' beliefs and goals. We extend
the sophisticated inference tree-based planning algorithm to systematically
explore joint policy spaces through recursive reasoning. Our approach is
evaluated through collision avoidance and foraging task simulations. Results
demonstrate that ToM-equipped agents cooperate better compared to non-ToM
counterparts by being able to avoid collisions and reduce redundant efforts.
Crucially, ToM agents accomplish this by inferring others' beliefs solely from
observable behaviour. This work advances practical applications in artificial
intelligence while providing computational insights into ToM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代理系统多为闭源或依赖付费API，限制了研究的可访问性和可复现性。

Method: 通过高质量训练数据的构建和代理测试时反思与投票策略，提升代理性能。

Result: 在GAIA基准测试中取得开源免费代理中的最佳性能，8B参数模型超越WebDancer和WebSailor。

Conclusion: Cognitive Kernel-Pro为高能力AI代理设立了新的性能标准，推动了开源社区的发展。

Abstract: General AI Agents are increasingly recognized as foundational frameworks for
the next generation of artificial intelligence, enabling complex reasoning, web
interaction, coding, and autonomous research capabilities. However, current
agent systems are either closed-source or heavily reliant on a variety of paid
APIs and proprietary tools, limiting accessibility and reproducibility for the
research community. In this work, we present \textbf{Cognitive Kernel-Pro}, a
fully open-source and (to the maximum extent) free multi-module agent framework
designed to democratize the development and evaluation of advanced AI agents.
Within Cognitive Kernel-Pro, we systematically investigate the curation of
high-quality training data for Agent Foundation Models, focusing on the
construction of queries, trajectories, and verifiable answers across four key
domains: web, file, code, and general reasoning. Furthermore, we explore novel
strategies for agent test-time reflection and voting to enhance agent
robustness and performance. We evaluate Cognitive Kernel-Pro on GAIA, achieving
state-of-the-art results among open-source and free agents. Notably, our
8B-parameter open-source model surpasses previous leading systems such as
WebDancer and WebSailor, establishing a new performance standard for
accessible, high-capability AI agents. Code is available at

*Andrea Asperti,Alberto Naibo,Claudio Sacerdoti Coen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs在结构化推理和符号任务中表现出色，但在形式数学（如定理证明）中进展较慢。本文探讨了LLMs在数学认知中的三个核心问题：形式与非形式数学的训练权衡、证明生成比代码合成更脆弱的原因，以及LLMs是否真正表示逻辑状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在数学领域的应用潜力，尤其是形式数学中的局限性，以揭示其推理和监督机制的本质。

Method: 分析当前最先进的模型和基准，探讨LLMs在数学认知中的三个关键问题。

Result: 发现LLMs在形式数学中的表现不如编程任务，揭示了其推理能力的局限性。

Conclusion: 旨在明确当前LLMs的边界，并探讨如何扩展其在数学领域的应用能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable abilities in structured
reasoning and symbolic tasks, with coding emerging as a particular area of
strength. This success has sparked growing interest in applying LLMs to
mathematics, both in informal problem-solving and formal theorem proving.
However, progress in formal mathematics has proven to be significantly more
difficult, despite surface-level similarities between programming and proof
construction. This discrepancy raises important questions about how LLMs
``reason'', how they are supervised, and whether they internally track a notion
of computational or deductive state. In this article, we address the
state-of-the-art of the discipline, focusing on recent models and benchmarks,
and explore three central issues at the intersection of machine learning and
mathematical cognition: (i) the trade-offs between formal and informal
mathematics as training domains; (ii) the deeper reasons why proof generation
remains more brittle than code synthesis; (iii) and the question of whether
LLMs represent, or merely mimic, a notion of evolving logical state. Our goal
is not to draw hard boundaries, but to identify where the current limits lie,
and how they might be extended.

*Haoyu Wang,Chris M. Poskitt,Jun Sun,Jiali Wei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Pro2Guard是一个基于概率可达性分析的主动运行时安全框架，通过学习代理行为的离散时间马尔可夫链（DTMC）来预测未来风险，并在风险超过阈值时提前干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于规则的安全系统（如AgentSpec）缺乏前瞻性，难以应对长期依赖和分布偏移，因此需要一种主动的安全框架。

Method: Pro2Guard将代理行为抽象为符号状态，从执行轨迹中学习DTMC，运行时通过估计到达不安全状态的概率来预测风险，并结合语义有效性检查和PAC边界确保统计可靠性。

Result: 在家庭代理和自动驾驶场景中，Pro2Guard分别实现了93.6%的不安全任务早期阻止和100%的交通违规及碰撞预测，风险预测时间最长可达38.66秒。

Conclusion: Pro2Guard通过主动预测和干预，显著提升了LLM代理的安全性，同时保持了任务的完成率。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents exhibit powerful autonomous capabilities
across domains such as robotics, virtual assistants, and web automation.
However, their stochastic behavior introduces significant safety risks that are
difficult to anticipate. Existing rule-based enforcement systems, such as
AgentSpec, focus on developing reactive safety rules, which typically respond
only when unsafe behavior is imminent or has already occurred. These systems
lack foresight and struggle with long-horizon dependencies and distribution
shifts. To address these limitations, we propose Pro2Guard, a proactive runtime
enforcement framework grounded in probabilistic reachability analysis.
Pro2Guard abstracts agent behaviors into symbolic states and learns a
Discrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) from execution traces. At runtime, it
anticipates future risks by estimating the probability of reaching unsafe
states, triggering interventions before violations occur when the predicted
risk exceeds a user-defined threshold. By incorporating semantic validity
checks and leveraging PAC bounds, Pro2Guard ensures statistical reliability
while approximating the underlying ground-truth model. We evaluate Pro2Guard
extensively across two safety-critical domains: embodied household agents and
autonomous vehicles. In embodied agent tasks, Pro2Guard enforces safety early
on up to 93.6% of unsafe tasks using low thresholds, while configurable modes
(e.g., reflect) allow balancing safety with task success, maintaining up to
80.4% task completion. In autonomous driving scenarios, Pro2Guard achieves 100%
prediction of traffic law violations and collisions, anticipating risks up to
38.66 seconds ahead.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MultiSHAP是一个模型无关的可解释性框架，用于量化多模态AI模型中视觉和文本元素之间的协同效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态AI模型在需要整合多种模态信息的任务中表现出色，但其“黑盒”特性在高风险应用中限制了部署，因为可解释性和可信度至关重要。

Method: MultiSHAP利用Shapley Interaction Index，将多模态预测归因于视觉和文本元素之间的成对交互，适用于开源和闭源模型。

Result: 实验证明MultiSHAP能够准确捕捉跨模态推理机制，并提供实例级和数据集级的解释。

Conclusion: MultiSHAP为解释复杂多模态AI模型提供了通用解决方案，并可扩展到两种以上的模态。

Abstract: Multimodal AI models have achieved impressive performance in tasks that
require integrating information from multiple modalities, such as vision and
language. However, their "black-box" nature poses a major barrier to deployment
in high-stakes applications where interpretability and trustworthiness are
essential. How to explain cross-modal interactions in multimodal AI models
remains a major challenge. While existing model explanation methods, such as
attention map and Grad-CAM, offer coarse insights into cross-modal
relationships, they cannot precisely quantify the synergistic effects between
modalities, and are limited to open-source models with accessible internal
weights. Here we introduce MultiSHAP, a model-agnostic interpretability
framework that leverages the Shapley Interaction Index to attribute multimodal
predictions to pairwise interactions between fine-grained visual and textual
elements (such as image patches and text tokens), while being applicable to
both open- and closed-source models. Our approach provides: (1) instance-level
explanations that reveal synergistic and suppressive cross-modal effects for
individual samples - "why the model makes a specific prediction on this input",
and (2) dataset-level explanation that uncovers generalizable interaction
patterns across samples - "how the model integrates information across
modalities". Experiments on public multimodal benchmarks confirm that MultiSHAP
faithfully captures cross-modal reasoning mechanisms, while real-world case
studies demonstrate its practical utility. Our framework is extensible beyond
two modalities, offering a general solution for interpreting complex multimodal
AI models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预咨询是医疗保健的关键环节，但直接从复杂电子病历生成问卷存在挑战，现有LLM方法在信息完整性和逻辑性上表现不佳。

Method: 分三个阶段：1) 提取原子断言；2) 构建个人因果网络并合成疾病知识；3) 基于结构化表示生成个性化问卷。

Result: 在真实电子病历数据集上验证，方法在信息覆盖、诊断相关性、可理解性和生成时间上表现优越。

Conclusion: 该框架通过显式临床知识构建，提升了预咨询问卷的质量和效率，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Pre-consultation is a critical component of effective healthcare delivery.
However, generating comprehensive pre-consultation questionnaires from complex,
voluminous Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) is a challenging task. Direct
Large Language Model (LLM) approaches face difficulties in this task,
particularly regarding information completeness, logical order, and
disease-level synthesis. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-stage
LLM-driven framework: Stage 1 extracts atomic assertions (key facts with
timing) from EMRs; Stage 2 constructs personal causal networks and synthesizes
disease knowledge by clustering representative networks from an EMR corpus;
Stage 3 generates tailored personal and standardized disease-specific
questionnaires based on these structured representations. This framework
overcomes limitations of direct methods by building explicit clinical
knowledge. Evaluated on a real-world EMR dataset and validated by clinical
experts, our method demonstrates superior performance in information coverage,
diagnostic relevance, understandability, and generation time, highlighting its
practical potential to enhance patient information collection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI在生成复杂交互式音视频内容（如视频游戏）时缺乏自动化评估指标和难以处理复杂内容的挑战。

Method: 提出AVR-Eval评估指标，通过音视频记录比较内容质量；开发AVR-Agent多智能体系统，从多媒体资源库生成并优化JavaScript代码。

Result: AVR-Agent生成的内容在质量上显著优于单次生成的内容，但模型在利用定制资源和反馈方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 当前模型在利用高质量资源和音视频反馈方面与人类存在差距，揭示了机器与人类内容创作方法的根本差异。

Abstract: While AI excels at generating text, audio, images, and videos, creating
interactive audio-visual content such as video games remains challenging.
Current LLMs can generate JavaScript games and animations, but lack automated
evaluation metrics and struggle with complex content that normally requires
teams of humans working for many months (multi-shot, multi-agents) using assets
made by artists. To tackle these issues, we built a new metric and a
multi-agent system.
  We propose AVR-Eval, a relative metric for multimedia content quality using
Audio-Visual Recordings (AVRs). An omni-modal model (processing text, video,
and audio) compares the AVRs of two contents, with a text model reviewing
evaluations to determine superiority. We show that AVR-Eval properly identifies
good from broken or mismatched content.
  We built AVR-Agent, a multi-agent system generating JavaScript code from a
bank of multimedia assets (audio, images, 3D models). The coding agent selects
relevant assets, generates multiple initial codes, uses AVR-Eval to identify
the best version, and iteratively improves it through omni-modal agent feedback
from the AVR.
  We run experiments on games and animations with AVR-Eval (win rate of content
A against B). We find that content generated by AVR-Agent has a significantly
higher win rate against content made through one-shot generation. However,
models struggle to leverage custom assets and AVR feedback effectively, showing
no higher win rate. This reveals a critical gap: while humans benefit from
high-quality assets and audio-visual feedback, current coding models do not
seem to utilize these resources as effectively, highlighting fundamental
differences between human and machine content creation approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解时间序列中的因果关系对多个领域至关重要，但现有方法（如变滞后格兰杰因果关系）未能考虑频率依赖性延迟，限制了其适用性。

Method: 提出MB-VLGC框架，通过显式建模频率依赖性因果延迟，扩展了传统VLGC方法，并设计了一个高效的推理流程。

Result: 实验表明，MB-VLGC在合成和真实数据集上显著优于现有方法，具有广泛适用性。

Conclusion: MB-VLGC框架为时间序列因果分析提供了更灵活和准确的工具，适用于多领域应用。

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships in time series is fundamental to many
domains, including neuroscience, economics, and behavioral science. Granger
causality is one of the well-known techniques for inferring causality in time
series. Typically, Granger causality frameworks have a strong fix-lag
assumption between cause and effect, which is often unrealistic in complex
systems. While recent work on variable-lag Granger causality (VLGC) addresses
this limitation by allowing a cause to influence an effect with different time
lags at each time point, it fails to account for the fact that causal
interactions may vary not only in time delay but also across frequency bands.
For example, in brain signals, alpha-band activity may influence another region
with a shorter delay than slower delta-band oscillations. In this work, we
formalize Multi-Band Variable-Lag Granger Causality (MB-VLGC) and propose a
novel framework that generalizes traditional VLGC by explicitly modeling
frequency-dependent causal delays. We provide a formal definition of MB-VLGC,
demonstrate its theoretical soundness, and propose an efficient inference
pipeline. Extensive experiments across multiple domains demonstrate that our
framework significantly outperforms existing methods on both synthetic and
real-world datasets, confirming its broad applicability to any type of time
series data. Code and datasets are publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI驱动的自适应学习系统缺乏透明度，且现有XAI技术忽视用户角色和理解需求。

Method: 提出混合框架，整合传统XAI技术与生成式AI模型，结合用户个性化需求，生成动态解释。

Result: 框架重新定义可解释性为动态沟通过程，并探讨了教育中XAI的局限性及研究方向。

Conclusion: 目标是推动可解释AI在增强透明度的同时，支持以用户为中心的体验。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence-driven adaptive learning systems are reshaping
education through data-driven adaptation of learning experiences. Yet many of
these systems lack transparency, offering limited insight into how decisions
are made. Most explainable AI (XAI) techniques focus on technical outputs but
neglect user roles and comprehension. This paper proposes a hybrid framework
that integrates traditional XAI techniques with generative AI models and user
personalisation to generate multimodal, personalised explanations tailored to
user needs. We redefine explainability as a dynamic communication process
tailored to user roles and learning goals. We outline the framework's design,
key XAI limitations in education, and research directions on accuracy,
fairness, and personalisation. Our aim is to move towards explainable AI that
enhances transparency while supporting user-centred experiences.

Motivation: 当前社交媒体AI推荐缺乏针对用户特定需求的解释性，导致用户不理解推荐原因，影响体验。

Method: 提出用户分段和上下文感知的解释层，采用视觉化解释系统，支持不同风格（视觉vs数字）和粒度（专家vs普通用户）的解释。

Result: 框架首次在单一流程中联合调整解释风格和粒度，并通过30名X用户的公开试验验证其对决策和信任的影响。

Conclusion: 该视觉解释系统有望提升用户对AI推荐的理解和信任。

Abstract: Social media platforms today strive to improve user experience through AI
recommendations, yet the value of such recommendations vanishes as users do not
understand the reasons behind them. This issue arises because explainability in
social media is general and lacks alignment with user-specific needs. In this
vision paper, we outline a user-segmented and context-aware explanation layer
by proposing a visual explanation system with diverse explanation methods. The
proposed system is framed by the variety of user needs and contexts, showing
explanations in different visualized forms, including a technically detailed
version for AI experts and a simplified one for lay users. Our framework is the
first to jointly adapt explanation style (visual vs. numeric) and granularity
(expert vs. lay) inside a single pipeline. A public pilot with 30 X users will
validate its impact on decision-making and trust.

Result: 在音频和图像假内容检测中表现优异，计算高效且适应少样本场景。

Conclusion: 预训练多模态模型特征为通用假内容检测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Generative models achieve remarkable results in multiple data domains,
including images and texts, among other examples. Unfortunately, malicious
users exploit synthetic media for spreading misinformation and disseminating
deepfakes. Consequently, the need for robust and stable fake detectors is
pressing, especially when new generative models appear everyday. While the
majority of existing work train classifiers that discriminate between real and
fake information, such tools typically generalize only within the same family
of generators and data modalities, yielding poor results on other generative
classes and data domains. Towards a universal classifier, we propose the use of
large pre-trained multi-modal models for the detection of generative content.
Effectively, we show that the latent code of these models naturally captures
information discriminating real from fake. Building on this observation, we
demonstrate that linear classifiers trained on these features can achieve
state-of-the-art results across various modalities, while remaining
computationally efficient, fast to train, and effective even in few-shot
settings. Our work primarily focuses on fake detection in audio and images,
achieving performance that surpasses or matches that of strong baseline
methods.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为OSF的遮挡鲁棒风格化框架，用于解决基于绘图的3D动画中因遮挡导致的风格退化问题，并显著提升了推理速度和内存效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理基于绘图的3D动画时，因训练与推理中的姿态差异（遮挡问题）导致风格属性（如粗糙轮廓和独特笔触）退化，影响动画质量。

Method: 提出OSF框架，利用光流提供遮挡鲁棒的边缘引导，确保风格一致性，同时采用单阶段方法替代传统两阶段流程。

Result: OSF在遮挡情况下仍能保持风格一致性，推理速度提升2.4倍，内存占用减少2.1倍。

Conclusion: OSF有效解决了基于绘图的3D动画中的风格退化问题，显著提升了性能和效率。

Abstract: 3D animation aims to generate a 3D animated video from an input image and a
target 3D motion sequence. Recent advances in image-to-3D models enable the
creation of animations directly from user-hand drawings. Distinguished from
conventional 3D animation, drawing-based 3D animation is crucial to preserve
artist's unique style properties, such as rough contours and distinct stroke
patterns. However, recent methods still exhibit quality deterioration in style
properties, especially under occlusions caused by overlapping body parts,
leading to contour flickering and stroke blurring. This occurs due to a
`stylization pose gap' between training and inference in stylization networks
designed to preserve drawing styles in drawing-based 3D animation systems. The
stylization pose gap denotes that input target poses used to train the
stylization network are always in occlusion-free poses, while target poses
encountered in an inference include diverse occlusions under dynamic motions.
To this end, we propose Occlusion-robust Stylization Framework (OSF) for
drawing-based 3D animation. We found that while employing object's edge can be
effective input prior for guiding stylization, it becomes notably inaccurate
when occlusions occur at inference. Thus, our proposed OSF provides
occlusion-robust edge guidance for stylization network using optical flow,
ensuring a consistent stylization even under occlusions. Furthermore, OSF
operates in a single run instead of the previous two-stage method, achieving
2.4x faster inference and 2.1x less memory.

Abstract: The interactive visual analysis of set-typed data, i.e., data with attributes
that are of type set, is a rewarding area of research and applications.
Valuable prior work has contributed solutions that enable the study of such
data with individual set-typed dimensions. In this paper, we present CrossSet,
a novel method for the joint study of two set-typed dimensions and their
interplay. Based on a task analysis, we describe a new, multi-scale approach to
the interactive visual exploration and analysis of such data. Two set-typed
data dimensions are jointly visualized using a hierarchical matrix layout,
enabling the analysis of the interactions between two set-typed attributes at
several levels, in addition to the analysis of individual such dimensions.
CrossSet is anchored at a compact, large-scale overview that is complemented by
drill-down opportunities to study the relations between and within the
set-typed dimensions, enabling an interactive visual multi-scale exploration
and analysis of bivariate set-typed data. Such an interactive approach makes it
possible to study single set-typed dimensions in detail, to gain an overview of
the interaction and association between two such dimensions, to refine one of
the dimensions to gain additional details at several levels, and to drill down
to the specific interactions of individual set-elements from the set-typed
dimensions. To demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CrossSet, we
have evaluated the new method in the context of several application scenarios.

Abstract: Text-to-3D (T23D) generation has transformed digital content creation, yet
remains bottlenecked by blind trial-and-error prompting processes that yield
unpredictable results. While visual prompt engineering has advanced in
text-to-image domains, its application to 3D generation presents unique
challenges requiring multi-view consistency evaluation and spatial
understanding. We present Sel3DCraft, a visual prompt engineering system for
T23D that transforms unstructured exploration into a guided visual process. Our
approach introduces three key innovations: a dual-branch structure combining
retrieval and generation for diverse candidate exploration; a multi-view hybrid
scoring approach that leverages MLLMs with innovative high-level metrics to
assess 3D models with human-expert consistency; and a prompt-driven visual
analytics suite that enables intuitive defect identification and refinement.
Extensive testing and user studies demonstrate that Sel3DCraft surpasses other
T23D systems in supporting creativity for designers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注语义信息，忽略了音频中的空间属性（如位置和运动方向），而人类能够自然识别这些信息。SpA2V旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 1）音频引导的视频规划：利用MLLM从音频中提取空间和语义线索，构建视频场景布局（VSL）；2）布局引导的视频生成：将VSL作为条件输入预训练扩散模型，实现无训练的视频生成。

Result: 实验表明，SpA2V能生成与输入音频在语义和空间上高度对齐的真实视频。

Conclusion: SpA2V通过利用音频中的空间线索，显著提升了视频生成的准确性和真实性。

Abstract: Audio-driven video generation aims to synthesize realistic videos that align
with input audio recordings, akin to the human ability to visualize scenes from
auditory input. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on exploring
semantic information, such as the classes of sounding sources present in the
audio, limiting their ability to generate videos with accurate content and
spatial composition. In contrast, we humans can not only naturally identify the
semantic categories of sounding sources but also determine their deeply encoded
spatial attributes, including locations and movement directions. This useful
information can be elucidated by considering specific spatial indicators
derived from the inherent physical properties of sound, such as loudness or
frequency. As prior methods largely ignore this factor, we present SpA2V, the
first framework explicitly exploits these spatial auditory cues from audios to
generate videos with high semantic and spatial correspondence. SpA2V decomposes
the generation process into two stages: 1) Audio-guided Video Planning: We
meticulously adapt a state-of-the-art MLLM for a novel task of harnessing
spatial and semantic cues from input audio to construct Video Scene Layouts
(VSLs). This serves as an intermediate representation to bridge the gap between
the audio and video modalities. 2) Layout-grounded Video Generation: We develop
an efficient and effective approach to seamlessly integrate VSLs as conditional
guidance into pre-trained diffusion models, enabling VSL-grounded video
generation in a training-free manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SpA2V excels in generating realistic videos with semantic and spatial alignment
to the input audios.
