Project page:\n  https://ubisoft-laforge.github.io/world/chord", "summary": "Material creation and reconstruction are crucial for appearance modeling but\ntraditionally require significant time and expertise from artists. While recent\nmethods leverage visual foundation models to synthesize PBR materials from\nuser-provided inputs, they often fall short in quality, flexibility, and user\ncontrol. We propose a novel two-stage generate-and-estimate framework for PBR\nmaterial generation. In the generation stage, a fine-tuned diffusion model\nsynthesizes shaded, tileable texture images aligned with user input. In the\nestimation stage, we introduce a chained decomposition scheme that sequentially\npredicts SVBRDF channels by passing previously extracted representation as\ninput into a single-step image-conditional diffusion model. Our method is\nefficient, high quality, and enables flexible user control. We evaluate our\napproach against existing material generation and estimation methods,\ndemonstrating superior performance. Our material estimation method shows strong\nrobustness on both generated textures and in-the-wild photographs. Furthermore,\nwe highlight the flexibility of our framework across diverse applications,\nincluding text-to-material, image-to-material, structure-guided generation, and\nmaterial editing."}

This paper\npresents the first analysis of video data leakage in FL using gradient\ninversion attacks. We evaluate two common video classification approaches: one\nemploying pre-trained feature extractors and another that processes raw video\nframes with simple transformations. Our initial results indicate that the use\nof feature extractors offers greater resilience against gradient inversion\nattacks. We also demonstrate that image super-resolution techniques can enhance\nthe frames extracted through gradient inversion attacks, enabling attackers to\nreconstruct higher-quality videos. Our experiments validate this across\nscenarios where the attacker has access to zero, one, or more reference frames\nfrom the target environment. We find that although feature extractors make\nattacks more challenging, leakage is still possible if the classifier lacks\nsufficient complexity. We, therefore, conclude that video data leakage in FL is\na viable threat, and the conditions under which it occurs warrant further\ninvestigation."}

A novel\nprivacy-preserving automated rosacea detection method inspired by clinical\npriors and trained entirely on synthetic data is presented in this paper.\nSpecifically, the proposed method, which leverages the observation that rosacea\nmanifests predominantly through central facial erythema, first constructs a\nfixed redness-informed mask by selecting regions with consistently high red\nchannel intensity across facial images. The mask thus is able to focus on\ndiagnostically relevant areas such as the cheeks, nose, and forehead and\nexclude identity-revealing features.

Parameter-Efficient\nFine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have emerged as a powerful solution, yet the\nlandscape of these techniques is diverse, with distinct methods operating in\neither the model's weight space or its representation space. This paper\ninvestigates the hypothesis that a synergistic combination of these paradigms\ncan unlock superior performance and efficiency. We introduce HEFT (Hierarchical\nEfficient Fine-Tuning), a novel hierarchical adaptation strategy that composes\ntwo distinct PEFT methods in a coarse-to-fine manner: first, a broad,\nfoundational adaptation in the weight space using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA),\nfollowed by a precise, surgical refinement of internal activations using\nRepresentation Fine-Tuning (ReFT). We evaluate this approach by fine-tuning a\nLlama-2-7B model on the BoolQ benchmark, a challenging dataset for inferential\nreasoning. Our results reveal a profound synergistic effect. A model fine-tuned\nfor only three epochs with our HEFT strategy achieves an accuracy of 85.17\\%,\nexceeding the performance of models trained for 20 epochs with either LoRA-only\n(85.05\\%) or ReFT-only (83.36\\%) methodologies. This work demonstrates that the\nthoughtful composition of PEFT methods is a potent algorithmic innovation,\noffering a more efficient and effective path toward advancing the reasoning\ncapabilities of language models. By achieving superior results with a fraction\nof the computational budget, our findings present a principled approach to\novercoming the obstacles inherent in adapting large-scale models for complex\ncognitive tasks."}

To solve this, DERN works in three steps: it first prunes\nredundant experts using router statistics; then it decomposes them into\nneuron-level expert segments, assigning each segment to its most compatible\nretained expert; and finally, it merges segments within each retained expert to\nbuild a compact representation. Experiments on Mixtral, Qwen, and DeepSeek SMoE\nmodels show that DERN improves performance by more than 5% on commonsense\nreasoning and MMLU benchmarks under 50% expert sparsity, without extra\ntraining.

We then carry out a large-scale\nanalysis of ICL ablating out or accounting for memorisation, pretraining,\ndistributional shifts, and prompting style and phrasing.

Their core weakness is a fundamental\ninability to perform robust counterfactual reasoning: to determine if\ncorrecting a single action would have actually averted the task failure. To\nbridge this counterfactual inference gap, we introduce Abduct-Act-Predict (A2P)\nScaffolding, a novel agent framework that transforms failure attribution from\npattern recognition into a structured causal inference task. A2P explicitly\nguides a large language model through a formal three-step reasoning process\nwithin a single inference pass: (1) Abduction, to infer the hidden root causes\nbehind an agent's actions; (2) Action, to define a minimal corrective\nintervention; and (3) Prediction, to simulate the subsequent trajectory and\nverify if the intervention resolves the failure. This structured approach\nleverages the holistic context of the entire conversation while imposing a\nrigorous causal logic on the model's analysis. Our extensive experiments on the\nWho\\&When benchmark demonstrate its efficacy. On the Algorithm-Generated\ndataset, A2P achieves 47.46\\% step-level accuracy, a 2.85$\\times$ improvement\nover the 16.67\\% of the baseline. On the more complex Hand-Crafted dataset, it\nachieves 29.31\\% step accuracy, a 2.43$\\times$ improvement over the baseline's\n12.07\\%. By reframing the problem through a causal lens, A2P Scaffolding\nprovides a robust, verifiable, and significantly more accurate solution for\nautomated failure attribution."}

With advances in deep learning, neural network-based\ncompression methods have emerged. In this process, an encoder maps the image to\na low-dimensional latent space, which is then quantized, entropy-coded into a\nbinary bitstream, and transmitted to the receiver. At the receiver end, the\nbitstream is entropy-decoded, and a decoder reconstructs an approximation of\nthe original image. Recent research suggests that these models consistently\noutperform conventional codecs. However, they require significant processing\npower, making them unsuitable for real-time use on resource-constrained\nplatforms, which hinders their deployment in mainstream applications. This\nstudy aims to reduce the resource requirements of neural networks used for\nimage compression by leveraging knowledge distillation, a training paradigm\nwhere smaller neural networks, partially trained on the outputs of larger, more\ncomplex models, can achieve better performance than when trained independently.\nOur work demonstrates that knowledge distillation can be effectively applied to\nimage compression tasks: i) across various architecture sizes, ii) to achieve\ndifferent image quality/bit rate tradeoffs, and iii) to save processing and\nenergy resources.
