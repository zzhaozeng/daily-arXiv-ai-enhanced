However, a key\nchallenge in LLM-based textual graph QA systems lies in graph retrieval, i.e.,\nhow to retrieve relevant content from large graphs that is sufficiently\ninformative while remaining compact for the LLM context. Existing retrievers\nsuffer from poor performance since they either rely on shallow embedding\nsimilarity or employ interactive retrieving policies that demand excessive data\nlabeling and training cost. To address these issues, we present Graph-$S^3$, an\nagentic textual graph reasoning framework that employs an LLM-based retriever\ntrained with synthetic stepwise supervision. Instead of rewarding the agent\nbased on the final answers, which may lead to sparse and unstable training\nsignals, we propose to closely evaluate each step of the retriever based on\noffline-extracted golden subgraphs. Our main techniques include a data\nsynthesis pipeline to extract the golden subgraphs for reward generation and a\ntwo-stage training scheme to learn the interactive graph exploration policy\nbased on the synthesized rewards.

The ease of synthesizing from a generative model suggests using\n(unverified) synthetic data to augment a limited corpus of real data for the\npurpose of fine-tuning in the hope of improving performance. Unfortunately,\nhowever, the resulting positive feedback loop leads to model autophagy disorder\n(MAD, aka model collapse) that results in a rapid degradation in sample quality\nand/or diversity. In this paper, we introduce Neon (for Negative Extrapolation\nfrOm self-traiNing), a new learning method that turns the degradation from\nself-training into a powerful signal for self-improvement. Given a base model,\nNeon first fine-tunes it on its own self-synthesized data but then,\ncounterintuitively, reverses its gradient updates to extrapolate away from the\ndegraded weights. We prove that Neon works because typical inference samplers\nthat favor high-probability regions create a predictable anti-alignment between\nthe synthetic and real data population gradients, which negative extrapolation\ncorrects to better align the model with the true data distribution. Neon is\nremarkably easy to implement via a simple post-hoc merge that requires no new\nreal data, works effectively with as few as 1k synthetic samples, and typically\nuses less than 1% additional training compute. We demonstrate Neon's\nuniversality across a range of architectures (diffusion, flow matching,\nautoregressive, and inductive moment matching models) and datasets (ImageNet,\nCIFAR-10, and FFHQ). In particular, on ImageNet 256x256, Neon elevates the\nxAR-L model to a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.02 with only 0.36% additional\ntraining compute.

Additionally, prior research has\nshown that saccade landing positions are distributed around a target location\nrather than landing at a single point, and that even during fixations, eyes\nperform small microsaccades around a fixation point.

In this\nwork, we demonstrate that monocular visual odometry can be addressed\neffectively in an end-to-end manner, thereby eliminating the need for\nhandcrafted components such as bundle adjustment, feature matching, camera\ncalibration, or dense 3D reconstruction. We introduce VoT, short for Visual\nodometry Transformer, which processes sequences of monocular frames by\nextracting features and modeling global relationships through temporal and\nspatial attention. Unlike prior methods, VoT directly predicts camera motion\nwithout estimating dense geometry and relies solely on camera poses for\nsupervision. The framework is modular and flexible, allowing seamless\nintegration of various pre-trained encoders as feature extractors. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that VoT scales effectively with larger datasets, benefits\nsubstantially from stronger pre-trained backbones, generalizes across diverse\ncamera motions and calibration settings, and outperforms traditional methods\nwhile running more than 3 times faster. The code will be released."}

However, these approaches\nsuffer from drawbacks such as retrieval overhead and high annotation costs, and\nthey heavily rely on substituted external assistants to reach limited\nperformance in medical field. In this paper, we introduce MedReflect, a\ngeneralizable framework designed to inspire LLMs with a physician-like\nreflective thinking mode. MedReflect generates a single-pass reflection chain\nthat includes initial hypothesis generation, self-questioning, self-answering\nand decision refinement. This self-verified and self-reflective nature releases\nlarge language model's latent capability in medical problem-solving without\nexternal retrieval or heavy annotation. We demonstrate that MedReflect enables\ncost-efficient medical dataset construction: with merely 2,000 randomly sampled\ntraining examples and a light fine-tuning, this approach achieves notable\nabsolute accuracy improvements across a series of medical benchmarks while\ncutting annotation requirements. Our results provide evidence that LLMs can\nlearn to solve specialized medical problems via self-reflection and\nself-improve, reducing reliance on external supervision and extensive\ntask-specific fine-tuning data."}

Therefore, we introduce the first\nbiometric leakage defense without ever looking at the reconstructed RGB video:\na pose-conditioned, large-margin contrastive encoder that isolates persistent\nidentity cues inside the transmitted latent while cancelling transient pose and\nexpression. A simple cosine test on this disentangled embedding flags illicit\nidentity swaps as the video is rendered. Our experiments on multiple\ntalking-head generation models show that our method consistently outperforms\nexisting puppeteering defenses, operates in real-time, and shows strong\ngeneralization to out-of-distribution scenarios."}

Open-vocabulary object detection addresses this limitation by\nenabling models to identify unseen classes without explicit training.\nLeveraging pretrained models contrastively trained on abundantly available\nground-view image-text classification pairs provides a strong foundation for\nopen-vocabulary object detection in aerial imagery. Domain shifts, viewpoint\nvariations, and extreme scale differences make direct knowledge transfer across\ndomains ineffective, requiring specialized adaptation strategies.

Unlike keypoint matching, which focuses on localized\nfeatures, segment matching captures structured regions, offering greater\nrobustness to occlusions, lighting variations, and viewpoint changes. In this\npaper, we leverage the spatial understanding of 3D foundation models to tackle\nwide-baseline segment matching, a challenging setting involving extreme\nviewpoint shifts. We propose an architecture that uses the inductive bias of\nthese 3D foundation models to match segments across image pairs with up to 180\ndegree view-point change. Extensive experiments show that our approach\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods, including the SAM2 video propagator and\nlocal feature matching methods, by upto 30% on the AUPRC metric, on ScanNet++\nand Replica datasets.

While various methods have been proposed to\nassess the quality of images under different distortions such as blur and\nnoise, contrast distortion has been largely overlooked as its visual impact and\nproperties are different from other conventional types of distortions. In this\npaper, we propose a no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) metric for\ncontrast-distorted images. Using a set of contrast enhancement algorithms, we\naim to generate pseudo-reference images that are visually close to the actual\nreference image, such that the NR problem is transformed to a Full-reference\n(FR) assessment with higher accuracy. To this end, a large dataset of\ncontrast-enhanced images is produced to train a classification network that can\nselect the most suitable contrast enhancement algorithm based on image content\nand distortion for pseudo-reference image generation. Finally, the evaluation\nis performed in the FR manner to assess the quality difference between the\ncontrast-enhanced (pseudoreference) and degraded images.

Additionally, FAISS-based similarity retrieval is\nincorporated to provide a memory-like reference to previously encountered data,\nenriching the model's feature space.

Beyond garbage classification,\nwe validate the model on the Kolektor Surface Defect Dataset 2 (KolektorSDD2),\nwhich involves industrial defect detection on metal surfaces.

We study inter-character\ninteraction in text-to-video generation, where the key challenge is to preserve\neach character's identity and behaviors while enabling coherent cross-context\ninteraction. This is difficult because characters may never have coexisted and\nbecause mixing styles often causes style delusion, where realistic characters\nappear cartoonish or vice versa. We introduce a framework that tackles these\nissues with Cross-Character Embedding (CCE), which learns identity and\nbehavioral logic across multimodal sources, and Cross-Character Augmentation\n(CCA), which enriches training with synthetic co-existence and mixed-style\ndata. Together, these techniques allow natural interactions between previously\nuncoexistent characters without losing stylistic fidelity. Experiments on a\ncurated benchmark of cartoons and live-action series with 10 characters show\nclear improvements in identity preservation, interaction quality, and\nrobustness to style delusion, enabling new forms of generative\nstorytelling.Additional results and videos are available on our project page:\nhttps://tingtingliao.github.io/mimix/."}

To bridge these strengths, we introduce VChain,\na novel inference-time chain-of-visual-thought framework that injects visual\nreasoning signals from multimodal models into video generation. Specifically,\nVChain contains a dedicated pipeline that leverages large multimodal models to\ngenerate a sparse set of critical keyframes as snapshots, which are then used\nto guide the sparse inference-time tuning of a pre-trained video generator only\nat these key moments.

Inspired by this capability, multimodal foundation models\n(MFMs) have emerged as powerful tools for multimodal understanding and\ngeneration. However, today's MFMs fall short of serving as effective world\nmodels. They lack the essential ability such as perform counterfactual\nreasoning, simulate dynamics, understand the spatiotemporal information,\ncontrol generated visual outcomes, and perform multifaceted reasoning. We\ninvestigates what it takes to bridge the gap between multimodal foundation\nmodels and world models. We begin by improving the reasoning capabilities of\nMFMs through discriminative tasks and equipping MFMs with structured reasoning\nskills, such as causal inference, counterfactual thinking, and spatiotemporal\nreasoning, enabling them to go beyond surface correlations and understand\ndeeper relationships within visual and textual data. Next, we explore\ngenerative capabilities of multimodal foundation models across both image and\nvideo modalities, introducing new frameworks for structured and controllable\ngeneration. Our approaches incorporate scene graphs, multimodal conditioning,\nand multimodal alignment strategies to guide the generation process, ensuring\nconsistency with high-level semantics and fine-grained user intent.

Existing approaches typically optimize intermediate latents or text\nconditions during inference, but these methods deliver only modest gains or\nremain sensitive to hyperparameter tuning. In this work, we introduce\nContrastive Noise Optimization, a simple yet effective method that addresses\nthe diversity issue from a distinct perspective. Unlike prior techniques that\nadapt intermediate latents, our approach shapes the initial noise to promote\ndiverse outputs. Specifically, we develop a contrastive loss defined in the\nTweedie data space and optimize a batch of noise latents. Our contrastive\noptimization repels instances within the batch to maximize diversity while\nkeeping them anchored to a reference sample to preserve fidelity. We further\nprovide theoretical insights into the mechanism of this preprocessing to\nsubstantiate its effectiveness.

To identify such directions, we employ a Sparse Autoencoder\n(SAE), whose sparse latent space exposes semantically isolated dimensions. Our\nmethod operates directly on text embeddings without modifying the diffusion\nprocess, making it model agnostic and broadly applicable to various image\nsynthesis backbones. Experiments show that it enables intuitive and efficient\nmanipulations with continuous control across diverse attributes and domains."}

In this paper, we are the first to cast\nthis task as a text-conditioned joint generation, aiming to maintain consistent\non-screen framing while producing two heterogeneous, yet intrinsically linked,\nmodalities: human motion and camera trajectories. We propose a simple,\nmodel-agnostic framework that enforces multimodal coherence via an auxiliary\nmodality: the on-screen framing induced by projecting human joints onto the\ncamera. This on-screen framing provides a natural and effective bridge between\nmodalities, promoting consistency and leading to more precise joint\ndistribution. We first design a joint autoencoder that learns a shared latent\nspace, together with a lightweight linear transform from the human and camera\nlatents to a framing latent. We then introduce auxiliary sampling, which\nexploits this linear transform to steer generation toward a coherent framing\nmodality. To support this task, we also introduce the PulpMotion dataset, a\nhuman-motion and camera-trajectory dataset with rich captions, and high-quality\nhuman motions. Extensive experiments across DiT- and MAR-based architectures\nshow the generality and effectiveness of our method in generating on-frame\ncoherent human-camera motions, while also achieving gains on textual alignment\nfor both modalities. Our qualitative results yield more cinematographically\nmeaningful framings setting the new state of the art for this task.
