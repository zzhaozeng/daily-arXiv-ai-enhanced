We introduce a\ntwo-level framework to address this gap. The Information-Theoretic Imperative\n(ITI) establishes that any system persisting in uncertain environments must\nminimize epistemic entropy through predictive compression: this is the\nevolutionary \"why\" linking survival pressure to information-processing demands.\nThe Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) specifies how efficient compression\nmechanically selects for generative, causal models through\nexception-accumulation dynamics, making reality alignment a consequence rather\nthan a contingent achievement. Together, ITI and CEP define a causal chain:\nfrom survival pressure to prediction necessity, compression requirement,\nefficiency optimization, generative structure discovery, and ultimately reality\nalignment. Each link follows from physical, information-theoretic, or\nevolutionary constraints, implying that intelligence is the mechanically\nnecessary outcome of persistence in structured environments. This framework\nyields empirically testable predictions: compression efficiency, measured as\napproach to the rate-distortion frontier, correlates with out-of-distribution\ngeneralization; exception-accumulation rates differentiate causal from\ncorrelational models; hierarchical systems exhibit increasing efficiency across\nabstraction layers; and biological systems demonstrate metabolic costs that\ntrack representational complexity.

Large Language\nModels (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC.

Moreover, diverse intersection\ntypes present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and\ncross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous\nintersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation\n(RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable\nTSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning\nframework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency\nscenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to\ndistill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the\nreliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this\npaper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a\nReward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3\nadaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with\nenvironment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed\nreward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies\nacross heterogeneous intersections. On three real-world road networks with 17\nto 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC\nreduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle\nwaiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods."}

Regulatory texts (e.g., the General Data Protection\nRegulation, GDPR) are cross-referential and normative, while runtime contexts\nare expressed in unstructured natural language.

To this end, we introduce GraphCompliance, a framework\nthat represents regulatory texts as a Policy Graph and runtime contexts as a\nContext Graph, and aligns them. In this formulation, the policy graph encodes\nnormative structure and cross-references, whereas the context graph formalizes\nevents as subject-action-object (SAO) and entity-relation triples. This\nalignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM) in\nstructured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation\nand event parsing, enabling a focus on the core reasoning step. In experiments\non 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks,\nGraphCompliance yields 4.1-7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1 than\nLLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting\nin higher recall and lower false positive rates.

Our experiments across ten LLMs on four reasoning benchmarks\ndemonstrate that instruction style can shift accuracy by up to 16.7% points. We\nintroduce Cross-Response Similarity (CRS), a method applying RCScore metrics to\nmeasure stylistic self-consistency, and establish its strong correlation with\ntask accuracy, suggesting consistency as a valuable proxy for model\nreliability. Additional findings show that deterministic decoding produces more\nstylistically stable outputs, and model scale correlates positively with\ncross-style consistency.

We identify and formally\ncharacterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform\nand context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps,\nerasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement\nprocess, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in\nuniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token\nordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and\nsemantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are\nfrozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This\ntimestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an\nadaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of\nrefinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies\nuniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision\nsources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment\ncontrol, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves\nperplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers\nmaximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0).\nTogether, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep\nallocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving\nstable and controllable diffusion text generation."}

We introduce SCRIBE, a framework for multi-hop, tool-augmented\nreasoning designed to generate valid responses to student questions about\nfeedback reports.

If the\nagent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to\na corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a\ntwo-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies\nas a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an\nalignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value\nfunction, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits\nitself cannot harm the human's value.

To explain this\nsurprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we\napply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation.

We identify and formally\ncharacterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform\nand context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps,\nerasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement\nprocess, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in\nuniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token\nordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and\nsemantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are\nfrozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This\ntimestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an\nadaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of\nrefinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies\nuniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision\nsources.

In practice, they depend on a\nnon-differentiable decoding process that requires laborious, hand-tuning of\nhyperparameters like temperature and top-p. This paper introduces AutoDeco, a\nnovel architecture that enables truly \"end-to-end\" generation by learning to\ncontrol its own decoding strategy. We augment the standard transformer with\nlightweight heads that, at each step, dynamically predict context-specific\ntemperature and top-p values alongside the next-token logits. This approach\ntransforms decoding into a parametric, token-level process, allowing the model\nto self-regulate its sampling strategy within a single forward pass.\n  Through extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, we demonstrate that\nAutoDeco not only significantly outperforms default decoding strategies but\nalso achieves performance comparable to an oracle-tuned baseline derived from\n\"hacking the test set\"-a practical upper bound for any static method.\nCrucially, we uncover an emergent capability for instruction-based decoding\ncontrol: the model learns to interpret natural language commands (e.g.,\n\"generate with low randomness\") and adjusts its predicted temperature and top-p\non a token-by-token basis, opening a new paradigm for steerable and interactive\nLLM decoding."}

To realize this vision, we introduce\nasynchronous thinking (AsyncThink) as a new paradigm of reasoning with large\nlanguage models, which organizes the internal thinking process into\nconcurrently executable structures. Specifically, we propose a thinking\nprotocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges\nintermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. More importantly, the\nthinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized through\nreinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that AsyncThink achieves 28%\nlower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy\non mathematical reasoning. Moreover, AsyncThink generalizes its learned\nasynchronous thinking capabilities, effectively tackling unseen tasks without\nadditional training."}

To\naddress this, AMO-Bench introduces more rigorous challenges by ensuring all 50\nproblems are (1) cross-validated by experts to meet at least the International\nMathematical Olympiad (IMO) difficulty standards, and (2) entirely original\nproblems to prevent potential performance leakages from data memorization.\nMoreover, each problem in AMO-Bench requires only a final answer rather than a\nproof, enabling automatic and robust grading for evaluation. Experimental\nresults across 26 LLMs on AMO-Bench show that even the best-performing model\nachieves only 52.4% accuracy on AMO-Bench, with most LLMs scoring below 40%.\nBeyond these poor performances, our further analysis reveals a promising\nscaling trend with increasing test-time compute on AMO-Bench. These results\nhighlight the significant room for improving the mathematical reasoning in\ncurrent LLMs. We release AMO-Bench to facilitate further research into\nadvancing the reasoning abilities of language models.\nhttps://amo-bench.github.io/"}

Codebase-Level Understanding via Runtime Execution", "comment": null, "summary": "As coding agents are increasingly deployed in large codebases, the need to\nautomatically design challenging, codebase-level evaluation is central. We\npropose Gistify, a task where a coding LLM must create a single, minimal,\nself-contained file that can reproduce a specific functionality of a codebase.\nThe coding LLM is given full access to a codebase along with a specific\nentrypoint (e.g., a python command), and the generated file must replicate the\noutput of the same command ran under the full codebase, while containing only\nthe essential components necessary to execute the provided command. Success on\nGistify requires both structural understanding of the codebase, accurate\nmodeling of its execution flow as well as the ability to produce potentially\nlarge code patches.
