We introduce a\ntwo-level framework to address this gap. The Information-Theoretic Imperative\n(ITI) establishes that any system persisting in uncertain environments must\nminimize epistemic entropy through predictive compression: this is the\nevolutionary \"why\" linking survival pressure to information-processing demands.\nThe Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) specifies how efficient compression\nmechanically selects for generative, causal models through\nexception-accumulation dynamics, making reality alignment a consequence rather\nthan a contingent achievement. Together, ITI and CEP define a causal chain:\nfrom survival pressure to prediction necessity, compression requirement,\nefficiency optimization, generative structure discovery, and ultimately reality\nalignment. Each link follows from physical, information-theoretic, or\nevolutionary constraints, implying that intelligence is the mechanically\nnecessary outcome of persistence in structured environments. This framework\nyields empirically testable predictions: compression efficiency, measured as\napproach to the rate-distortion frontier, correlates with out-of-distribution\ngeneralization; exception-accumulation rates differentiate causal from\ncorrelational models; hierarchical systems exhibit increasing efficiency across\nabstraction layers; and biological systems demonstrate metabolic costs that\ntrack representational complexity.

Quality is assessed using a\nmulti-LLM evaluation framework that measures coverage, structure, and relevance\nin alignment with expert review standards. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat autosurvey2 consistently outperforms existing retrieval-based and\nautomated baselines, achieving higher scores in structural coherence and\ntopical relevance while maintaining strong citation fidelity. By combining\nretrieval, reasoning, and automated evaluation into a unified framework,\nautosurvey2 provides a scalable and reproducible solution for generating\nlong-form academic surveys and contributes a solid foundation for future\nresearch on automated scholarly writing.

It provides smoother rewards based on the similarity between\nthe model's actions and expert actions extracted from the SFT dataset in a\nstep-wise manner. This supervision offers richer learning signals even when all\nrollouts are incorrect, while encouraging flexible reasoning guided by expert\ndemonstrations. As a result, SRL enables small models to learn challenging\nproblems previously unlearnable by SFT or RLVR. Moreover, initializing training\nwith SRL before refining with RLVR yields the strongest overall performance.\nBeyond reasoning benchmarks, SRL generalizes effectively to agentic software\nengineering tasks, establishing it as a robust and versatile training framework\nfor reasoning-oriented LLMs."}

Large Language\nModels (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC.

Moreover, diverse intersection\ntypes present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and\ncross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous\nintersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation\n(RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable\nTSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning\nframework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency\nscenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to\ndistill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the\nreliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this\npaper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a\nReward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3\nadaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with\nenvironment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed\nreward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies\nacross heterogeneous intersections. On three real-world road networks with 17\nto 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC\nreduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle\nwaiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods."}

To this end, we introduce GraphCompliance, a framework\nthat represents regulatory texts as a Policy Graph and runtime contexts as a\nContext Graph, and aligns them.

We identify and formally\ncharacterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform\nand context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps,\nerasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement\nprocess, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in\nuniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token\nordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and\nsemantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are\nfrozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This\ntimestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an\nadaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of\nrefinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies\nuniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision\nsources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment\ncontrol, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves\nperplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers\nmaximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0).\nTogether, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep\nallocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving\nstable and controllable diffusion text generation."}

If the\nagent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to\na corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a\ntwo-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies\nas a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an\nalignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value\nfunction, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits\nitself cannot harm the human's value.

As this failure originates in\nuniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token\nordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and\nsemantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are\nfrozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This\ntimestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an\nadaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of\nrefinement strategies.

While large language models (LLMs)\nhave demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, their\nability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored. In this paper, we\nsystematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain\nfrom both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs\nreason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with\nnormative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a\ncommon formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a\nwide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic\ndomains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence\nhuman reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to\nvalid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific\ntypes of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those\nobserved in psychological studies of human reasoning. These findings highlight\nchallenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and\nprovide insights for enhancing their reliability.

In practice, they depend on a\nnon-differentiable decoding process that requires laborious, hand-tuning of\nhyperparameters like temperature and top-p. This paper introduces AutoDeco, a\nnovel architecture that enables truly \"end-to-end\" generation by learning to\ncontrol its own decoding strategy. We augment the standard transformer with\nlightweight heads that, at each step, dynamically predict context-specific\ntemperature and top-p values alongside the next-token logits. This approach\ntransforms decoding into a parametric, token-level process, allowing the model\nto self-regulate its sampling strategy within a single forward pass.\n  Through extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, we demonstrate that\nAutoDeco not only significantly outperforms default decoding strategies but\nalso achieves performance comparable to an oracle-tuned baseline derived from\n\"hacking the test set\"-a practical upper bound for any static method.\nCrucially, we uncover an emergent capability for instruction-based decoding\ncontrol: the model learns to interpret natural language commands (e.g.,\n\"generate with low randomness\") and adjusts its predicted temperature and top-p\non a token-by-token basis, opening a new paradigm for steerable and interactive\nLLM decoding."}

To realize this vision, we introduce\nasynchronous thinking (AsyncThink) as a new paradigm of reasoning with large\nlanguage models, which organizes the internal thinking process into\nconcurrently executable structures. Specifically, we propose a thinking\nprotocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges\nintermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. More importantly, the\nthinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized through\nreinforcement learning.

To\naddress this, AMO-Bench introduces more rigorous challenges by ensuring all 50\nproblems are (1) cross-validated by experts to meet at least the International\nMathematical Olympiad (IMO) difficulty standards, and (2) entirely original\nproblems to prevent potential performance leakages from data memorization.\nMoreover, each problem in AMO-Bench requires only a final answer rather than a\nproof, enabling automatic and robust grading for evaluation. Experimental\nresults across 26 LLMs on AMO-Bench show that even the best-performing model\nachieves only 52.4% accuracy on AMO-Bench, with most LLMs scoring below 40%.\nBeyond these poor performances, our further analysis reveals a promising\nscaling trend with increasing test-time compute on AMO-Bench.
