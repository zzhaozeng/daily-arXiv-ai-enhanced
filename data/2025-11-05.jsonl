In this paper, we introduce a new framework that decomposes\nmodality following into two fundamental factors: relative reasoning uncertainty\n(the case-specific confidence gap between unimodal predictions) and inherent\nmodality preference( a model's stable bias when uncertainties are balanced). To\nvalidate this framework, we construct a controllable dataset that\nsystematically varies the reasoning difficulty of visual and textual inputs.\nUsing entropy as a fine-grained uncertainty metric, we uncover a universal law:\nthe probability of following a modality decreases monotonically as its relative\nuncertainty increases. At the relative difficulty level where the model tends\nto follow both modalities with comparable probability what we call the balance\npoint, a practical indicator of the model's inherent preference. Unlike\ntraditional macro-level ratios, this measure offers a more principled and less\nconfounded way to characterize modality bias, disentangling it from unimodal\ncapabilities and dataset artifacts. Further, by probing layer-wise predictions,\nwe reveal the internal mechanism of oscillation: in ambiguous regions near the\nbalance point, models vacillate between modalities across layers, explaining\nexternally observed indecision.

However, for open-ended tasks\nlacking ground-truth solutions (e.g., creative writing and instruction\nfollowing), existing studies typically regard them as non-reasoning scenarios,\nthereby overlooking the latent value of reasoning capabilities. This raises a\nkey question: Can strengthening reasoning improve performance in open-ended\ntasks? To address this, we explore the transfer of the RLVR paradigm to the\nopen domain. Yet, since RLVR fundamentally relies on verifiers that presuppose\nthe existence of standard answers, it cannot be directly applied to open-ended\ntasks.

Experimental results on multiple\nbenchmarks validate the effectiveness of our method in improving LLM\nperformance on open-ended tasks.

The DVB uses a novel\nexperimental design with controlled confounding between deep values (e.g.,\nmoral principles) and shallow features (e.g., superficial attributes).

At the same\ntime, inference servers remain heavily optimized for chat completion. Prior\nwork has shown that large improvements to KV cache hit rate are possible if\ninference servers evolve towards these non-chat use cases. However, they offer\nsolutions that are also optimized for a single use case, RAG. In this paper, we\nintroduce the span query to generalize the interface to the inference server.\nWe demonstrate that chat, RAG, inference-time scaling, and agentic workloads\ncan all be expressed as span queries. We show how the critical distinction that\nhad been assumed by prior work lies in whether the order of the inputs matter\n-- do they commute? In chat, they do not. In RAG, they often do. This paper\nintroduces span queries, which are expression trees of inference calls, linked\ntogether with commutativity constraints. We describe span query syntax and\nsemantics. We show how they can be automatically optimized to improve KV cache\nlocality. We show how a small change to vLLM (affecting only 492 lines) can\nenable high-performance execution of span queries. Using this stack, we\ndemonstrate that span queries can achieve 10-20x reductions in TTFT for two\ndistinct non-chat use cases. Finally, we show that span queries can also be\noptimized to improve attention locality, so as to avoid the so-called\nlost-in-the-middle problem. We demonstrate that an attention-optimized span\nquery on a 2b parameter model vastly outperforms the accuracy of a stock\ninference server using an 8b model."}

To test this, we use a\nweighted regression model to isolate the language effect from socioeconomic and\ndemographic factors, finding that LRLCs have a share of AI users that is\napproximately 20% lower relative to their baseline. These results indicate that\nlinguistic accessibility is a significant, independent barrier to equitable AI\ndiffusion."}

In contrast, using only the\ncurrent turn avoids this overhead but discards essential information. This\ntrade-off limits the scalability of search agents. To address this challenge,\nwe propose MemSearcher, an agent workflow that iteratively maintains a compact\nmemory and combines the current turn with it. At each turn, MemSearcher fuses\nthe user's question with the memory to generate reasoning traces, perform\nsearch actions, and update memory to retain only information essential for\nsolving the task. This design stabilizes context length across multi-turn\ninteractions, improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. To optimize\nthis workflow, we introduce multi-context GRPO, an end-to-end RL framework that\njointly optimize reasoning, search strategies, and memory management of\nMemSearcher Agents. Specifically, multi-context GRPO samples groups of\ntrajectories under different contexts and propagates trajectory-level\nadvantages across all conversations within them. Trained on the same dataset as\nSearch-R1, MemSearcher achieves significant improvements over strong baselines\non seven public benchmarks: +11% on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and +12% on\nQwen2.5-7B-Instruct relative average gains. Notably, the 3B-based MemSearcher\neven outperforms 7B-based baselines, demonstrating that striking a balance\nbetween information integrity and efficiency yields both higher accuracy and\nlower computational overhead. The code and models will be publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/icip-cas/MemSearcher"}

Gormley"], "title": "Oolong: Evaluating Long Context Reasoning and Aggregation Capabilities", "comment": "Preprint", "summary": "As model context lengths continue to grow, concerns about whether models\neffectively use the full context length have persisted. While several carefully\ndesigned long-context evaluations have recently been released, these\nevaluations tend to rely on retrieval from one or more sections of the context,\nwhich allows nearly all of the context tokens to be disregarded as noise. This\nrepresents only one type of task that might be performed with long context. We\nintroduce Oolong, a benchmark of long-context reasoning tasks that require\nanalyzing individual chunks of text on an atomic level, and then aggregating\nthese analyses to answer distributional questions. Oolong is separated into two\ntask sets: Oolong-synth, a set of naturalistic synthetic tasks, where we can\neasily ablate components of the reasoning problem; and Oolong-real, a\ndownstream setting which requires reasoning over real-world conversational\ndata. Oolong requires models to reason over large quantities of examples, to\nperform both classification and counting in-context, and to reason over\ntemporal and user relations. Even frontier models struggle on Oolong, with\nGPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, and Gemini-2.5-Pro all achieving less than 50% accuracy\non both splits at 128K. We release the data and evaluation harness for Oolong\nto enable further development of models that can reason over large quantities\nof text."}
