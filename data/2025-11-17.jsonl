While effective GUI agents synergistically integrate planning and grounding capabilities, current methodologies exhibit two fundamental limitations: (1) insufficient exploitation of cross-model synergies, and (2) over-reliance on synthetic data generation without sufficient utilization. To address these challenges, we propose Co-EPG, a self-iterative training framework for Co-Evolution of Planning and Grounding. Co-EPG establishes an iterative positive feedback loop: through this loop, the planning model explores superior strategies under grounding-based reward guidance via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), generating diverse data to optimize the grounding model. Concurrently, the optimized Grounding model provides more effective rewards for subsequent GRPO training of the planning model, fostering continuous improvement. Co-EPG thus enables iterative enhancement of agent capabilities through self-play optimization and training data distillation. On the Multimodal-Mind2Web and AndroidControl benchmarks, our framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods after just three iterations without requiring external data. The agent consistently improves with each iteration, demonstrating robust self-enhancement capabilities. This work establishes a novel training paradigm for GUI agents, shifting from isolated optimization to an integrated, self-driven co-evolution approach."}

These modifications enhance graph fidelity while preserving the core spectral reasoning pipeline. Experimental results on ProofWriter, EntailmentBank, and CLUTRR benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains (up to +3.8\\%), improved generalization to adversarial cases, and reduced inference noise. The novelty lies in performing semantic and symbolic refinement entirely upstream of the spectral inference stage, enabling efficient, interpretable, and scalable reasoning without relying on quadratic attention mechanisms. In summary, this work extends the Spectral NSR framework with modular, semantically grounded preprocessing steps that improve graph quality without altering the core spectral reasoning engine. The result is a more robust, interpretable, and scalable reasoning system suitable for deployment in open-domain and real-world settings."}

To reduce the cognitive load on the decision maker, previous work has introduced the Pareto pruning problem, where the goal is to compute a fixed-size subset of Pareto optimal solutions that best represent the full set, as evaluated by a given quality measure. Reframing Pareto pruning as a multiwinner voting problem, we conduct an axiomatic analysis of existing quality measures, uncovering several unintuitive behaviors. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a new measure, directed coverage. We also analyze the computational complexity of optimizing various quality measures, identifying previously unknown boundaries between tractable and intractable cases depending on the number and structure of the objectives. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation, demonstrating that the choice of quality measure has a decisive impact on the characteristics of the selected set of solutions and that our proposed measure performs competitively or even favorably across a range of settings."}

Existing multi-objective alignment methods rely on manually specified preference weights, which not only burden users with difficult preference specification tasks but also lead to suboptimal training efficiency due to exploration of irrelevant preference combinations. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel framework named PRO, i.e., PReference Orchestrator, which features a lightweight preference adapter that automatically infers prompt-specific preference weights during both training and deployment phases. Specifically, the adapter automatically learns appropriate preference weights for each prompt by training on normalized reward scores from multiple reward models for preferred responses, which inherently reflect effective preference balances across objectives. Additionally, We provide theoretical analysis proving that our prompt-aware preference mechanism achieves superior performance compared to fixed preference weights in multi-objective alignment scenarios. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over existing multi-objective alignment approaches."}

It is even known that modern SAT solvers work efficiently on instances of small treewidth. Since these solvers are widely applied, research interests in compact encodings into (Q)SAT for solving and to understand encoding limitations. Even more general is the graph parameter clique-width, which unlike treewidth can be small for dense graphs. Although algorithms are available for clique-width, little is known about encodings. We initiate the quest to understand encoding capabilities with clique-width by considering abstract argumentation, which is a robust framework for reasoning with conflicting arguments. It is based on directed graphs and asks for computationally challenging properties, making it a natural candidate to study computational properties. We design novel reductions from argumentation problems to (Q)SAT. Our reductions linearly preserve the clique-width, resulting in directed decomposition-guided (DDG) reductions. We establish novel results for all argumentation semantics, including counting. Notably, the overhead caused by our DDG reductions cannot be significantly improved under reasonable assumptions."}

To remedy this, we propose section-based augmentation, where different sections of a patent (e.g., abstract, claims, background) serve as complementary views. This design introduces natural semantic and structural diversity, mitigating over-dispersion and yielding embeddings that better preserve both global structure and local continuity. On large-scale benchmarks, our fully self-supervised method matches or surpasses citation-and IPC-supervised baselines in prior-art retrieval and classification, while avoiding reliance on brittle or incomplete annotations.

PoR reveals the most probable ranking of potential outcomes for an individual, and PoB indicates the action most likely to yield the top-ranked outcome for an individual.

We evaluated 15 open-weight LLMs on pathology and radiology reports across six use cases, colorectal liver metastases, liver tumours, neurodegenerative diseases, soft-tissue tumours, melanomas, and sarcomas, at three institutes in the Netherlands, UK, and Czech Republic. Models included general-purpose and medical-specialised LLMs of various sizes, and six prompting strategies were compared: zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, self-consistency, and prompt graph. Performance was assessed using task-appropriate metrics, with consensus rank aggregation and linear mixed-effects models quantifying variance. Top-ranked models achieved macro-average scores close to inter-rater agreement across tasks. Small-to-medium general-purpose models performed comparably to large models, while tiny and specialised models performed worse. Prompt graph and few-shot prompting improved performance by ~13%. Task-specific factors, including variable complexity and annotation variability, influenced results more than model size or prompting strategy. These findings show that open-weight LLMs can extract structured data from clinical reports across diseases, languages, and institutions, offering a scalable approach for clinical data curation."}

While prior surveys focus on efficiency by examining how to shorten reasoning chains or reduce computation, this view overlooks a fundamental challenge: current LLMs apply uniform reasoning strategies regardless of task complexity, generating long traces for trivial problems while failing to extend reasoning for difficult tasks. This survey reframes reasoning through the lens of {adaptivity}: the capability to allocate reasoning effort based on input characteristics such as difficulty and uncertainty. We make three contributions. First, we formalize deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning within the LLM context, connecting these classical cognitive paradigms with their algorithmic realizations. Second, we formalize adaptive reasoning as a control-augmented policy optimization problem balancing task performance with computational cost, distinguishing learned policies from inference-time control mechanisms. Third, we propose a systematic taxonomy organizing existing methods into training-based approaches that internalize adaptivity through reinforcement learning, supervised fine-tuning, and learned controllers, and training-free approaches that achieve adaptivity through prompt conditioning, feedback-driven halting, and modular composition. This framework clarifies how different mechanisms realize adaptive reasoning in practice and enables systematic comparison across diverse strategies. We conclude by identifying open challenges in self-evaluation, meta-reasoning, and human-aligned reasoning control."}

A large challenge with traditional OCR methods is the inability to verify the accurate extraction of numbers. When applied to fiscal data, the inherent structure of fiscal tables, with totals at each level of the hierarchy, allows for robust internal validation of the extracted data. We use these hierarchical relationships to create multi-level validation checks. We demonstrate that LLMs can read tables and also process document-specific structural hierarchies, offering a scalable process for converting PDF-based fiscal disclosures into research-ready databases.

Despite their advantages, neural compressors struggle to generalize to unseen data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that performs Test-Time Steering via a Weighted Product of Experts (wPoE). At inference, our method adaptively combines a universal compression model with a pretrained neural language model, ensuring the compression rate is at least as good as that of the best individual model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of text compression without requiring fine-tuning. Furthermore, it seamlessly integrates with any autoregressive language model, providing a practical solution for enhancing text compression across diverse data distributions."}

However, existing approaches to evaluation often neglect statistical uncertainty quantification. With an applied statistics audience in mind, we provide background on LLM text generation and evaluation, and then describe a Bayesian approach for quantifying uncertainty in binary evaluation metrics. We focus in particular on uncertainty that is induced by the probabilistic text generation strategies typically deployed in LLM-based systems. We present two case studies applying this approach: 1) evaluating refusal rates on a benchmark of adversarial inputs designed to elicit harmful responses, and 2) evaluating pairwise preferences of one LLM over another on a benchmark of open-ended interactive dialogue examples.

Alexander"], "title": "LLM enhanced graph inference for long-term disease progression modelling", "comment": null, "summary": "Understanding the interactions between biomarkers among brain regions during neurodegenerative disease is essential for unravelling the mechanisms underlying disease progression. For example, pathophysiological models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) typically describe how variables, such as regional levels of toxic proteins, interact spatiotemporally within a dynamical system driven by an underlying biological substrate, often based on brain connectivity. However, current methods grossly oversimplify the complex relationship between brain connectivity by assuming a single-modality brain connectome as the disease-spreading substrate. This leads to inaccurate predictions of pathology spread, especially during the long-term progression period. Meanhwile, other methods of learning such a graph in a purely data-driven way face the identifiability issue due to lack of proper constraint. We thus present a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as expert guides on the interaction of regional variables to enhance learning of disease progression from irregularly sampled longitudinal patient data. By leveraging LLMs' ability to synthesize multi-modal relationships and incorporate diverse disease-driving mechanisms, our method simultaneously optimizes 1) the construction of long-term disease trajectories from individual-level observations and 2) the biologically-constrained graph structure that captures interactions among brain regions with better identifiability. We demonstrate the new approach by estimating the pathology propagation using tau-PET imaging data from an Alzheimer's disease cohort. The new framework demonstrates superior prediction accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional approaches while revealing additional disease-driving factors beyond conventional connectivity measures."}

In this context, understanding is defined as the ability to identify and rely on the correct decision factors, features that determine outcomes within a domain.

Evaluated on a stratified dataset of 200 Amended APPI Article 16 cases with clearly defined ground truth labels and multiple performance metrics, the system achieves 72% accuracy, which is 21 percentage points higher than a single-agent baseline, including 90% accuracy on clear compliance cases (vs. 16% for the baseline) while maintaining perfect detection of clear violations. While challenges remain in ambiguous scenarios, these results show that domain specialization and coordinated reasoning can meaningfully improve legal AI performance, providing a scalable and regulation-aware framework for trustworthy and interpretable automated compliance verification."}

Despite extensive training, these systems will inevitably encounter scenarios where no available course of action fully satisfies all operational constraints (e.g., operating procedures, rules, laws, norms, and goals). To achieve goals in accordance with human expectations and values, agents must go beyond their trained policies and instead construct, evaluate, and justify candidate courses of action. These processes require contextual \"knowledge\" that may lie outside prior (policy) training. This paper characterizes requirements for agent decision making in these contexts. It also identifies the types of knowledge agents require to make decisions robust to agent goals and aligned with human expectations. Drawing on both analysis and empirical case studies, we examine how agents need to integrate normative, pragmatic, and situational understanding to select and then to pursue more aligned courses of action in complex, real-world environments."}

Previous studies tend to rely on the model itself to implicitly learn semantic modeling during training, and resort to inefficient and costly manual annotations for these two challenges. To mitigate these limitations, we propose enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) speech projector, where each expert specializes in the semantic subspace of a specific language, enabling fine-grained modeling of speech features. Additionally, we introduce a multi-stage training paradigm that utilizes readily available monolingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) and monolingual ST data, facilitating speech-text alignment and improving translation capabilities. During training, we leverage a combination of language-specific loss and intra-group load balancing loss to guide the MoE speech projector in efficiently allocating tokens to the appropriate experts, across expert groups and within each group, respectively. To bridge the data gap across different training stages and improve adaptation to the CS scenario, we further employ a transition loss, enabling smooth transitions of data between stages, to effectively address the scarcity of high-quality CS speech translation data. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our approach."}

Gent", "Christopher Jefferson"], "title": "Faster Symmetry Breaking Constraints for Abstract Structures", "comment": null, "summary": "In constraint programming and related paradigms, a modeller specifies their problem in a modelling language for a solver to search and return its solution(s). Using high-level modelling languages such as Essence, a modeller may express their problems in terms of abstract structures. These are structures not natively supported by the solvers, and so they have to be transformed into or represented as other structures before solving. For example, nested sets are abstract structures, and they can be represented as matrices in constraint solvers. Many problems contain symmetries and one very common and highly successful technique used in constraint programming is to \"break\" symmetries, to avoid searching for symmetric solutions. This can speed up the solving process by many orders of magnitude. Most of these symmetry-breaking techniques involve placing some kind of ordering for the variables of the problem, and picking a particular member under the symmetries, usually the smallest. Unfortunately, applying this technique to abstract variables produces a very large number of complex constraints that perform poorly in practice. In this paper, we demonstrate a new incomplete method of breaking the symmetries of abstract structures by better exploiting their representations. We apply the method in breaking the symmetries arising from indistinguishable objects, a commonly occurring type of symmetry, and show that our method is faster than the previous methods proposed in (Akgün et al. 2025)."}

Here we propose Differentiable Simulation for Search (DSS), a framework that leverages the differentiable simulator Waymax as both a next state predictor and a critic. It relies on the simulator's hardcoded dynamics, making state predictions highly accurate, while utilizing the simulator's differentiability to effectively search across action sequences.

To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage demonstration selection method, TopK + Label Distribution Divergence (L2D), which leverages a fine-tuned BERT-like small language model (SLM) to generate label distributions and calculate their divergence for both test inputs and candidate demonstrations. This enables the selection of demonstrations that are not only semantically similar but also aligned in label distribution with the test input. Extensive experiments across seven text classification benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms previous demonstration selection strategies.

Applying complex layers or even training standalone networks for better prediction introduces high computation overhead. In this paper, we propose pre-attention expert prediction to achieve accurate and lightweight expert prefetching. The key insight is that some functions in LLMs are ranking-preserving, indicating that matching the ranking of selected experts using simple linear functions is possible. Therefore, we utilize the activations before the attention block in the same layer with 2 linear functions and ranking-aware loss to achieve accurate prediction, which also supports prefetching in the first layer.

We conducted a systematic analysis using statistical methods to verify how sensitive the Attack Success Rate (ASR) is when we apply variations to prompts designed to elicit inappropriate content from LLMs. Our results show that even small prompt modifications can significantly change the Attack Success Rate (ASR) according to the statistical tests we run, making the models more or less susceptible to types of attack.

Although the Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) paradigm offers a promising solution by promoting consensus among multiple agents to enhance reliability, it relies on the unrealistic assumption that all debaters are rational and reflective, which is a condition that may not hold when agents themselves are prone to hallucinations. To address this gap, we introduce the Multi-agent Undercover Gaming (MUG) protocol, inspired by social deduction games like \"Who is Undercover?\". MUG reframes MAD as a process of detecting \"undercover\" agents (those suffering from hallucinations) by employing multimodal counterfactual tests. Specifically, we modify reference images to introduce counterfactual evidence and observe whether agents can accurately identify these changes, providing ground-truth for identifying hallucinating agents and enabling robust, crowd-powered multimodal reasoning. MUG advances MAD protocols along three key dimensions: (1) enabling factual verification beyond statistical consensus through counterfactual testing; (2) introducing cross-evidence reasoning via dynamically modified evidence sources instead of relying on static inputs; and (3) fostering active reasoning, where agents engage in probing discussions rather than passively answering questions. Collectively, these innovations offer a more reliable and effective framework for multimodal reasoning in LLMs. The source code can be accessed at https://github.com/YongLD/MUG.git."}

Consequently, research has focused on evaluating the robustness of LLMs, an essential quality for real-world tasks. In this paper, we employ simple multi-turn follow-up prompts to evaluate models' answer changes, model accuracy dynamics across turns with Markov chains, and examine whether linear probes can predict these changes. Our results show significant vulnerabilities in LLM robustness: a simple \"Think again\" prompt led to an approximate 10% accuracy drop for Gemini 1.5 Flash over nine turns, while combining this prompt with a semantically equivalent reworded question caused a 7.5% drop for Claude 3.5 Haiku. Additionally, we find that model accuracy across turns can be effectively modeled using Markov chains, enabling the prediction of accuracy probabilities over time. This allows for estimation of the model's stationary (long-run) accuracy, which we find to be on average approximately 8% lower than its first-turn accuracy for Gemini 1.5 Flash. Our results from a model's hidden states also reveal evidence that linear probes can help predict future answer changes. Together, these results establish stationary accuracy as a principled robustness metric for interactive settings and expose the fragility of models under repeated questioning. Addressing this instability will be essential for deploying LLMs in high-stakes and interactive settings where consistent reasoning is as important as initial accuracy."}

In this work, we present STaR (slow-thinking for table reasoning), a new framework achieving cognitive table reasoning, in which LLMs are equipped with slow-thinking capabilities by explicitly modeling step-by-step thinking and uncertainty-aware inference.

We investigate gender bias dynamics across three generations of recursive text generation using three complementary evaluation frameworks: rule-based pattern matching, embedding-based semantic similarity, and downstream task performance. Experiments with three initial bias levels (0.1, 0.3, 0.6) and four mitigation strategies reveal equilibrium dynamics rather than monotonic amplification. The low initial bias amplifies toward the model's inherent bias level (+36%), whereas the high initial bias decays toward it (-26%). Among mitigation methods, contrastive augmentation, which introduces gender-swapped variants, achieves significant downstream bias reduction (98.8% for low initial bias and 91% on average) despite producing higher embedding-based bias scores. This paradox demonstrates that semantic similarity metrics may diverge from behavioral fairness outcomes, highlighting the need for multidimensional evaluation in responsible synthetic data generation."}

In this paper, we use the systems' preference bias to study their hidden language: During the process of compressing the input images (typically containing multiple concepts) into texts and then reconstructing them into images, the systems' inherent preference bias introduces specific shifts in the outputs, disrupting the original input concept co-occurrence. We employ the multi-round \"telephone game\" to strategically leverage this bias. By observing the co-occurrence frequencies of concepts in telephone games, we quantitatively investigate the concept connection strength in the understanding of multimodal systems, i.e., \"hidden language.\" We also contribute Telescope, a dataset of 10,000+ concept pairs, as the database of our telephone game framework. Our telephone game is test-time scalable: By iteratively running telephone games, we can construct a global map of concept connections in multimodal systems' understanding. Here we can identify preference bias inherited from training, assess generalization capability advancement, and discover more stable pathways for fragile concept connections. Furthermore, we use Reasoning-LLMs to uncover unexpected concept relationships that transcend textual and visual similarities, inferring how multimodal systems understand and simulate the world. This study offers a new perspective on the hidden language of multimodal systems and lays the foundation for future research on the interpretability and controllability of multimodal systems."}

Although they are indispensable to evaluate model performance on various tasks, it is uncertain whether the models trained on Internet data have genuinely learned how to solve problems or merely seen the questions before. This potential data contamination issue presents a fundamental challenge to establishing trustworthy evaluation frameworks. Meanwhile, existing benchmarks predominantly assume benign, resource-rich settings, leaving the behavior of LLMs under pressure unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Squid Game, a dynamic and adversarial evaluation environment with resource-constrained and asymmetric information settings elaborated to evaluate LLMs through interactive gameplay against other LLM opponents. Notably, Squid Game consists of six elimination-style levels, focusing on multi-faceted abilities, such as instruction-following, code, reasoning, planning, and safety alignment. We evaluate over 50 LLMs on Squid Game, presenting the largest behavioral evaluation study of general LLMs on dynamic adversarial scenarios. We observe a clear generational phase transition on performance in the same model lineage and find evidence that some models resort to speculative shortcuts to win the game, indicating the possibility of higher-level evaluation paradigm contamination in static benchmarks. Furthermore, we compare prominent LLM benchmarks and Squid Game with correlation analyses, highlighting that dynamic evaluation can serve as a complementary part for static evaluations.

There is a substantial risk that some of these decision induce harm to people, by infringing their well-being or their fundamental human rights.

This obstructs the ability to trace what went into a decision, which in turn is a prerequisite to any attempt of reconstructing a responsibility chain. Specifically, such traceability is linked to a documentation that will stand up in court when determining the cause of some AI-based decision that inadvertently or intentionally violates the law.\n  This paper takes a radical, yet practical, approach to this problem, by enforcing the documentation of each and every component that goes into the training or inference of an automated decision. As such, it presents the first running workflow supporting the generation of tamper-proof, verifiable and exhaustive traces of AI decisions.

We prompted 22 synthetic voices from two leading AI platforms (AI Studio and OpenAI) to read a fixed script under both \"polite and formal\" and \"casual and informal\" conditions and measured the resulting speech duration. Across both AI platforms, the polite prompt produced slower speech than the casual prompt with very large effect sizes, an effect that was statistically significant for all of AI Studio's voices and for a large majority of OpenAI's voices. These results demonstrate that AI can implicitly learn and replicate psychological nuances of human communication, highlighting its emerging role as a social actor capable of reinforcing human social norms."}

We develop an appropriate notion of contrastive explanations for the special case of ABox reasoning with description logic ontologies, and analyze the computational complexity for different variants under different optimality criteria, considering lightweight as well as more expressive description logics. We implemented a first method for computing one variant of contrastive explanations, and evaluated it on generated problems for realistic knowledge bases."}

Fundamentally, aligning LVLMs is not just a safety challenge but a problem of economic efficiency. Current alignment methods struggle with the trade-off between safety, utility, and operational costs. Critically, a focus solely on final outputs (process-blindness) wastes significant computational budget on unsafe deliberation. This flaw allows harmful reasoning to be disguised with benign justifications, thereby circumventing simple additive safety scores. To address this, we propose EcoAlign, an inference-time framework that reframes alignment as an economically rational search by treating the LVLM as a boundedly rational agent. EcoAlign incrementally expands a thought graph and scores actions using a forward-looking function (analogous to net present value) that dynamically weighs expected safety, utility, and cost against the remaining budget. To prevent deception, path safety is enforced via the weakest-link principle. Extensive experiments across 3 closed-source and 2 open-source models on 6 datasets show that EcoAlign matches or surpasses state-of-the-art safety and utility at a lower computational cost, thereby offering a principled, economical pathway to robust LVLM alignment."}

Leveraging historical records from the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), we developed a bias evaluation framework comprising three distinct tests to explore nation-level bias in various LLMs, with a particular focus on the five permanent members of the UNSC. Experimental results show that, even with the general bias patterns across models (e.g., favorable biases toward the western nations, and unfavorable biases toward Russia), these still vary based on the LLM. Notably, even within the same LLM, the direction and magnitude of bias for a nation change depending on the evaluation context. This observation suggests that LLM biases are fundamentally multidimensional, varying across models and tasks. We also observe that models with stronger reasoning abilities show reduced bias and better performance. Building on this finding, we introduce a debiasing framework that improves LLMs' factual reasoning combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Reflexion-based self-reflection techniques. Experiments show it effectively reduces nation-level bias, and improves performance, particularly in GPT-4o-mini and LLama-3.3-70B. Our findings emphasize the need to assess nation-level bias alongside performance when applying LLMs in the IR domain."}

While rule-based approaches offer interpretability through predefined psychological principles, they often lack generalizability and flexibility. Conversely, data-driven methods can learn complex behaviors from large-scale datasets, but are typically inefficient, opaque, and difficult to align with human intuitions. To bridge this gap, we propose RLSLM, a hybrid Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates a rule-based Social Locomotion Model, grounded in empirical behavioral experiments, into the reward function of a reinforcement learning framework. The social locomotion model generates an orientation-sensitive social comfort field that quantifies human comfort across space, enabling socially aligned navigation policies with minimal training. RLSLM then jointly optimizes mechanical energy and social comfort, allowing agents to avoid intrusions into personal or group space. A human-agent interaction experiment using an immersive VR-based setup demonstrates that RLSLM outperforms state-of-the-art rule-based models in user experience. Ablation and sensitivity analyses further show the model's significantly improved interpretability over conventional data-driven methods.

While systems that update and maintain a memory at inference time have been proposed, existing designs only steer the system by modifying textual input to a language model or agent, which means that they cannot change sampling parameters, remove tools, modify system prompts, or switch between agentic and workflow paradigms. On the other hand, systems that adapt more flexibly require offline optimization and remain static once deployed. We present Experience-Guided Reasoner (EGuR), which generates tailored strategies -- complete computational procedures involving LLM calls, tools, sampling parameters, and control logic -- dynamically at inference time based on accumulated experience. We achieve this using an LLM-based meta-strategy -- a strategy that outputs strategies -- enabling adaptation of all strategy components (prompts, sampling parameters, tool configurations, and control logic). EGuR operates through two components: a Guide generates multiple candidate strategies conditioned on the current problem and structured memory of past experiences, while a Consolidator integrates execution feedback to improve future strategy generation. This produces complete, ready-to-run strategies optimized for each problem, which can be cached, retrieved, and executed as needed without wasting resources. Across five challenging benchmarks (AIME 2025, 3-SAT, and three Big Bench Extra Hard tasks), EGuR achieves up to 14% accuracy improvements over the strongest baselines while reducing computational costs by up to 111x, with both metrics improving as the system gains experience."}

Do they form shared multilingual representations with language-specific decoding, and if so, why does performance still favor the dominant training language? To address this, we train a series of LLMs on different mixtures of multilingual data and analyze their internal mechanisms using cross-layer transcoders (CLT) and attribution graphs. Our results provide strong evidence for pivot language representations: the model employs nearly identical representations across languages, while language-specific decoding emerges in later layers. Attribution analyses reveal that decoding relies in part on a small set of high-frequency language features in the final layers, which linearly read out language identity from the first layers in the model. By intervening on these features, we can suppress one language and substitute another in the model's outputs. Finally, we study how the dominant training language influences these mechanisms across attribution graphs and decoding pathways. We argue that understanding this pivot-language mechanism is crucial for improving multilingual alignment in LLMs."}

Agents trained solely to achieve their objectives may adopt harmful behavior, exposing a key trade-off between maximizing the reward function and maintaining the alignment. For the pre-trained agents, ensuring alignment is particularly challenging, as retraining can be a costly and slow process. This is further complicated by the diverse and potentially conflicting attributes representing the ethical values for alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a test-time alignment technique based on model-guided policy shaping. Our method allows precise control over individual behavioral attributes, generalizes across diverse reinforcement learning (RL) environments, and facilitates a principled trade-off between ethical alignment and reward maximization without requiring agent retraining. We evaluate our approach using the MACHIAVELLI benchmark, which comprises 134 text-based game environments and thousands of annotated scenarios involving ethical decisions. The RL agents are first trained to maximize the reward in their respective games. At test time, we apply policy shaping via scenario-action attribute classifiers to ensure decision alignment with ethical attributes. We compare our approach against prior training-time methods and general-purpose agents, as well as study several types of ethical violations and power-seeking behavior. Our results demonstrate that test-time policy shaping provides an effective and scalable solution for mitigating unethical behavior across diverse environments and alignment attributes."}

However, models often rely on annotations that reflect dominant cultural norms, limiting model ability to recognize emotional expression in dialects often excluded from training data distributions, such as African American Vernacular English (AAVE). This study examines emotion recognition model performance on AAVE compared to General American English (GAE). We analyze 2.7 million tweets geo-tagged within Los Angeles. Texts are scored for strength of AAVE using computational approximations of dialect features. Annotations of emotion presence and intensity are collected on a dataset of 875 tweets with both high and low AAVE densities. To assess model accuracy on a task as subjective as emotion perception, we calculate community-informed \"silver\" labels where AAVE-dense tweets are labeled by African American, AAVE-fluent (ingroup) annotators. On our labeled sample, GPT and BERT-based models exhibit false positive prediction rates of anger on AAVE more than double than on GAE. SpanEmo, a popular text-based emotion model, increases false positive rates of anger from 25 percent on GAE to 60 percent on AAVE. Additionally, a series of linear regressions reveals that models and non-ingroup annotations are significantly more correlated with profanity-based AAVE features than ingroup annotations. Linking Census tract demographics, we observe that neighborhoods with higher proportions of African American residents are associated with higher predictions of anger (Pearson's correlation r = 0.27) and lower joy (r = -0.10). These results find an emergent safety issue of emotion AI reinforcing racial stereotypes through biased emotion classification. We emphasize the need for culturally and dialect-informed affective computing systems."}

Yet, it remains unclear whether such LLM-judges can reliably assess tasks that require social or conversational judgment. We investigate how an LLM's conviction is changed when a task is reframed from a direct factual query to a Conversational Judgment Task. Our evaluation framework contrasts the model's performance on direct factual queries with its assessment of a speaker's correctness when the same information is presented within a minimal dialogue, effectively shifting the query from \"Is this statement correct?\" to \"Is this speaker correct?\". Furthermore, we apply pressure in the form of a simple rebuttal (\"The previous answer is incorrect.\") to both conditions. This perturbation allows us to measure how firmly the model maintains its position under conversational pressure. Our findings show that while some models like GPT-4o-mini reveal sycophantic tendencies under social framing tasks, others like Llama-8B-Instruct become overly-critical. We observe an average performance change of 9.24% across all models, demonstrating that even minimal dialogue context can significantly alter model judgment, underscoring conversational framing as a key factor in LLM-based evaluation. The proposed framework offers a reproducible methodology for diagnosing model conviction and contributes to the development of more trustworthy dialogue systems."}

Previous research has focused on detecting and addressing negative attention heads that induce negative bias. However, the underlying detailed factors influencing negative bias remain underexplored. In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs exhibit format-level negative bias, meaning the prompt format more influences their responses than the semantics of the negative response. For the fine-grained study of the negative bias, we introduce a pipeline for constructing the evaluation set, which systematically categorizes the dataset into three subsets based on the model's parametric knowledge: correct, incorrect, and insufficient relevant knowledge. Through analysis of this evaluation set, we identify a shortcut behavior in which models tend to generate negative responses when they lack sufficient knowledge to answer a yes-no question, leading to negative bias. We further examine how negative bias changes under various prompting scenarios related to parametric knowledge. We observe that providing relevant context and offering an \"I don't know\" option generally reduces negative bias, whereas chain-of-thought prompting tends to amplify the bias. Finally, we demonstrate that the degree of negative bias can vary depending on the type of prompt, which influences the direction of the response. Our work reveals the various factors that influence negative bias, providing critical insights for mitigating it in LLMs."}

This assumption is untested. We characterize temporal constraint processing across eight production-scale models (2.8-8B parameters) using deadline detection tasks, revealing systematic deployment risks: bimodal performance distribution (models achieve either 95% or 50% accuracy), extreme prompt brittleness (30-60 percentage point swings from formatting changes alone), and systematic action bias (100% false positive rates in failing models). Parameter count shows no correlation with capability in this range-a 3.8B model matches 7B models while other 7B models fail completely. Fine-tuning on 200 synthetic examples improves models with partial capability by 12-37 percentage points. We demonstrate that temporal constraint satisfaction cannot be reliably learned through next-token prediction on natural language, even with targeted fine-tuning. This capability requires architectural mechanisms for: (1) continuous temporal state representation, (2) explicit constraint checking separate from linguistic pattern matching, (3) systematic compositional reasoning over temporal relations.

We further develop a multi-dimensional evaluation suite to quantify reasoning degradation in TaLMs relative to their non-tool counterparts.

This degradation intensifies with tool use; the more frequently a model invokes tools, the less coherent its reasoning becomes. Moreover, tool use shifts errors from arithmetic mistakes toward global reasoning failures (logic, assumption, creativity); with TIM present in ~55% of high-risk cases.

To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel framework named PRO, i.e., PReference Orchestrator, which features a lightweight preference adapter that automatically infers prompt-specific preference weights during both training and deployment phases. Specifically, the adapter automatically learns appropriate preference weights for each prompt by training on normalized reward scores from multiple reward models for preferred responses, which inherently reflect effective preference balances across objectives.

A small dataset of 600 sentences labeled with six cognitive categories - Knowledge, Comprehension, Application, Analysis, Synthesis, and Evaluation - was processed using traditional machine learning (ML) models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines), recurrent neural network architectures (LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, BiGRU), transformer-based models (BERT and RoBERTa), and large language models (OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, Anthropic). Each model was evaluated under different preprocessing and augmentation strategies (for example, synonym replacement, word embeddings, etc.). Among traditional ML approaches, Support Vector Machines (SVM) with data augmentation achieved the best overall performance, reaching 94 percent accuracy, recall, and F1 scores with minimal overfitting. In contrast, the RNN models and BERT suffered from severe overfitting, while RoBERTa initially overcame it but began to show signs as training progressed. Finally, zero-shot evaluations of large language models (LLMs) indicated that OpenAI and Gemini performed best among the tested LLMs, achieving approximately 0.72-0.73 accuracy and comparable F1 scores. These findings highlight the challenges of training complex deep models on limited data and underscore the value of careful data augmentation and simpler algorithms (such as augmented SVM) for Bloom's Taxonomy classification."}

Traditional universal compressors like gzip offer low computational overhead, high speed, and broad applicability across data distributions. However, they often lead to worse compression rates than modern neural compressors, which leverage large-scale training data to model data distributions more effectively. Despite their advantages, neural compressors struggle to generalize to unseen data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that performs Test-Time Steering via a Weighted Product of Experts (wPoE). At inference, our method adaptively combines a universal compression model with a pretrained neural language model, ensuring the compression rate is at least as good as that of the best individual model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of text compression without requiring fine-tuning. Furthermore, it seamlessly integrates with any autoregressive language model, providing a practical solution for enhancing text compression across diverse data distributions."}

We analyze six open-source guard models and show that our approach reduces semantic variability across paraphrases by ~58%, improves benchmark accuracy by ~2.5% on average, and generalizes to unseen stylistic variations. Intriguingly, we discover a bidirectional relationship between model calibration and consistency: our robustness training improves calibration by up to 40%, revealing a fundamental connection between these properties. These results highlight the value of treating semantic consistency as a first-class training objective and provide a scalable recipe for building more reliable guard models."}

In this context, understanding is defined as the ability to identify and rely on the correct decision factors, features that determine outcomes within a domain. STaDS jointly assesses understanding through: (i) question and instruction comprehension, (ii) knowledge-based prediction, and (iii) reliance on relevant decision factors.

Among these, direct preference optimization (DPO) has emerged as a widely adopted technique that fine-tunes LLMs on preferred completions over less favorable ones. While most frontier LLMs do not disclose their curated preference pairs, the broader LLM community has released several open-source DPO datasets, including TuluDPO, ORPO, UltraFeedback, HelpSteer, and Code-Preference-Pairs. However, systematic comparisons remain scarce, largely due to the high computational cost and the lack of rich quality annotations, making it difficult to understand how preferences were selected, which task types they span, and how well they reflect human judgment on a per-sample level. In this work, we present the first comprehensive, data-centric analysis of popular open-source DPO corpora. We leverage the Magpie framework to annotate each sample for task category, input quality, and preference reward, a reward-model-based signal that validates the preference order without relying on human annotations. This enables a scalable, fine-grained inspection of preference quality across datasets, revealing structural and qualitative discrepancies in reward margins. Building on these insights, we systematically curate a new DPO mixture, UltraMix, that draws selectively from all five corpora while removing noisy or redundant samples. UltraMix is 30% smaller than the best-performing individual dataset yet exceeds its performance across key benchmarks. We publicly release all annotations, metadata, and our curated mixture to facilitate future research in data-centric preference optimization."}

To mitigate these limitations, we propose enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) speech projector, where each expert specializes in the semantic subspace of a specific language, enabling fine-grained modeling of speech features. Additionally, we introduce a multi-stage training paradigm that utilizes readily available monolingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) and monolingual ST data, facilitating speech-text alignment and improving translation capabilities. During training, we leverage a combination of language-specific loss and intra-group load balancing loss to guide the MoE speech projector in efficiently allocating tokens to the appropriate experts, across expert groups and within each group, respectively. To bridge the data gap across different training stages and improve adaptation to the CS scenario, we further employ a transition loss, enabling smooth transitions of data between stages, to effectively address the scarcity of high-quality CS speech translation data.

To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage demonstration selection method, TopK + Label Distribution Divergence (L2D), which leverages a fine-tuned BERT-like small language model (SLM) to generate label distributions and calculate their divergence for both test inputs and candidate demonstrations. This enables the selection of demonstrations that are not only semantically similar but also aligned in label distribution with the test input.

Applying complex layers or even training standalone networks for better prediction introduces high computation overhead. In this paper, we propose pre-attention expert prediction to achieve accurate and lightweight expert prefetching. The key insight is that some functions in LLMs are ranking-preserving, indicating that matching the ranking of selected experts using simple linear functions is possible.

Next, we design a dual-stage modal fusion strategy: the first stage performs shallow fusion on raw meme image and text, while the second stage deeply integrates the enhanced visual and textual features. This hierarchical fusion enables the model to better capture nuanced cross-modal emotional cues. Experiments on two datasets, MET-MEME and MOOD, demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Specifically, MemoDetector improves F1 scores by 4.3\\% on MET-MEME and 3.4\\% on MOOD. Further ablation studies and in-depth analyses validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, highlighting its strong potential for advancing MEU.

Although they are indispensable to evaluate model performance on various tasks, it is uncertain whether the models trained on Internet data have genuinely learned how to solve problems or merely seen the questions before. This potential data contamination issue presents a fundamental challenge to establishing trustworthy evaluation frameworks. Meanwhile, existing benchmarks predominantly assume benign, resource-rich settings, leaving the behavior of LLMs under pressure unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Squid Game, a dynamic and adversarial evaluation environment with resource-constrained and asymmetric information settings elaborated to evaluate LLMs through interactive gameplay against other LLM opponents. Notably, Squid Game consists of six elimination-style levels, focusing on multi-faceted abilities, such as instruction-following, code, reasoning, planning, and safety alignment. We evaluate over 50 LLMs on Squid Game, presenting the largest behavioral evaluation study of general LLMs on dynamic adversarial scenarios. We observe a clear generational phase transition on performance in the same model lineage and find evidence that some models resort to speculative shortcuts to win the game, indicating the possibility of higher-level evaluation paradigm contamination in static benchmarks. Furthermore, we compare prominent LLM benchmarks and Squid Game with correlation analyses, highlighting that dynamic evaluation can serve as a complementary part for static evaluations. The code and data will be released in the future."}

This challenge arises primarily due to constrained model context windows and the sparsity of relevant information within extensive contextual noise. To solve this, we propose the SAP$^{2}$ method, a novel framework that dynamically prunes and integrates relevant contextual keywords in two stages. Specifically, each stage leverages our proposed Speech-Driven Attention-based Pooling mechanism, enabling efficient compression of context embeddings while preserving speech-salient information. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of SAP$^{2}$ on the SlideSpeech and LibriSpeech datasets, achieving word error rates (WER) of 7.71% and 1.12%, respectively. On SlideSpeech, our method notably reduces biased keyword error rates (B-WER) by 41.1% compared to non-contextual baselines. SAP$^{2}$ also exhibits robust scalability, consistently maintaining performance under extensive contextual input conditions on both datasets."}

This study investigates whether state-of-the-art text-to-speech systems have internalized the human tendency to reduce speech rate to convey politeness - a non-obvious prosodic marker. We prompted 22 synthetic voices from two leading AI platforms (AI Studio and OpenAI) to read a fixed script under both \"polite and formal\" and \"casual and informal\" conditions and measured the resulting speech duration. Across both AI platforms, the polite prompt produced slower speech than the casual prompt with very large effect sizes, an effect that was statistically significant for all of AI Studio's voices and for a large majority of OpenAI's voices. These results demonstrate that AI can implicitly learn and replicate psychological nuances of human communication, highlighting its emerging role as a social actor capable of reinforcing human social norms."}

Paraphrase robustness is essential for reliable deployment, especially in socially sensitive contexts where inconsistent representations can amplify demographic biases. In this paper, we introduce the Paraphrase Ranking Stability Metric (PRSM), a novel measure for quantifying CLIP's sensitivity to paraphrased queries. Using the Social Counterfactuals dataset, a benchmark designed to reveal social and demographic biases, we empirically assess CLIP's stability under paraphrastic variation, examine the interaction between paraphrase robustness and gender, and discuss implications for fairness and equitable deployment of multimodal systems. Our analysis reveals that robustness varies across paraphrasing strategies, with subtle yet consistent differences observed between male- and female-associated queries."}

This method generates challenging negative training examples through the selective marking of alternate words in the training set. The goal is to force the model to create a greater separability between same sentences with different marked words. Experimental results on lexical semantic change detection and word sense disambiguation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach yields more discriminative word representations, improving performance over standard contrastive learning baselines.

However, models often rely on annotations that reflect dominant cultural norms, limiting model ability to recognize emotional expression in dialects often excluded from training data distributions, such as African American Vernacular English (AAVE). This study examines emotion recognition model performance on AAVE compared to General American English (GAE). We analyze 2.7 million tweets geo-tagged within Los Angeles. Texts are scored for strength of AAVE using computational approximations of dialect features. Annotations of emotion presence and intensity are collected on a dataset of 875 tweets with both high and low AAVE densities. To assess model accuracy on a task as subjective as emotion perception, we calculate community-informed \"silver\" labels where AAVE-dense tweets are labeled by African American, AAVE-fluent (ingroup) annotators. On our labeled sample, GPT and BERT-based models exhibit false positive prediction rates of anger on AAVE more than double than on GAE. SpanEmo, a popular text-based emotion model, increases false positive rates of anger from 25 percent on GAE to 60 percent on AAVE. Additionally, a series of linear regressions reveals that models and non-ingroup annotations are significantly more correlated with profanity-based AAVE features than ingroup annotations. Linking Census tract demographics, we observe that neighborhoods with higher proportions of African American residents are associated with higher predictions of anger (Pearson's correlation r = 0.27) and lower joy (r = -0.10). These results find an emergent safety issue of emotion AI reinforcing racial stereotypes through biased emotion classification. We emphasize the need for culturally and dialect-informed affective computing systems."}

The approach first clusters KG triplets based on their relations, creating reusable templates through natural language rules derived from the entity types of objects and relations. A module then leverages LLMs to refine these templates, improving clarity and coherence while preserving factual accuracy. Finally, the instantiation of answer options is achieved through a selection strategy that introduces distractors from the KG.

To further enhance reasoning and accuracy on complex tasks, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as a promising framework that engages multiple LLM agents in structured debates to encourage diverse reasoning. However, triggering MAD for every query is inefficient, as it incurs substantial computational (token) cost and may even degrade accuracy by overturning correct single-agent answers. To address these limitations, we propose intelligent Multi-Agent Debate (iMAD), a token-efficient framework that selectively triggers MAD only when it is likely to be beneficial (i.e., correcting an initially wrong answer). To achieve this goal, iMAD learns generalizable model behaviors to make accurate debate decisions. Specifically, iMAD first prompts a single agent to produce a structured self-critique response, from which we extract 41 interpretable linguistic and semantic features capturing hesitation cues. Then, iMAD uses a lightweight debate-decision classifier, trained using our proposed FocusCal loss, to determine whether to trigger MAD, enabling robust debate decisions without test dataset-specific tuning. Through extensive experiments using six (visual) question answering datasets against five competitive baselines, we have shown that iMAD significantly reduces token usage (by up to 92%) while also improving final answer accuracy (by up to 13.5%)."}

Previous research has focused on detecting and addressing negative attention heads that induce negative bias. However, the underlying detailed factors influencing negative bias remain underexplored. In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs exhibit format-level negative bias, meaning the prompt format more influences their responses than the semantics of the negative response. For the fine-grained study of the negative bias, we introduce a pipeline for constructing the evaluation set, which systematically categorizes the dataset into three subsets based on the model's parametric knowledge: correct, incorrect, and insufficient relevant knowledge. Through analysis of this evaluation set, we identify a shortcut behavior in which models tend to generate negative responses when they lack sufficient knowledge to answer a yes-no question, leading to negative bias. We further examine how negative bias changes under various prompting scenarios related to parametric knowledge. We observe that providing relevant context and offering an \"I don't know\" option generally reduces negative bias, whereas chain-of-thought prompting tends to amplify the bias. Finally, we demonstrate that the degree of negative bias can vary depending on the type of prompt, which influences the direction of the response. Our work reveals the various factors that influence negative bias, providing critical insights for mitigating it in LLMs."}

Each model was evaluated under different preprocessing and augmentation strategies (for example, synonym replacement, word embeddings, etc.). Among traditional ML approaches, Support Vector Machines (SVM) with data augmentation achieved the best overall performance, reaching 94 percent accuracy, recall, and F1 scores with minimal overfitting. In contrast, the RNN models and BERT suffered from severe overfitting, while RoBERTa initially overcame it but began to show signs as training progressed. Finally, zero-shot evaluations of large language models (LLMs) indicated that OpenAI and Gemini performed best among the tested LLMs, achieving approximately 0.72-0.73 accuracy and comparable F1 scores.

While these translations demand discourse-level coherence and strict terminological precision, current evaluation methods predominantly focus on segment-level accuracy and fluency. To address this limitation, we introduce DiscoX, a new benchmark for discourse-level and expert-level Chinese-English translation. It comprises 200 professionally-curated texts from 7 domains, with an average length exceeding 1700 tokens. To evaluate performance on DiscoX, we also develop Metric-S, a reference-free system that provides fine-grained automatic assessments across accuracy, fluency, and appropriateness. Metric-S demonstrates strong consistency with human judgments, significantly outperforming existing metrics. Our experiments reveal a remarkable performance gap: even the most advanced LLMs still trail human experts on these tasks. This finding validates the difficulty of DiscoX and underscores the challenges that remain in achieving professional-grade machine translation. The proposed benchmark and evaluation system provide a robust framework for more rigorous evaluation, facilitating future advancements in LLM-based translation."}

Among these, direct preference optimization (DPO) has emerged as a widely adopted technique that fine-tunes LLMs on preferred completions over less favorable ones. While most frontier LLMs do not disclose their curated preference pairs, the broader LLM community has released several open-source DPO datasets, including TuluDPO, ORPO, UltraFeedback, HelpSteer, and Code-Preference-Pairs. However, systematic comparisons remain scarce, largely due to the high computational cost and the lack of rich quality annotations, making it difficult to understand how preferences were selected, which task types they span, and how well they reflect human judgment on a per-sample level. In this work, we present the first comprehensive, data-centric analysis of popular open-source DPO corpora. We leverage the Magpie framework to annotate each sample for task category, input quality, and preference reward, a reward-model-based signal that validates the preference order without relying on human annotations. This enables a scalable, fine-grained inspection of preference quality across datasets, revealing structural and qualitative discrepancies in reward margins. Building on these insights, we systematically curate a new DPO mixture, UltraMix, that draws selectively from all five corpora while removing noisy or redundant samples. UltraMix is 30% smaller than the best-performing individual dataset yet exceeds its performance across key benchmarks. We publicly release all annotations, metadata, and our curated mixture to facilitate future research in data-centric preference optimization."}

Results on real-world 2- and 3-speaker conversation test sets, collected with binaural egocentric hardware from 11 participants totaling 6.8 hours, show generalization in identifying and isolating conversational partners in multi-conversation settings.

Training-time alignment methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) face prohibitive costs in expert supervision and inherent scalability limitations, offering limited dynamic control during inference. Consequently, there is an urgent need for scalable and adaptable alignment mechanisms. To address this, we propose W2S-AlignTree, a pioneering plug-and-play inference-time alignment framework that synergistically combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with the Weak-to-Strong Generalization paradigm for the first time. W2S-AlignTree formulates LLM alignment as an optimal heuristic search problem within a generative search tree. By leveraging weak model's real-time, step-level signals as alignment proxies and introducing an Entropy-Aware exploration mechanism, W2S-AlignTree enables fine-grained guidance during strong model's generation without modifying its parameters. The approach dynamically balances exploration and exploitation in high-dimensional generation search trees. Experiments across controlled sentiment generation, summarization, and instruction-following show that W2S-AlignTree consistently outperforms strong baselines. Notably, W2S-AlignTree raises the performance of Llama3-8B from 1.89 to 2.19, a relative improvement of 15.9 on the summarization task."}

The approach first clusters KG triplets based on their relations, creating reusable templates through natural language rules derived from the entity types of objects and relations. A module then leverages LLMs to refine these templates, improving clarity and coherence while preserving factual accuracy. Finally, the instantiation of answer options is achieved through a selection strategy that introduces distractors from the KG.

To further enhance reasoning and accuracy on complex tasks, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as a promising framework that engages multiple LLM agents in structured debates to encourage diverse reasoning. However, triggering MAD for every query is inefficient, as it incurs substantial computational (token) cost and may even degrade accuracy by overturning correct single-agent answers. To address these limitations, we propose intelligent Multi-Agent Debate (iMAD), a token-efficient framework that selectively triggers MAD only when it is likely to be beneficial (i.e., correcting an initially wrong answer). To achieve this goal, iMAD learns generalizable model behaviors to make accurate debate decisions. Specifically, iMAD first prompts a single agent to produce a structured self-critique response, from which we extract 41 interpretable linguistic and semantic features capturing hesitation cues. Then, iMAD uses a lightweight debate-decision classifier, trained using our proposed FocusCal loss, to determine whether to trigger MAD, enabling robust debate decisions without test dataset-specific tuning. Through extensive experiments using six (visual) question answering datasets against five competitive baselines, we have shown that iMAD significantly reduces token usage (by up to 92%) while also improving final answer accuracy (by up to 13.5%)."}

While effective GUI agents synergistically integrate planning and grounding capabilities, current methodologies exhibit two fundamental limitations: (1) insufficient exploitation of cross-model synergies, and (2) over-reliance on synthetic data generation without sufficient utilization. To address these challenges, we propose Co-EPG, a self-iterative training framework for Co-Evolution of Planning and Grounding. Co-EPG establishes an iterative positive feedback loop: through this loop, the planning model explores superior strategies under grounding-based reward guidance via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), generating diverse data to optimize the grounding model. Concurrently, the optimized Grounding model provides more effective rewards for subsequent GRPO training of the planning model, fostering continuous improvement. Co-EPG thus enables iterative enhancement of agent capabilities through self-play optimization and training data distillation. On the Multimodal-Mind2Web and AndroidControl benchmarks, our framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods after just three iterations without requiring external data. The agent consistently improves with each iteration, demonstrating robust self-enhancement capabilities. This work establishes a novel training paradigm for GUI agents, shifting from isolated optimization to an integrated, self-driven co-evolution approach."}

While prior surveys focus on efficiency by examining how to shorten reasoning chains or reduce computation, this view overlooks a fundamental challenge: current LLMs apply uniform reasoning strategies regardless of task complexity, generating long traces for trivial problems while failing to extend reasoning for difficult tasks. This survey reframes reasoning through the lens of {adaptivity}: the capability to allocate reasoning effort based on input characteristics such as difficulty and uncertainty. We make three contributions. First, we formalize deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning within the LLM context, connecting these classical cognitive paradigms with their algorithmic realizations. Second, we formalize adaptive reasoning as a control-augmented policy optimization problem balancing task performance with computational cost, distinguishing learned policies from inference-time control mechanisms. Third, we propose a systematic taxonomy organizing existing methods into training-based approaches that internalize adaptivity through reinforcement learning, supervised fine-tuning, and learned controllers, and training-free approaches that achieve adaptivity through prompt conditioning, feedback-driven halting, and modular composition. This framework clarifies how different mechanisms realize adaptive reasoning in practice and enables systematic comparison across diverse strategies. We conclude by identifying open challenges in self-evaluation, meta-reasoning, and human-aligned reasoning control."}

Although the Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) paradigm offers a promising solution by promoting consensus among multiple agents to enhance reliability, it relies on the unrealistic assumption that all debaters are rational and reflective, which is a condition that may not hold when agents themselves are prone to hallucinations. To address this gap, we introduce the Multi-agent Undercover Gaming (MUG) protocol, inspired by social deduction games like \"Who is Undercover?\". MUG reframes MAD as a process of detecting \"undercover\" agents (those suffering from hallucinations) by employing multimodal counterfactual tests. Specifically, we modify reference images to introduce counterfactual evidence and observe whether agents can accurately identify these changes, providing ground-truth for identifying hallucinating agents and enabling robust, crowd-powered multimodal reasoning. MUG advances MAD protocols along three key dimensions: (1) enabling factual verification beyond statistical consensus through counterfactual testing; (2) introducing cross-evidence reasoning via dynamically modified evidence sources instead of relying on static inputs; and (3) fostering active reasoning, where agents engage in probing discussions rather than passively answering questions. Collectively, these innovations offer a more reliable and effective framework for multimodal reasoning in LLMs. The source code can be accessed at https://github.com/YongLD/MUG.git."}

Agents trained solely to achieve their objectives may adopt harmful behavior, exposing a key trade-off between maximizing the reward function and maintaining the alignment. For the pre-trained agents, ensuring alignment is particularly challenging, as retraining can be a costly and slow process. This is further complicated by the diverse and potentially conflicting attributes representing the ethical values for alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a test-time alignment technique based on model-guided policy shaping. Our method allows precise control over individual behavioral attributes, generalizes across diverse reinforcement learning (RL) environments, and facilitates a principled trade-off between ethical alignment and reward maximization without requiring agent retraining. We evaluate our approach using the MACHIAVELLI benchmark, which comprises 134 text-based game environments and thousands of annotated scenarios involving ethical decisions. The RL agents are first trained to maximize the reward in their respective games. At test time, we apply policy shaping via scenario-action attribute classifiers to ensure decision alignment with ethical attributes. We compare our approach against prior training-time methods and general-purpose agents, as well as study several types of ethical violations and power-seeking behavior. Our results demonstrate that test-time policy shaping provides an effective and scalable solution for mitigating unethical behavior across diverse environments and alignment attributes."}
