Bramley (Eds.),\n  Proceedings of the 47th Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society.\n  Cognitive Science Society", "summary": "The ability to learn new visual concepts from limited examples is a hallmark\nof human cognition. While traditional category learning models represent each\nexample as an unstructured feature vector, compositional concept learning is\nthought to depend on (1) structured representations of examples (e.g., directed\ngraphs consisting of objects and their relations) and (2) the identification of\nshared relational structure across examples through analogical mapping. Here,\nwe introduce Probabilistic Schema Induction (PSI), a prototype model that\nemploys deep learning to perform analogical mapping over structured\nrepresentations of only a handful of examples, forming a compositional concept\ncalled a schema. In doing so, PSI relies on a novel conception of similarity\nthat weighs object-level similarity and relational similarity, as well as a\nmechanism for amplifying relations relevant to classification, analogous to\nselective attention parameters in traditional models. We show that PSI produces\nhuman-like learning performance and outperforms two controls: a prototype model\nthat uses unstructured feature vectors extracted from a deep learning model,\nand a variant of PSI with weaker structured representations. Notably, we find\nthat PSI's human-like performance is driven by an adaptive strategy that\nincreases relational similarity over object-level similarity and upweights the\ncontribution of relations that distinguish classes.

Recent studies have demonstrated that pre-trained vision-language\nmodels like CLIP exhibit strong generalization with just zero or a few normal\nimages. However, existing methods struggle with designing prompt templates,\ncomplex token interactions, or requiring additional fine-tuning, resulting in\nlimited flexibility. In this work, we present a simple yet effective method\ncalled AdaptCLIP based on two key insights. First, adaptive visual and textual\nrepresentations should be learned alternately rather than jointly. Second,\ncomparative learning between query and normal image prompt should incorporate\nboth contextual and aligned residual features, rather than relying solely on\nresidual features.

In the typical setup for unsupervised domain adaptation,\nlabeled data from a source domain and unlabeled data from a target domain are\nused to train a target model. However, access to labeled source domain data,\nparticularly in medical datasets, can be restricted due to privacy policies. As\na result, research has increasingly shifted to source-free domain adaptation\n(SFDA), which requires only a pretrained model from the source domain and\nunlabeled data from the target domain data for adaptation. Existing SFDA\nmethods often rely on domain-specific image style translation and\nself-supervision techniques to bridge the domain gap and train the target\ndomain model. However, the quality of domain-specific style-translated images\nand pseudo-labels produced by these methods still leaves room for improvement.\nMoreover, training the entire model during adaptation can be inefficient under\nlimited supervision. In this paper, we propose a novel SFDA framework to\naddress these challenges. Specifically, to effectively mitigate the impact of\ndomain gap in the initial training phase, we introduce preadaptation to\ngenerate a preadapted model, which serves as an initialization of target model\nand allows for the generation of high-quality enhanced pseudo-labels without\nintroducing extra parameters. Additionally, we propose a data-dependent\nfrequency prompt to more effectively translate target domain images into a\nsource-like style. To further enhance adaptation, we employ a style-related\nlayer fine-tuning strategy, specifically designed for SFDA, to train the target\nmodel using the prompted target domain images and pseudo-labels.

To perform NER, we fine-tuned the\nbsc-bio-ehr-en3 model, a RoBERTa-based biomedical linguistic model pre-trained\nin Spanish.

In real-world applications, models are\ntypically fixed after training. However, domain shifts caused by changes in the\nenvironment, sensor types, or sensor degradation often lead to a decline in\nmodel performance. Continuous Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) offers a solution by\nadapting a source-pretrained model to evolving, unlabeled target domains.\nDespite its potential, research on ALS point clouds remains limited, facing\nchallenges such as the absence of standardized datasets and the risk of\ncatastrophic forgetting and error accumulation during prolonged adaptation. To\ntackle these challenges, we propose APCoTTA, the first CTTA method tailored for\nALS point cloud semantic segmentation. We propose a dynamic trainable layer\nselection module. This module utilizes gradient information to select\nlow-confidence layers for training, and the remaining layers are kept frozen,\nmitigating catastrophic forgetting. To further reduce error accumulation, we\npropose an entropy-based consistency loss. By losing such samples based on\nentropy, we apply consistency loss only to the reliable samples, enhancing\nmodel stability.

Most existing approaches have\nadopted sparse binary supervision, indicating whether a pair of images and\nsentences matches or not. However, such sparse supervision covers a limited\nsubset of image-text relationships, neglecting their inherent many-to-many\ncorrespondences; an image can be described in numerous texts at different\ndescriptive levels. Moreover, existing approaches overlook the implicit\nconnections from general to specific descriptions, which form the underlying\nrationale for the many-to-many relationships between vision and language. In\nthis work, we propose descriptive image-text matching, called DITM, to learn\nthe graded contextual similarity between image and text by exploring the\ndescriptive flexibility of language. We formulate the descriptiveness score of\neach sentence with cumulative term frequency-inverse document frequency\n(TF-IDF) to balance the pairwise similarity according to the keywords in the\nsentence. Our method leverages sentence descriptiveness to learn robust\nimage-text matching in two key ways: (1) to refine the false negative labeling,\ndynamically relaxing the connectivity between positive and negative pairs, and\n(2) to build more precise matching, aligning a set of relevant sentences in a\ngeneric-to-specific order. By moving beyond rigid binary supervision, DITM\nenhances the discovery of both optimal matches and potential positive pairs.\nExtensive experiments on MS-COCO, Flickr30K, and CxC datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method in representing complex image-text relationships\ncompared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Then we leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) logic generation,\nn-hop sub-graph searching, and entailment-based sentence generation to realize\naccurate evidence retrieval. We demonstrate that our method improves the\nexisting models' performance in terms of identifying the exact evidence in a\nfree-form context, providing a reliable way to examine the resources of LLM's\nconclusion and help with the judgment of the trustworthiness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faGE-Chat\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u589e\u5f3a\u68c0\u7d22\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u63d0\u5347LLM\u751f\u6210\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u9700\u624b\u52a8\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u4efb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u3001CoT\u903b\u8f91\u751f\u6210\u3001n\u8df3\u5b50\u56fe\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u8574\u542b\u5f0f\u53e5\u5b50\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u8bc1\u636e\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u7531\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86LLM\u7ed3\u8bba\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5224\u65ad\u3002", "conclusion": "GE-Chat\u6846\u67b6\u4e3aLLM\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002"}}

However, adapting these models\nwith limited few-shot data often leads to overfitting, undermining their\nability to generalize to new tasks. To address this, we propose Multi-Modal\nRepresentation Learning (MMRL), which introduces a shared, learnable,\nmodality-agnostic representation space. MMRL generates space tokens projected\ninto both text and image encoders as representation tokens, enabling more\neffective cross-modal interactions. Unlike prior methods that mainly optimize\nclass token features, MMRL inserts representation tokens into higher encoder\nlayers--where task-specific features are more prominent--while preserving\ngeneral knowledge in the lower layers. During training, both class and\nrepresentation features are jointly optimized: a trainable projection layer is\napplied to representation tokens for task adaptation, while the projection\nlayer for class token remains frozen to retain pre-trained knowledge. To\nfurther promote generalization, we introduce a regularization term aligning\nclass and text features with the frozen VLM's zero-shot features. At inference,\na decoupling strategy uses both class and representation features for base\ntasks, but only class features for novel tasks due to their stronger\ngeneralization. Building upon this, we propose MMRL++, a parameter-efficient\nand interaction-aware extension that significantly reduces trainable parameters\nand enhances intra-modal interactions--particularly across the layers of\nrepresentation tokens--allowing gradient sharing and instance-specific\ninformation to propagate more effectively through the network.

This study introduces Quicker, an evidence-based clinical decision\nsupport system powered by large language models (LLMs), designed to automate\nevidence synthesis and generate clinical recommendations modeled after standard\nclinical guideline development processes. Quicker implements a fully automated\nchain that covers all phases, from questions to clinical recommendations, and\nfurther enables customized decision-making through integrated tools and\ninteractive user interfaces. To evaluate Quicker's capabilities, we developed\nthe Q2CRBench-3 benchmark dataset, based on clinical guideline development\nrecords for three different diseases. Experimental results highlighted\nQuicker's strong performance, with fine-grained question decomposition tailored\nto user preferences, retrieval sensitivities comparable to human experts, and\nliterature screening performance approaching comprehensive inclusion of\nrelevant studies.

However, existing methods rely\nlargely on 2D-rendered pose images for motion guidance, which limits\ngeneralization and discards essential 3D information for open-world animation.\nTo tackle this problem, we propose MTVCrafter (Motion Tokenization Video\nCrafter), the first framework that directly models raw 3D motion sequences\n(i.e., 4D motion) for human image animation. Specifically, we introduce 4DMoT\n(4D motion tokenizer) to quantize 3D motion sequences into 4D motion tokens.\nCompared to 2D-rendered pose images, 4D motion tokens offer more robust\nspatio-temporal cues and avoid strict pixel-level alignment between pose image\nand character, enabling more flexible and disentangled control. Then, we\nintroduce MV-DiT (Motion-aware Video DiT). By designing unique motion attention\nwith 4D positional encodings, MV-DiT can effectively leverage motion tokens as\n4D compact yet expressive context for human image animation in the complex 3D\nworld. Hence, it marks a significant step forward in this field and opens a new\ndirection for pose-guided human video generation. Experiments show that our\nMTVCrafter achieves state-of-the-art results with an FID-VID of 6.98,\nsurpassing the second-best by 65%.

To address these issues, we propose ADHMR, a framework that\nAligns a Diffusion-based HMR model in a preference optimization manner. First,\nwe train a human mesh prediction assessment model, HMR-Scorer, capable of\nevaluating predictions even for in-the-wild images without 3D annotations. We\nthen use HMR-Scorer to create a preference dataset, where each input image has\na pair of winner and loser mesh predictions. This dataset is used to finetune\nthe base model using direct preference optimization. Moreover, HMR-Scorer also\nhelps improve existing HMR models by data cleaning, even with fewer training\nsamples. Extensive experiments show that ADHMR outperforms current\nstate-of-the-art methods.

A more prevalent and challenging problem is\nstructural repetition. In structural repetition, the repeated code appears in\nvarious patterns but possesses a fixed structure, which can be inherently\nreflected in grammar. In this paper, we formally define structural repetition\nand propose an efficient decoding approach called RPG, which stands for\nRepetition Penalization based on Grammar, to alleviate the repetition problems\nin code generation for LLMs. Specifically, RPG first leverages grammar rules to\nidentify repetition problems during code generation, and then strategically\ndecays the likelihood of critical tokens that contribute to repetitions,\nthereby mitigating them in code generation. To facilitate this study, we\nconstruct a new dataset CodeRepetEval to comprehensively evaluate approaches\nfor mitigating the repetition problems in code generation. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that RPG substantially outperforms the\nbest-performing baselines on CodeRepetEval dataset as well as HumanEval and\nMBPP benchmarks, effectively reducing repetitions and enhancing the quality of\ngenerated code.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u6cd5\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5RPG\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u91cd\u590d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u795e\u7ecf\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u91cd\u590d\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u7ed3\u6784\u91cd\u590d\uff09\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u5185\u5bb9\u91cd\u590d\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u66f4\u666e\u904d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u91cd\u590d\u3002", "method": "RPG\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u6cd5\u89c4\u5219\u8bc6\u522b\u91cd\u590d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8870\u51cf\u5173\u952e\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u4f3c\u7136\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u91cd\u590d\u3002", "result": "RPG\u5728CodeRepetEval\u3001HumanEval\u548cMBPP\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u91cd\u590d\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4ee3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "RPG\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u91cd\u590d\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

We train our model using\nthe publicly available ORION dataset of restained H&E and mIF images from\ncolorectal cancer tissue, and validate it on two independent datasets. MIPHEI\nachieves accurate cell-type classification from H&E alone, with F1 scores of\n0.88 for Pan-CK, 0.57 for CD3e, 0.56 for SMA, 0.36 for CD68, and 0.30 for CD20,\nsubstantially outperforming both a state-of-the-art baseline and a random\nclassifier for most markers. Our results indicate that our model effectively\ncaptures the complex relationships between nuclear morphologies in their tissue\ncontext, as visible in H&E images and molecular markers defining specific cell\ntypes. MIPHEI offers a promising step toward enabling cell-type-aware analysis\nof large-scale H&E datasets, in view of uncovering relationships between\nspatial cellular organization and patient outcomes.", "AI": {"tldr": "MIPHEI\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eU-Net\u548cViT\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4eceH&E\u67d3\u8272\u56fe\u50cf\u9884\u6d4bmIF\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u80de\u7c7b\u578b\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3mIF\u6280\u672f\u56e0\u6210\u672c\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u96be\u4ee5\u4e34\u5e8a\u666e\u53ca\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528H&E\u56fe\u50cf\u9884\u6d4bmIF\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528U-Net\u67b6\u6784\u7ed3\u5408ViT\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e8eORION\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e8e\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6807\u8bb0\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5982Pan-CK\uff08F1=0.88\uff09\u3001CD3e\uff08F1=0.57\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "MIPHEI\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21H&E\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u7ec6\u80de\u7c7b\u578b\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ec6\u80de\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e0e\u60a3\u8005\u9884\u540e\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002"}}

To better understand the\ninterplay between these learning modes, we draw inspiration from evolutionary\nbiology's analogous adaptive strategies: genetic encoding (akin to IWL,\nadapting over generations and fixed within an individual's lifetime) and\nphenotypic plasticity (akin to ICL, enabling flexible behavioral responses to\nenvironmental cues). In evolutionary biology, environmental predictability\ndictates the balance between these strategies: stability favors genetic\nencoding, while reliable predictive cues promote phenotypic plasticity. We\nexperimentally operationalize these dimensions of predictability and\nsystematically investigate their influence on the ICL/IWL balance in\nTransformers. Using regression and classification tasks, we show that high\nenvironmental stability decisively favors IWL, as predicted, with a sharp\ntransition at maximal stability. Conversely, high cue reliability enhances ICL\nefficacy, particularly when stability is low. Furthermore, learning dynamics\nreveal task-contingent temporal evolution: while a canonical ICL-to-IWL shift\noccurs in some settings (e.g., classification with many classes), we\ndemonstrate that scenarios with easier IWL (e.g., fewer classes) or slower ICL\nacquisition (e.g., regression) can exhibit an initial IWL phase later yielding\nto ICL dominance.

Existing methods to evaluate privacy leakage in LLMs often use\nmemorized prefixes or simple instructions to extract data, both of which\nwell-alignment models can easily block.

In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of\njailbreak attacks in extracting sensitive information, bridging privacy leakage\nand jailbreak attacks in LLMs. Moreover, we propose PIG, a novel framework\ntargeting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and addressing the\nlimitations of current jailbreak methods. Specifically, PIG identifies PII\nentities and their types in privacy queries, uses in-context learning to build\na privacy context, and iteratively updates it with three gradient-based\nstrategies to elicit target PII. We evaluate PIG and existing jailbreak methods\nusing two privacy-related datasets. Experiments on four white-box and two\nblack-box LLMs show that PIG outperforms baseline methods and achieves\nstate-of-the-art (SoTA) results.

However,\ndiffusion models still routinely generate images that would not exist in\nreality, such as a dog floating above the ground or with unrealistic texture\nartifacts. We define the concept of feasibility as whether attributes in a\nsynthetic image could realistically exist in the real-world domain; synthetic\nimages containing attributes that violate this criterion are considered\ninfeasible. Intuitively, infeasible images are typically considered\nout-of-distribution; thus, training on such images is expected to hinder a\nmodel's ability to generalize to real-world data, and they should therefore be\nexcluded from the training set whenever possible. However, does feasibility\nreally matter? In this paper, we investigate whether enforcing feasibility is\nnecessary when generating synthetic training data for CLIP-based classifiers,\nfocusing on three target attributes: background, color, and texture. We\nintroduce VariReal, a pipeline that minimally edits a given source image to\ninclude feasible or infeasible attributes given by the textual prompt generated\nby a large language model. Our experiments show that feasibility minimally\naffects LoRA-fine-tuned CLIP performance, with mostly less than 0.3% difference\nin top-1 accuracy across three fine-grained datasets. Also, the attribute\nmatters on whether the feasible/infeasible images adversarially influence the\nclassification performance.

Project page: https://3dfixup.github.io/", "summary": "Despite significant advances in modeling image priors via diffusion models,\n3D-aware image editing remains challenging, in part because the object is only\nspecified via a single image. To tackle this challenge, we propose 3D-Fixup, a\nnew framework for editing 2D images guided by learned 3D priors. The framework\nsupports difficult editing situations such as object translation and 3D\nrotation. To achieve this, we leverage a training-based approach that harnesses\nthe generative power of diffusion models. As video data naturally encodes\nreal-world physical dynamics, we turn to video data for generating training\ndata pairs, i.e., a source and a target frame. Rather than relying solely on a\nsingle trained model to infer transformations between source and target frames,\nwe incorporate 3D guidance from an Image-to-3D model, which bridges this\nchallenging task by explicitly projecting 2D information into 3D space.

However, the origin of this\nneural scaling law -- the finding that loss decreases as a power law with model\nsize -- remains unclear. Starting from two empirical principles -- that LLMs\nrepresent more things than the model dimensions (widths) they have (i.e.,\nrepresentations are superposed), and that words or concepts in language occur\nwith varying frequencies -- we constructed a toy model to study the loss\nscaling with model size. We found that when superposition is weak, meaning only\nthe most frequent features are represented without interference, the scaling of\nloss with model size depends on the underlying feature frequency; if feature\nfrequencies follow a power law, so does the loss. In contrast, under strong\nsuperposition, where all features are represented but overlap with each other,\nthe loss becomes inversely proportional to the model dimension across a wide\nrange of feature frequency distributions. This robust scaling behavior is\nexplained geometrically: when many more vectors are packed into a lower\ndimensional space, the interference (squared overlaps) between vectors scales\ninversely with that dimension. We then analyzed four families of open-sourced\nLLMs and found that they exhibit strong superposition and quantitatively match\nthe predictions of our toy model. The Chinchilla scaling law turned out to also\nagree with our results. We conclude that representation superposition is an\nimportant mechanism underlying the observed neural scaling laws.

Goal: We introduce the Reviewer,\na 3D visual interface projecting EMG signals directly into the decoder's\nclassification space, providing intuitive, real-time insight into PR algorithm\nbehavior. This structured feedback reduces cognitive load and fosters mutual,\ndata-driven adaptation between user-generated EMG patterns and decoder\nboundaries. Methods: A 10-session study with 12 able-bodied participants\ncompared PR performance after motor-based training and updating using the\nReviewer versus conventional virtual arm visualization. Performance was\nassessed using a Fitts law task that involved the aperture of the cursor and\nthe control of orientation. Results: Participants trained with the Reviewer\nachieved higher completion rates, reduced overshoot, and improved path\nefficiency and throughput compared to the standard visualization group.\nSignificance: The Reviewer introduces decoder-informed motor training,\nfacilitating immediate and consistent PR-based myoelectric control\nimprovements.

We introduce\nMultimodal Adaptation and Self-Data Distillation for Speculative Decoding of\nVision-Language Models (MASSV), which transforms existing small language models\ninto effective multimodal drafters through a two-phase approach. MASSV first\nconnects the target VLM's vision encoder to the draft model via a lightweight\ntrainable projector, then applies self-distilled visual instruction tuning\nusing responses generated by the target VLM to align token predictions.\nComprehensive experiments across the Qwen2.5-VL and Gemma3 model families\ndemonstrate that MASSV increases accepted length by up to 30% and delivers\nend-to-end inference speedups of up to 1.46x on visually-grounded tasks. MASSV\nprovides a scalable, architecture-compatible method for accelerating both\ncurrent and future VLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "MASSV\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8349\u7a3f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u4e14\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "MASSV\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u6295\u5f71\u5668\u8fde\u63a5\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u81ea\u84b8\u998f\u89c6\u89c9\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u6574\u5bf9\u9f50\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728Qwen2.5-VL\u548cGemma3\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cMASSV\u5c06\u63a5\u53d7\u957f\u5ea6\u63d0\u534730%\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad81.46\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "MASSV\u4e3a\u52a0\u901f\u5f53\u524d\u53ca\u672a\u6765\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u517c\u5bb9\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

To address these\nissues, we develop a hybrid Gen-SemCom system with a critical information\nembedding (CIE) framework, where both text prompts and semantically critical\nfeatures are extracted for transmissions. First, a novel approach of semantic\nfiltering is proposed to select and transmit the semantically critical features\nof images relevant to semantic label. By integrating the text prompt and\ncritical features, the receiver reconstructs high-fidelity images using a\ndiffusion-based generative model. Next, we propose the generative visual\ninformation fidelity (GVIF) metric to evaluate the visual quality of the\ngenerated image. By characterizing the statistical models of image features,\nthe GVIF metric quantifies the mutual information between the distorted\nfeatures and their original counterparts. By maximizing the GVIF metric, we\ndesign a channel-adaptive Gen-SemCom system that adaptively control the volume\nof features and compression rate according to the channel state. Experimental\nresults validate the GVIF metric's sensitivity to visual fidelity, correlating\nwith both the PSNR and critical information volume. In addition, the optimized\nsystem achieves superior performance over benchmarking schemes in terms of\nhigher PSNR and lower FID scores.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u7eaf\u63d0\u793a\u9a71\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u4e22\u5931\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86GVIF\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7eaf\u63d0\u793a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u4f1a\u4e22\u5931\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8bed\u4e49\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65b9\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u5efa\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1GVIF\u6307\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "GVIF\u6307\u6807\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728PSNR\u548cFID\u5f97\u5206\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df7\u5408Gen-SemCom\u7cfb\u7edf\u548cGVIF\u6307\u6807\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u548c\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}
