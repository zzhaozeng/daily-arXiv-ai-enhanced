This step is fundamental\nfor all applications that include a human player, but it remains a mostly\nunexplored topic in symbolic music processing. In this work, we formalize the\nproblem as a collection of interdependent subtasks, and propose a unified graph\nneural network (GNN) framework that targets the case of piano music and\nquantized symbolic input. Our method employs a multi-task GNN to jointly\npredict voice connections, staff assignments, pitch spelling, key signature,\nstem direction, octave shifts, and clef signs. A dedicated postprocessing\npipeline generates print-ready MusicXML/MEI outputs. Comprehensive evaluation\non two diverse piano corpora (J-Pop and DCML Romantic) demonstrates that our\nunified model achieves good accuracy across all subtasks, compared to existing\nsystems that only specialize in specific subtasks. These results indicate that\na shared GNN encoder with lightweight task-specific decoders in a multi-task\nsetting offers a scalable and effective solution for automatic music engraving."}

We interleave drafting and\nverification per token. While the LLM is verifying the current token in its\nfinal layers, the early-exit path simultaneously drafts the next token. Such a\nverify-while-draft scheme keeps all units busy and validates tokens on-the-fly\nanalogous to pipelining the speculation and verification stages. Empirical\nresults confirm that PPSD achieves state-of-the-art acceleration in\nself-speculative LLM inference. On diverse benchmarks, PPSD achieves speedup\nratios in the range of 2.01x~3.81x, which gains almost the optimal acceleration\nat the fixed acceptance rate and exit position, showcasing its advancement in\nproviding efficient self-speculation."}

However, manual matching is labor-intensive\nand error-prone, leading to recruitment delays. Pipelines incorporating large\nlanguage models (LLMs) offer a promising solution. We conducted a systematic\nreview of studies published between 2020 and 2025 from three academic databases\nand one preprint server, identifying LLM-based approaches to clinical trial\nmatching. Of 126 unique articles, 31 met inclusion criteria. Reviewed studies\nfocused on matching patient-to-criterion only (n=4), patient-to-trial only\n(n=10), trial-to-patient only (n=2), binary eligibility classification only\n(n=1) or combined tasks (n=14). Sixteen used synthetic data; fourteen used real\npatient data; one used both. Variability in datasets and evaluation metrics\nlimited cross-study comparability. In studies with direct comparisons, the\nGPT-4 model consistently outperformed other models, even finely-tuned ones, in\nmatching and eligibility extraction, albeit at higher cost. Promising\nstrategies included zero-shot prompting with proprietary LLMs like the GPT-4o\nmodel, advanced retrieval methods, and fine-tuning smaller, open-source models\nfor data privacy when incorporation of large models into hospital\ninfrastructure is infeasible. Key challenges include accessing sufficiently\nlarge real-world data sets, and deployment-associated challenges such as\nreducing cost, mitigating risk of hallucinations, data leakage, and bias. This\nreview synthesizes progress in applying LLMs to clinical trial matching,\nhighlighting promising directions and key limitations. Standardized metrics,\nmore realistic test sets, and attention to cost-efficiency and fairness will be\ncritical for broader deployment."}

The MM prompt models missing states in\nincomplete data, enhancing the model's adaptability to missing information. The\nMV prompt learns relationships between subjective (\\textit{i.e.}, text and\nimage) and objective (\\textit{i.e.}, comments) perspectives, effectively\ndetecting rumors. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks\ndemonstrate that \\textsf{TriSPrompt} achieves an accuracy gain of over 13\\%\ncompared to state-of-the-art methods.

The primary contribution of this study is a feature\nmatching algorithm for aerial and ground images, whose core idea is to generate\nintermediate views to alleviate perspective distortions caused by the extensive\nviewpoint changes. First, by using aerial images only, sparse models are\nreconstructed through an incremental SfM (Structure from Motion) engine due to\ntheir large scene coverage. Second, 3D Gaussian Splatting is then adopted for\nscene rendering by taking as inputs sparse points and oriented images. For\naccurate view rendering, a render viewpoint determination algorithm is designed\nby using the oriented camera poses of aerial images, which is used to generate\nhigh-quality intermediate images that can bridge the gap between aerial and\nground images. Third, with the aid of intermediate images, reliable feature\nmatching is conducted for match pairs from render-aerial and render-ground\nimages, and final matches can be generated by transmitting correspondences\nthrough intermediate views. By using real aerial and ground datasets, the\nvalidation of the proposed solution has been verified in terms of feature\nmatching and scene rendering and compared comprehensively with widely used\nmethods.

We introduce Progressive\nAlignment Representation Training (PART), a multi-stage and multi-task\nframework that separates within-language from cross-language alignment. During\ncross-language training, LLM parameters are dynamically activated, and\ntext-based tasks are later introduced to enhance multilingual understanding.\nExperiments on CommonVoice 15, Fleurs, Wenetspeech, and CoVoST2 show that PART\nsurpasses conventional approaches, with analysis confirming its ability to\nbalance language-specific distinctions and cross-language generalization. These\nresults demonstrate PART's effectiveness and generality for multilingual speech\nmodality alignment."}

To address this limitation, we propose a novel\nhuman-like framework called OmniScene. First, we introduce the OmniScene\nVision-Language Model (OmniVLM), a vision-language framework that integrates\nmulti-view and temporal perception for holistic 4D scene understanding. Then,\nharnessing a teacher-student OmniVLM architecture and knowledge distillation,\nwe embed textual representations into 3D instance features for semantic\nsupervision, enriching feature learning, and explicitly capturing human-like\nattentional semantics. These feature representations are further aligned with\nhuman driving behaviors, forming a more human-like\nperception-understanding-action architecture.

However, existing IML methods\nremain manipulation-process-agnostic, directly producing localization masks in\na one-shot prediction paradigm without modeling the underlying editing steps.\nThis one-shot paradigm compresses the high-dimensional compositional space into\na single binary mask, inducing severe dimensional collapse, thereby creating a\nfundamental mismatch with the intrinsic nature of the IML task.\n  To address this, we are the first to reformulate image manipulation\nlocalization as a conditional sequence prediction task, proposing the RITA\nframework. RITA predicts manipulated regions layer-by-layer in an ordered\nmanner, using each step's prediction as the condition for the next, thereby\nexplicitly modeling temporal dependencies and hierarchical structures among\nediting operations.\n  To enable training and evaluation, we synthesize multi-step manipulation data\nand construct a new benchmark HSIM. We further propose the HSS metric to assess\nsequential order and hierarchical alignment. Extensive experiments show RITA\nachieves SOTA on traditional benchmarks and provides a solid foundation for the\nnovel hierarchical localization task, validating its potential as a general and\neffective paradigm.

Finally, multiple\nEfficient Multi-Scale Attention mechanisms are integrated into our model to\nreduce the computational overhead and extract deep visual representations,\nthereby improving the capacity for small object detection. In the experiment,\nwe compared SDE-DET with the Yolo series and other mainstream detection models\nin Shatian pomelo detection. The presented SDE-DET model achieved scores of\n0.883, 0.771, 0.838, 0.497, and 0.823 in Precision, Recall, mAP@0.5,\nmAP@0.5:0.95 and F1-score, respectively. SDE-DET has achieved state-of-the-art\nperformance on the STP-AgriData dataset.

To address these challenges, we propose the first Universal Camouflage\nAttack (UCA) framework for VLM-AD. Unlike previous methods that focus on\noptimizing the logit layer, UCA operates in the feature space to generate\nphysically realizable camouflage textures that exhibit strong generalization\nacross different user commands and model architectures. Motivated by the\nobserved vulnerability of encoder and projection layers in VLM-AD, UCA\nintroduces a feature divergence loss (FDL) that maximizes the representational\ndiscrepancy between clean and adversarial images. In addition, UCA incorporates\na multi-scale learning strategy and adjusts the sampling ratio to enhance its\nadaptability to changes in scale and viewpoint diversity in real-world\nscenarios, thereby improving training stability.

To overcome these limitations, we introduce PhysCtrl, a novel\nframework for physics-grounded image-to-video generation with physical\nparameters and force control. At its core is a generative physics network that\nlearns the distribution of physical dynamics across four materials (elastic,\nsand, plasticine, and rigid) via a diffusion model conditioned on physics\nparameters and applied forces. We represent physical dynamics as 3D point\ntrajectories and train on a large-scale synthetic dataset of 550K animations\ngenerated by physics simulators. We enhance the diffusion model with a novel\nspatiotemporal attention block that emulates particle interactions and\nincorporates physics-based constraints during training to enforce physical\nplausibility. Experiments show that PhysCtrl generates realistic,\nphysics-grounded motion trajectories which, when used to drive image-to-video\nmodels, yield high-fidelity, controllable videos that outperform existing\nmethods in both visual quality and physical plausibility.

Our results highlight the effectiveness of\ncombining speech disentanglement with keyframe-aware diffusion for talking-head\ngeneration."}

We designed the Interleaved Cognitive\nEvaluation (ICE), a deconfounded benchmark to systematically manipulate these\nload factors on challenging multi-hop reasoning tasks.
