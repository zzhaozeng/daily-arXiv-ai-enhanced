However,\nthese approaches often struggle with loose-fitting garments due to two key\nlimitations: (1) They rely on human body semantic maps to align garments with\nthe body, but these maps become unreliable when body contours are obscured by\nloose-fitting garments, resulting in degraded outcomes; (2) They train garment\nsynthesis networks on a per-frame basis without utilizing temporal information,\nleading to noticeable jittering artifacts. To address these challenges, we\npropose a two-stage approach for robust semantic map estimation. First, we\nextract a garment-invariant representation from the raw input image. This\nrepresentation is then passed through an auxiliary network to estimate the\nsemantic map. This enhances the robustness of semantic map estimation under\nloose-fitting garments during garment-specific dataset generation. Furthermore,\nwe introduce a recurrent garment synthesis framework that incorporates temporal\ndependencies to improve frame-to-frame coherence while maintaining real-time\nperformance. We conducted qualitative and quantitative evaluations to\ndemonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both image\nquality and temporal coherence.

As their influence grows, understanding their decision making and\nunderlying personality becomes essential. In this work, we interpret model\npersonality using our proposed Supernova Event Dataset, a novel dataset with\ndiverse articles spanning biographies, historical events, news, and scientific\ndiscoveries. We use this dataset to benchmark LLMs on extracting and ranking\nkey events from text, a subjective and complex challenge that requires\nreasoning over long-range context and modeling causal chains. We evaluate small\nmodels like Phi-4, Orca 2, and Qwen 2.5, and large, stronger models such as\nClaude 3.7, Gemini 2.5, and OpenAI o3, and propose a framework where another\nLLM acts as a judge to infer each model's personality based on its selection\nand classification of events.

LLMs are\nremarkably effective at processing unstructured text and inferring meaning from\ncontext, offering new affordances that challenge long-standing divides between\ncomputational and interpretive methods. This raises both opportunities and\nchallenges for HPSS, which emphasizes interpretive methodologies and\nunderstands meaning as context-dependent, ambiguous, and historically situated.\nWe argue that HPSS is uniquely positioned not only to benefit from LLMs'\ncapabilities but also to interrogate their epistemic assumptions and\ninfrastructural implications. To this end, we first offer a concise primer on\nLLM architectures and training paradigms tailored to non-technical readers. We\nframe LLMs not as neutral tools but as epistemic infrastructures that encode\nassumptions about meaning, context, and similarity, conditioned by their\ntraining data, architecture, and patterns of use. We then examine how\ncomputational techniques enhanced by LLMs, such as structuring data, detecting\npatterns, and modeling dynamic processes, can be applied to support\ninterpretive research in HPSS. Our analysis compares full-context and\ngenerative models, outlines strategies for domain and task adaptation (e.g.,\ncontinued pretraining, fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation), and\nevaluates their respective strengths and limitations for interpretive inquiry\nin HPSS. We conclude with four lessons for integrating LLMs into HPSS: (1)\nmodel selection involves interpretive trade-offs; (2) LLM literacy is\nfoundational; (3) HPSS must define its own benchmarks and corpora; and (4) LLMs\nshould enhance, not replace, interpretive methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u53f2\u3001\u54f2\u5b66\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u5b66\uff08HPSS\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u673a\u9047\u4e0e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6574\u5408LLMs\u7684\u56db\u70b9\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "HPSS\u9886\u57df\u5f3a\u8c03\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u800cLLMs\u5728\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672c\u5904\u7406\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3aHPSS\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u9700\u5ba1\u89c6\u5176\u8ba4\u77e5\u5047\u8bbe\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u7ae0\u9996\u5148\u4e3a\u975e\u6280\u672f\u8bfb\u8005\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86LLM\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u89c6\u4e3a\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u610f\u4e49\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u3002\u968f\u540e\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u652f\u6301HPSS\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0cLLMs\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u6a21\u5f0f\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u5bf9HPSS\u6709\u5e2e\u52a9\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6587\u7ae0\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u56db\u70b9\u6574\u5408LLMs\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u9700\u6743\u8861\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff1bLLM\u7d20\u517b\u662f\u57fa\u7840\uff1bHPSS\u9700\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff1bLLMs\u5e94\u589e\u5f3a\u800c\u975e\u66ff\u4ee3\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present Med-U1, a unified framework for robust\nreasoning across medical QA tasks with diverse output formats, ranging from\nMCQs to complex generation and computation tasks. Med-U1 employs pure\nlarge-scale reinforcement learning with mixed rule-based binary reward\nfunctions, incorporating a length penalty to manage output verbosity.

Most existing methods\nhave two limitations: (i) low robustness in handling corrupted image data\ncollected by IoT devices; and (ii) high consumption of computational and\ntransmission resources. To this end, we propose the Grouped NonLinear\ntransformation generation method (GroupNL), which generates diversified feature\nmaps by utilizing data-agnostic Nonlinear Transformation Functions (NLFs) to\nimprove the robustness of the CNN model. Specifically, partial convolution\nfilters are designated as seed filters in a convolutional layer, and a small\nset of feature maps, i.e., seed feature maps, are first generated based on\nvanilla convolution operation. Then, we split seed feature maps into several\ngroups, each with a set of different NLFs, to generate corresponding diverse\nfeature maps with in-place nonlinear processing. Moreover, GroupNL effectively\nreduces the parameter transmission between multiple nodes during model training\nby setting the hyperparameters of NLFs to random initialization and not\nupdating them during model training, and reduces the computing resources by\nusing NLFs to generate feature maps instead of most feature maps generated\nbased on sliding windows.

Existing optimization approaches highlights a tendency toward\n\"overthinking\", yet lack fine-grained analysis. In this work, we focus on\nSelf-Affirmation Reflections: redundant reflective steps that affirm prior\ncontent and often occurs after the already correct reasoning steps.\nObservations of both original and optimized reasoning models reveal pervasive\nself-affirmation reflections. Notably, these reflections sometimes lead to\nlonger outputs in optimized models than their original counterparts. Through\ndetailed analysis, we uncover an intriguing pattern: compared to other\nreflections, the leading words (i.e., the first word of sentences) in\nself-affirmation reflections exhibit a distinct probability bias. Motivated by\nthis insight, we can locate self-affirmation reflections and conduct a\ntrain-free experiment demonstrating that suppressing self-affirmation\nreflections reduces output length without degrading accuracy across multiple\nmodels (R1-Distill-Models, QwQ-32B, and Qwen3-32B). Furthermore, we also\nimprove current train-based method by explicitly suppressing such reflections.\nIn our experiments, we achieve length compression of 18.7\\% in train-free\nsettings and 50.2\\% in train-based settings for R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B.

We first perform an MIA method under the white-box setting, where we\ncan obtain the embeddings of the image through the vision part of the target\nLVLM. The attacks are based on the embedding similarity between the image and\nits corrupted version. We further explore a more practical scenario where we\nhave no knowledge about target LVLMs and we can only query the target LVLMs\nwith an image and a question. We then conduct the attack by utilizing the\noutput text embeddings' similarity. Experiments on existing datasets validate\nthe effectiveness of our proposed attack methods under those two different\nsettings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LVLM\uff09\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08ICIMIA\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u50cf\u635f\u574f\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u68c0\u6d4b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u5305\u542b\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u68c0\u6d4b\u56fe\u50cf\u662f\u5426\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u635f\u574f\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\uff08ICIMIA\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u767d\u76d2\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u9ed1\u76d2\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ICIMIA\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4bLVLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6210\u5458\u4fe1\u606f\u3002"}}

We review progress in three key areas: knowledge\ngraph construction, deep learning approaches, and the integration of\npre-trained and large language models (LLMs). While LBD has made notable\nprogress, several fundamental challenges remain unresolved, particularly\nconcerning scalability, reliance on structured data, and the need for extensive\nmanual curation.

To address this issue, we propose a local-global feature complementation\nnetwork (LGCN) for VPR which integrates a parallel CNN-ViT hybrid architecture\nwith a dynamic feature fusion module (DFM). The DFM performs dynamic feature\nfusion through joint modeling of spatial and channel-wise dependencies.\nFurthermore, to enhance the expressiveness and adaptability of the ViT branch\nfor VPR tasks, we introduce lightweight frequency-to-spatial fusion adapters\ninto the frozen ViT backbone.

While most existing TTA methods for video primarily utilize visual\nsupervisory signals, they often overlook the potential contribution of inherent\naudio data. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that incorporates\naudio information into video TTA. Our method capitalizes on the rich semantic\ncontent of audio to generate audio-assisted pseudo-labels, a new concept in the\ncontext of video TTA. Specifically, we propose an audio-to-video label mapping\nmethod by first employing pre-trained audio models to classify audio signals\nextracted from videos and then mapping the audio-based predictions to video\nlabel spaces through large language models, thereby establishing a connection\nbetween the audio categories and video labels. To effectively leverage the\ngenerated pseudo-labels, we present a flexible adaptation cycle that determines\nthe optimal number of adaptation iterations for each sample, based on changes\nin loss and consistency across different views. This enables a customized\nadaptation process for each sample.

However, HDR increases data demands, posing challenges for\nbandwidth efficiency and compression techniques.\n  Advances in compression and display technologies require more precise image\nquality assessment, particularly in the high-fidelity range where perceptual\ndifferences are subtle.\n  To address this gap, we introduce AIC-HDR2025, the first such HDR dataset,\ncomprising 100 test images generated from five HDR sources, each compressed\nusing four codecs at five compression levels. It covers the high-fidelity\nrange, from visible distortions to compression levels below the visually\nlossless threshold.\n  A subjective study was conducted using the JPEG AIC-3 test methodology,\ncombining plain and boosted triplet comparisons. In total, 34,560 ratings were\ncollected from 151 participants across four fully controlled labs. The results\nconfirm that AIC-3 enables precise HDR quality estimation, with 95\\% confidence\nintervals averaging a width of 0.27 at 1 JND.

Moreover, we\ncreate a diverse Q&A dataset of 500 questions generated via the DataMorgana\nsetup across a broad range of WebOrganizer topics and formats. DoTA-RAG\nimproves the answer correctness score from 0.752 (baseline, using LiveRAG\npre-built vector store) to 1.478 while maintaining low latency, and it achieves\na 0.929 correctness score on the Live Challenge Day.

Our method comprises two key post-processing modules: (i)\nMotion-Aware Median Filtering, which suppresses blink-induced spikes while\npreserving natural gaze dynamics, and (ii) Optical Flow-Based Local Refinement,\nwhich aligns gaze predictions with cumulative event motion to reduce spatial\njitter and temporal discontinuities.

This embedding model is then integrated with a Reasoning and\nActing agent (ReAct), which serves as a powerful tool for answering complex\nuser queries that require multi-step reasoning, planning, and knowledge\ninference.\n  Through ablation studies, we demonstrate that: (a) LLM query augmentation\nimproves the quality of embeddings, (b) Contrastive loss and other methods that\navoid in-batch negatives are superior for datasets with queries related to many\nitems, and (c) It is crucial to balance positive and negative in-batch samples.\nAfter training and testing on our dataset, we observe a substantial\nimprovement: HIT@1 increases by +54.2%, MAP@100 by +50.1%, and NDCG@10 by\n+54.7%, averaged across all tasks and models. Additionally, we empirically\ndemonstrate the model's planning and tool invocation capabilities when\nanswering complex questions related to industrial asset maintenance, showcasing\nits effectiveness in supporting Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) in their\nday-to-day operations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u589e\u5f3a\u5d4c\u5165\u548cReAct\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5de5\u4e1a\u8d44\u4ea7\u7ef4\u62a4\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u8d44\u4ea7\u7ef4\u62a4\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u51b3\u7b56\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u8d44\u4ea7\u505c\u673a\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLM\u589e\u5f3a\u8f93\u5165\u4efb\u52a1\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408ReAct\u4ee3\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u63a8\u65ad\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0cHIT@1\u589e\u52a054.2%\uff0cMAP@100\u589e\u52a050.1%\uff0cNDCG@10\u589e\u52a054.7%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u5de5\u4e1a\u8d44\u4ea7\u7ef4\u62a4\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u7b54\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e13\u5bb6\u65e5\u5e38\u5de5\u4f5c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Typically, existing CBM\nmethods associate the final layer of visual encoders with concepts to explain\nthe model's predictions. However, we empirically discover the phenomenon of\nconcept preference variation, that is, the concepts are preferably associated\nwith the features at different layers than those only at the final layer; yet a\nblind last-layer-based association neglects such a preference variation and\nthus weakens the accurate correspondences between features and concepts,\nimpairing model interpretability. To address this issue, we propose a novel\nMulti-layer Visual Preference-enhanced Concept Bottleneck Model (MVP-CBM),\nwhich comprises two key novel modules: (1) intra-layer concept preference\nmodeling, which captures the preferred association of different concepts with\nfeatures at various visual layers, and (2) multi-layer concept sparse\nactivation fusion, which sparsely aggregates concept activations from multiple\nlayers to enhance performance. Thus, by explicitly modeling concept\npreferences, MVP-CBM can comprehensively leverage multi-layer visual\ninformation to provide a more nuanced and accurate explanation of model\ndecisions.

However,\nthese large models typically process videos by averaging embedding outputs from\nmultiple clips over time to produce fixed-length representations. This approach\nfails to account for a variety of time-related features, such as variable video\ndurations, chronological order of events, and temporal variance in feature\nsignificance. While methods for temporal modeling do exist, they often require\nsignificant architectural changes and expensive retraining, making them\nimpractical for off-the-shelf, fine-tuned large encoders. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose DejaVid, an encoder-agnostic method that enhances model\nperformance without the need for retraining or altering the architecture. Our\nframework converts a video into a variable-length temporal sequence of\nembeddings, which we call a multivariate time series (MTS). An MTS naturally\npreserves temporal order and accommodates variable video durations. We then\nlearn per-timestep, per-feature weights over the encoded MTS frames, allowing\nus to account for variations in feature importance over time. We introduce a\nnew neural network architecture inspired by traditional time series alignment\nalgorithms for this learning task. Our evaluation demonstrates that DejaVid\nsubstantially improves the performance of a state-of-the-art large encoder,\nachieving leading Top-1 accuracy of 77.2% on Something-Something V2, 89.1% on\nKinetics-400, and 88.6% on HMDB51, while adding fewer than 1.8% additional\nlearnable parameters and requiring less than 3 hours of training time.

Through systematic analysis, we identify three key pathological\nattention behaviors in LVLMs: (1) weak visual grounding, where attention to\nvisual tokens is insufficient or misallocated, over-focusing on uninformative\nregions; (2) language prior dominance, where excessive attention to prior\nresponse tokens reinforces autoregressive patterns and impairs multimodal\nalignment; (3) prompt redundancy, where many attention heads fixate on system\nprompt tokens, disrupting the integration of image, instruction, and response\ncontent.

Probing a New Dimension of Political Biases in Large Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into everyday\nlife and information ecosystems, concerns about their implicit biases continue\nto persist. While prior work has primarily examined socio-demographic and\nleft--right political dimensions, little attention has been paid to how LLMs\nalign with broader geopolitical value systems, particularly the\ndemocracy--authoritarianism spectrum. In this paper, we propose a novel\nmethodology to assess such alignment, combining (1) the F-scale, a psychometric\ntool for measuring authoritarian tendencies, (2) FavScore, a newly introduced\nmetric for evaluating model favorability toward world leaders, and (3)\nrole-model probing to assess which figures are cited as general role-models by\nLLMs. We find that LLMs generally favor democratic values and leaders, but\nexhibit increases favorability toward authoritarian figures when prompted in\nMandarin. Further, models are found to often cite authoritarian figures as role\nmodels, even outside explicit political contexts. These results shed light on\nways LLMs may reflect and potentially reinforce global political ideologies,\nhighlighting the importance of evaluating bias beyond conventional\nsocio-political axes.

Generally, existing\nsemantic segmentation models of coal maceral groups use the method of stacking\nparameters to achieve higher accuracy. It leads to increased computational\nrequirements and impacts model training efficiency. At the same time, due to\nthe professionalism and diversity of coal maceral group images sampling,\nobtaining the number of samples for model training requires a long time and\nprofessional personnel operation. To address these issues, We have innovatively\ndeveloped an IoT-based DA-VIT parallel network model. By utilizing this model,\nwe can continuously broaden the dataset through IoT and achieving sustained\nimprovement in the accuracy of coal maceral groups segmentation. Besides, we\ndecouple the parallel network from the backbone network to ensure the normal\nusing of the backbone network during model data updates. Secondly, DCSA\nmechanism of DA-VIT is introduced to enhance the local feature information of\ncoal microscopic images.

However, their high computational cost and\nlow execution frequency hinder their suitability for real-time tasks such as\nrobotic manipulation and autonomous navigation. Existing VLA acceleration\nmethods primarily focus on structural optimization, overlooking the fact that\nthese models operate in sequential decision-making environments. As a result,\ntemporal redundancy in sequential action generation and spatial redundancy in\nvisual input remain unaddressed. To this end, we propose SP-VLA, a unified\nframework that accelerates VLA models by jointly scheduling models and pruning\ntokens. Specifically, we design an action-aware model scheduling mechanism that\nreduces temporal redundancy by dynamically switching between VLA model and a\nlightweight generator. Inspired by the human motion pattern of focusing on key\ndecision points while relying on intuition for other actions, we categorize VLA\nactions into deliberative and intuitive, assigning the former to the VLA model\nand the latter to the lightweight generator, enabling frequency-adaptive\nexecution through collaborative model scheduling. To address spatial\nredundancy, we further develop a spatio-semantic dual-aware token pruning\nmethod. Tokens are classified into spatial and semantic types and pruned based\non their dual-aware importance to accelerate VLA inference.

These\nsignals are combined through a learnable or rule-based scheduler to generate\nsoft modality weights used in downstream fusion.To ensure stable training, we\nfurther introduce a \\textit{Modality Weight Consistency Loss}, which\nregularizes the fused representation to stay close to unimodal embeddings\nproportionally to their assigned weights. Our method is model-agnostic and can\nbe integrated into existing MLLMs such as BLIP-2 and LLaVA.

Currently, the common approach in 3DGS is to utilize\n\"single-view\" mini-batch training, where only one image is processed per\niteration, in contrast to NeRF's \"multi-view\" mini-batch training, which\nleverages multiple images. We observe that such single-view training can lead\nto suboptimal optimization due to increased variance in mini-batch stochastic\ngradients, highlighting the necessity for multi-view training. However,\nimplementing multi-view training in 3DGS poses challenges.

Some previous methods inspired by dropout, which enhances\ngeneralization by regularizing features, have shown promising results in blind\nSR. Nevertheless, these methods focus solely on regularizing features before\nthe final layer and overlook the need for generalization in features at\nintermediate layers. Without explicit regularization of features at\nintermediate layers, the blind SR network struggles to obtain well-generalized\nfeature representations. However, the key challenge is that directly applying\ndropout to intermediate layers leads to a significant performance drop, which\nwe attribute to the inconsistency in training-testing and across layers it\nintroduced. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Dropout, a new regularization method\nfor blind SR models, which mitigates the inconsistency and facilitates\napplication across intermediate layers of networks. Specifically, for\ntraining-testing inconsistency, we re-design the form of dropout and integrate\nthe features before and after dropout adaptively. For inconsistency in\ngeneralization requirements across different layers, we innovatively design an\nadaptive training strategy to strengthen feature propagation by layer-wise\nannealing. Experimental results show that our method outperforms all past\nregularization methods on both synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets,\nalso highly effective in other image restoration tasks.

The results\nshow that Native Resolution Visual Encoding significantly improves the\nperformance of VLMs on RC-Bench as well as other resolution-centric benchmarks.\nCode is available at https://github.com/Niujunbo2002/NativeRes-LLaVA.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faRC-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u548cNativeRes-LLaVA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3VLMs\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u5bbd\u9ad8\u6bd4\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VLMs\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165RC-Bench\u8bc4\u4f30\u6781\u7aef\u89c6\u89c9\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684VLM\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faNativeRes-LLaVA\u6846\u67b6\u652f\u6301\u539f\u751f\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u539f\u751f\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347VLMs\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "RC-Bench\u548cNativeRes-LLaVA\u4e3aVLM\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Traditional approaches, which rely on empirical formulas or\nphysical simulations, often suffer from limited accuracy or require strong\nscene priors. Recent neural radiance field (NeRF-based) methods improve\nreconstruction fidelity through differentiable volumetric rendering, but their\nreliance on computationally expensive multilayer perceptron (MLP) queries\nhinders real-time deployment. To overcome these challenges, we introduce\nGaussian splatting (GS) to the wireless domain, leveraging its efficiency in\nmodeling optical radiance fields to enable compact and accurate WRF\nreconstruction. Specifically, we propose SwiftWRF, a deformable 2D Gaussian\nsplatting framework that synthesizes WRF spectra at arbitrary positions under\nsingle-sided transceiver mobility. SwiftWRF employs CUDA-accelerated\nrasterization to render spectra at over 100000 fps and uses a lightweight MLP\nto model the deformation of 2D Gaussians, effectively capturing\nmobility-induced WRF variations. In addition to novel spectrum synthesis, the\nefficacy of SwiftWRF is further underscored in its applications in\nangle-of-arrival (AoA) and received signal strength indicator (RSSI)\nprediction.

While these models have attained high accuracy\nby leveraging additional computation at test time, they need to generate long\nchain-of-thought reasoning in order to think before answering, which requires\ngenerating thousands of tokens. While sparse attention methods can help reduce\nthe KV cache pressure induced by this long autoregressive reasoning, these\nmethods can introduce errors which disrupt the reasoning process.

While ICL has been highly\nsuccessful for prediction and generation tasks, leveraging it for agentic tasks\nthat require sequential decision making is challenging -- one must think not\nonly about how to annotate long trajectories at scale and how to select\ndemonstrations, but also what constitutes demonstrations, and when and where to\nshow them. To address this, we first propose an algorithm that leverages an LLM\nwith retries along with demonstrations to automatically and efficiently\nannotate agentic tasks with solution trajectories. We then show that\nset-selection of trajectories of similar tasks as demonstrations significantly\nimproves performance, reliability, robustness, and efficiency of LLM agents.\nHowever, trajectory demonstrations have a large inference cost overhead.

Traditional methods predominantly rely on\nflow-based propagation and spatio-temporal Transformers, but these approaches\nface limitations in effectively leveraging long-term temporal features and\nensuring temporal consistency in the completion results, particularly when\ndealing with large masks. Consequently, performance on extensive masked areas\nremains suboptimal. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel\nvideo inpainting approach leveraging the Diffusion Transformer (DiT). DiT\nsynergistically combines the advantages of diffusion models and transformer\narchitectures to maintain long-term temporal consistency while ensuring\nhigh-quality inpainting results. We propose a Circular Position-Shift strategy\nto further enhance long-term temporal consistency during the inference stage.\nAdditionally, the proposed method automatically detects objects within videos,\ninteractively removes specified objects, and generates corresponding prompts.\nIn terms of processing speed, it takes only 180 seconds (testing on one NVIDIA\nA100 GPU) to complete a video with a resolution of $1080 \\times 1920$ with 121\nframes without any acceleration method.

In this way, IGD moves beyond pure likelihood\nmaximization, effectively prioritizing high-decisiveness tokens.

Automated tabular numerical cross-checking presents two\nsignificant challenges: (C1) managing the combinatorial explosion of candidate\ninstances at the document level and (C2) comprehending multi-faceted numerical\nsemantics. Previous research typically depends on heuristic-based filtering or\nsimplified context extraction, often struggling to balance performance and\nefficiency. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable\ncontextual understanding capabilities that helps address C2 at the instance\nlevel, yet they remain hampered by computational inefficiency (C1) and limited\ndomain expertise. This paper introduces CoFiTCheck, a novel LLM-based\ncoarse-to-fine framework that addresses these challenges through two sequential\nstages: embedding-based filtering and discriminative classification. The\nembedding-based filtering stage introduces an instructional parallel encoding\nmethod to efficiently represent all numerical mentions in a table with LLMs, as\nwell as a decoupled InfoNCE objective to mitigate the isolated mention problem.\nThe discriminative classification stage employs a specialized LLM for\nfine-grained analysis of the remaining candidate pairs. This stage is further\nenhanced by our crosstable numerical alignment pretraining paradigm, which\nleverages weak supervision from cross-table numerical equality relationships to\nenrich task-specific priors without requiring manual annotation. Comprehensive\nevaluation across three types of real-world disclosure documents demonstrates\nthat CoFiTCheck significantly outperforms previous methods while maintaining\npractical efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "CoFiTCheck\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5d4c\u5165\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548c\u5224\u522b\u5206\u7c7b\u89e3\u51b3\u8868\u683c\u6570\u503c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u786e\u4fdd\u62ab\u9732\u6587\u6863\u4e2d\u8868\u683c\u6570\u503c\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u68c0\u67e5\u9762\u4e34\u7ec4\u5408\u7206\u70b8\u548c\u591a\u7ef4\u6570\u503c\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "CoFiTCheck\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5d4c\u5165\u8fc7\u6ee4\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u5e76\u884c\u7f16\u7801\u548cInfoNCE\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5224\u522b\u5206\u7c7b\u9636\u6bb5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8de8\u8868\u6570\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u771f\u5b9e\u62ab\u9732\u6587\u6863\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cCoFiTCheck\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "CoFiTCheck\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6570\u503c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, their unique architecture-characterized by sparse expert\nactivation and dynamic routing mechanisms-introduces inherent complexities that\nchallenge conventional quantization techniques. Existing post-training\nquantization (PTQ) methods struggle to address activation outliers, router\nconsistency and sparse expert calibration, leading to significant performance\ndegradation. To bridge this gap, we propose EAQuant, a novel PTQ framework\ntailored for MoE architectures.

Extensive experiments across W4A4 and extreme W3A4\nquantization configurations demonstrate that EAQuant significantly outperforms\nexisting methods, achieving average score improvements of 1.15 - 2.28% across\nthree diverse MoE architectures, with particularly pronounced gains in\nreasoning tasks and robust performance retention under aggressive quantization.\nBy integrating these innovations, EAQuant establishes a new state-of-the-art\nfor high-precision, efficient MoE model compression.

However, perceptual\nerrors -- especially overlooked but visible abnormalities -- remain common and\nclinically significant. Current workflows and AI systems provide limited\nsupport for detecting such errors after interpretation and often lack\nmeaningful human--AI collaboration. We introduce RADAR (Radiologist--AI\nDiagnostic Assistance and Review), a post-interpretation companion system.\nRADAR ingests finalized radiologist annotations and CXR images, then performs\nregional-level analysis to detect and refer potentially missed abnormal\nregions. The system supports a \"second-look\" workflow and offers suggested\nregions of interest (ROIs) rather than fixed labels to accommodate\ninter-observer variation. We evaluated RADAR on a simulated perceptual-error\ndataset derived from de-identified CXR cases, using F1 score and Intersection\nover Union (IoU) as primary metrics. RADAR achieved a recall of 0.78, precision\nof 0.44, and an F1 score of 0.56 in detecting missed abnormalities in the\nsimulated perceptual-error dataset. Although precision is moderate, this\nreduces over-reliance on AI by encouraging radiologist oversight in human--AI\ncollaboration. The median IoU was 0.78, with more than 90% of referrals\nexceeding 0.5 IoU, indicating accurate regional localization.

It extends conventional Video Crowd\nCounting (VCC) beyond the per-frame pedestrian count. In contrast to VCC that\nonly learns to count repeated pedestrian patterns across frames, the key\nproblem of VIC is how to identify co-existent pedestrians between frames, which\nturns out to be a correspondence problem. Existing VIC approaches, however,\nmainly follow a one-to-one (O2O) matching strategy where the same pedestrian\nmust be exactly matched between frames, leading to sensitivity to appearance\nvariations or missing detections. In this work, we show that the O2O matching\ncould be relaxed to a one-to-many (O2M) matching problem, which better fits the\nproblem nature of VIC and can leverage the social grouping behavior of walking\npedestrians. We therefore introduce OMAN, a simple but effective VIC model with\nimplicit One-to-Many mAtchiNg, featuring an implicit context generator and a\none-to-many pairwise matcher.

Additionally, brain damage, such as from a stroke, may lead to\nsystematic speech errors with specific characteristics dependent on the\nlocation of the brain damage. Cognitive sciences suggest a model with various\ncomponents for the different processing stages involved in word repetition.\nWhile some studies have begun to localize the corresponding regions in the\nbrain, the neural mechanisms and how exactly the brain performs word repetition\nremain largely unknown.

In this paper, we propose Pro-AD to address these\nissues and fully utilize the prototypes to boost the performance of anomaly\ndetection.

Additionally, to prevent the anomalies from being well\nreconstructed using sufficient semantic information through the attention\nmechanism, Pro-AD introduces a Prototype-based Constraint that applied within\nthe target feature reconstruction process of the decoder, which further\nimproves the performance of our approach.

To\nachieve high-quality long-horizon driving video generation, we introduce\nHierarchical Temporal Feature Transfer (HTFT) and a novel multi-stage training\nstrategy. HTFT enhances temporal consistency between video frames throughout\nthe video generation process by modeling the temporal and denoising process\nseparately and transferring denoising features between frames. The multi-stage\ntraining strategy is to divide the training into three stages, through model\ndecoupling and auto-regressive inference process simulation, thereby\naccelerating model convergence and reducing error accumulation. Experiments on\nthe Nuscenes dataset show that STAGE has significantly surpassed existing\nmethods in the long-horizon driving video generation task. In addition, we also\nexplored STAGE's ability to generate unlimited-length driving videos. We\ngenerated 600 frames of high-quality driving videos on the Nuscenes dataset,\nwhich far exceeds the maximum length achievable by existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "STAGE\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u534f\u8c03\u548c\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u65f6\u9a7e\u9a76\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u65f6\u7a7a\u52a8\u6001\u89e3\u8026\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u8de8\u5e27\u7279\u5f81\u4f20\u64ad\u673a\u5236\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u9519\u4f4d\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u957f\u65f6\u9a7e\u9a76\u89c6\u9891\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u5c42\u65f6\u5e8f\u7279\u5f81\u4f20\u9012\uff08HTFT\uff09\u548c\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u5e8f\u548c\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5e27\u95f4\u4f20\u9012\u53bb\u566a\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728Nuscenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cSTAGE\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e86600\u5e27\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u9a7e\u9a76\u89c6\u9891\u3002", "conclusion": "STAGE\u901a\u8fc7HTFT\u548c\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u957f\u65f6\u9a7e\u9a76\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u65e0\u9650\u957f\u5ea6\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Most existing learning-based PCR methods rely on Transformers,\nwhich suffer from quadratic computational complexity.

In contrast, Mamba-a recently proposed model based on state\nspace models (SSMs)-achieves linear computational complexity while maintaining\nstrong long-range contextual modeling capabilities. However, directly applying\nMamba to PCR tasks yields suboptimal performance due to the unordered and\nirregular nature of point cloud data.

Specifically, we serialize point cloud features using\nZ-order space-filling curves to enforce spatial locality, enabling Mamba to\nbetter model the geometric structure of the input. Additionally, we remove the\norder indicator module commonly used in Mamba-based sequence modeling, leads to\nimproved performance in our setting.

To address these issues, we propose DVP-MVS++,\nan innovative approach that synergizes both depth-normal-edge aligned and\nharmonized cross-view priors for robust and visibility-aware patch deformation.\nSpecifically, to avoid edge-skipping, we first apply DepthPro, Metric3Dv2 and\nRoberts operator to generate coarse depth maps, normal maps and edge maps,\nrespectively. These maps are then aligned via an erosion-dilation strategy to\nproduce fine-grained homogeneous boundaries for facilitating robust patch\ndeformation. Moreover, we reformulate view selection weights as visibility\nmaps, and then implement both an enhanced cross-view depth reprojection and an\narea-maximization strategy to help reliably restore visible areas and\neffectively balance deformed patch, thus acquiring harmonized cross-view priors\nfor visibility-aware patch deformation. Additionally, we obtain geometry\nconsistency by adopting both aggregated normals via view selection and\nprojection depth differences via epipolar lines, and then employ SHIQ for\nhighlight correction to enable geometry consistency with highlight-aware\nperception, thus improving reconstruction quality during propagation and\nrefinement stage.

MiniMax-M1 is powered by a hybrid\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture combined with a lightning attention\nmechanism. The model is developed based on our previous MiniMax-Text-01 model,\nwhich contains a total of 456 billion parameters with 45.9 billion parameters\nactivated per token. The M1 model natively supports a context length of 1\nmillion tokens, 8x the context size of DeepSeek R1. Furthermore, the lightning\nattention mechanism in MiniMax-M1 enables efficient scaling of test-time\ncompute. These properties make M1 particularly suitable for complex tasks that\nrequire processing long inputs and thinking extensively. MiniMax-M1 is trained\nusing large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) on diverse problems including\nsandbox-based, real-world software engineering environments. In addition to\nM1's inherent efficiency advantage for RL training, we propose CISPO, a novel\nRL algorithm to further enhance RL efficiency. CISPO clips importance sampling\nweights rather than token updates, outperforming other competitive RL variants.\nCombining hybrid-attention and CISPO enables MiniMax-M1's full RL training on\n512 H800 GPUs to complete in only three weeks, with a rental cost of just\n$534,700. We release two versions of MiniMax-M1 models with 40K and 80K\nthinking budgets respectively, where the 40K model represents an intermediate\nphase of the 80K training. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our\nmodels are comparable or superior to strong open-weight models such as the\noriginal DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3-235B, with particular strengths in complex\nsoftware engineering, tool utilization, and long-context tasks.

However, existing methods\nstruggle with consistently achieving sub-millimeter accuracy, robustness under\nbroad initial pose estimates or need manual key-point annotations. This work\naims to address these challenges by proposing a novel multi-view X-ray/CT\nregistration method for intraoperative bone registration. Methods: The proposed\nregistration method consists of a multi-view, contour-based iterative closest\npoint (ICP) optimization. Unlike previous methods, which attempt to match bone\ncontours across the entire silhouette in both imaging modalities, we focus on\nmatching specific subcategories of contours corresponding to bone\nsubstructures. This leads to reduced ambiguity in the ICP matches, resulting in\na more robust and accurate registration solution. This approach requires only\ntwo X-ray images and operates fully automatically. Additionally, we contribute\na dataset of 5 cadaveric specimens, including real X-ray images, X-ray image\nposes and the corresponding CT scans. Results: The proposed registration method\nis evaluated on real X-ray images using mean reprojection error (mRPD). The\nmethod consistently achieves sub-millimeter accuracy with a mRPD 0.67mm\ncompared to 5.35mm by a commercial solution requiring manual intervention.\nFurthermore, the method offers improved practical applicability, being fully\nautomatic. Conclusion: Our method offers a practical, accurate, and efficient\nsolution for multi-view X-ray/CT registration in orthopedic surgeries, which\ncan be easily combined with tracking systems.

Recently, Nguyen et al.\n2024's \"Turning Up the Heat: Min-p Sampling for Creative and Coherent LLM\nOutputs\" introduced a new sampler called min-p, claiming it achieves superior\nquality and diversity over established samplers such as basic, top-k, and top-p\nsampling.

This paper conducts a comprehensive re-examination of\nthe evidence supporting min-p and reaches different conclusions from the\noriginal paper's four lines of evidence. First, the original paper's human\nevaluations omitted data, conducted statistical tests incorrectly, and\ndescribed qualitative feedback inaccurately; our reanalysis demonstrates min-p\ndid not outperform baselines in quality, diversity, or a trade-off between\nquality and diversity; in response to our findings, the authors of the original\npaper conducted a new human evaluation using a different implementation, task,\nand rubric that nevertheless provides further evidence min-p does not improve\nover baselines. Second, comprehensively sweeping the original paper's NLP\nbenchmarks reveals min-p does not surpass baselines when controlling for the\nnumber of hyperparameters.

Traditional identification methods, such as ampelography and\nmolecular analysis, have limitations: ampelography depends on expert knowledge\nand is inherently subjective, while molecular methods are costly and\ntime-intensive. To address these limitations, recent studies have applied deep\nlearning (DL) models to classify grapevine varieties using image data. However,\ndue to the small dataset sizes, these methods often depend on transfer learning\nfrom datasets from other domains, e.g., ImageNet1K (IN1K), which can lead to\nperformance degradation due to domain shift and supervision collapse. In this\ncontext, self-supervised learning (SSL) methods can be a good tool to avoid\nthis performance degradation, since they can learn directly from data, without\nexternal labels. This study presents an evaluation of Masked Autoencoders\n(MAEs) for identifying grapevine varieties based on field-acquired images. The\nmain contributions of this study include two benchmarks comprising 43 grapevine\nvarieties collected across different seasons, an analysis of MAE's application\nin the agricultural context, and a performance comparison of trained models\nacross seasons.

First, we apply blind unmixing to extract endmembers\nand abundance maps directly from raw hyperspectral data. These abundance maps\nthen serve as inputs to a diffusion model, which acts as a generative engine to\nsynthesize highly realistic spatial distributions.

Traditionally, we rely on computer tools (e.g.,\nMatplotlib and GeoGebra) to manually generate precise diagrams, but it usually\nrequires huge, complicated calculations cost. Recently, researchers start to\nwork on learning-based methods (e.g., Stable Diffusion and GPT4) to\nautomatically generate diagrams, saving operational cost but usually suffering\nfrom limited realism and insufficient accuracy. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel framework GeoSDF to automatically generate diagrams efficiently and\naccurately with Signed Distance Field (SDF). Specifically, we first represent\ngeometric elements in the SDF, then construct a series of constraint functions\nto represent geometric relationships, next we optimize such constraint\nfunctions to get an optimized field of both elements and constraints, finally\nby rendering the optimized field, we can obtain the synthesized diagram. In our\nGeoSDF, we define a symbolic language to easily represent geometric elements\nand those constraints, and our synthesized geometry diagrams can be\nself-verified in the SDF, ensuring both mathematical accuracy and visual\nplausibility. In experiments, our GeoSDF synthesized both normal high-school\nlevel and IMO-level geometry diagrams. Through both qualitative and\nquantitative analysis, we can see that synthesized diagrams are realistic and\naccurate, and our synthesizing process is simple and efficient. Furthermore, we\nobtain a very high accuracy of solving geometry problems (over 95\\% while the\ncurrent SOTA accuracy is around 75%) by leveraging our self-verification\nproperty.

This work aims to develop a clinically\nfeasible method for reconstructing high-quality CBCT volumes from consecutive\nlimited-angle acquisitions, addressing imaging challenges in time- or\ndose-constrained settings. We propose a limited-angle (LA) geometry-integrated\ncycle-domain (LA-GICD) framework for CBCT reconstruction, comprising two\ndenoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) connected via analytic\ncone-beam forward and back projectors. A Projection-DDPM completes missing\nprojections, followed by back-projection, and an Image-DDPM refines the volume.\nThis dual-domain design leverages complementary priors from projection and\nimage spaces to achieve high-quality reconstructions from limited-angle (<= 90\ndegrees) scans. Performance was evaluated against full-angle reconstruction.\nFour board-certified medical physicists conducted assessments.

To this end, we introduce relational modeling into both\nperception and reasoning, \\textit{jointly} enhancing structural understanding.\nSpecifically, we propose: 1) a relation-aware lane detector, where our\ngeometry-biased self-attention and \\curve\\ cross-attention refine lane\nrepresentations by capturing relational dependencies; 2) relation-enhanced\ntopology heads, including a geometry-enhanced L2L head and a cross-view L2T\nhead, boosting reasoning with relational cues; and 3) a contrastive learning\nstrategy with InfoNCE loss to regularize relationship embeddings.

To address this,\nseveral simulation tools have been developed to generate synthetic event data.\nAmong these, the CARLA driving simulator includes a built-in dynamic vision\nsensor (DVS) module that emulates event camera output. Despite its potential,\nthe sim-to-real gap for event-based object detection remains insufficiently\nstudied. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of this gap by\ntraining a recurrent vision transformer model exclusively on synthetic data\ngenerated using CARLAs DVS and testing it on varying combinations of synthetic\nand real-world event streams. Our experiments show that models trained solely\non synthetic data perform well on synthetic-heavy test sets but suffer\nsignificant performance degradation as the proportion of real-world data\nincreases.
