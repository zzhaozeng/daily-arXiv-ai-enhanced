Although\nits creative capabilities have been widely explored, its potential to represent\nartwork in latent spaces remains underexamined. We use cutting-edge generative\nAI, specifically Stable Diffusion, to analyze 500 years of Western paintings by\nextracting two types of latent information with the model: formal aspects\n(e.g., colors) and contextual aspects (e.g., subject). Our findings reveal that\ncontextual information differentiates between artistic periods, styles, and\nindividual artists more successfully than formal elements. Additionally, using\ncontextual keywords extracted from paintings, we show how artistic expression\nevolves alongside societal changes.

Unlike\ntypographic attacks, these artifacts are not predefined, making them harder to\ndefend against but also more challenging to find. We address this by framing\nartifact attacks as a search problem and demonstrate their effectiveness across\nfive datasets, with some artifacts reinforcing each other to reach 100% attack\nsuccess rates. These attacks transfer across models with up to 90%\neffectiveness, making it possible to attack unseen models. To defend against\nthese attacks, we extend prior work's artifact aware prompting to the graphical\nsetting. We see a moderate reduction of success rates of up to 15% relative to\nstandard prompts, suggesting a promising direction for enhancing model\nrobustness.", "AI": {"task": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f2a\u5f71\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bef\u5bfc\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0e\u65e0\u5173\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u610f\u5916\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5076\u7136\u6a21\u5f0f\u800c\u975e\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u6587\u672c\u548c\u56fe\u5f62\u5143\u7d20\u6765\u8bef\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u653b\u51fb\u89c6\u4e3a\u641c\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u67d0\u4e9b\u4f2a\u5f71\u76f8\u4e92\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86100%\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8fd9\u4e9b\u653b\u51fb\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u7684\u8f6c\u79fb\u6548\u679c\u9ad8\u8fbe90%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u5148\u524d\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u56fe\u5f62\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u9002\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Neural Radiance\nFields (NeRFs) model scenes as continuous volumetric functions and achieve\nremarkable rendering quality. However, NeRFs often struggle in large,\nlow-textured areas, producing cloudy artifacts known as ''floaters'' that\nreduce scene realism, especially in indoor environments with featureless\narchitectural surfaces like walls, ceilings, and floors. To overcome this\nlimitation, prior work has integrated geometric constraints into the NeRF\npipeline, typically leveraging depth information derived from Structure from\nMotion or Multi-View Stereo. Yet, conventional RGB-feature correspondence\nmethods face challenges in accurately estimating depth in textureless regions,\nleading to unreliable constraints. This challenge is further complicated in\n360-degree ''inside-out'' views, where sparse visual overlap between adjacent\nimages further hinders depth estimation.

Code:\n  https://github.com/CAMMA-public/Self-MVA", "summary": "Multi-view person association is a fundamental step towards multi-view\nanalysis of human activities. Although the person re-identification features\nhave been proven effective, they become unreliable in challenging scenes where\npersons share similar appearances. Therefore, cross-view geometric constraints\nare required for a more robust association. However, most existing approaches\nare either fully-supervised using ground-truth identity labels or require\ncalibrated camera parameters that are hard to obtain. In this work, we\ninvestigate the potential of learning from synchronization, and propose a\nself-supervised uncalibrated multi-view person association approach, Self-MVA,\nwithout using any annotations. Specifically, we propose a self-supervised\nlearning framework, consisting of an encoder-decoder model and a\nself-supervised pretext task, cross-view image synchronization, which aims to\ndistinguish whether two images from different views are captured at the same\ntime. The model encodes each person's unified geometric and appearance\nfeatures, and we train it by utilizing synchronization labels for supervision\nafter applying Hungarian matching to bridge the gap between instance-wise and\nimage-wise distances.

To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework,\n\\textbf{C2D-ISR}, for optimizing attention-based image super-resolution models\nfrom both performance and complexity perspectives.

In addition, we generalize the hierarchical encoding\nmechanism with existing attention-based network structures, which can achieve\nimproved spatial feature fusion, cross-scale information aggregation, and more\nimportantly, much faster inference. We have evaluated the C2D-ISR framework\nbased on three efficient attention-based backbones, SwinIR-L, SRFormer-L and\nMambaIRv2-L, and demonstrated significant improvements over the other existing\noptimization framework, HiT, in terms of super-resolution performance (up to\n0.2dB) and computational complexity reduction (up to 11%).

Our analysis shows that state-of-the-art Multi-Modal Large\nLanguage Models (MLLMs) on these benchmarks achieve remarkably high performance\nusing just text or a single frame as input. To address these limitations, we\nintroduce EgoTempo, a dataset specifically designed to evaluate temporal\nunderstanding in the egocentric domain. EgoTempo emphasizes tasks that require\nintegrating information across the entire video, ensuring that models would\nneed to rely on temporal patterns rather than static cues or pre-existing\nknowledge. Extensive experiments on EgoTempo show that current MLLMs still fall\nshort in temporal reasoning on egocentric videos, and thus we hope EgoTempo\nwill catalyze new research in the field and inspire models that better capture\nthe complexity of temporal dynamics.

These associations\ndegrade model accuracy by causing predictions to rely on incidental patterns\nrather than genuine visual understanding. Prior work has weaponized these\ncorrelations as an attack vector to manipulate model predictions, such as\ninserting a deceiving class text onto the image in a typographic attack. These\nattacks succeed due to VLMs' text-heavy bias-a result of captions that echo\nvisible words rather than describing content. However, this attack has focused\nsolely on text that matches the target class exactly, overlooking a broader\nrange of correlations, including non-matching text and graphical symbols, which\narise from the abundance of branding content in web-scale data. To address this\ngap, we introduce artifact-based attacks: a novel class of manipulations that\nmislead models using both non-matching text and graphical elements. Unlike\ntypographic attacks, these artifacts are not predefined, making them harder to\ndefend against but also more challenging to find. We address this by framing\nartifact attacks as a search problem and demonstrate their effectiveness across\nfive datasets, with some artifacts reinforcing each other to reach 100% attack\nsuccess rates. These attacks transfer across models with up to 90%\neffectiveness, making it possible to attack unseen models. To defend against\nthese attacks, we extend prior work's artifact aware prompting to the graphical\nsetting.

Neural Radiance\nFields (NeRFs) model scenes as continuous volumetric functions and achieve\nremarkable rendering quality. However, NeRFs often struggle in large,\nlow-textured areas, producing cloudy artifacts known as ''floaters'' that\nreduce scene realism, especially in indoor environments with featureless\narchitectural surfaces like walls, ceilings, and floors. To overcome this\nlimitation, prior work has integrated geometric constraints into the NeRF\npipeline, typically leveraging depth information derived from Structure from\nMotion or Multi-View Stereo. Yet, conventional RGB-feature correspondence\nmethods face challenges in accurately estimating depth in textureless regions,\nleading to unreliable constraints. This challenge is further complicated in\n360-degree ''inside-out'' views, where sparse visual overlap between adjacent\nimages further hinders depth estimation. In order to address these issues, we\npropose an efficient and robust method for computing dense depth priors,\nspecifically tailored for large low-textured architectural surfaces in indoor\nenvironments.

Code:\n  https://github.com/CAMMA-public/Self-MVA", "summary": "Multi-view person association is a fundamental step towards multi-view\nanalysis of human activities. Although the person re-identification features\nhave been proven effective, they become unreliable in challenging scenes where\npersons share similar appearances. Therefore, cross-view geometric constraints\nare required for a more robust association. However, most existing approaches\nare either fully-supervised using ground-truth identity labels or require\ncalibrated camera parameters that are hard to obtain. In this work, we\ninvestigate the potential of learning from synchronization, and propose a\nself-supervised uncalibrated multi-view person association approach, Self-MVA,\nwithout using any annotations. Specifically, we propose a self-supervised\nlearning framework, consisting of an encoder-decoder model and a\nself-supervised pretext task, cross-view image synchronization, which aims to\ndistinguish whether two images from different views are captured at the same\ntime. The model encodes each person's unified geometric and appearance\nfeatures, and we train it by utilizing synchronization labels for supervision\nafter applying Hungarian matching to bridge the gap between instance-wise and\nimage-wise distances.

These associations\ndegrade model accuracy by causing predictions to rely on incidental patterns\nrather than genuine visual understanding. Prior work has weaponized these\ncorrelations as an attack vector to manipulate model predictions, such as\ninserting a deceiving class text onto the image in a typographic attack. These\nattacks succeed due to VLMs' text-heavy bias-a result of captions that echo\nvisible words rather than describing content. However, this attack has focused\nsolely on text that matches the target class exactly, overlooking a broader\nrange of correlations, including non-matching text and graphical symbols, which\narise from the abundance of branding content in web-scale data. To address this\ngap, we introduce artifact-based attacks: a novel class of manipulations that\nmislead models using both non-matching text and graphical elements. Unlike\ntypographic attacks, these artifacts are not predefined, making them harder to\ndefend against but also more challenging to find. We address this by framing\nartifact attacks as a search problem and demonstrate their effectiveness across\nfive datasets, with some artifacts reinforcing each other to reach 100% attack\nsuccess rates. These attacks transfer across models with up to 90%\neffectiveness, making it possible to attack unseen models. To defend against\nthese attacks, we extend prior work's artifact aware prompting to the graphical\nsetting. We see a moderate reduction of success rates of up to 15% relative to\nstandard prompts, suggesting a promising direction for enhancing model\nrobustness.", "AI": {"task": "\u7814\u7a76\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u610f\u5916\u5173\u8054\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u2014\u2014\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f2a\u5f71\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u8f7b\u5ea6\u7b56\u5212\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u8bed\u4e49\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0e\u65e0\u5173\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u610f\u5916\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5173\u8054\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f2a\u5f71\u7684\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u6587\u672c\u548c\u56fe\u5f62\u5143\u7d20\u8bef\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u89c6\u4e3a\u641c\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f2a\u5f71\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u67d0\u4e9b\u4f2a\u5f71\u76f8\u4e92\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u53ef\u8fbe100%\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u653b\u51fb\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u7684\u8f6c\u79fb\u6548\u679c\u9ad8\u8fbe90%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u5148\u524d\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u793a\u5230\u56fe\u5f62\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u9002\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Neural Radiance\nFields (NeRFs) model scenes as continuous volumetric functions and achieve\nremarkable rendering quality. However, NeRFs often struggle in large,\nlow-textured areas, producing cloudy artifacts known as ''floaters'' that\nreduce scene realism, especially in indoor environments with featureless\narchitectural surfaces like walls, ceilings, and floors. To overcome this\nlimitation, prior work has integrated geometric constraints into the NeRF\npipeline, typically leveraging depth information derived from Structure from\nMotion or Multi-View Stereo. Yet, conventional RGB-feature correspondence\nmethods face challenges in accurately estimating depth in textureless regions,\nleading to unreliable constraints. This challenge is further complicated in\n360-degree ''inside-out'' views, where sparse visual overlap between adjacent\nimages further hinders depth estimation. In order to address these issues, we\npropose an efficient and robust method for computing dense depth priors,\nspecifically tailored for large low-textured architectural surfaces in indoor\nenvironments.

Code:\n  https://github.com/CAMMA-public/Self-MVA", "summary": "Multi-view person association is a fundamental step towards multi-view\nanalysis of human activities. Although the person re-identification features\nhave been proven effective, they become unreliable in challenging scenes where\npersons share similar appearances. Therefore, cross-view geometric constraints\nare required for a more robust association. However, most existing approaches\nare either fully-supervised using ground-truth identity labels or require\ncalibrated camera parameters that are hard to obtain. In this work, we\ninvestigate the potential of learning from synchronization, and propose a\nself-supervised uncalibrated multi-view person association approach, Self-MVA,\nwithout using any annotations. Specifically, we propose a self-supervised\nlearning framework, consisting of an encoder-decoder model and a\nself-supervised pretext task, cross-view image synchronization, which aims to\ndistinguish whether two images from different views are captured at the same\ntime. The model encodes each person's unified geometric and appearance\nfeatures, and we train it by utilizing synchronization labels for supervision\nafter applying Hungarian matching to bridge the gap between instance-wise and\nimage-wise distances. To further reduce the solution space, we propose two\ntypes of self-supervised linear constraints: multi-view re-projection and\npairwise edge association. Extensive experiments on three challenging public\nbenchmark datasets (WILDTRACK, MVOR, and SOLDIERS) show that our approach\nachieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing existing unsupervised and\nfully-supervised approaches.

To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework,\n\\textbf{C2D-ISR}, for optimizing attention-based image super-resolution models\nfrom both performance and complexity perspectives. Our approach is based on a\ntwo-stage training methodology and a hierarchical encoding mechanism. The new\ntraining methodology involves continuous-scale training for discrete scale\nmodels, enabling the learning of inter-scale correlations and multi-scale\nfeature representation. In addition, we generalize the hierarchical encoding\nmechanism with existing attention-based network structures, which can achieve\nimproved spatial feature fusion, cross-scale information aggregation, and more\nimportantly, much faster inference.

Existing medical image segmentation methods predominantly\nrely on uni-modal visual inputs, such as images or videos, requiring\nlabor-intensive manual annotations. Additionally, medical imaging techniques\ncapture multiple intertwined organs within a single scan, further complicating\nsegmentation accuracy. To address these challenges, MedSAM, a large-scale\nmedical segmentation model based on the Segment Anything Model (SAM), was\ndeveloped to enhance segmentation accuracy by integrating image features with\nuser-provided prompts. While MedSAM has demonstrated strong performance across\nvarious medical segmentation tasks, it primarily relies on geometric prompts\n(e.g., points and bounding boxes) and lacks support for text-based prompts,\nwhich could help specify subtle or ambiguous anatomical structures. To overcome\nthese limitations, we propose the Organ-aware Multi-scale Text-guided Medical\nImage Segmentation Model (OMT-SAM) for multi-organ segmentation. Our approach\nintroduces CLIP encoders as a novel image-text prompt encoder, operating with\nthe geometric prompt encoder to provide informative contextual guidance. We\npair descriptive textual prompts with corresponding images, processing them\nthrough pre-trained CLIP encoders and a cross-attention mechanism to generate\nfused image-text embeddings.

While earlier approaches\nleverage generative models like autoencoders and generative adversarial\nnetworks (GANs), they often fall short due to overgeneralization. Recent\nmethods explore various strategies, including memory banks, normalizing flows,\nself-supervised learning, and knowledge distillation, to enhance\ndiscrimination. Among these, knowledge distillation, particularly reverse\ndistillation, has shown promise. Following this paradigm, we propose a novel\nscale-aware contrastive reverse distillation model that addresses two key\nlimitations of existing reverse distillation methods: insufficient feature\ndiscriminability and inability to handle anomaly scale variations.\nSpecifically, we introduce a contrastive student-teacher learning approach to\nderive more discriminative representations by generating and exploring\nout-of-normal distributions.

Inspired by professional animators who mainly\nfocus on sparse keyframes, we propose a novel diffusion framework explicitly\ndesigned around sparse and geometrically meaningful keyframes. Our method\nreduces computation by masking non-keyframes and efficiently interpolating\nmissing frames. We dynamically refine the keyframe mask during inference to\nprioritize informative frames in later diffusion steps. Extensive experiments\nshow that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in\ntext alignment and motion realism, while also effectively maintaining high\nperformance at significantly fewer diffusion steps. We further validate the\nrobustness of our framework by using it as a generative prior and adapting it\nto different downstream tasks.

However, seamless\nhuman-AI interaction demands more than just object-level recognition; it\nrequires understanding both objects and the functions of their detailed parts,\nparticularly in multi-target scenarios. For example, when instructing a robot\nto \\textit{turn on the TV\"}, there could be various ways to accomplish this\ncommand. Recognizing multiple objects capable of turning on the TV, such as the\nTV itself or a remote control (multi-target), provides more flexible options\nand aids in finding the optimized scenario. Furthermore, understanding specific\nparts of these objects, like the TV's button or the remote's button\n(part-level), is important for completing the action. Unfortunately, current\nreasoning segmentation datasets predominantly focus on a single target\nobject-level reasoning, which limits the detailed recognition of an object's\nparts in multi-target contexts. To address this gap, we construct a large-scale\ndataset called Multi-target and Multi-granularity Reasoning (MMR).

Conversely, ViTs are adept at capturing long-range global\nfeatures but face challenges in representing local feature details.\nOff-the-shelf video object detection methods solely rely on CNNs or ViTs to\nconduct feature aggregation, which hampers their capability to simultaneously\nleverage global and local information, thereby resulting in limited detection\nperformance. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-GraphFormer Blender\nNetwork (TGBFormer) for video object detection, with three key technical\nimprovements to fully exploit the advantages of transformers and graph\nconvolutional networks while compensating for their limitations. First, we\ndevelop a spatial-temporal transformer module to aggregate global contextual\ninformation, constituting global representations with long-range feature\ndependencies.

Project page is available at\n  https://renhuan1999.github.io/SpherePose", "summary": "Category-level object pose estimation aims to determine the pose and size of\nnovel objects in specific categories. Existing correspondence-based approaches\ntypically adopt point-based representations to establish the correspondences\nbetween primitive observed points and normalized object coordinates. However,\ndue to the inherent shape-dependence of canonical coordinates, these methods\nsuffer from semantic incoherence across diverse object shapes. To resolve this\nissue, we innovatively leverage the sphere as a shared proxy shape of objects\nto learn shape-independent transformation via spherical representations. Based\non this insight, we introduce a novel architecture called SpherePose, which\nyields precise correspondence prediction through three core designs. Firstly,\nWe endow the point-wise feature extraction with SO(3)-invariance, which\nfacilitates robust mapping between camera coordinate space and object\ncoordinate space regardless of rotation transformation.

Recent DC approaches increasingly focus on\nencoding knowledge into realistic images with soft labeling, for their\nscalability to ImageNet-scale datasets and strong capability of cross-domain\ngeneralization. However, this strong performance comes at a substantial storage\ncost which could significantly exceed the storage cost of the original dataset.\nWe argue that the three key properties to alleviate this performance-storage\ndilemma are informativeness, discriminativeness, and compressibility of the\ncondensed data. Towards this end, this paper proposes a \\textbf{S}oft label\ncompression-centric dataset condensation framework using \\textbf{CO}ding\n\\textbf{R}at\\textbf{E} (SCORE). SCORE formulates dataset condensation as a\nmin-max optimization problem, which aims to balance the three key properties\nfrom an information-theoretic perspective.

Current mainstream collaborative perception methods rely on discretized\nfeature maps to conduct fusion, which however, lacks flexibility in extracting\nand transmitting the informative features and can hardly focus on the\ninformative features during fusion. To address these problems, this paper\nproposes a novel Anchor-Centric paradigm for Collaborative Object detection\n(ACCO). It avoids grid precision issues and allows more flexible and efficient\nanchor-centric communication and fusion. ACCO is composed by three main\ncomponents: (1) Anchor featuring block (AFB) that targets to generate anchor\nproposals and projects prepared anchor queries to image features. (2) Anchor\nconfidence generator (ACG) is designed to minimize communication by selecting\nonly the features in the confident anchors to transmit. (3) A local-global\nfusion module, in which local fusion is anchor alignment-based fusion (LAAF)\nand global fusion is conducted by spatial-aware cross-attention (SACA). LAAF\nand SACA run in multi-layers, so agents conduct anchor-centric fusion\niteratively to adjust the anchor proposals. Comprehensive experiments are\nconducted to evaluate ACCO on OPV2V and Dair-V2X datasets, which demonstrate\nACCO's superiority in reducing the communication volume, and in improving the\nperception range and detection performances.

Our approach achieves\nover 120x compression and increases rendering FPS up to 20\\% compared to the\nbaseline 4DGS, and also superior to frame-wise state-of-the-art 3DGS\ncompression methods, revealing the effectiveness of our Light4GS in terms of\nboth intra- and inter-prediction methods without sacrificing rendering quality.", "AI": {"task": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u76844DGS\u6846\u67b6\uff08Light4GS\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u60013D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\uff083DGS\uff09\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u9ad8\u6548\u8868\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u52a8\u60013DGS\u4e2d\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u5927\u91cf\u57fa\u5143\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u9700\u6c42\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u663e\u8457\u6027\u526a\u679d\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u7a7a\u663e\u8457\u6027\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u71b5\u7ea6\u675f\u7403\u8c10\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6f5c\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc7120\u500d\u7684\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u6e32\u67d3FPS\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8620%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u76843DGS\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Light4GS\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5b58\u50a8\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6e32\u67d3\u901f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

In response, we introduce\nDIFFVSGG, an online VSGG solution that frames this task as an iterative scene\ngraph update problem. Drawing inspiration from Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs)\nwhich generate images via denoising a latent feature embedding, we unify the\ndecoding of object classification, bounding box regression, and graph\ngeneration three tasks using one shared feature embedding. Then, given an\nembedding containing unified features of object pairs, we conduct a step-wise\nDenoising on it within LDMs, so as to deliver a clean embedding which clearly\nindicates the relationships between objects. This embedding then serves as the\ninput to task-specific heads for object classification, scene graph generation,\netc. DIFFVSGG further facilitates continuous temporal reasoning, where\npredictions for subsequent frames leverage results of past frames as the\nconditional inputs of LDMs, to guide the reverse diffusion process for current\nframes.

While state-of-the art methods that relies on\nfeature matching have proven to be accurate for visual localization, its\nrequirements for storage and compute are burdens. Scene coordinate regression\n(SCR) is an alternative approach that remove the barrier for storage by\nlearning to map 2D pixels to 3D scene coordinates. Most popular SCR use\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract 2D descriptor, which we would\nargue that it miss the spatial relationship between pixels. Inspired by the\nsuccess of vision transformer architecture, we present a new SCR architecture,\ncalled A-ScoRe, an Attention-based model which leverage attention on descriptor\nmap level to produce meaningful and high-semantic 2D descriptors. Since the\noperation is performed on descriptor map, our model can work with multiple data\nmodality whether it is a dense or sparse from depth-map, SLAM to\nStructure-from-Motion (SfM).

However, they struggle to perform\nspatio-temporal video grounding. This limitation stems from two major\nchallenges. Firstly, it is difficult to extract accurate spatio-temporal\ninformation of each frame in the video. Secondly, the substantial number of\nvisual tokens makes it challenging to precisely map visual tokens of each frame\nto their corresponding spatial coordinates. To address these issues, we\nintroduce SpaceVLLM, a MLLM endowed with spatio-temporal video grounding\ncapability. Specifically, we adopt a set of interleaved Spatio-Temporal Aware\nQueries to capture temporal perception and dynamic spatial information.\nMoreover, we propose a Query-Guided Space Decoder to establish a corresponding\nconnection between the queries and spatial coordinates. Additionally, due to\nthe lack of spatio-temporal datasets, we construct the Unified Spatio-Temporal\nGrounding (Uni-STG) dataset, comprising 480K instances across three tasks. This\ndataset fully exploits the potential of MLLM to simultaneously facilitate\nlocalization in both temporal and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that SpaceVLLM achieves the state-of-the-art performance across 11\nbenchmarks covering temporal, spatial, spatio-temporal and video understanding\ntasks, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

While automated\nmethods have advanced in recent years, state-of-the-art approaches tend to\nincreasingly complex model designs. In this paper, we propose a conceptually\nsimple yet effective decoupled learning scheme for automated cell counting,\nconsisting of separate counter and localizer networks. In contrast to jointly\nlearning counting and density map estimation, we show that decoupling these\nobjectives surprisingly improves results. The counter operates on intermediate\nfeature maps rather than pixel space to leverage global context and produce\ncount estimates, while also generating coarse density maps. The localizer then\nreconstructs high-resolution density maps that precisely localize individual\ncells, conditional on the original images and coarse density maps from the\ncounter. Besides, to boost counting accuracy, we further introduce a global\nmessage passing module to integrate cross-region patterns. Extensive\nexperiments on four datasets demonstrate that our approach, despite its\nsimplicity, challenges common practice and achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance by significant margins.

Recent progress leverages feature aggregation into discriminative\ndescriptions based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

Remote Sensing Image Object Detection", "summary": "Remote sensing object detection (RSOD) faces formidable challenges in complex\nvisual environments. Aerial and satellite images inherently suffer from\nlimitations such as low spatial resolution, sensor noise, blurred objects,\nlow-light degradation, and partial occlusions. These degradation factors\ncollectively compromise the feature discriminability in detection models,\nresulting in three key issues: (1) reduced contrast that hampers\nforeground-background separation, (2) structural discontinuities in edge\nrepresentations, and (3) ambiguous feature responses caused by variations in\nillumination. These collectively weaken model robustness and deployment\nfeasibility. To address these challenges, we propose LEGNet, a lightweight\nnetwork that incorporates a novel edge-Gaussian aggregation (EGA) module\nspecifically designed for low-quality remote sensing images. Our key innovation\nlies in the synergistic integration of Scharr operator-based edge priors with\nuncertainty-aware Gaussian modeling: (a) The orientation-aware Scharr filters\npreserve high-frequency edge details with rotational invariance; (b) The\nuncertainty-aware Gaussian layers probabilistically refine low-confidence\nfeatures through variance estimation.

In this\nwork, we design a new end-to-end object-aware lifting approach, named\nUnified-Lift that provides accurate 3D segmentation based on the 3D Gaussian\nrepresentation. To start, we augment each Gaussian point with an additional\nGaussian-level feature learned using a contrastive loss to encode instance\ninformation. Importantly, we introduce a learnable object-level codebook to\naccount for individual objects in the scene for an explicit object-level\nunderstanding and associate the encoded object-level features with the\nGaussian-level point features for segmentation predictions. While promising,\nachieving effective codebook learning is non-trivial and a naive solution leads\nto degraded performance. Therefore, we formulate the association learning\nmodule and the noisy label filtering module for effective and robust codebook\nlearning.

The code is\n  available at https://github.com/aipixel/PL-VTONv2", "summary": "Image-based virtual try-on aims to transfer an in-shop clothing image to a\nperson image. Most existing methods adopt a single global deformation to\nperform clothing warping directly, which lacks fine-grained modeling of in-shop\nclothing and leads to distorted clothing appearance. In addition, existing\nmethods usually fail to generate limb details well because they are limited by\nthe used clothing-agnostic person representation without referring to the limb\ntextures of the person image. To address these problems, we propose Limb-aware\nVirtual Try-on Network named PL-VTON, which performs fine-grained clothing\nwarping progressively and generates high-quality try-on results with realistic\nlimb details. Specifically, we present Progressive Clothing Warping (PCW) that\nexplicitly models the location and size of in-shop clothing and utilizes a\ntwo-stage alignment strategy to progressively align the in-shop clothing with\nthe human body. Moreover, a novel gravity-aware loss that considers the fit of\nthe person wearing clothing is adopted to better handle the clothing edges.\nThen, we design Person Parsing Estimator (PPE) with a non-limb target parsing\nmap to semantically divide the person into various regions, which provides\nstructural constraints on the human body and therefore alleviates texture\nbleeding between clothing and body regions. Finally, we introduce Limb-aware\nTexture Fusion (LTF) that focuses on generating realistic details in limb\nregions, where a coarse try-on result is first generated by fusing the warped\nclothing image with the person image, then limb textures are further fused with\nthe coarse result under limb-aware guidance to refine limb details.

The performance of these models is determined by a complex\ninterdependence among the model architecture, optimization/loss function and\ndatasets. Although FRSs have surpassed human-level accuracy, they continue to\nbe disparate against certain demographics. Due to the ubiquity of applications,\nit is extremely important to understand the impact of the three components --\nmodel architecture, loss function and face image dataset on the\naccuracy-disparity trade-off to design better, unbiased platforms. In this\nwork, we perform an in-depth analysis of three FRSs for the task of gender\nprediction, with various architectural modifications resulting in ten\ndeep-learning models coupled with four loss functions and benchmark them on\nseven face datasets across 266 evaluation configurations. Our results show that\nall three components have an individual as well as a combined impact on both\naccuracy and disparity.

In this study, we introduce a novel\nvisual-language alignment method that casts the key issue as a Visual Question\nAnswering with Mask generation (VQAMask) task, optimizing two tasks\nsimultaneously: VQA-based text parsing and mask generation. The former allows\nthe model to implicitly align images and text at the semantic level.

Current standard practices in PCC highlight a primary\nissue: while single-feature metrics are widely used to assess compression\ndistortion, the classic method of searching point-to-point nearest neighbors\nfrequently fails to adequately build precise correspondences between point\nclouds, resulting in an ineffective capture of human perceptual features. To\novercome the related limitations, we propose a novel assessment method called\nRBFIM, utilizing radial basis function (RBF) interpolation to convert discrete\npoint features into a continuous feature function for the distorted point\ncloud. By substituting the geometry coordinates of the original point cloud\ninto the feature function, we obtain the bijective sets of point features.

The compositional characteristic of images captured from a\nstatic viewpoint remains underestimated. We term this characteristic as\nContinuous Space Perception. When observing a scene from a static viewpoint\nwhile shifting orientations, it produces a series of spatially continuous\nimages, enabling the reconstruction of the entire space. In this paper, we\npresent CoSpace, a multi-image visual understanding benchmark designed to\nassess the Continuous Space perception ability for VLMs. CoSpace contains 2,918\nimages and 1,626 question-answer pairs, covering seven types of tasks. We\nconduct evaluation across 19 proprietary and open-source VLMs. Results reveal\nthat there exist pitfalls on the continuous space perception ability for most\nof the evaluated models, including proprietary ones.

However, accurate detection\nof persons from overhead fisheye images remains an open challenge because of\nfactors including person rotation and small-sized persons. To address the\nperson rotation problem, we convert the fisheye images into panoramic images.\nFor smaller people, we focused on the geometry of the panoramas. Conventional\ndetection methods tend to focus on larger people because these larger people\nyield large significant areas for feature maps. In equirectangular panoramic\nimages, we find that a person's height decreases linearly near the top of the\nimages. Using this finding, we leverage the significance values and aggregate\ntokens that are sorted based on these values to balance the significant areas.\nIn this leveraging process, we introduce panoramic distortion-aware\ntokenization. This tokenization procedure divides a panoramic image using\nself-similarity figures that enable determination of optimal divisions without\ngaps, and we leverage the maximum significant values in each tile of token\ngroups to preserve the significant areas of smaller people.

However, current diffusion-based methods\nstruggle with fine-grained style customization due to challenges in controlling\nmultiple style attributes, such as color and texture. This paper introduces the\nfirst tuning-free approach to achieve free-lunch color-texture disentanglement\nin stylized T2I generation, addressing the need for independently controlled\nstyle elements for the Disentangled Stylized Image Generation (DisIG) problem.\nOur approach leverages the Image-Prompt Additivity property in the CLIP image\nembedding space to develop techniques for separating and extracting\nColor-Texture Embeddings (CTE) from individual color and texture reference\nimages. To ensure that the color palette of the generated image aligns closely\nwith the color reference, we apply a whitening and coloring transformation to\nenhance color consistency.

To support\ndiverse tasks and complex instructions, we employ a curriculum learning\nstrategy: first aligning the MLLM and video diffusion model with large-scale\ninstructional image editing data, followed by end-to-end fine-tuning on\nhigh-quality multitask video data. Additionally, we introduce a novel data\nsynthesis pipeline to generate paired instructional video editing data for\nmodel training. It transforms static image data into diverse, high-quality\nvideo editing samples by leveraging Image-to-Video models to inject dynamics.\nVEGGIE shows strong performance in instructional video editing with different\nediting skills, outperforming the best instructional baseline as a versatile\nmodel, while other models struggle with multi-tasking.

Most existing methods adopted deep feature-based\nor score-based guidance for generation models to conduct FAE. Although these\nmethods achieved promising results, they potentially produced excessively\nbeautified results with lower identity consistency or insufficiently improved\nfacial attractiveness. To enhance facial aesthetics with less loss of identity,\nwe propose the Nearest Neighbor Structure Guidance based on Diffusion\n(NNSG-Diffusion), a diffusion-based FAE method that beautifies a 2D facial\nimage with 3D structure guidance. Specifically, we propose to extract FAE\nguidance from a nearest neighbor reference face.

In recent years, large vision models have rapidly developed,\nperforming excellently across various tasks and demonstrating remarkable\ngeneralization capabilities. Some works use large vision models for monocular\ndepth estimation, which have been applied to facilitate multi-view\nreconstruction tasks in an indirect manner. Due to the ambiguity of the\nmonocular depth estimation task, the estimated depth values are usually not\naccurate enough, limiting their utility in aiding multi-view reconstruction.

However, the scene point features in the transformer decoder\nremain fixed, leading to minimal contributions from later decoder layers,\nthereby limiting performance improvement. Recently, State Space Models (SSM)\nhave shown efficient context modeling ability with linear complexity through\niterative interactions between system states and inputs. Inspired by SSMs, we\npropose a new 3D object DEtection paradigm with an interactive STate space\nmodel (DEST). In the interactive SSM, we design a novel state-dependent SSM\nparameterization method that enables system states to effectively serve as\nqueries in 3D indoor detection tasks. In addition, we introduce four key\ndesigns tailored to the characteristics of point cloud and SSM: The\nserialization and bidirectional scanning strategies enable bidirectional\nfeature interaction among scene points within the SSM. The inter-state\nattention mechanism models the relationships between state points, while the\ngated feed-forward network enhances inter-channel correlations. To the best of\nour knowledge, this is the first method to model queries as system states and\nscene points as system inputs, which can simultaneously update scene point\nfeatures and query features with linear complexity.

To address this\nlimitation, we introduce DeepFlow, a novel framework that enhances velocity\nrepresentation through inter layer communication. DeepFlow partitions\ntransformer layers into balanced branches with deep supervision and inserts a\nlightweight Velocity Refiner with Acceleration (VeRA) block between adjacent\nbranches, which aligns the intermediate velocity features within transformer\nblocks. Powered by the improved deep supervision via the internal velocity\nalignment, DeepFlow converges 8 times faster on ImageNet with equivalent\nperformance and further reduces FID by 2.6 while halving training time compared\nto previous flow based models without a classifier free guidance.

To\naddress this limitation, in this work, we explore the integration of generative\nartificial intelligence techniques with physics-based simulators to enhance ADS\nsystem-level testing. Our study evaluates the effectiveness and computational\noverhead of three generative strategies based on diffusion models, namely\ninstruction-editing, inpainting, and inpainting with refinement. Specifically,\nwe assess these techniques' capabilities to produce augmented\nsimulator-generated images of driving scenarios representing new ODDs. We\nemploy a novel automated detector for invalid inputs based on semantic\nsegmentation to ensure semantic preservation and realism of the neural\ngenerated images. We then perform system-level testing to evaluate the ADS's\ngeneralization ability to newly synthesized ODDs.

Several studies in PH have applied machine learning to\nlow-cost diagnostic tools like 12-lead ECG (12L-ECG), but they mainly focus on\nareas with limited resources, overlooking areas with no diagnostic tools, such\nas rural primary healthcare in LMICs. Recent studies have shown the\neffectiveness of 6-lead ECG (6L-ECG), as a cheaper and portable alternative in\ndetecting various cardiac conditions, but its clinical value for PH detection\nis not well proved. Furthermore, existing methods treat 12L-/6L-ECG as a single\nmodality, capturing only shared features while overlooking lead-specific\nfeatures essential for identifying complex cardiac hemodynamic changes.

LS-EMVAE models each\n12L-ECG lead as a separate modality and introduces a hierarchical expert\ncomposition using Mixture and Product of Experts for adaptive latent feature\nfusion between lead-specific and shared features.

Notably, the method was developed to accurately extract the\nreference line by averaging the x-coordinates of the lines detected through the\nHough Transform. This approach enabled the detection of the 0.2 mm thick piano\nwire with high accuracy, even in the presence of noise and other interfering\nfactors (e.g., concrete cracks inside the elevator shaft or safety bars for\nfilming equipment). The experimental results showed that Experiment 4 (FCH),\nwhich utilized Fourier Transform in the preprocessing stage, achieved the\nhighest detection rate for the LtoL, LtoR, and RtoL datasets. Experiment\n2(GSCH), which applied Gaussian blurring and a sharpening filter, demonstrated\nsuperior detection performance on the RtoR dataset. This study proposes a\nreference line detection algorithm that enables precise position calculation\nand control of automated robots in elevator shaft installation. Moreover, the\ndeveloped method shows potential for applicability even in confined working\nspaces.

YOLOv8-pose was\nfine-tuned on 193 annotated periapical radiographs.

We\npropose a heuristic post-processing module that adjusts certain keypoint\npredictions to align with the edge of the related tooth, using a supporting\ninstance segmentation model trained on an open source auxiliary dataset. The\nmodel can sufficiently detect bone loss keypoints, tooth boxes, and alveolar\nridge resorption, but has insufficient performance at detecting detached\nperiodontal ligament and furcation involvement. The model with post-processing\ndemonstrated a PRCK 0.25 of 0.726 and PRCK 0.05 of 0.401 for keypoint\ndetection, mAP 0.5 of 0.715 for tooth object detection, mesial dice score of\n0.593 for periodontal staging, and dice score of 0.280 for furcation\ninvolvement. Our annotation methodology provides a stage agnostic approach to\nperiodontal disease detection, by ensuring most keypoints are present for each\ntooth in the image, allowing small imbalanced datasets.

To address the limitation, we introduce\nMSWAL, the first 3D Multi-class Segmentation of the Whole Abdominal Lesions\ndataset, which broadens the coverage of various common lesion types, such as\ngallstones, kidney stones, liver tumors, kidney tumors, pancreatic cancer,\nliver cysts, and kidney cysts. With CT scans collected from 694 patients\n(191,417 slices) of different genders across various scanning phases, MSWAL\ndemonstrates strong robustness and generalizability. The transfer learning\nexperiment from MSWAL to two public datasets, LiTS and KiTS, effectively\ndemonstrates consistent improvements, with Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC)\nincrease of 3.00% for liver tumors and 0.89% for kidney tumors, demonstrating\nthat the comprehensive annotations and diverse lesion types in MSWAL facilitate\neffective learning across different domains and data distributions.\nFurthermore, we propose Inception nnU-Net, a novel segmentation framework that\neffectively integrates an Inception module with the nnU-Net architecture to\nextract information from different receptive fields, achieving significant\nenhancement in both voxel-level DSC and region-level F1 compared to the\ncutting-edge public algorithms on MSWAL.

Despite the advantages,\naerial data also comes with challenges such as a sensor-modality gap and a\nviewpoint difference gap. Learned localization methods have shown promise for\novercoming these challenges to provide precise metric localization for\nautonomous vehicles. Most learned localization methods rely on coarsely aligned\nground truth, or implicit consistency-based methods to learn the localization\ntask -- however, in this paper we find that improving the alignment between\naerial data and autonomous vehicle sensor data at training time is critical to\nthe performance of a learning-based localization system. We compare two data\nalignment methods using a factor graph framework and, using these methods, we\nthen evaluate the effects of closely aligned ground truth on learned\nlocalization accuracy through ablation studies.

Automatic brain tumor\ndetection from MRI dataset has garnered significant attention in the research\ncommunity, since the inception of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models.\nHowever, the performance of conventional CNN models is hindered due to class\nimbalance problems. The novelties of this work are as follows: (I) A\nlightweight CNN model is proposed in which the number of filters in different\nconvolutional layers is chosen according to the numbers of Fibonacci series.\n(II) In the last two blocks of the proposed model, depth-wise separable\nconvolution (DWSC) layers are employed to considerably reduce the computational\ncomplexity of the model. (III) Two parallel concatenations (or, skip\nconnections) are deployed from 2nd to 4th, and 3rd to 5th convolutional block\nin the proposed Fibonacci-Net. This skip connection encompasses a novel\nAverage-2Max pooling layer that produces two stacks of convoluted output,\nhaving a bit different statistics. Therefore, this parallel concatenation block\nworks as an efficient feature augmenter inside the model, thus, automatically\nalleviating the class imbalance problem to a certain extent. For validity\npurpose, we have implemented the proposed framework on three MRI datasets which\nare highly class-imbalanced. (a) The first dataset has four classes, i.e.,\nglioma tumor, meningioma tumor, pituitary tumor, and no-tumor. (b) Second and\nthird MRI datasets have 15 and 44 classes respectively.

However, the challenge of\nselecting informative features to ensure both performance and efficiency\nremains a significant question in MVML. Existing methods often extract\ninformation separately from the consistency part and the complementary part,\nwhich may result in noise due to unclear segmentation. In this paper, we\npropose a unified model constructed from the perspective of global-view\nreconstruction. Additionally, while feature selection methods can discern the\nimportance of features, they typically overlook the uncertainty of samples,\nwhich is prevalent in realistic scenarios. To address this, we incorporate the\nperception of sample uncertainty during the reconstruction process to enhance\ntrustworthiness. Thus, the global-view is reconstructed through the graph\nstructure between samples, sample confidence, and the view relationship.

This new generation of dynamically configurable and\nprecision-adjustable activation function cores promise greater adaptability for\na range of activation functions in AI workloads, including Swish, SoftMax,\nSeLU, and GeLU, utilizing the Shift-and-Add CORDIC technique. The previously\npresented design has been optimized for MAC, Sigmoid, and Tanh functionalities\nand incorporated into ReLU AFs, culminating in an accumulative NEURIC compute\nunit. These enhancements position NEURIC as a fundamental component in the\nresource-efficient vector engine for the realization of AI accelerators that\nfocus on DNNs, RNNs/LSTMs, and Transformers, achieving a quality of results\n(QoR) of 98.5%.", "AI": {"task": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eCORDIC\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4ee5\u52a0\u901f\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684ASIC\u786c\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u529f\u80fd\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3AI\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Shift-and-Add CORDIC\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u53ef\u8c03\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u6838\u5fc3\u3002", "result": "\u4f18\u5316\u4e86MAC\u3001Sigmoid\u548cTanh\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u6574\u5408\u5230ReLU AFs\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e86NEURIC\u8ba1\u7b97\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8698.5%\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u8d28\u91cf\uff08QoR\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "NEURIC\u6210\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u9ad8\u6548\u5411\u91cf\u5f15\u64ce\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8eDNNs\u3001RNNs/LSTMs\u548cTransformers\u7684AI\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u3002"}}

This typically requires a strong\nmodel design that can capture complex facial reflections as well as intensive\ntraining on a high-quality paired video dataset, such as dynamic\none-light-at-a-time (OLAT). In this work, we introduce Lux Post Facto, a novel\nportrait video relighting method that produces both photorealistic and\ntemporally consistent lighting effects. From the model side, we design a new\nconditional video diffusion model built upon state-of-the-art pre-trained video\ndiffusion model, alongside a new lighting injection mechanism to enable precise\ncontrol. This way we leverage strong spatial and temporal generative capability\nto generate plausible solutions to the ill-posed relighting problem. Our\ntechnique uses a hybrid dataset consisting of static expression OLAT data and\nin-the-wild portrait performance videos to jointly learn relighting and\ntemporal modeling. This avoids the need to acquire paired video data in\ndifferent lighting conditions. Our extensive experiments show that our model\nproduces state-of-the-art results both in terms of photorealism and temporal\nconsistency.", "AI": {"task": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u8096\u50cf\u91cd\u7167\u660e\u65b9\u6cd5Lux Post Facto\uff0c\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u65e2\u903c\u771f\u53c8\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7167\u660e\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u9891\u8096\u50cf\u91cd\u7167\u660e\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u903c\u771f\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u914d\u5bf9\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u7167\u660e\u6ce8\u5165\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u9759\u6001\u8868\u60c5OLAT\u6570\u636e\u548c\u91ce\u5916\u8096\u50cf\u8868\u6f14\u89c6\u9891\uff09\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u91cd\u7167\u660e\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u903c\u771f\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "Lux Post Facto\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u8096\u50cf\u91cd\u7167\u660e\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u83b7\u53d6\u4e0d\u540c\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u914d\u5bf9\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}
