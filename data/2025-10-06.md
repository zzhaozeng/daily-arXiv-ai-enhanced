### [1] [FSFSplatter: Build Surface and Novel Views with Sparse-Views within 3min](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02691)
*Yibin Zhao,Yihan Pan,Jun Nan,Jianjun Yi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FSFSplatter是一种从稀疏自由图像进行快速表面重建的新方法，通过端到端密集高斯初始化、相机参数估计和几何增强的场景优化，解决了传统方法需要密集校准视图的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高斯溅射方法大多需要密集校准视图，而从稀疏自由图像重建往往因重叠有限和过拟合导致表面质量差。

Method: 使用大型Transformer编码多视图图像，通过自分裂高斯头生成密集且几何一致的高斯场景初始化，采用基于贡献的剪枝消除局部漂浮物，并在快速优化期间利用深度和多视图特征监督来缓解过拟合。

Result: FSFSplatter在广泛使用的DTU和Replica数据集上优于当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够从稀疏自由图像实现高质量的表面重建，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has become a leading reconstruction technique, known for
its high-quality novel view synthesis and detailed reconstruction. However,
most existing methods require dense, calibrated views. Reconstructing from free
sparse images often leads to poor surface due to limited overlap and
overfitting. We introduce FSFSplatter, a new approach for fast surface
reconstruction from free sparse images. Our method integrates end-to-end dense
Gaussian initialization, camera parameter estimation, and geometry-enhanced
scene optimization. Specifically, FSFSplatter employs a large Transformer to
encode multi-view images and generates a dense and geometrically consistent
Gaussian scene initialization via a self-splitting Gaussian head. It eliminates
local floaters through contribution-based pruning and mitigates overfitting to
limited views by leveraging depth and multi-view feature supervision with
differentiable camera parameters during rapid optimization. FSFSplatter
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on widely used DTU and Replica.

### [3] [ROGR: Relightable 3D Objects using Generative Relighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03163)
*Jiapeng Tang,Matthew Lavine,Dor Verbin,Stephan J. Garbin,Matthias Nießner,Ricardo Martin Brualla,Pratul P. Srinivasan,Philipp Henzler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ROGR是一种新颖的可重光照3D重建方法，通过生成式重光照模型从多视角图像重建物体的可重光照3D模型，使用双分支架构的NeRF分别编码一般光照效果和镜面反射。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在任意环境光照下进行重光照时通常需要针对每种光照进行优化或进行复杂的光传输模拟，效率较低。

Method: 通过在不同光照环境下采样物体外观创建数据集，训练光照条件NeRF，采用双分支架构分别处理一般光照效果和镜面反射。

Result: 在TensoIR和Stanford-ORB数据集上评估，在大多数指标上优于现有最先进方法，并在真实物体捕获上展示了良好效果。

Conclusion: ROGR方法能够高效地进行前向重光照，无需针对每种光照进行优化或光传输模拟，实现了高质量的可重光照3D重建。

Abstract: We introduce ROGR, a novel approach that reconstructs a relightable 3D model
of an object captured from multiple views, driven by a generative relighting
model that simulates the effects of placing the object under novel environment
illuminations. Our method samples the appearance of the object under multiple
lighting environments, creating a dataset that is used to train a
lighting-conditioned Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) that outputs the object's
appearance under any input environmental lighting. The lighting-conditioned
NeRF uses a novel dual-branch architecture to encode the general lighting
effects and specularities separately. The optimized lighting-conditioned NeRF
enables efficient feed-forward relighting under arbitrary environment maps
without requiring per-illumination optimization or light transport simulation.
We evaluate our approach on the established TensoIR and Stanford-ORB datasets,
where it improves upon the state-of-the-art on most metrics, and showcase our
approach on real-world object captures.

### [4] [Oracle-RLAIF: An Improved Fine-Tuning Framework for Multi-modal Video Models through Reinforcement Learning from Ranking Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02561)
*Derek Shi,Ruben Glatt,Christine Klymko,Shubham Mohole,Hongjun Choi,Shashank Kushwaha,Sam Sakla,Felipe Leno da Silva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Oracle-RLAIF框架，用通用的Oracle排序器替代训练好的奖励模型，通过基于排名的GRPO_rank损失函数直接优化序数反馈，在大规模视频语言模型的强化学习对齐中实现更高效和灵活的训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视频语言模型参数规模扩大，收集人类反馈的成本急剧增加。现有的RLAIF方法依赖专门的奖励模型来生成标量奖励，这种流程既昂贵又受限。

Method: 使用Oracle排序器替代传统奖励模型，该排序器对候选模型响应进行排序而非评分；提出基于GRPO的GRPO_rank排名损失函数，直接优化序数反馈并利用排名感知优势。

Result: 经验证明Oracle-RLAIF在各种视频理解基准测试中持续优于使用现有微调方法的领先VLM。

Conclusion: Oracle-RLAIF为通过排名而非分数的强化学习来对齐大型多模态视频模型开辟了创建灵活和数据高效框架的道路。

Abstract: Recent advances in large video-language models (VLMs) rely on extensive
fine-tuning techniques that strengthen alignment between textual and visual
comprehension. Leading pipelines typically pair supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
with reinforcement learning from preference data to enhance video
comprehension. However, as VLMs scale in parameter size, so does the cost of
gathering enough human feedback. To make fine-tuning more cost-effective,
recent frameworks explore reinforcement learning with AI feedback (RLAIF),
which replace human preference with AI as a judge. Current RLAIF frameworks
rely on a specialized reward model trained with video narratives to create
calibrated scalar rewards-- an expensive and restrictive pipeline. We propose
Oracle-RLAIF, a novel framework that replaces the trained reward model with a
more general Oracle ranker which acts as a drop-in model ranking candidate
model responses rather than scoring them. Alongside Oracle-RLAIF, we introduce
$GRPO_{rank}$, a novel rank-based loss function based on Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) that directly optimizes ordinal feedback with rank-aware
advantages. Empirically, we demonstrate that Oracle-RLAIF consistently
outperforms leading VLMs using existing fine-tuning methods when evaluated
across various video comprehension benchmarks. Oracle-RLAIF paves the path to
creating flexible and data-efficient frameworks for aligning large multi-modal
video models with reinforcement learning from rank rather than score.

### [5] [PhysHMR: Learning Humanoid Control Policies from Vision for Physically Plausible Human Motion Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02566)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysHMR是一个统一框架，直接从单目视频学习视觉到动作策略，在物理模拟器中控制人形角色，实现物理合理且视觉对齐的运动重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注基于运动学的姿态估计，缺乏物理约束导致不真实结果。两阶段设计（先运动估计后物理后处理）会导致误差累积，限制重建质量。

Method: 使用像素作为射线策略将2D关键点提升为3D空间射线并转换到全局空间；结合局部视觉特征；通过蒸馏方案从动捕训练专家转移运动知识；使用物理驱动的强化学习奖励进行精炼。

Result: PhysHMR在多样化场景中产生高保真、物理合理的运动，在视觉准确性和物理真实性方面优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过统一的视觉到动作学习，实现了物理基础和视觉对齐的运动重建，解决了传统两阶段方法的误差累积问题。

Abstract: Reconstructing physically plausible human motion from monocular videos
remains a challenging problem in computer vision and graphics. Existing methods
primarily focus on kinematics-based pose estimation, often leading to
unrealistic results due to the lack of physical constraints. To address such
artifacts, prior methods have typically relied on physics-based post-processing
following the initial kinematics-based motion estimation. However, this
two-stage design introduces error accumulation, ultimately limiting the overall
reconstruction quality. In this paper, we present PhysHMR, a unified framework
that directly learns a visual-to-action policy for humanoid control in a
physics-based simulator, enabling motion reconstruction that is both physically
grounded and visually aligned with the input video. A key component of our
approach is the pixel-as-ray strategy, which lifts 2D keypoints into 3D spatial
rays and transforms them into global space. These rays are incorporated as
policy inputs, providing robust global pose guidance without depending on noisy
3D root predictions. This soft global grounding, combined with local visual
features from a pretrained encoder, allows the policy to reason over both
detailed pose and global positioning. To overcome the sample inefficiency of
reinforcement learning, we further introduce a distillation scheme that
transfers motion knowledge from a mocap-trained expert to the
vision-conditioned policy, which is then refined using physically motivated
reinforcement learning rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhysHMR
produces high-fidelity, physically plausible motion across diverse scenarios,
outperforming prior approaches in both visual accuracy and physical realism.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人机协作面部识别系统的准确性，探索在什么情况下人类和机器的结合能提高识别准确率，以及如何优化这种协作。

Method: 使用专家和非专家面部识别者的数据，分析人-人和人-机协作效果，提出近端准确率规则(PAR)来预测协作效益，并实施智能人机融合策略。

Result: 发现协作效益随协作者基础准确率差异减小而增加；建立了关键融合区域；智能人机融合比单独机器或所有人机判断组合更准确；图论分析显示全人类系统的最高准确率接近智能人机协作的平均表现。

Conclusion: 人机协作在面部识别中具有重要价值，智能融合能有效提高系统准确性并最小化低表现人类的影响，为AI在面部识别中的智能应用提供了循证路线图。

Abstract: Human review of consequential decisions by face recognition algorithms
creates a "collaborative" human-machine system. Individual differences between
people and machines, however, affect whether collaboration improves or degrades
accuracy in any given case. We establish the circumstances under which
combining human and machine face identification decisions improves accuracy.
Using data from expert and non-expert face identifiers, we examined the
benefits of human-human and human-machine collaborations. The benefits of
collaboration increased as the difference in baseline accuracy between
collaborators decreased-following the Proximal Accuracy Rule (PAR). This rule
predicted collaborative (fusion) benefit across a wide range of baseline
abilities, from people with no training to those with extensive training. Using
the PAR, we established a critical fusion zone, where humans are less accurate
than the machine, but fusing the two improves system accuracy. This zone was
surprisingly large. We implemented "intelligent human-machine fusion" by
selecting people with the potential to increase the accuracy of a
high-performing machine. Intelligent fusion was more accurate than the machine
operating alone and more accurate than combining all human and machine
judgments. The highest system-wide accuracy achievable with human-only
partnerships was found by graph theory. This fully human system approximated
the average performance achieved by intelligent human-machine collaboration.
However, intelligent human-machine collaboration more effectively minimized the
impact of low-performing humans on system-wide accuracy. The results
demonstrate a meaningful role for both humans and machines in assuring accurate
face identification. This study offers an evidence-based road map for the
intelligent use of AI in face identification.

### [7] [How Confident are Video Models? Empowering Video Models to Express their Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02571)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了首个生成式视频模型不确定性量化框架S-QUBED，包含评估指标、黑盒UQ方法和基准数据集，能够分解预测不确定性为偶然性和认知性成分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式视频模型存在幻觉问题，会产生看似合理但事实错误的视频，而现有研究缺乏视频模型的不确定性量化方法，存在安全隐患。

Method: 开发了基于稳健秩相关估计的校准评估指标、黑盒UQ方法S-QUBED（利用潜在建模分解不确定性）、以及UQ基准数据集。

Result: S-QUBED能够计算校准的总不确定性估计，与任务准确率负相关，并能有效分解偶然性和认知性不确定性成分。

Conclusion: 这是首个视频模型不确定性量化工作，提出的框架为视频生成模型的安全应用提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Generative video models demonstrate impressive text-to-video capabilities,
spurring widespread adoption in many real-world applications. However, like
large language models (LLMs), video generation models tend to hallucinate,
producing plausible videos even when they are factually wrong. Although
uncertainty quantification (UQ) of LLMs has been extensively studied in prior
work, no UQ method for video models exists, raising critical safety concerns.
To our knowledge, this paper represents the first work towards quantifying the
uncertainty of video models. We present a framework for uncertainty
quantification of generative video models, consisting of: (i) a metric for
evaluating the calibration of video models based on robust rank correlation
estimation with no stringent modeling assumptions; (ii) a black-box UQ method
for video models (termed S-QUBED), which leverages latent modeling to
rigorously decompose predictive uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic
components; and (iii) a UQ dataset to facilitate benchmarking calibration in
video models. By conditioning the generation task in the latent space, we
disentangle uncertainty arising due to vague task specifications from that
arising from lack of knowledge. Through extensive experiments on benchmark
video datasets, we demonstrate that S-QUBED computes calibrated total
uncertainty estimates that are negatively correlated with the task accuracy and
effectively computes the aleatoric and epistemic constituents.

### [8] [PEO: Training-Free Aesthetic Quality Enhancement in Pre-Trained Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Prompt Embedding Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02599)
*Hovhannes Margaryan,Bo Wan,Tinne Tuytelaars*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Prompt Embedding Optimization (PEO)方法，通过优化文本嵌入来提升预训练文本到图像扩散模型生成图像的美学质量，无需额外训练且与主干模型无关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决预训练文本到图像扩散模型在简单提示词下生成图像美学质量不足的问题，旨在通过优化文本嵌入而非修改模型本身来提升生成效果。

Method: 使用三分目标函数优化文本嵌入：提升生成图像的美学保真度、确保与优化后文本嵌入的一致性、通过提示词保留项最小化与初始提示词的差异。

Result: 定量和定性评估证实该方法有效，在性能上超过或等同于最先进的文本到图像和提示词适应方法。

Conclusion: PEO是一种无需训练、主干模型无关的有效方法，能够显著提升简单提示词下生成图像的美学质量。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to aesthetic quality improvement in
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models when given a simple prompt. Our
method, dubbed Prompt Embedding Optimization (PEO), leverages a pre-trained
text-to-image diffusion model as a backbone and optimizes the text embedding of
a given simple and uncurated prompt to enhance the visual quality of the
generated image. We achieve this by a tripartite objective function that
improves the aesthetic fidelity of the generated image, ensures adherence to
the optimized text embedding, and minimal divergence from the initial prompt.
The latter is accomplished through a prompt preservation term. Additionally,
PEO is training-free and backbone-independent. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, exceeding or
equating the performance of state-of-the-art text-to-image and prompt
adaptation methods.

*Patrick Rim,Kun He,Kevin Harris,Braden Copple,Shangchen Han,Sizhe An,Ivan Shugurov,Tomas Hodan,He Wen,Xu Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的无标记多摄像头系统，用于在真实野外环境中捕获精确的3D手部姿势和物体交互，解决了现有数据集在环境多样性和模型泛化方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集主要在受控实验室环境中采集，限制了环境多样性和模型泛化能力，需要开发能够在真实野外条件下准确跟踪手部及其与物体交互的方法。

Method: 设计了一种轻量级背戴式捕捉系统，结合8个外中心摄像头和Meta Quest 3头显的两个内中心视图，开发了内-外中心跟踪流程来生成准确的3D手部姿势真值。

Result: 收集了包含同步多视角图像和精确3D手部姿势的标注数据集，证明该方法能够显著减少环境真实性与3D标注精度之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 该方法为在真实野外环境中进行准确的3D手部跟踪提供了可行解决方案，为计算机视觉研究提供了更高质量的数据支持。

Abstract: Accurate 3D tracking of hands and their interactions with the world in
unconstrained settings remains a significant challenge for egocentric computer
vision. With few exceptions, existing datasets are predominantly captured in
controlled lab setups, limiting environmental diversity and model
generalization. To address this, we introduce a novel marker-less multi-camera
system designed to capture precise 3D hands and objects, which allows for
nearly unconstrained mobility in genuinely in-the-wild conditions. We combine a
lightweight, back-mounted capture rig with eight exocentric cameras, and a
user-worn Meta Quest 3 headset, which contributes two egocentric views. We
design an ego-exo tracking pipeline to generate accurate 3D hand pose ground
truth from this system, and rigorously evaluate its quality. By collecting an
annotated dataset featuring synchronized multi-view images and precise 3D hand
poses, we demonstrate the capability of our approach to significantly reduce
the trade-off between environmental realism and 3D annotation accuracy.

### [10] [Input-Aware Sparse Attention for Real-Time Co-Speech Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02617)
*Beijia Lu,Ziyi Chen,Jing Xiao,Jun-Yan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于输入人体姿态条件的视频蒸馏方法，通过稀疏注意力机制和输入感知蒸馏损失，将多步扩散视频模型蒸馏为少步学生模型，实现实时性能并提升视觉质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的语音驱动视频生成方法由于需要大量去噪步骤和昂贵的注意力机制，导致速度缓慢，无法实现实时部署

Method: 1. 使用输入人体姿态关键点的准确对应关系来引导注意力到相关区域；2. 提出输入感知稀疏注意力减少冗余计算；3. 引入输入感知蒸馏损失提升唇部同步和手部运动真实性

Result: 方法实现了实时性能，在视觉质量上优于最近的音频驱动和输入驱动方法

Conclusion: 通过整合输入感知稀疏注意力和蒸馏损失，该方法在保持高质量的同时显著提升了推理效率

Abstract: Diffusion models can synthesize realistic co-speech video from audio for
various applications, such as video creation and virtual agents. However,
existing diffusion-based methods are slow due to numerous denoising steps and
costly attention mechanisms, preventing real-time deployment. In this work, we
distill a many-step diffusion video model into a few-step student model.
Unfortunately, directly applying recent diffusion distillation methods degrades
video quality and falls short of real-time performance. To address these
issues, our new video distillation method leverages input human pose
conditioning for both attention and loss functions. We first propose using
accurate correspondence between input human pose keypoints to guide attention
to relevant regions, such as the speaker's face, hands, and upper body. This
input-aware sparse attention reduces redundant computations and strengthens
temporal correspondences of body parts, improving inference efficiency and
motion coherence. To further enhance visual quality, we introduce an
input-aware distillation loss that improves lip synchronization and hand motion
realism. By integrating our input-aware sparse attention and distillation loss,
our method achieves real-time performance with improved visual quality compared
to recent audio-driven and input-driven methods. We also conduct extensive
experiments showing the effectiveness of our algorithmic design choices.

### [11] [Deep Generative Continual Learning using Functional LoRA: FunLoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02631)
*Victor Enescu,Hichem Sahbi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FunLoRA方法，通过基于低秩适应的新型条件机制解决生成模型持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，仅需在当前任务数据上训练，显著减少内存成本和采样时间。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度生成模型在持续适应过程中面临灾难性遗忘问题，现有基于合成数据重训练的方法存在训练时间不断增加和长期性能下降的局限性。

Method: 设计基于低秩适应的功能LoRA方法，专门使用秩1矩阵，通过精心选择的函数增加重参数化矩阵的秩，实现动态条件机制。

Result: 实验表明FunLoRA在基于流匹配的模型上超越现有基于扩散模型的方法，达到更高的分类准确率，同时仅需部分内存成本和采样时间。

Conclusion: FunLoRA提供了一种参数高效微调方法，有效解决生成模型持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，具有优越的性能和效率。

Abstract: Continual adaptation of deep generative models holds tremendous potential and
critical importance, given their rapid and expanding usage in text and vision
based applications. Incremental training, however, remains highly challenging
due to catastrophic forgetting phenomenon, which makes it difficult for neural
networks to effectively incorporate new knowledge. A common strategy consists
in retraining the generative model on its own synthetic data in order to
mitigate forgetting. Yet, such an approach faces two major limitations: (i) the
continually increasing training time eventually becomes intractable, and (ii)
reliance on synthetic data inevitably leads to long-term performance
degradation, since synthetic samples lack the richness of real training data.
In this paper, we attenuate these issues by designing a novel and more
expressive conditioning mechanism for generative models based on low rank
adaptation (LoRA), that exclusively employs rank 1 matrices, whose
reparametrized matrix rank is functionally increased using carefully selected
functions -- and dubbed functional LoRA: FunLoRA. Using this dynamic
conditioning, the generative model is guaranteed to avoid catastrophic
forgetting and needs only to be trained on data from the current task.
Extensive experiments using flow-matching based models trained from scratch,
showcase that our proposed parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method
surpasses prior state-of-the-art results based on diffusion models, reaching
higher classification accuracy scores, while only requiring a fraction of the
memory cost and sampling time.

*Abhishek Joshi,Jahnavi Krishna Koda,Abhishek Phadke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种双视野、序列保持的鲁棒性框架，用于美国交通灯和标志识别，通过统一的三层防御堆栈（特征压缩、防御蒸馏、基于熵的异常检测）和时序投票机制，显著提升了对抗数字和自然干扰的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆中交通灯和标志识别错误直接影响导航和安全。现有研究缺乏对时间连续性、多静态视野感知以及数字和自然干扰鲁棒性的考虑，需要开发更全面的防御框架。

Method: 基于aiMotive、Udacity、Waymo和自录德克萨斯州视频构建多源数据集，对高速公路、夜间、雨天和城市四种操作设计域进行时序对齐。采用统一三层防御堆栈：特征压缩、防御蒸馏、基于熵的异常检测，并结合序列级时序投票增强。

Result: 统一防御堆栈达到79.8mAP，将攻击成功率降至18.2%，优于YOLOv8、YOLOv9和BEVFormer，同时将高风险误分类降至32%。通过重捕获探针确认了物理可转移性。

Conclusion: 该框架在保持高精度的同时显著提升了对抗数字和自然干扰的鲁棒性，为自动驾驶系统的安全感知提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Traffic light and sign recognition are key for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs)
because perception mistakes directly influence navigation and safety. In
addition to digital adversarial attacks, models are vulnerable to existing
perturbations (glare, rain, dirt, or graffiti), which could lead to dangerous
misclassifications. The current work lacks consideration of temporal
continuity, multistatic field-of-view (FoV) sensing, and robustness to both
digital and natural degradation. This study proposes a dual FoV,
sequence-preserving robustness framework for traffic lights and signs in the
USA based on a multi-source dataset built on aiMotive, Udacity, Waymo, and
self-recorded videos from the region of Texas. Mid and long-term sequences of
RGB images are temporally aligned for four operational design domains (ODDs):
highway, night, rainy, and urban. Over a series of experiments on a real-life
application of anomaly detection, this study outlines a unified three-layer
defense stack framework that incorporates feature squeezing, defensive
distillation, and entropy-based anomaly detection, as well as sequence-wise
temporal voting for further enhancement. The evaluation measures included
accuracy, attack success rate (ASR), risk-weighted misclassification severity,
and confidence stability. Physical transferability was confirmed using probes
for recapture. The results showed that the Unified Defense Stack achieved
79.8mAP and reduced the ASR to 18.2%, which is superior to YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and
BEVFormer, while reducing the high-risk misclassification to 32%.

*Benjamin Yu,Jackie Liu,Justin Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Smart-GRPO是首个针对流匹配模型中强化学习的噪声扰动优化方法，通过迭代搜索策略改进噪声分布，提升奖励优化和视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流匹配模型的确定性特性使其不适合强化学习，而现有方法通过随机噪声扰动引入随机性效率低且不稳定。

Method: 采用迭代搜索策略：解码候选扰动，用奖励函数评估，向高奖励区域优化噪声分布。

Result: 实验表明Smart-GRPO在奖励优化和视觉质量方面均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 为流匹配框架中的强化学习提供了实用路径，弥合了高效训练与人类对齐生成之间的差距。

Abstract: Recent advancements in flow-matching have enabled high-quality text-to-image
generation. However, the deterministic nature of flow-matching models makes
them poorly suited for reinforcement learning, a key tool for improving image
quality and human alignment. Prior work has introduced stochasticity by
perturbing latents with random noise, but such perturbations are inefficient
and unstable. We propose Smart-GRPO, the first method to optimize noise
perturbations for reinforcement learning in flow-matching models. Smart-GRPO
employs an iterative search strategy that decodes candidate perturbations,
evaluates them with a reward function, and refines the noise distribution
toward higher-reward regions. Experiments demonstrate that Smart-GRPO improves
both reward optimization and visual quality compared to baseline methods. Our
results suggest a practical path toward reinforcement learning in flow-matching
frameworks, bridging the gap between efficient training and human-aligned
generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoGIC是一个统一的多模态运动生成框架，通过整合意图建模和视觉先验，解决了现有方法在捕捉动作执行因果逻辑和人类意图方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本驱动运动生成方法将合成视为语言和运动之间的双向映射，但无法捕捉动作执行的因果逻辑和驱动行为的人类意图。缺乏视觉基础进一步限制了精度和个性化。

Method: 提出MoGIC框架，联合优化多模态条件运动生成和意图预测，引入具有自适应范围的注意力混合机制，实现条件标记与运动子序列的有效局部对齐。构建了440小时的Mo440H基准数据集。

Result: 微调后，MoGIC在HumanML3D上FID降低38.6%，在Mo440H上降低34.6%，在运动描述任务中超越基于LLM的方法，并支持意图预测和视觉条件生成。

Conclusion: MoGIC推进了可控运动合成和意图理解，展示了多模态生成能力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Existing text-driven motion generation methods often treat synthesis as a
bidirectional mapping between language and motion, but remain limited in
capturing the causal logic of action execution and the human intentions that
drive behavior. The absence of visual grounding further restricts precision and
personalization, as language alone cannot specify fine-grained spatiotemporal
details. We propose MoGIC, a unified framework that integrates intention
modeling and visual priors into multimodal motion synthesis. By jointly
optimizing multimodal-conditioned motion generation and intention prediction,
MoGIC uncovers latent human goals, leverages visual priors to enhance
generation, and exhibits versatile multimodal generative capability. We further
introduce a mixture-of-attention mechanism with adaptive scope to enable
effective local alignment between conditional tokens and motion subsequences.
To support this paradigm, we curate Mo440H, a 440-hour benchmark from 21
high-quality motion datasets. Experiments show that after finetuning, MoGIC
reduces FID by 38.6\% on HumanML3D and 34.6\% on Mo440H, surpasses LLM-based
methods in motion captioning with a lightweight text head, and further enables
intention prediction and vision-conditioned generation, advancing controllable
motion synthesis and intention understanding. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于运动自适应的动态3D重建框架，通过语义和运动先验优化控制点分配，在动态区域集中控制点，减少静态背景冗余，使用样条轨迹参数化实现更平滑的运动表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏控制方法仅基于几何分配控制点，导致静态区域冗余和动态区域不足，无法有效处理运动复杂度与表示密度之间的不匹配问题。

Method: 利用视觉基础模型的语义和运动先验建立补丁-标记-节点对应关系，应用运动自适应压缩，通过迭代体素化和运动趋势评分实现表示密度自适应，使用基于2D轨迹初始化的样条轨迹参数化替代MLP变形场。

Result: 在重建质量和效率方面相比现有最先进方法有显著提升。

Conclusion: 提出的运动自适应框架通过将控制密度与运动复杂度对齐，有效解决了动态3D重建中的关键挑战，实现了更高质量和更高效的重建效果。

Abstract: Dynamic 3D reconstruction from monocular videos remains difficult due to the
ambiguity inferring 3D motion from limited views and computational demands of
modeling temporally varying scenes. While recent sparse control methods
alleviate computation by reducing millions of Gaussians to thousands of control
points, they suffer from a critical limitation: they allocate points purely by
geometry, leading to static redundancy and dynamic insufficiency. We propose a
motion-adaptive framework that aligns control density with motion complexity.
Leveraging semantic and motion priors from vision foundation models, we
establish patch-token-node correspondences and apply motion-adaptive
compression to concentrate control points in dynamic regions while suppressing
redundancy in static backgrounds. Our approach achieves flexible
representational density adaptation through iterative voxelization and motion
tendency scoring, directly addressing the fundamental mismatch between control
point allocation and motion complexity. To capture temporal evolution, we
introduce spline-based trajectory parameterization initialized by 2D tracklets,
replacing MLP-based deformation fields to achieve smoother motion
representation and more stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate
significant improvements in reconstruction quality and efficiency over existing
state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 提出Net2Net方法，结合无训练网络和预训练网络的优势，通过正则化去噪(RED)解决真实世界噪声去除问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统去噪方法依赖手工先验，在复杂真实噪声中表现不佳；深度学习需要大量标注数据且泛化能力有限。需要一种能适应不同噪声类型且不依赖大量标注数据的方法。

Method: 结合无监督DIP网络和预训练DRUNet模型，通过RED正则化。无训练网络适应输入图像的独特噪声特征，预训练网络利用大规模数据集学习到的表示。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在真实世界噪声去除方面具有优越性能，特别是在训练数据有限的情况下。

Conclusion: Net2Net混合框架通过结合无训练和预训练网络的优势，提高了对不同噪声模式的泛化能力，在真实世界噪声去除任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Traditional denoising methods for noise removal have largely relied on
handcrafted priors, often perform well in controlled environments but struggle
to address the complexity and variability of real noise. In contrast, deep
learning-based approaches have gained prominence for learning noise
characteristics from large datasets, but these methods frequently require
extensive labeled data and may not generalize effectively across diverse noise
types and imaging conditions. In this paper, we present an innovative method,
termed as Net2Net, that combines the strengths of untrained and pre-trained
networks to tackle the challenges of real-world noise removal. The innovation
of Net2Net lies in its combination of unsupervised DIP and supervised
pre-trained model DRUNet by regularization by denoising (RED). The untrained
network adapts to the unique noise characteristics of each input image without
requiring labeled data, while the pre-trained network leverages learned
representations from large-scale datasets to deliver robust denoising
performance. This hybrid framework enhances generalization across varying noise
patterns and improves performance, particularly in scenarios with limited
training data. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our method for real-world noise removal.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Retrv-R1是首个专为多模态通用检索设计的R1风格MLLM，通过逐步推理提升检索准确性，解决了DeepSeek-R1直接应用于检索任务时的计算成本高和训练不稳定的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DeepSeek-R1展示了RL增强LLM推理能力的潜力，但直接应用于检索任务不可行，主要因为多候选推理过程导致高计算成本，以及RL训练检索任务时的不稳定性和次优结果。

Method: 引入信息压缩模块和细节检查机制减少token数量但保留关键信息；提出新的训练范式，包括使用检索定制合成CoT数据集的激活阶段，以及采用课程奖励的RL训练。

Result: Retrv-R1在多个基准测试和任务中实现了SOTA性能、高效率和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过信息压缩和新的训练范式，Retrv-R1成功将R1风格推理应用于多模态检索，实现了性能、效率和泛化能力的平衡。

Abstract: The success of DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates the immense potential of using
reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities. This paper
introduces Retrv-R1, the first R1-style MLLM specifically designed for
multimodal universal retrieval, achieving higher performance by employing
step-by-step reasoning to produce more accurate retrieval results. We find that
directly applying the methods of DeepSeek-R1 to retrieval tasks is not
feasible, mainly due to (1) the high computational cost caused by the large
token consumption required for multiple candidates with reasoning processes,
and (2) the instability and suboptimal results when directly applying RL to
train for retrieval tasks. To address these issues, Retrv-R1 introduces an
information compression module with a details inspection mechanism, which
enhances computational efficiency by reducing the number of tokens while
ensuring that critical information for challenging candidates is preserved.
Furthermore, a new training paradigm is proposed, including an activation stage
using a retrieval-tailored synthetic CoT dataset for more effective
optimization, followed by RL with a novel curriculum reward to improve both
performance and efficiency. Incorporating these novel designs, Retrv-R1
achieves SOTA performance, high efficiency, and strong generalization ability,
as demonstrated by experiments across multiple benchmarks and tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时自适应方法要么依赖计算昂贵的反向传播，要么只关注似然适应而忽略先验的重要性，限制了实时部署和性能提升。

Method: 引入动态缓存存储类别嵌入、空间尺度和自适应先验，将适应问题建模为贝叶斯推理，通过不确定性引导的融合机制结合初始VLM输出和基于缓存的预测。

Result: 在识别和检测基准测试中达到最先进性能，无需反向传播，计算效率高。

Conclusion: BCA+通过双自适应机制有效修正模型的语义理解和上下文置信度，为视觉语言模型在真实世界分布偏移下的部署提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP and Grounding DINO have achieved
remarkable success in object recognition and detection. However, their
performance often degrades under real-world distribution shifts. Test-time
adaptation (TTA) aims to mitigate this issue by adapting models during
inference. Existing methods either rely on computationally expensive
backpropagation, which hinders real-time deployment, or focus solely on
likelihood adaptation, which overlooks the critical role of the prior. Our
prior work, Bayesian Class Adaptation (BCA), addressed these shortcomings for
object recognition by introducing a training-free framework that incorporates
adaptive priors. Building upon this foundation, we now present Bayesian Class
Adaptation plus (BCA+), a unified, training-free framework for TTA for both
object recognition and detection. BCA+ introduces a dynamic cache that
adaptively stores and updates class embeddings, spatial scales (for detection),
and, crucially, adaptive class priors derived from historical predictions. We
formulate adaptation as a Bayesian inference problem, where final predictions
are generated by fusing the initial VLM output with a cache-based prediction.
This cache-based prediction combines a dynamically updated likelihood
(measuring feature and scale similarity) and a prior (reflecting the evolving
class distribution). This dual-adaptation mechanism, coupled with
uncertainty-guided fusion, enables BCA+ to correct both the model's semantic
understanding and its contextual confidence. As a training-free method
requiring no backpropagation, BCA+ is highly efficient. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BCA+ achieves state-of-the-art performance on both recognition
and detection benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于脑肿瘤分类的层次化广义类别发现方法（HGCD-BT），通过结合层次聚类和对比学习，能够识别训练时未见过的肿瘤类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有脑肿瘤分类方法局限于预定义类别，无法识别训练时未见的肿瘤类型。广义类别发现（GCD）虽然能识别已知和未知类别，但缺乏对脑肿瘤分类学层次结构的考虑。

Method: 将层次聚类与对比学习相结合，在基于对比学习的GCD基础上引入半监督层次聚类损失函数。

Result: 在OpenSRH数据集上，相比最先进的GCD方法，在斑块级分类准确率提升28%，特别是在识别未见肿瘤类别方面表现优异。在WSI数据集上也验证了方法的通用性。

Conclusion: HGCD-BT方法能够有效识别已知和未知的脑肿瘤类别，且具有良好的跨模态通用性，为术中决策提供了更准确的分类工具。

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor classification is critical for intra-operative decision
making in neuro-oncological surgery. However, existing approaches are
restricted to a fixed set of predefined classes and are therefore unable to
capture patterns of tumor types not available during training. Unsupervised
learning can extract general-purpose features, but it lacks the ability to
incorporate prior knowledge from labelled data, and semi-supervised methods
often assume that all potential classes are represented in the labelled data.
Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to bridge this gap by categorizing
both known and unknown classes within unlabelled data. To reflect the
hierarchical structure of brain tumor taxonomies, in this work, we introduce
Hierarchical Generalized Category Discovery for Brain Tumor Classification
(HGCD-BT), a novel approach that integrates hierarchical clustering with
contrastive learning. Our method extends contrastive learning based GCD by
incorporating a novel semi-supervised hierarchical clustering loss. We evaluate
HGCD-BT on OpenSRH, a dataset of stimulated Raman histology brain tumor images,
achieving a +28% improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art GCD methods for
patch-level classification, particularly in identifying previously unseen tumor
categories. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of HGCD-BT on
slide-level classification of hematoxylin and eosin stained whole-slide images
from the Digital Brain Tumor Atlas, confirming its utility across imaging
modalities.

TL;DR: AdaRD-Key是一个无需训练的关键帧采样模块，通过统一的相关性-多样性最大体积目标，为长视频理解选择信息丰富且非冗余的关键帧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在长视频理解中存在关键时刻遗漏、冗余帧过多或忽视查询相关性等问题，需要一种能平衡相关性和多样性的采样策略。

Method: 提出RD-MV目标函数，结合查询条件相关性评分和对数行列式多样性组件，并采用轻量级相关性感知门控机制处理弱对齐查询。

Result: 在LongVideoBench和Video-MME上的实验表明，该方法在长视频理解任务上达到了最先进的性能，且计算效率高，可在单GPU上实时运行。

Conclusion: AdaRD-Key提供了一种高效、无需训练的关键帧采样解决方案，能够显著提升长视频理解的性能，并兼容现有的视觉语言模型。

Abstract: Understanding long-form videos remains a significant challenge for
vision--language models (VLMs) due to their extensive temporal length and high
information density. Most current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rely
on uniform sampling, which often overlooks critical moments, leading to
incorrect responses to queries. In parallel, many keyframe selection approaches
impose rigid temporal spacing: once a frame is chosen, an exclusion window
suppresses adjacent timestamps to reduce redundancy. While effective at
limiting overlap, this strategy frequently misses short, fine-grained cues near
important events. Other methods instead emphasize visual diversity but neglect
query relevance. We propose AdaRD-Key, a training-free keyframe sampling module
for query-driven long-form video understanding. AdaRD-Key maximizes a unified
Relevance--Diversity Max-Volume (RD-MV) objective, combining a
query-conditioned relevance score with a log-determinant diversity component to
yield informative yet non-redundant frames. To handle broad queries with weak
alignment to the video, AdaRD-Key employs a lightweight relevance-aware gating
mechanism; when the relevance distribution indicates weak alignment, the method
seamlessly shifts into a diversity-only mode, enhancing coverage without
additional supervision. Our pipeline is training-free, computationally
efficient (running in real time on a single GPU), and compatible with existing
VLMs in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experiments on LongVideoBench and
Video-MME demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, particularly on long-form
videos. Code available at https://github.com/Xian867/AdaRD-Key.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现出色，但其在复杂横向思维挑战（如字谜）上的认知过程仍不透明，且失败模式尚未被深入探索。

Method: 创建了包含221个字谜的系统标注数据集，涵盖六个认知类别，并开发了将推理质量与答案正确性分离的评估框架，研究了三种提示策略。

Result: 发现推理质量在不同谜题类别间差异显著，模型在视觉组合方面表现系统优势，但在缺失解释和文化象征方面存在根本性限制。提示策略显著影响认知方法和问题解决效果。

Conclusion: 可解释性应作为模型性能的组成部分而非事后考虑，提示策略对模型认知过程和问题解决能力有重要影响。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet their
cognitive processes remain opaque on complex lateral thinking challenges like
rebus puzzles. While recent work has demonstrated these models struggle
significantly with rebus puzzle solving, the underlying reasoning processes and
failure patterns remain largely unexplored. We address this gap through a
comprehensive explainability analysis that moves beyond performance metrics to
understand how VLMs approach these complex lateral thinking challenges. Our
study contributes a systematically annotated dataset of 221 rebus puzzles
across six cognitive categories, paired with an evaluation framework that
separates reasoning quality from answer correctness. We investigate three
prompting strategies designed to elicit different types of explanatory
processes and reveal critical insights into VLM cognitive processes. Our
findings demonstrate that reasoning quality varies dramatically across puzzle
categories, with models showing systematic strengths in visual composition
while exhibiting fundamental limitations in absence interpretation and cultural
symbolism. We also discover that prompting strategy substantially influences
both cognitive approach and problem-solving effectiveness, establishing
explainability as an integral component of model performance rather than a
post-hoc consideration.

Motivation: 现有文本移除研究主要关注自然图像中的场景文本，但当前数据集存在域外泛化能力差、评估不准确的问题，特别是SCUT-EnsText等基准存在人工编辑造成的地面真值伪影、文本背景过于简单等问题。

Method: 通过对象感知放置和视觉语言模型生成内容，在复杂背景上渲染文本，合成文本移除基准数据集，确保干净的地面真值和具有挑战性的文本移除场景。

Conclusion: 提出的数据集合成方法解决了现有文本移除数据集的局限性，为文本移除任务提供了更准确和具有挑战性的评估基准。

Abstract: Text removal is a crucial task in computer vision with applications such as
privacy preservation, image editing, and media reuse. While existing research
has primarily focused on scene text removal in natural images, limitations in
current datasets hinder out-of-domain generalization or accurate evaluation. In
particular, widely used benchmarks such as SCUT-EnsText suffer from ground
truth artifacts due to manual editing, overly simplistic text backgrounds, and
evaluation metrics that do not capture the quality of generated results. To
address these issues, we introduce an approach to synthesizing a text removal
benchmark applicable to domains other than scene texts. Our dataset features
text rendered on complex backgrounds using object-aware placement and
vision-language model-generated content, ensuring clean ground truth and
challenging text removal scenarios. The dataset is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于多模态医学目标检测的表示对齐方法，通过模态标记和查询表示对齐来解决不同医学成像模态间的统计异质性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单一检测器在混合医学模态（如CXR、CT、MRI）上训练时，由于统计异质性和不连续表示空间而性能下降。

Method: 使用模态标记（文本导出的紧凑嵌入）和多模态上下文注意力（MoCA）将模态上下文注入对象查询，并通过QueryREPA预训练阶段对齐查询表示。

Result: 该方法在多种模态联合训练时持续提升AP指标，且开销极小，无需架构修改。

Conclusion: 提供了一种实现稳健多模态医学目标检测的实用路径，能有效对齐不同模态的表示空间。

Abstract: Medical object detection suffers when a single detector is trained on mixed
medical modalities (e.g., CXR, CT, MRI) due to heterogeneous statistics and
disjoint representation spaces. To address this challenge, we turn to
representation alignment, an approach that has proven effective for bringing
features from different sources into a shared space. Specifically, we target
the representations of DETR-style object queries and propose a simple,
detector-agnostic framework to align them with modality context. First, we
define modality tokens: compact, text-derived embeddings encoding imaging
modality that are lightweight and require no extra annotations. We integrate
the modality tokens into the detection process via Multimodality Context
Attention (MoCA), mixing object-query representations via self-attention to
propagate modality context within the query set. This preserves DETR-style
architectures and adds negligible latency while injecting modality cues into
object queries. We further introduce QueryREPA, a short pretraining stage that
aligns query representations to their modality tokens using a task-specific
contrastive objective with modality-balanced batches. Together, MoCA and
QueryREPA produce modality-aware, class-faithful queries that transfer
effectively to downstream training. Across diverse modalities trained
altogether, the proposed approach consistently improves AP with minimal
overhead and no architectural modifications, offering a practical path toward
robust multimodality medical object detection. Project page:

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在视觉语言理解方面表现出色，但存在幻觉问题，即生成与输入视觉和文本内容相矛盾的内容。现有的对比解码方法难以构建合适的对比样本，注意力操作方法缺乏稳定性。

Method: 提出图像头掩码对比解码(MaskCD)，利用LVLMs中的"图像头"，通过掩码这些头来构建对比样本进行对比解码。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7b和Qwen-VL-7b模型上使用CHAIR、POPE、AMBER和MME等基准测试，结果显示MaskCD能有效缓解幻觉现象并保持LVLMs的一般能力。

Conclusion: MaskCD方法通过掩码图像头构建对比样本，为缓解LVLMs的幻觉问题提供了一种有效且稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
visual-language understanding for downstream multimodal tasks. While their
capabilities are improving, problems emerge simultaneously. Among those
problems, the hallucinations have attracted much attention, which stands for
the phenomenon where LVLMs generate contradictory content to their input visual
and text contents. Many approaches have been proposed to deal with this issue,
such as contrastive decoding and attention manipulation. However, contrastive
decoding methods struggle in constructing appropriate contrastive samples, and
attention manipulation methods are highly sensitive, lacking stability. In this
work, we propose image head Masked Contrastive Decoding (MaskCD). Our approach
utilizes the "image heads" in LVLMs, masking them to construct contrastive
samples for contrastive decoding. We evaluated MaskCD on LLaVA-1.5-7b and
Qwen-VL-7b, using various benchmarks such as CHAIR, POPE, AMBER and MME. The
results demonstrate that MaskCD effectively alleviates the phenomenon of
hallucinations and retains the general capabilities of LVLMs. Corresponding

Abstract: Pose estimation is still a challenge at the small scales. Few solutions exist
to capture the 6 degrees of freedom of an object with nanometric and
microradians resolutions over relatively large ranges. Over the years, we have
proposed several fiducial marker and pattern designs to achieve reliable
performance for various microscopy applications. Centimeter ranges are possible
using pattern encoding methods, while nanometer resolutions can be achieved
using phase processing of the periodic frames. This paper presents VERNIER, an
open source phase processing software designed to provide fast and reliable
pose measurement based on pseudo-periodic patterns. Thanks to a phase-based
local thresholding algorithm, the software has proven to be particularly robust
to noise, defocus and occlusion. The successive steps of the phase processing
are presented, as well as the different types of patterns that address
different application needs. The implementation procedure is illustrated with
synthetic and experimental images. Finally, guidelines are given for selecting
the appropriate pattern design and microscope magnification lenses as a
function of the desired performance.

Motivation: 临床诊断需要灵活的模态重建能力，但现有方法面临三个挑战：如何建模不同模态的异质贡献、如何控制融合质量避免噪声信息退化、如何在多输出生成中保持模态身份一致性。

Method: 将多模态医学数据视为带质量驱动选择机制的序列帧，设计三个协作模块：PreWeightNet（全局贡献评估）、ThresholdNet（自适应过滤）、EffiWeightNet（有效权重计算），并提出因果模态身份模块（CMIM）建立生成图像与目标模态描述间的因果约束。

Conclusion: 通过渐进增强和质量驱动选择机制，Med-K2N能够有效解决K到N医学图像合成的关键挑战，为临床诊断提供更灵活的模态重建支持。

Abstract: Cross-modal medical image synthesis research focuses on reconstructing
missing imaging modalities from available ones to support clinical diagnosis.
Driven by clinical necessities for flexible modality reconstruction, we explore
K to N medical generation, where three critical challenges emerge: How can we
model the heterogeneous contributions of different modalities to various target
tasks? How can we ensure fusion quality control to prevent degradation from
noisy information? How can we maintain modality identity consistency in
multi-output generation? Driven by these clinical necessities, and drawing
inspiration from SAM2's sequential frame paradigm and clinicians' progressive
workflow of incrementally adding and selectively integrating multi-modal
information, we treat multi-modal medical data as sequential frames with
quality-driven selection mechanisms. Our key idea is to "learn" adaptive
weights for each modality-task pair and "memorize" beneficial fusion patterns
through progressive enhancement. To achieve this, we design three collaborative
modules: PreWeightNet for global contribution assessment, ThresholdNet for
adaptive filtering, and EffiWeightNet for effective weight computation.
Meanwhile, to maintain modality identity consistency, we propose the Causal
Modality Identity Module (CMIM) that establishes causal constraints between
generated images and target modality descriptions using vision-language
modeling. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Med-K2N
outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins on multiple
benchmarks. Source code is available.

Motivation: 需要准确、无损的鸡蛋质量评估方法来确保食品安全、维持产品标准和提高商业禽类生产效率。传统方法需要破坏性内部测量，而本研究旨在仅使用外部特征进行内部质量评估。

Method: 构建包含186个褐壳鸡蛋的公开数据集，使用预训练的CNN模型（ResNet152、DenseNet169、ResNet152V2）提取图像特征，结合形状和重量特征，通过PCA降维、SMOTE增强，并采用集成投票机制融合多个机器学习算法的预测结果。

Abstract: Accurate, non-destructive assessment of egg quality is critical for ensuring
food safety, maintaining product standards, and operational efficiency in
commercial poultry production. This paper introduces ELMF4EggQ, an ensemble
learning framework that employs multimodal feature fusion to classify egg grade
and freshness using only external attributes - image, shape, and weight. A
novel, publicly available dataset of 186 brown-shelled eggs was constructed,
with egg grade and freshness levels determined through laboratory-based expert
assessments involving internal quality measurements, such as yolk index and
Haugh unit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply
machine learning methods for internal egg quality assessment using only
external, non-invasive features, and the first to release a corresponding
labeled dataset. The proposed framework integrates deep features extracted from
external egg images with structural characteristics such as egg shape and
weight, enabling a comprehensive representation of each egg. Image feature
extraction is performed using top-performing pre-trained CNN models (ResNet152,
DenseNet169, and ResNet152V2), followed by PCA-based dimensionality reduction,
SMOTE augmentation, and classification using multiple machine learning
algorithms. An ensemble voting mechanism combines predictions from the
best-performing classifiers to enhance overall accuracy. Experimental results

*Lorenzo Bianchi,Giacomo Pacini,Fabio Carrara,Nicola Messina,Giuseppe Amato,Fabrizio Falchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的零样本图像描述框架，从图像中心转向补丁中心范式，无需区域级监督即可描述任意区域


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的零样本描述器局限于全局表示和整图描述，无法描述图像中的特定区域

Method: 将单个补丁作为原子描述单元进行聚合，从单个补丁到非连续区域再到整图都能描述，使用DINO等生成有意义的密集视觉特征

Result: 在多个基于区域的描述任务中达到最先进性能，在零样本密集描述、区域集描述和新引入的轨迹描述任务上表现优异

Conclusion: 补丁级语义表示对于可扩展的描述生成非常有效

Abstract: Zero-shot captioners are recently proposed models that utilize common-space
vision-language representations to caption images without relying on paired
image-text data. To caption an image, they proceed by textually decoding a
text-aligned image feature, but they limit their scope to global
representations and whole-image captions. We present \frameworkName{}, a
unified framework for zero-shot captioning that shifts from an image-centric to
a patch-centric paradigm, enabling the captioning of arbitrary regions without
the need of region-level supervision. Instead of relying on global image
representations, we treat individual patches as atomic captioning units and
aggregate them to describe arbitrary regions, from single patches to
non-contiguous areas and entire images. We analyze the key ingredients that
enable current latent captioners to work in our novel proposed framework.
Experiments demonstrate that backbones producing meaningful, dense visual
features, such as DINO, are key to achieving state-of-the-art performance in
multiple region-based captioning tasks. Compared to other baselines and
state-of-the-art competitors, our models achieve better performance on
zero-shot dense, region-set, and a newly introduced trace captioning task,
highlighting the effectiveness of patch-wise semantic representations for
scalable caption generation. Project page at https://paciosoft.com/Patch-ioner/ .

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MEACI-Net框架，通过多尺度块和去噪模块增强运动模态表示，并引入选择性运动补充和跨模态增强模块来加强RGB与运动模态的交互，提升压缩视频动作识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 压缩视频动作识别存在动态信息粗糙噪声大、RGB与运动模态融合不足的问题，需要改进表示学习和模态交互。

Method: 采用双流架构，运动流使用带去噪模块的多尺度块增强表示；引入选择性运动补充模块和跨模态增强模块加强模态交互。

Result: 在UCF-101、HMDB-51和Kinetics-400基准测试上验证了方法的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: MEACI-Net通过运动增强和跨模态交互机制，有效解决了压缩视频动作识别中的关键问题，取得了优异的性能。

Abstract: Compressed video action recognition has recently drawn growing attention,
since it remarkably reduces the storage and computational cost via replacing
raw videos by sparsely sampled RGB frames and compressed motion cues (e.g.,
motion vectors and residuals). However, this task severely suffers from the
coarse and noisy dynamics and the insufficient fusion of the heterogeneous RGB
and motion modalities. To address the two issues above, this paper proposes a
novel framework, namely Attentive Cross-modal Interaction Network with Motion
Enhancement (MEACI-Net). It follows the two-stream architecture, i.e. one for
the RGB modality and the other for the motion modality. Particularly, the
motion stream employs a multi-scale block embedded with a denoising module to
enhance representation learning. The interaction between the two streams is
then strengthened by introducing the Selective Motion Complement (SMC) and
Cross-Modality Augment (CMA) modules, where SMC complements the RGB modality
with spatio-temporally attentive local motion features and CMA further combines
the two modalities with selective feature augmentation. Extensive experiments
on the UCF-101, HMDB-51 and Kinetics-400 benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of MEACI-Net.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的方法，利用InternImage骨干网络特征，结合K-Means聚类和置信度阈值来检测语义分割中的未知物体，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义分割中的未知物体检测对自动驾驶等安全关键应用至关重要。虽然大型视觉基础模型在封闭集语义任务中表现出色，但其在检测分布外区域的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用InternImage骨干网络提取特征，应用K-Means聚类并结合解码器原始logits的置信度阈值来识别分布外聚类，整个过程无需训练。

Result: 在RoadAnomaly基准测试上达到50.02平均精度，在ADE-OoD基准测试上达到48.77平均精度，超越了多个有监督和无监督基线方法。

Conclusion: 结果表明这是一种有前景的通用分布外分割方法，需要最少的假设或额外数据。

Abstract: Detecting unknown objects in semantic segmentation is crucial for
safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Large vision
foundation models, includ- ing DINOv2, InternImage, and CLIP, have advanced
visual representation learn- ing by providing rich features that generalize
well across diverse tasks. While their strength in closed-set semantic tasks is
established, their capability to detect out- of-distribution (OoD) regions in
semantic segmentation remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate
whether foundation models fine-tuned on segmen- tation datasets can inherently
distinguish in-distribution (ID) from OoD regions without any outlier
supervision. We propose a simple, training-free approach that utilizes features
from the InternImage backbone and applies K-Means clustering alongside
confidence thresholding on raw decoder logits to identify OoD clusters. Our
method achieves 50.02 Average Precision on the RoadAnomaly benchmark and 48.77
on the benchmark of ADE-OoD with InternImage-L, surpassing several supervised
and unsupervised baselines. These results suggest a promising direc- tion for
generic OoD segmentation methods that require minimal assumptions or additional
data.

*Xin Zou,Di Lu,Yizhou Wang,Yibo Yan,Yuanhuiyi Lyu,Xu Zheng,Linfeng Zhang,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HoloV是一个简单有效的视觉token剪枝框架，通过从整体视角重新思考token保留策略，在不同空间区域自适应分配剪枝预算，解决了现有基于注意力的剪枝方法在高剪枝率下性能显著下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型依赖大量视觉token导致计算开销巨大，现有基于注意力的剪枝方法倾向于保留语义相似的token，在高剪枝率下性能下降明显。

Method: 提出HoloV框架，从整体视角重新思考token保留，通过在不同空间区域自适应分配剪枝预算，确保保留的token能捕捉全局视觉上下文而非孤立显著特征。

Result: 实验结果表明HoloV在各种任务、MLLM架构和剪枝率下均优于SOTA方法。例如，LLaVA1.5配备HoloV在剪枝88.9%视觉token后仍保持95.8%的原始性能。

Conclusion: HoloV通过整体视角的token剪枝策略，有效解决了高剪枝率下的性能下降问题，实现了优越的效率-精度权衡。

Abstract: Despite their powerful capabilities, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
suffer from considerable computational overhead due to their reliance on
massive visual tokens. Recent studies have explored token pruning to alleviate
this problem, which typically uses text-vision cross-attention or
[\texttt{CLS}] attention to assess and discard redundant visual tokens. In this
work, we identify a critical limitation of such attention-first pruning
approaches, i.e., they tend to preserve semantically similar tokens, resulting
in pronounced performance drops under high pruning ratios. To this end, we
propose {HoloV}, a simple yet effective, plug-and-play visual token pruning
framework for efficient inference. Distinct from previous attention-first
schemes, HoloV rethinks token retention from a holistic perspective. By
adaptively distributing the pruning budget across different spatial crops,
HoloV ensures that the retained tokens capture the global visual context rather
than isolated salient features. This strategy minimizes representational
collapse and maintains task-relevant information even under aggressive pruning.
Experimental results demonstrate that our HoloV achieves superior performance
across various tasks, MLLM architectures, and pruning ratios compared to SOTA
methods. For instance, LLaVA1.5 equipped with HoloV preserves 95.8\% of the
original performance after pruning 88.9\% of visual tokens, achieving superior
efficiency-accuracy trade-offs.

### [32] [Zero-Shot Robustness of Vision Language Models Via Confidence-Aware Weighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02913)
*Nikoo Naghavian,Mostafa Tavassolipour*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Confidence-Aware Weighting (CAW)方法增强视觉语言模型的零样本鲁棒性，包含置信度感知损失和特征对齐正则化，在保持泛化能力的同时提升干净和对抗样本的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型如CLIP在零样本泛化方面表现出色，但对对抗攻击高度脆弱，需要提升其鲁棒性。

Method: CAW包含两个组件：(1) 置信度感知损失，通过缩放干净和对抗预测之间的KL散度来优先处理不确定的对抗样本；(2) 特征对齐正则化，通过最小化冻结和微调图像编码器在对抗输入上的特征距离来保持语义一致性。

Result: 在TinyImageNet和14个额外数据集上的广泛实验表明，CAW在AutoAttack等强攻击下优于PMG-AFT和TGA-ZSR等最新方法，同时使用更少内存。

Conclusion: CAW方法有效提升了视觉语言模型的零样本鲁棒性，在保持泛化能力的同时显著改善了对抗攻击下的性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models like CLIP demonstrate impressive zero-shot
generalization but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this
work, we propose Confidence-Aware Weighting (CAW) to enhance zero-shot
robustness in vision-language models. CAW consists of two components: (1) a
Confidence-Aware loss that prioritizes uncertain adversarial examples by
scaling the KL divergence between clean and adversarial predictions, and (2) a
feature alignment regularization that preserves semantic consistency by
minimizing the distance between frozen and fine-tuned image encoder features on
adversarial inputs. These components work jointly to improve both clean and
robust accuracy without sacrificing generalization. Extensive experiments on
TinyImageNet and 14 additional datasets show that CAW outperforms recent
methods such as PMG-AFT and TGA-ZSR under strong attacks like AutoAttack, while
using less memory.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大型视觉语言模型在整合超声成像与临床数据用于颈动脉粥样硬化风险评估的潜力，发现现有模型在风险分类方面表现不佳，但通过领域适应和多模态数据整合可显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 颈动脉粥样硬化疾病的风险评估需要整合多样化的临床和影像信息，且需要透明可解释的方法供临床医生使用，但目前仍面临挑战。

Method: 提出模拟真实诊断场景的访谈式问题框架，比较多种开源LVLMs，使用低秩适应( LoRA)将LLaVa-NeXT-Vicuna模型适配到超声领域，并整合多模态表格数据。

Result: 零样本实验显示大多数LVLMs无法准确识别成像模式和解剖结构，风险分类表现差。领域适应后卒中风险分层显著改善，整合多模态数据进一步提高了特异性和平衡准确率，性能可与先前CNN基线相媲美。

Conclusion: LVLMs在基于超声的心血管风险预测中既有潜力也有局限，强调了多模态整合、模型校准和领域适应对于临床转化的重要性。

Abstract: Reliable risk assessment for carotid atheromatous disease remains a major
clinical challenge, as it requires integrating diverse clinical and imaging
information in a manner that is transparent and interpretable to clinicians.
This study investigates the potential of state-of-the-art and recent large
vision-language models (LVLMs) for multimodal carotid plaque assessment by
integrating ultrasound imaging (USI) with structured clinical, demographic,
laboratory, and protein biomarker data. A framework that simulates realistic
diagnostic scenarios through interview-style question sequences is proposed,
comparing a range of open-source LVLMs, including both general-purpose and
medically tuned models. Zero-shot experiments reveal that even if they are very
powerful, not all LVLMs can accurately identify imaging modality and anatomy,
while all of them perform poorly in accurate risk classification. To address
this limitation, LLaVa-NeXT-Vicuna is adapted to the ultrasound domain using
low-rank adaptation (LoRA), resulting in substantial improvements in stroke
risk stratification. The integration of multimodal tabular data in the form of
text further enhances specificity and balanced accuracy, yielding competitive
performance compared to prior convolutional neural network (CNN) baselines
trained on the same dataset. Our findings highlight both the promise and
limitations of LVLMs in ultrasound-based cardiovascular risk prediction,
underscoring the importance of multimodal integration, model calibration, and
domain adaptation for clinical translation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多期相增强MRI合成方法使用深度自编码器生成器，参数效率低且缺乏可解释的训练策略，需要改进特征分离能力。

Method: 使用变分自编码器将输入和目标图像编码为关于标准正态分布对称的两个潜在分布，采用Y形双向训练策略增强特征分离的可解释性。

Result: 相比现有深度自编码器端到端合成方法，FDA-VAE显著减少模型参数和推理时间，同时有效提升合成质量。

Conclusion: FDA-VAE是一种高效的多期相增强MRI合成方法，通过特征解耦和对称分布编码实现了参数效率和合成质量的平衡。

Abstract: Separating shared and independent features is crucial for multi-phase
contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI synthesis. However, existing methods use deep
autoencoder generators with low parameter efficiency and lack interpretable
training strategies. In this paper, we propose Flip Distribution Alignment
Variational Autoencoder (FDA-VAE), a lightweight feature-decoupled VAE model
for multi-phase CE MRI synthesis. Our method encodes input and target images
into two latent distributions that are symmetric concerning a standard normal
distribution, effectively separating shared and independent features. The
Y-shaped bidirectional training strategy further enhances the interpretability
of feature separation. Experimental results show that compared to existing deep
autoencoder-based end-to-end synthesis methods, FDA-VAE significantly reduces
model parameters and inference time while effectively improving synthesis
quality. The source code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了LPG-Bench基准和TIT评估方法，用于评估长提示文本到图像生成的质量，解决了现有模型对长提示理解不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在处理长而详细的提示时表现不佳，生成结果不一致，缺乏专门的评估基准和方法。

Method: 构建包含200个平均长度超过250词提示的LPG-Bench基准，提出基于文本-图像-文本一致性的TIT评估框架，包括TIT-Score和TIT-Score-LLM两种实现方式。

Result: TIT方法在人类偏好对齐方面显著优于现有评估指标，TIT-Score-LLM在成对准确率上比最强基线提升7.31%。

Conclusion: LPG-Bench和TIT方法为评估和促进文本到图像模型发展提供了新的视角和工具。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large multimodal models (LMMs), recent
text-to-image (T2I) models can generate high-quality images and demonstrate
great alignment to short prompts. However, they still struggle to effectively
understand and follow long and detailed prompts, displaying inconsistent
generation. To address this challenge, we introduce LPG-Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating long-prompt-based text-to-image generation. LPG-Bench
features 200 meticulously crafted prompts with an average length of over 250
words, approaching the input capacity of several leading commercial models.
Using these prompts, we generate 2,600 images from 13 state-of-the-art models
and further perform comprehensive human-ranked annotations. Based on LPG-Bench,
we observe that state-of-the-art T2I alignment evaluation metrics exhibit poor
consistency with human preferences on long-prompt-based image generation. To
address the gap, we introduce a novel zero-shot metric based on
text-to-image-to-text consistency, termed TIT, for evaluating
long-prompt-generated images. The core concept of TIT is to quantify T2I
alignment by directly comparing the consistency between the raw prompt and the
LMM-produced description on the generated image, which includes an efficient
score-based instantiation TIT-Score and a large-language-model (LLM) based
instantiation TIT-Score-LLM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves superior alignment with human judgment compared to
CLIP-score, LMM-score, etc., with TIT-Score-LLM attaining a 7.31% absolute
improvement in pairwise accuracy over the strongest baseline. LPG-Bench and TIT
methods together offer a deeper perspective to benchmark and foster the
development of T2I models. All resources will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出了3DEditVerse数据集和3DEditFormer模型，通过大规模配对数据和结构保持的Transformer架构，实现了无需3D掩码的高质量3D编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D编辑中跨视图一致性、结构保真度和细粒度控制性的挑战，克服现有方法速度慢、几何失真和依赖手动3D掩码的问题。

Method: 构建3DEditVerse数据集（116,309个训练对和1,500个测试对），提出3DEditFormer模型，采用双引导注意力和时间自适应门控机制，在图像到3D生成中解耦可编辑区域和保留结构。

Result: 在广泛实验中，该框架在定量和定性评估上都优于现有最先进基线，为实用和可扩展的3D编辑设立了新标准。

Conclusion: 通过数据和模型的双重创新，实现了无需辅助3D掩码的精确一致3D编辑，推动了3D编辑技术的实用化发展。

Abstract: 3D editing - the task of locally modifying the geometry or appearance of a 3D
asset - has wide applications in immersive content creation, digital
entertainment, and AR/VR. However, unlike 2D editing, it remains challenging
due to the need for cross-view consistency, structural fidelity, and
fine-grained controllability. Existing approaches are often slow, prone to
geometric distortions, or dependent on manual and accurate 3D masks that are
error-prone and impractical. To address these challenges, we advance both the
data and model fronts. On the data side, we introduce 3DEditVerse, the largest
paired 3D editing benchmark to date, comprising 116,309 high-quality training
pairs and 1,500 curated test pairs. Built through complementary pipelines of
pose-driven geometric edits and foundation model-guided appearance edits,
3DEditVerse ensures edit locality, multi-view consistency, and semantic
alignment. On the model side, we propose 3DEditFormer, a
3D-structure-preserving conditional transformer. By enhancing image-to-3D
generation with dual-guidance attention and time-adaptive gating, 3DEditFormer
disentangles editable regions from preserved structure, enabling precise and
consistent edits without requiring auxiliary 3D masks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines both
quantitatively and qualitatively, establishing a new standard for practical and
scalable 3D editing. Dataset and code will be released. Project:

TL;DR: 提出了一种云层注入算法模拟真实云覆盖，并开发了轻量级NDI注入方法增强深度学习模型在云覆盖条件下的土地覆盖语义分割性能，结合Sentinel-1雷达数据显著提升了分割准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Sentinel-2数据集多为无云图像，在热带云层常见地区实用性有限，需要解决云遮挡问题；同时深度学习编码器下采样过程中会丢失空间和光谱细节。

Method: 开发云层注入算法模拟真实云覆盖；提出轻量级NDI注入方法，将归一化差异指数注入最终解码层以保留关键空间特征；结合Sentinel-1雷达数据与光学数据进行融合。

Result: NDI注入在无云图像上使U-Net性能提升1.99%，DeepLabV3提升2.78%；在云覆盖条件下，结合Sentinel-1数据相比仅使用光学数据在所有模型上均获得显著性能提升。

Conclusion: NDI注入方法能有效保留空间特征且计算开销小；雷达-光学数据融合在挑战性大气条件下具有显著优势，为热带地区土地覆盖分割提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Supervised deep learning for land cover semantic segmentation (LCS) relies on
labeled satellite data. However, most existing Sentinel-2 datasets are
cloud-free, which limits their usefulness in tropical regions where clouds are
common. To properly evaluate the extent of this problem, we developed a cloud
injection algorithm that simulates realistic cloud cover, allowing us to test
how Sentinel-1 radar data can fill in the gaps caused by cloud-obstructed
optical imagery. We also tackle the issue of losing spatial and/or spectral
details during encoder downsampling in deep networks. To mitigate this loss, we
propose a lightweight method that injects Normalized Difference Indices (NDIs)
into the final decoding layers, enabling the model to retain key spatial
features with minimal additional computation. Injecting NDIs enhanced land
cover segmentation performance on the DFC2020 dataset, yielding improvements of
1.99% for U-Net and 2.78% for DeepLabV3 on cloud-free imagery. Under
cloud-covered conditions, incorporating Sentinel-1 data led to significant
performance gains across all models compared to using optical data alone,
highlighting the effectiveness of radar-optical fusion in challenging
atmospheric scenarios.

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (RealSR) aims to enhance the visual quality
of in-the-wild images, such as those captured by mobile phones. While existing
methods leveraging large generative models demonstrate impressive results, the
high computational cost and latency make them impractical for edge deployment.
In this paper, we introduce PocketSR, an ultra-lightweight, single-step model
that brings generative modeling capabilities to RealSR while maintaining high
fidelity. To achieve this, we design LiteED, a highly efficient alternative to
the original computationally intensive VAE in SD, reducing parameters by 97.5%
while preserving high-quality encoding and decoding. Additionally, we propose
online annealing pruning for the U-Net, which progressively shifts generative
priors from heavy modules to lightweight counterparts, ensuring effective
knowledge transfer and further optimizing efficiency. To mitigate the loss of
prior knowledge during pruning, we incorporate a multi-layer feature
distillation loss. Through an in-depth analysis of each design component, we
provide valuable insights for future research. PocketSR, with a model size of
146M parameters, processes 4K images in just 0.8 seconds, achieving a
remarkable speedup over previous methods. Notably, it delivers performance on
par with state-of-the-art single-step and even multi-step RealSR models, making
it a highly practical solution for edge-device applications.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation has surged in response to challenging
questions, especially when a long video must depict multiple sequential events
with temporal coherence and controllable content. Existing methods that extend
to multi-event generation omit an inspection of the intrinsic factor in event
shifting. The paper aims to answer the central question: When and where
multi-event prompts control event transition during T2V generation. This work
introduces MEve, a self-curated prompt suite for evaluating multi-event
text-to-video (T2V) generation, and conducts a systematic study of two
representative model families, i.e., OpenSora and CogVideoX. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the importance of early intervention in denoising steps
and block-wise model layers, revealing the essential factor for multi-event
video generation and highlighting the possibilities for multi-event
conditioning in future models.

Conclusion: 研究表明，高效架构结合针对性的不平衡处理策略，能够提供实用、透明且可复现的面部表情识别解决方案。

Abstract: Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is a key task in affective computing,
enabling applications in human-computer interaction, e-learning, healthcare,
and safety systems. Despite advances in deep learning, FER remains challenging
due to occlusions, illumination and pose variations, subtle intra-class
differences, and dataset imbalance that hinders recognition of minority
emotions. We present InsideOut, a reproducible FER framework built on
EfficientNetV2-S with transfer learning, strong data augmentation, and
imbalance-aware optimization. The approach standardizes FER2013 images, applies
stratified splitting and augmentation, and fine-tunes a lightweight
classification head with class-weighted loss to address skewed distributions.
InsideOut achieves 62.8% accuracy with a macro averaged F1 of 0.590 on FER2013,
showing competitive results compared to conventional CNN baselines. The novelty
lies in demonstrating that efficient architectures, combined with tailored
imbalance handling, can provide practical, transparent, and reproducible FER
solutions.

Abstract: Compositional generalization, the ability to generate novel combinations of
known concepts, is a key ingredient for visual generative models. Yet, not all
mechanisms that enable or inhibit it are fully understood. In this work, we
conduct a systematic study of how various design choices influence
compositional generalization in image and video generation in a positive or
negative way. Through controlled experiments, we identify two key factors: (i)
whether the training objective operates on a discrete or continuous
distribution, and (ii) to what extent conditioning provides information about
the constituent concepts during training. Building on these insights, we show
that relaxing the MaskGIT discrete loss with an auxiliary continuous JEPA-based
objective can improve compositional performance in discrete models like
MaskGIT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型潜在空间的图像扰动方法，通过改变去噪轨迹的起点来生成难以被下游生成模型反演和个性化的"不可学习"图像，在保持高视觉保真度的同时有效保护数据隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着文本到图像扩散模型在个性化应用中的有效性提升，引发了数据隐私、知识产权保护和未经授权使用的担忧。现有基于像素空间的图像中毒方法存在噪声和伪影问题，需要更隐蔽的防御方法。

Method: 在扩散模型的潜在空间中操作，交替进行去噪和反演过程，同时修改去噪轨迹的起点。这种轨迹偏移采样方法将不可学习性整合到潜在扩散模型框架中。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在感知指标（PSNR、SSIM、FID）上提升了约8%-10%，在五种对抗设置下平均鲁棒性提升了约10%，能有效抵御最先进的反演攻击。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种实用且难以察觉的防御机制，能够有效保护敏感数据免受未经授权的模型适应，在视觉保真度和防御效果之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in
rapid and high-fidelity personalization, even when provided with only a few
user images. However, the effectiveness of personalization techniques has lead
to concerns regarding data privacy, intellectual property protection, and
unauthorized usage. To mitigate such unauthorized usage and model replication,
the idea of generating ``unlearnable'' training samples utilizing image
poisoning techniques has emerged. Existing methods for this have limited
imperceptibility as they operate in the pixel space which results in images
with noise and artifacts. In this work, we propose a novel model-based
perturbation strategy that operates within the latent space of diffusion
models. Our method alternates between denoising and inversion while modifying
the starting point of the denoising trajectory: of diffusion models. This
trajectory-shifted sampling ensures that the perturbed images maintain high
visual fidelity to the original inputs while being resistant to inversion and
personalization by downstream generative models. This approach integrates
unlearnability into the framework of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), enabling a
practical and imperceptible defense against unauthorized model adaptation. We
validate our approach on four benchmark datasets to demonstrate robustness
against state-of-the-art inversion attacks. Results demonstrate that our method
achieves significant improvements in imperceptibility ($\sim 8 \% -10\%$ on
perceptual metrics including PSNR, SSIM, and FID) and robustness ( $\sim 10\%$
on average across five adversarial settings), highlighting its effectiveness in
safeguarding sensitive data.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在辐射场语义蒸馏中几何基础特征与纯视觉特征的效果对比，发现几何基础特征包含更多几何细节但会降低姿态估计精度，而纯视觉特征在下游任务中更具通用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在辐射场语义蒸馏中，几何基础语义特征是否比纯视觉特征更具优势，特别是在空间任务如姿态估计中的表现。

Method: 提出SPINE框架用于无初始猜测的辐射场反演，包含基于蒸馏语义的粗反演和基于光度优化的精细反演两个核心组件。

Result: 几何基础特征包含更精细的结构细节，但在语义目标定位任务中无显著差异，且会降低姿态估计精度；纯视觉特征在下游任务中更具通用性。

Conclusion: 纯视觉特征在更广泛的下游任务中具有更好的通用性，未来需要研究更有效的几何基础策略来增强预训练语义特征的多功能性和性能。

Abstract: Semantic distillation in radiance fields has spurred significant advances in
open-vocabulary robot policies, e.g., in manipulation and navigation, founded
on pretrained semantics from large vision models. While prior work has
demonstrated the effectiveness of visual-only semantic features (e.g., DINO and
CLIP) in Gaussian Splatting and neural radiance fields, the potential benefit
of geometry-grounding in distilled fields remains an open question. In
principle, visual-geometry features seem very promising for spatial tasks such
as pose estimation, prompting the question: Do geometry-grounded semantic
features offer an edge in distilled fields? Specifically, we ask three critical
questions: First, does spatial-grounding produce higher-fidelity geometry-aware
semantic features? We find that image features from geometry-grounded backbones
contain finer structural details compared to their counterparts. Secondly, does
geometry-grounding improve semantic object localization? We observe no
significant difference in this task. Thirdly, does geometry-grounding enable
higher-accuracy radiance field inversion? Given the limitations of prior work
and their lack of semantics integration, we propose a novel framework SPINE for
inverting radiance fields without an initial guess, consisting of two core
components: coarse inversion using distilled semantics, and fine inversion
using photometric-based optimization. Surprisingly, we find that the pose
estimation accuracy decreases with geometry-grounded features. Our results
suggest that visual-only features offer greater versatility for a broader range
of downstream tasks, although geometry-grounded features contain more geometric
detail. Notably, our findings underscore the necessity of future research on
effective strategies for geometry-grounding that augment the versatility and
performance of pretrained semantic features.

*Beibei Lin,Tingting Chen,Robby T. Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoComplete是一个新颖的参考驱动图像补全框架，通过整合显式3D结构引导来增强几何一致性，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成方法仅依赖扩散先验，缺乏几何线索（如相机姿态或深度），在目标视图与参考图像差异较大时经常产生不对齐或不合理的内容。

Method: 采用双分支扩散架构：一个分支从掩码目标合成缺失区域，另一个分支从投影点云提取几何特征；通过联合自注意力确保连贯性；引入目标感知掩码来引导模型关注相关参考线索。

Result: 实验显示GeoComplete在PSNR指标上比最先进方法提升了17.1，显著提高了几何准确性同时保持高视觉质量。

Conclusion: 通过整合几何感知的双分支扩散架构和目标感知掩码策略，GeoComplete为几何条件图像补全提供了统一且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Reference-driven image completion, which restores missing regions in a target
view using additional images, is particularly challenging when the target view
differs significantly from the references. Existing generative methods rely
solely on diffusion priors and, without geometric cues such as camera pose or
depth, often produce misaligned or implausible content. We propose GeoComplete,
a novel framework that incorporates explicit 3D structural guidance to enforce
geometric consistency in the completed regions, setting it apart from prior
image-only approaches. GeoComplete introduces two key ideas: conditioning the
diffusion process on projected point clouds to infuse geometric information,
and applying target-aware masking to guide the model toward relevant reference
cues. The framework features a dual-branch diffusion architecture. One branch
synthesizes the missing regions from the masked target, while the other
extracts geometric features from the projected point cloud. Joint
self-attention across branches ensures coherent and accurate completion. To
address regions visible in references but absent in the target, we project the
target view into each reference to detect occluded areas, which are then masked
during training. This target-aware masking directs the model to focus on useful
cues, enhancing performance in difficult scenarios. By integrating a
geometry-aware dual-branch diffusion architecture with a target-aware masking
strategy, GeoComplete offers a unified and robust solution for
geometry-conditioned image completion. Experiments show that GeoComplete
achieves a 17.1 PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods, significantly
boosting geometric accuracy while maintaining high visual quality.

Motivation: 解决文本到有声视频生成中的两个关键挑战：单一共享文本标题造成的模态干扰，以及跨模态特征交互机制不明确的问题。

Method: 提出分层视觉基础字幕框架生成解耦的视频和音频字幕，并设计BridgeDiT双塔扩散变换器，采用双向交叉注意力机制实现语义和时间同步。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在大多数指标上达到了最先进水平，人类评估也证实了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了模态干扰问题，提供了稳健的跨模态交互机制，为未来文本到有声视频任务提供了重要见解。

Abstract: This study focuses on a challenging yet promising task,
Text-to-Sounding-Video (T2SV) generation, which aims to generate a video with
synchronized audio from text conditions, meanwhile ensuring both modalities are
aligned with text. Despite progress in joint audio-video training, two critical
challenges still remain unaddressed: (1) a single, shared text caption where
the text for video is equal to the text for audio often creates modal
interference, confusing the pretrained backbones, and (2) the optimal mechanism
for cross-modal feature interaction remains unclear. To address these
challenges, we first propose the Hierarchical Visual-Grounded Captioning (HVGC)
framework that generates pairs of disentangled captions, a video caption, and
an audio caption, eliminating interference at the conditioning stage. Based on
HVGC, we further introduce BridgeDiT, a novel dual-tower diffusion transformer,
which employs a Dual CrossAttention (DCA) mechanism that acts as a robust
``bridge" to enable a symmetric, bidirectional exchange of information,
achieving both semantic and temporal synchronization. Extensive experiments on
three benchmark datasets, supported by human evaluations, demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art results on most metrics. Comprehensive
ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our contributions,
offering key insights for the future T2SV task. All the codes and checkpoints
will be publicly released.

TL;DR: HAVIR模型通过分离视觉皮层的两个层次区域提取不同特征，结合结构生成器和语义提取器，使用Versatile Diffusion模型合成图像，在复杂场景中提升重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在恢复复杂视觉刺激时面临挑战，自然场景的低级特征具有异质性，高级特征存在语义纠缠。受视觉皮层层次表示理论启发，需要分离处理不同层次的特征。

Method: 将视觉皮层分为两个层次区域：结构生成器从空间处理体素提取结构信息并转换为潜在扩散先验，语义提取器将语义处理体素转换为CLIP嵌入，通过Versatile Diffusion模型集成合成最终图像。

Result: 实验结果表明HAVIR在复杂场景中提升了重建的结构和语义质量，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: HAVIR模型通过层次化分离视觉皮层特征提取，有效解决了复杂视觉刺激重建的挑战，在结构和语义质量上均有显著提升。

Abstract: The reconstruction of visual information from brain activity fosters
interdisciplinary integration between neuroscience and computer vision.
However, existing methods still face challenges in accurately recovering highly
complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from the characteristics of
natural scenes: low-level features exhibit heterogeneity, while high-level
features show semantic entanglement due to contextual overlaps. Inspired by the
hierarchical representation theory of the visual cortex, we propose the HAVIR
model, which separates the visual cortex into two hierarchical regions and
extracts distinct features from each. Specifically, the Structural Generator
extracts structural information from spatial processing voxels and converts it
into latent diffusion priors, while the Semantic Extractor converts semantic
processing voxels into CLIP embeddings. These components are integrated via the
Versatile Diffusion model to synthesize the final image. Experimental results
demonstrate that HAVIR enhances both the structural and semantic quality of
reconstructions, even in complex scenes, and outperforms existing models.

TL;DR: Mask2IV是一个用于交互中心视频生成的两阶段框架，无需密集掩码输入，通过预测动作轨迹来生成人类或机器人交互视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以建模复杂的动态交互，而获取精确掩码标注在现实应用中具有挑战性。

Method: 采用解耦的两阶段流程：先预测执行者和物体的运动轨迹，再基于轨迹生成视频。支持通过动作描述或空间位置线索来引导运动轨迹。

Result: 在涵盖人类-物体交互和机器人操作场景的两个基准测试中，该方法在视觉真实性和可控性方面优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: Mask2IV框架在无需密集掩码输入的情况下，实现了高质量的交互中心视频生成，为具身智能提供了丰富的视觉先验。

Abstract: Generating interaction-centric videos, such as those depicting humans or
robots interacting with objects, is crucial for embodied intelligence, as they
provide rich and diverse visual priors for robot learning, manipulation policy
training, and affordance reasoning. However, existing methods often struggle to
model such complex and dynamic interactions. While recent studies show that
masks can serve as effective control signals and enhance generation quality,
obtaining dense and precise mask annotations remains a major challenge for
real-world use. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Mask2IV, a novel
framework specifically designed for interaction-centric video generation. It
adopts a decoupled two-stage pipeline that first predicts plausible motion
trajectories for both actor and object, then generates a video conditioned on
these trajectories. This design eliminates the need for dense mask inputs from
users while preserving the flexibility to manipulate the interaction process.
Furthermore, Mask2IV supports versatile and intuitive control, allowing users
to specify the target object of interaction and guide the motion trajectory
through action descriptions or spatial position cues. To support systematic
training and evaluation, we curate two benchmarks covering diverse action and
object categories across both human-object interaction and robotic manipulation
scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior
visual realism and controllability compared to existing baselines.

Abstract: Accurately modeling human mobility is critical for urban planning,
epidemiology, and traffic management. In this work, we introduce Markovian Reeb
Graphs, a novel framework for simulating spatiotemporal trajectories that
preserve Patterns of Life (PoLs) learned from baseline data. By combining
individual- and population-level mobility structures within a probabilistic
topological model, our approach generates realistic future trajectories that
capture both consistency and variability in daily life. Evaluations on the
Urban Anomalies dataset (Atlanta and Berlin subsets) using the Jensen-Shannon
Divergence (JSD) across population- and agent-level metrics demonstrate that
the proposed method achieves strong fidelity while remaining data- and
compute-efficient. These results position Markovian Reeb Graphs as a scalable
framework for trajectory simulation with broad applicability across diverse
urban environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脊柱疾病影响全球6.19亿人，是导致残疾的主要原因，但AI辅助诊断因缺乏椎体级别感知的多模态数据集而受限。临床决策需要跨X光、CT和MRI在特定椎体级别进行复杂推理。

Method: 采用临床医生参与的两阶段LLM生成方法（草稿和修订），从教科书、指南、开放数据集和约1000个医院病例中整理数据。构建SpineBench评估框架，在椎体识别、病理评估和手术规划等临床关键维度上评估模型。

Conclusion: SpineMed生态系统通过提供高质量、可追溯的数据和临床基础的评估框架，显著提升了脊柱疾病AI诊断的能力，特别是在椎体级别的细粒度推理方面。

Abstract: Spine disorders affect 619 million people globally and are a leading cause of
disability, yet AI-assisted diagnosis remains limited by the lack of
level-aware, multimodal datasets. Clinical decision-making for spine disorders
requires sophisticated reasoning across X-ray, CT, and MRI at specific
vertebral levels. However, progress has been constrained by the absence of
traceable, clinically-grounded instruction data and standardized,
spine-specific benchmarks. To address this, we introduce SpineMed, an ecosystem
co-designed with practicing spine surgeons. It features SpineMed-450k, the
first large-scale dataset explicitly designed for vertebral-level reasoning
across imaging modalities with over 450,000 instruction instances, and
SpineBench, a clinically-grounded evaluation framework. SpineMed-450k is
curated from diverse sources, including textbooks, guidelines, open datasets,
and ~1,000 de-identified hospital cases, using a clinician-in-the-loop pipeline
with a two-stage LLM generation method (draft and revision) to ensure
high-quality, traceable data for question-answering, multi-turn consultations,
and report generation. SpineBench evaluates models on clinically salient axes,
including level identification, pathology assessment, and surgical planning.
Our comprehensive evaluation of several recently advanced large vision-language
models (LVLMs) on SpineBench reveals systematic weaknesses in fine-grained,
level-specific reasoning. In contrast, our model fine-tuned on SpineMed-450k
demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across all tasks.
Clinician assessments confirm the diagnostic clarity and practical utility of
our model's outputs.

Conclusion: UniShield通过多智能体统一框架有效解决了图像伪造检测中的跨域泛化和自适应问题，为维护信息完整性和社会安全提供了有力工具。

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in image generation, synthetic images have become
increasingly realistic, posing significant societal risks, such as
misinformation and fraud. Forgery Image Detection and Localization (FIDL) thus
emerges as essential for maintaining information integrity and societal
security. Despite impressive performances by existing domain-specific detection
methods, their practical applicability remains limited, primarily due to their
narrow specialization, poor cross-domain generalization, and the absence of an
integrated adaptive framework. To address these issues, we propose UniShield,
the novel multi-agent-based unified system capable of detecting and localizing
image forgeries across diverse domains, including image manipulation, document
manipulation, DeepFake, and AI-generated images. UniShield innovatively
integrates a perception agent with a detection agent. The perception agent
intelligently analyzes image features to dynamically select suitable detection
models, while the detection agent consolidates various expert detectors into a
unified framework and generates interpretable reports. Extensive experiments
show that UniShield achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing both existing
unified approaches and domain-specific detectors, highlighting its superior
practicality, adaptiveness, and scalability.

Abstract: Product quantisation (PQ) is a classical method for scalable vector encoding,
yet it has seen limited usage for latent representations in high-fidelity image
generation. In this work, we introduce PQGAN, a quantised image autoencoder
that integrates PQ into the well-known vector quantisation (VQ) framework of
VQGAN. PQGAN achieves a noticeable improvement over state-of-the-art methods in
terms of reconstruction performance, including both quantisation methods and
their continuous counterparts. We achieve a PSNR score of 37dB, where prior
work achieves 27dB, and are able to reduce the FID, LPIPS, and CMMD score by up
to 96%. Our key to success is a thorough analysis of the interaction between
codebook size, embedding dimensionality, and subspace factorisation, with
vector and scalar quantisation as special cases. We obtain novel findings, such
that the performance of VQ and PQ behaves in opposite ways when scaling the
embedding dimension. Furthermore, our analysis shows performance trends for PQ
that help guide optimal hyperparameter selection. Finally, we demonstrate that
PQGAN can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained diffusion models. This
enables either a significantly faster and more compute-efficient generation, or
a doubling of the output resolution at no additional cost, positioning PQ as a
strong extension for discrete latent representation in image synthesis.

Motivation: 自回归视频扩散模型在模拟游戏玩法时需要同时生成自然的新场景内容并保持已探索区域的空间一致性，但在有限计算预算下面临时间记忆缺乏长期空间一致性、空间记忆可能过度依赖而降低新场景生成质量的问题。

Method: 结合几何索引空间记忆，采用混合训练策略（区分探索和重访模式）、链式前向训练（通过模型滚动创建更大姿态变化）、点对帧检索（高效检索历史）和增量3D重建（维护显式3D缓存）。

Result: 实验证明Memory Forcing在多样化环境中实现了优越的长期空间一致性和生成质量，同时在扩展序列中保持计算效率。

Conclusion: Memory Forcing框架有效平衡了空间一致性和生成质量，为视频扩散模型的世界建模和交互场景生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models have proved effective for world
modeling and interactive scene generation, with Minecraft gameplay as a
representative application. To faithfully simulate play, a model must generate
natural content while exploring new scenes and preserve spatial consistency
when revisiting explored areas. Under limited computation budgets, it must
compress and exploit historical cues within a finite context window, which
exposes a trade-off: Temporal-only memory lacks long-term spatial consistency,
whereas adding spatial memory strengthens consistency but may degrade new scene
generation quality when the model over-relies on insufficient spatial context.
We present Memory Forcing, a learning framework that pairs training protocols
with a geometry-indexed spatial memory. Hybrid Training exposes distinct
gameplay regimes, guiding the model to rely on temporal memory during
exploration and incorporate spatial memory for revisits. Chained Forward
Training extends autoregressive training with model rollouts, where chained
predictions create larger pose variations and encourage reliance on spatial
memory for maintaining consistency. Point-to-Frame Retrieval efficiently
retrieves history by mapping currently visible points to their source frames,
while Incremental 3D Reconstruction maintains and updates an explicit 3D cache.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Memory Forcing achieves superior
long-term spatial consistency and generative quality across diverse
environments, while maintaining computational efficiency for extended
sequences.

Conclusion: MonSTeR展示了其在零样本场景内物体放置和运动字幕生成等任务中的多功能性，为运动-场景-文本对齐分析提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Intention drives human movement in complex environments, but such movement
can only happen if the surrounding context supports it. Despite the intuitive
nature of this mechanism, existing research has not yet provided tools to
evaluate the alignment between skeletal movement (motion), intention (text),
and the surrounding context (scene). In this work, we introduce MonSTeR, the
first MOtioN-Scene-TExt Retrieval model. Inspired by the modeling of
higher-order relations, MonSTeR constructs a unified latent space by leveraging
unimodal and cross-modal representations. This allows MonSTeR to capture the
intricate dependencies between modalities, enabling flexible but robust
retrieval across various tasks. Our results show that MonSTeR outperforms
trimodal models that rely solely on unimodal representations. Furthermore, we
validate the alignment of our retrieval scores with human preferences through a
dedicated user study. We demonstrate the versatility of MonSTeR's latent space
on zero-shot in-Scene Object Placement and Motion Captioning. Code and
pre-trained models are available at github.com/colloroneluca/MonSTeR.

*Dong Lao,Yuxiang Zhang,Haniyeh Ehsani Oskouie,Yangchao Wu,Alex Wong,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于随机共振的测试时防御机制，通过引入小幅度平移扰动来对抗对抗性攻击，无需额外训练或特定攻击类型调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法依赖特征过滤或平滑处理，可能导致信息损失。本文旨在通过"以噪声对抗噪声"的策略，在保持信息完整性的同时增强模型鲁棒性。

Method: 对输入图像引入小幅平移扰动，对齐变换后的特征嵌入，然后聚合这些特征并映射回原始参考图像。该方法具有闭式解，可部署于不同网络架构。

Result: 在图像分类任务中恢复了68.1%的准确率损失，在立体匹配中恢复71.9%，在光流估计中恢复29.2%，在各种对抗攻击下均表现出色。

Conclusion: 该方法首次为密集预测任务建立了通用的测试时防御机制，具有训练无关、架构无关和攻击无关的优点，展现了出色的实用性和通用性。

Abstract: We propose a test-time defense mechanism against adversarial attacks:
imperceptible image perturbations that significantly alter the predictions of a
model. Unlike existing methods that rely on feature filtering or smoothing,
which can lead to information loss, we propose to "combat noise with noise" by
leveraging stochastic resonance to enhance robustness while minimizing
information loss. Our approach introduces small translational perturbations to
the input image, aligns the transformed feature embeddings, and aggregates them
before mapping back to the original reference image. This can be expressed in a
closed-form formula, which can be deployed on diverse existing network
architectures without introducing additional network modules or fine-tuning for
specific attack types. The resulting method is entirely training-free,
architecture-agnostic, and attack-agnostic. Empirical results show
state-of-the-art robustness on image classification and, for the first time,
establish a generic test-time defense for dense prediction tasks, including
stereo matching and optical flow, highlighting the method's versatility and
practicality. Specifically, relative to clean (unperturbed) performance, our
method recovers up to 68.1% of the accuracy loss on image classification, 71.9%
on stereo matching, and 29.2% on optical flow under various types of
adversarial attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的随机神经网络方法主要关注改进跨信息预测，但在整体网络架构方面没有显著进展。本文旨在通过新颖的架构设计来提升纹理表示学习效果。

Method: 使用超球面随机嵌入结合双分支学习模块，分别捕获通道内和通道间关系，并通过新制定的优化问题构建丰富的纹理表示。

Result: 实验结果显示该方法在多个具有不同特征和挑战的纯纹理基准测试中取得了有趣的结果。

Conclusion: Mixer方法在纹理表示学习方面表现出色，源代码将在发表后提供。

Abstract: Randomized neural networks for representation learning have consistently
achieved prominent results in texture recognition tasks, effectively combining
the advantages of both traditional techniques and learning-based approaches.
However, existing approaches have so far focused mainly on improving
cross-information prediction, without introducing significant advancements to
the overall randomized network architecture. In this paper, we propose Mixer, a
novel randomized neural network for texture representation learning. At its
core, the method leverages hyperspherical random embeddings coupled with a
dual-branch learning module to capture both intra- and inter-channel
relationships, further enhanced by a newly formulated optimization problem for
building rich texture representations. Experimental results have shown the
interesting results of the proposed approach across several pure texture
benchmarks, each with distinct characteristics and challenges. The source code
will be available upon publication.

*Suyuchen Wang,Tianyu Zhang,Ahmed Masry,Christopher Pal,Spandana Gella,Bang Liu,Perouz Taslakian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RULER tokens和I-MRoPE两种创新方法，解决GUI grounding任务中坐标映射在未见高分辨率显示时失效的问题，显著提升了定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在GUI grounding任务中面临核心瓶颈：可靠的补丁到像素映射在训练未见的高分辨率显示时失效。现有方法直接从视觉特征生成坐标文本标记，迫使模型隐式推断复杂的位置到像素映射，导致精度下降。

Method: 1. RULER tokens作为显式坐标标记，让模型像地图上的网格线一样参考位置并调整坐标，而不是从零生成；2. 交错MRoPE (I-MRoPE)通过确保宽度和高度维度平等表示来改进空间编码，解决标准位置方案的不对称性问题。

Result: 在ScreenSpot、ScreenSpot-V2和ScreenSpot-Pro数据集上的实验显示定位精度持续提升，在高分辨率界面上改进最大。

Conclusion: 通过提供显式空间指导而不是依赖隐式学习，该方法能够在不同分辨率和平台上实现更可靠的GUI自动化。

Abstract: GUI grounding, the task of mapping natural-language instructions to pixel
coordinates, is crucial for autonomous agents, yet remains difficult for
current VLMs. The core bottleneck is reliable patch-to-pixel mapping, which
breaks when extrapolating to high-resolution displays unseen during training.
Current approaches generate coordinates as text tokens directly from visual
features, forcing the model to infer complex position-to-pixel mappings
implicitly; as a result, accuracy degrades and failures proliferate on new
resolutions. We address this with two complementary innovations. First, RULER
tokens serve as explicit coordinate markers, letting the model reference
positions similar to gridlines on a map and adjust rather than generate
coordinates from scratch. Second, Interleaved MRoPE (I-MRoPE) improves spatial
encoding by ensuring that width and height dimensions are represented equally,
addressing the asymmetry of standard positional schemes. Experiments on
ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-V2, and ScreenSpot-Pro show consistent gains in
grounding accuracy, with the largest improvements on high-resolution
interfaces. By providing explicit spatial guidance rather than relying on
implicit learning, our approach enables more reliable GUI automation across
diverse resolutions and platforms.

TL;DR: LEAML是一个标签高效的MLLM适应框架，通过生成领域相关伪QA对和选择性神经元更新，在有限标注数据下提升专业领域VQA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在通用视觉基准上表现良好，但在医学影像等专业领域的OOD任务中表现不佳，且标注数据有限且昂贵

Method: 利用稀缺标注VQA样本和丰富未标注图像，通过QA生成器生成领域相关伪QA对，采用描述蒸馏正则化，并选择性更新与问答最相关的神经元

Result: 在胃肠内窥镜和体育VQA实验中，LEAML在最小监督下持续优于标准微调方法

Conclusion: LEAML框架在标签稀缺的专业领域VQA任务中表现出有效性

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
general visual benchmarks but struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks in
specialized domains such as medical imaging, where labeled data is limited and
expensive. We introduce LEAML, a label-efficient adaptation framework that
leverages both scarce labeled VQA samples and abundant unlabeled images. Our
approach generates domain-relevant pseudo question-answer pairs for unlabeled
data using a QA generator regularized by caption distillation. Importantly, we
selectively update only those neurons most relevant to question-answering,
enabling the QA Generator to efficiently acquire domain-specific knowledge
during distillation. Experiments on gastrointestinal endoscopy and sports VQA
demonstrate that LEAML consistently outperforms standard fine-tuning under
minimal supervision, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed LEAML
framework.

### [59] [Hallucination reduction with CASAL: Contrastive Activation Steering For Amortized Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02324)
*Wannan Yang,Xinchi Qiu,Lei Yu,Yuchen Zhang,Oliver Aobo Yang,Narine Kokhlikyan,Nicola Cancedda,Diego Garcia-Olano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CASAL是一种高效的对比激活引导算法，通过将激活引导的好处直接融入模型权重，让LLM只回答知道的问题而拒绝回答不知道的问题，减少幻觉30%-40%，计算效率比LoRA基线高30倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM经常产生幻觉的问题，现有方法需要实时监控和干预，不够实用。

Method: CASAL连接可解释性与摊销优化，仅训练单个transformer层的子模块，将激活引导效果固化到模型权重中。

Result: 在多个短问答基准上减少幻觉30%-40%，计算效率比SFT和DPO高30倍，数据效率高20倍，在OOD领域也有效。

Conclusion: CASAL是首个对密集和MoE模型都有效的基于引导的训练方法，为实际部署提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities but often
hallucinate, confidently providing incorrect answers instead of admitting
ignorance. Prior work has shown that models encode linear representations of
their own knowledge and that activation steering can reduce hallucinations.
These approaches, however, require real-time monitoring and intervention during
inference. We introduce Contrastive Activation Steering for Amortized Learning
(CASAL), an efficient algorithm that connects interpretability with amortized
optimization. CASAL directly bakes the benefits of activation steering into
model's weights. Once trained, LLMs answer questions they know while abstaining
from answering those they do not. CASAL's light-weight design requires training
only a submodule of a single transformer layer and yet reduces hallucination by
30%-40% across multiple short-form QA benchmarks. CASAL is 30x more
compute-efficient and 20x more data-efficient than strong LoRA-based baselines
such as SFT and DPO, boosting its practical applicability in data scarce
domains. Importantly, CASAL also generalizes effectively to out-of-distribution
(OOD) domains. We showcase CASAL's flexibility in mitigating hallucinations in
both text-only and vision-language models. To our knowledge, CASAL is the first
steering-based training method that has been shown to be effective for both
dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. CASAL represents a promising step
forward for applying interpretability-inspired method for practical deployment
in production systems.

TL;DR: RA-FSM是一个基于GPT的模块化研究助手，使用有限状态机控制循环（相关性→置信度→知识）来减少幻觉和错误引用，通过向量检索和确定性引用管道确保答案的可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型能加速文献综述但会产生幻觉和错误引用，限制了在专家工作流程中的实用性。

Method: 采用模块化设计，包含有限状态控制循环、向量检索和确定性引用管道，通过控制器过滤超出范围的查询、评分可回答性、分解问题，仅在需要时触发检索。

Result: 在光子学领域的评估中，专家在盲测A/B评审中更偏好RA-FSM，认为其边界条件处理更强，证据使用更可靠，且能探索超出NLM的内容范围。

Conclusion: RA-FSM为高风险技术工作提供透明且引用充分的答案，设计可推广到其他科学领域，但会带来可调延迟和成本开销。

Abstract: Large language models accelerate literature synthesis but can hallucinate and
mis-cite, limiting their usefulness in expert workflows. We present RA-FSM
(Research Assistant - Finite State Machine), a modular GPT-based research
assistant that wraps generation in a finite-state control loop: Relevance ->
Confidence -> Knowledge. The system is grounded in vector retrieval and a
deterministic citation pipeline. The controller filters out-of-scope queries,
scores answerability, decomposes questions, and triggers retrieval only when
needed, and emits answers with confidence labels and in-corpus, de-duplicated
references. A ranked-tier ingestion workflow constructs a domain knowledge base
from journals, conferences, indices, preprints, and patents, writing both to a
dense vector index and to a relational store of normalized metrics. We
implement the system for photonics and evaluate it on six task categories:
analytical reasoning, numerical analysis, methodological critique, comparative
synthesis, factual extraction, and application design. In blinded A/B reviews,
domain experts prefer RA-FSM to both a strong Notebook LM (NLM) and a vanilla
Default GPT API call single-pass baseline, citing stronger boundary-condition
handling and more defensible evidence use. Coverage and novelty analyses
indicate that RA-FSM explores beyond the NLM while incurring tunable latency
and cost overheads. The design emphasizes transparent, well-cited answers for
high-stakes technical work and is generalizable to other scientific domains.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合架构，结合了实时语音到语音模型和大型语言模型的优势，在保持低延迟的同时提升语义理解和知识表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实时语音对话系统中知识表达不足与高延迟系统交互不自然之间的矛盾，寻求在保持实时性的同时增强语义理解能力。

Method: 采用混合架构：S2S变换器处理语音实现即时响应，同时将查询发送给后端LLM，将LLM的文本响应实时注入指导S2S模型的语音生成。

Result: 在MT-Bench语音合成基准测试中，系统在响应正确性上显著优于基线S2S模型，接近级联系统水平，同时保持与基线相当的延迟。

Conclusion: 混合架构成功平衡了实时性和知识表达能力，为语音对话系统提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time speech-to-speech (S2S) models excel at generating natural,
low-latency conversational responses but often lack deep knowledge and semantic
understanding. Conversely, cascaded systems combining automatic speech
recognition, a text-based Large Language Model (LLM), and text-to-speech
synthesis offer superior knowledge representation at the cost of high latency,
which disrupts the flow of natural interaction. This paper introduces a novel
hybrid architecture that bridges the gap between these two paradigms. Our
framework processes user speech through an S2S transformer for immediate
responsiveness while concurrently relaying the query to a powerful back-end
LLM. The LLM's text-based response is then injected in real time to guide the
S2S model's speech generation, effectively infusing its output with rich
knowledge without the full latency penalty of a cascaded system. We evaluated
our method using a speech-synthesized variant of the MT-Bench benchmark that
consists of multi-turn question-answering sessions. The results demonstrate
that our system substantially outperforms a baseline S2S model in response
correctness, approaching that of a cascaded system, while maintaining a latency
on par with the baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学多模态大语言模型在低资源环境下存在两个推理瓶颈：内在推理瓶颈忽略医学图像细节，外在推理瓶颈无法整合专业医学知识。

Method: 提出AMANDA框架，通过LLM代理进行医学知识增强：内在知识增强采用粗到细的问题分解进行综合诊断，外在知识增强通过生物医学知识图谱检索来支撑推理过程。

Result: 在8个Med-VQA基准测试中，零样本和少样本设置下都取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: AMANDA框架有效解决了医学多模态大语言模型的推理瓶颈问题，在低资源医学视觉问答任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Medical Multimodal Large Language Models (Med-MLLMs) have shown great promise
in medical visual question answering (Med-VQA). However, when deployed in
low-resource settings where abundant labeled data are unavailable, existing
Med-MLLMs commonly fail due to their medical reasoning capability bottlenecks:
(i) the intrinsic reasoning bottleneck that ignores the details from the
medical image; (ii) the extrinsic reasoning bottleneck that fails to
incorporate specialized medical knowledge. To address those limitations, we
propose AMANDA, a training-free agentic framework that performs medical
knowledge augmentation via LLM agents. Specifically, our intrinsic medical
knowledge augmentation focuses on coarse-to-fine question decomposition for
comprehensive diagnosis, while extrinsic medical knowledge augmentation grounds
the reasoning process via biomedical knowledge graph retrieval. Extensive
experiments across eight Med-VQA benchmarks demonstrate substantial
improvements in both zero-shot and few-shot Med-VQA settings. The code is
available at https://github.com/REAL-Lab-NU/AMANDA.

TL;DR: SelfJudge通过自监督训练验证器，放宽推测解码的验证标准，在保持语义的前提下接受与目标模型输出有轻微差异的候选标记，从而加速大语言模型推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的判断解码方法依赖人工标注或具有可验证真实值的任务，限制了在不同NLP任务中的通用性。

Method: 通过自监督训练验证器，评估标记替换后的响应是否保持原始响应的语义，实现跨NLP任务的自动验证器训练。

Result: 实验显示SelfJudge在推理速度和准确性的权衡上优于判断解码基线方法。

Conclusion: SelfJudge为加速LLM推理提供了一个广泛适用的解决方案。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by verifying candidate tokens
from a draft model against a larger target model. Recent judge decoding boosts
this process by relaxing verification criteria by accepting draft tokens that
may exhibit minor discrepancies from target model output, but existing methods
are restricted by their reliance on human annotations or tasks with verifiable
ground truths, limiting generalizability across diverse NLP tasks. We propose
SelfJudge, which trains judge verifiers via self-supervision of the target
model. Our method measures semantic preservation by assessing whether
token-substituted responses preserve the meaning of original responses,
enabling automatic verifier training across diverse NLP tasks. Our experiments
show SelfJudge achieves superior inference-accuracy trade-offs than judge
decoding baselines, offering a broadly applicable solution for faster LLM
inference.

TL;DR: 提出了EntropyLong方法，通过预测不确定性验证长距离依赖关系质量，构建具有真实长距离依赖的训练数据，显著提升模型在长上下文理解任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的长上下文语言模型训练方法（如通用文本拼接或基于启发式的方法）经常无法保证真正的长距离依赖关系，需要专门的数据构建方法来捕获长范围依赖。

Method: 利用预测不确定性验证依赖关系质量：识别文档中的高熵位置，从大型语料库中检索语义相关上下文，通过评估是否降低预测熵来验证其效用。采用模型在环验证确保每个依赖关系代表可测量的信息增益而非伪相关。

Result: 使用FineWebEdu和Cosmopedia构建了128K长度序列的数据集，训练出的模型在RULER基准测试中表现显著提升，特别是在需要远距离信息的任务上。经过指令微调后，在LongBenchv2上也取得显著进步。

Conclusion: 基于熵的验证对于长上下文训练是必要且有效的，EntropyLong方法能够构建具有真实长距离依赖的训练数据，显著增强模型的长上下文理解能力。

Abstract: Training long-context language models to capture long-range dependencies
requires specialized data construction. Current approaches, such as generic
text concatenation or heuristic-based variants, frequently fail to guarantee
genuine long-range dependencies. We propose EntropyLong, a novel data
construction method that leverages predictive uncertainty to verify dependency
quality. Our approach identifies high-entropy positions in documents, retrieves
semantically relevant contexts from large corpora, and verifies their utility
by assessing whether they reduce prediction entropy. This model-in-the-loop
verification ensures each dependency represents measurable information gain
rather than spurious correlation. We construct training samples with long-range
dependencies by combining original documents with these verified contextual
supplements. Using FineWebEdu and Cosmopedia, we generate a dataset of
128K-length sequences with verified dependencies. Models trained on this data
demonstrate significant improvements on RULER benchmarks, particularly in tasks
requiring distant information. Following instruction fine-tuning, our models
also achieve substantial gains on LongBenchv2, demonstrating enhanced
long-context understanding. Extensive ablation studies further validate the
necessity and effectiveness of entropybased verification for long-context
training.

Motivation: 对话推荐系统(CRSs)面临公开数据稀缺的挑战，而现有的语言模型作为用户模拟器生成的数据往往缺乏行为一致性，无法真实反映用户对话序列。

Method: 开发了一种结合行为模拟器和语言模型提示的方法，生成与用户底层状态一致的自然对话，并创建了一个包含偏好引导和示例批评的大规模开源CRS数据集。

Result: 评估显示生成的对话在一致性、事实性和自然性方面表现良好，为CRS训练提供了高质量的数据。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了CRS数据稀缺问题，生成的对话数据质量高，可用于训练基于语言模型的对话推荐系统。

Abstract: While language models (LMs) offer great potential for conversational
recommender systems (CRSs), the paucity of public CRS data makes fine-tuning
LMs for CRSs challenging. In response, LMs as user simulators qua data
generators can be used to train LM-based CRSs, but often lack behavioral
consistency, generating utterance sequences inconsistent with those of any real
user. To address this, we develop a methodology for generating natural
dialogues that are consistent with a user's underlying state using behavior
simulators together with LM-prompting. We illustrate our approach by generating
a large, open-source CRS data set with both preference elicitation and example
critiquing. Rater evaluation on some of these dialogues shows them to exhibit
considerable consistency, factuality and naturalness.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为look-ahead Sync的神经语言隐写方法，在保持可证明安全性的同时显著提升了嵌入容量，相比SyncPool方法在英语中嵌入率提升超过160%，在中文中提升超过25%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SyncPool方法因使用粗粒度同步机制而牺牲嵌入容量的问题，现代分词器的分词歧义性可能导致灾难性解码失败。

Method: look-ahead Sync方法仅在真正不可区分的token序列上执行最小化同步采样，同时策略性地保留所有其他可区分路径以最大化嵌入容量。

Result: 在英语（使用Llama 3）和中文（使用Qwen 2.5）基准测试中，该方法持续接近理论容量上限，显著优于SyncPool。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了向实用高容量可证明安全语言隐写迈出的重要一步。

Abstract: Neural linguistic steganography aims to embed information
  into natural text while preserving statistical undetectability. A fundamental
challenge in this ffeld stems from tokenization ambiguity in modern tokenizers,
which can lead to catastrophic decoding failures. The recent method, SyncPool,
addresses this ambiguity
  by employing a coarse-grained synchronization mechanism over groups of
ambiguous candidates. However, SyncPool sacriffces embedding capacity, as it
utilizes the entire Shannon entropy of an ambiguous group solely for
synchronization rather than for payload embedding. We propose a method named
look-ahead Sync, which overcomes the capacity limitation of SyncPool while
retaining its provable security guarantees. Our approach performs minimal
synchronized sampling only on truly indistinguishable token sequences, while
strategically preserving all other discernible paths to maximize embedding
capacity. We provide theoretical proofs for the security of our method and
analyze the gap between its achievable embedding capacity and the theoretical
upper bound. Experiments on English (using Llama 3) and Chinese (using Qwen
2.5) benchmarks show that our method consistently approaches the theoretical
capacity upper bound and signiffcantly outperforms SyncPool. The improvement in
embedding rate exceeds 160% in English and 25% in Chinese, particularly in
settings with larger candidate pools. This work represents a signiffcant step
toward practical high-capacity provably secure linguistic steganography.

Abstract: In this resource paper, we present two publicly available datasets of
semantically enriched human trajectories, together with the pipeline to build
them. The trajectories are publicly available GPS traces retrieved from
OpenStreetMap. Each dataset includes contextual layers such as stops, moves,
points of interest (POIs), inferred transportation modes, and weather data. A
novel semantic feature is the inclusion of synthetic, realistic social media
posts generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling multimodal and
semantic mobility analysis. The datasets are available in both tabular and
Resource Description Framework (RDF) formats, supporting semantic reasoning and
FAIR data practices. They cover two structurally distinct, large cities: Paris
and New York. Our open source reproducible pipeline allows for dataset
customization, while the datasets support research tasks such as behavior
modeling, mobility prediction, knowledge graph construction, and LLM-based
applications. To our knowledge, our resource is the first to combine real-world
movement, structured semantic enrichment, LLM-generated text, and semantic web
compatibility in a reusable framework.

Motivation: 现有基于参数梯度的归因方法存在噪声信号大和计算复杂度高的问题，难以有效诊断LLM中不良行为的根本原因，这对AI安全构成了关键挑战。

Method: 通过分析表示及其梯度，直接在模型激活空间中操作，提供语义上有意义的信号，将输出与其训练数据联系起来。

Conclusion: 这项工作为理解、审计和最终减轻与LLM相关的风险提供了一个强大的诊断工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
their deployment is frequently undermined by undesirable behaviors such as
generating harmful content, factual inaccuracies, and societal biases.
Diagnosing the root causes of these failures poses a critical challenge for AI
safety. Existing attribution methods, particularly those based on parameter
gradients, often fall short due to prohibitive noisy signals and computational
complexity. In this work, we introduce a novel and efficient framework that
diagnoses a range of undesirable LLM behaviors by analyzing representation and
its gradients, which operates directly in the model's activation space to
provide a semantically meaningful signal linking outputs to their training
data. We systematically evaluate our method for tasks that include tracking
harmful content, detecting backdoor poisoning, and identifying knowledge
contamination. The results demonstrate that our approach not only excels at
sample-level attribution but also enables fine-grained token-level analysis,
precisely identifying the specific samples and phrases that causally influence
model behavior. This work provides a powerful diagnostic tool to understand,
audit, and ultimately mitigate the risks associated with LLMs. The code is

TL;DR: 本文介绍了FormalML基准测试，用于评估LLMs在数学证明子目标补全任务中的表现，发现现有证明器在准确性和效率方面仍有局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs作为数学家实用助手的能力，填补复杂证明中缺失的步骤，即子目标补全任务。

Method: 构建FormalML基准测试，使用Lean 4从机器学习基础理论中提取4937个问题，通过翻译策略将过程式证明转换为声明式形式。

Result: 评估最先进的证明器显示在准确性和效率方面存在持续局限性。

Conclusion: 需要更强大的基于LLM的定理证明器来实现有效的子目标补全。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress
in formal theorem proving. Yet their ability to serve as practical assistants
for mathematicians, filling in missing steps within complex proofs, remains
underexplored. We identify this challenge as the task of subgoal completion,
where an LLM must discharge short but nontrivial proof obligations left
unresolved in a human-provided sketch. To study this problem, we introduce
FormalML, a Lean 4 benchmark built from foundational theories of machine
learning. Using a translation tactic that converts procedural proofs into
declarative form, we extract 4937 problems spanning optimization and
probability inequalities, with varying levels of difficulty. FormalML is the
first subgoal completion benchmark to combine premise retrieval and complex
research-level contexts. Evaluation of state-of-the-art provers highlights
persistent limitations in accuracy and efficiency, underscoring the need for
more capable LLM-based theorem provers for effective subgoal completion,

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 创建了首个库尔德语语义文本相似度数据集，包含10,000个句子对，涵盖正式和非正式语体，并建立了多个基线模型的评估基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然高资源语言有丰富的语义文本相似度资源，但像库尔德语这样的低资源语言仍然缺乏相关数据集和评估基准。

Method: 构建了10,000个库尔德语句子对数据集，涵盖正式和非正式语体，每个句子对都标注了相似度。使用Sentence-BERT、多语言BERT等强基线模型进行基准测试。

Result: 获得了有竞争力的结果，同时揭示了库尔德语形态学、正字法变异和语码混合带来的挑战。

Conclusion: 该数据集和基线模型建立了一个可复现的评估套件，为库尔德语语义学和低资源NLP的未来研究提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) measures the degree of meaning overlap
between two texts and underpins many NLP tasks. While extensive resources exist
for high-resource languages, low-resource languages such as Kurdish remain
underserved. We present, to our knowledge, the first Kurdish STS dataset:
10,000 sentence pairs spanning formal and informal registers, each annotated
for similarity. We benchmark Sentence-BERT, multilingual BERT, and other strong
baselines, obtaining competitive results while highlighting challenges arising
from Kurdish morphology, orthographic variation, and code-mixing. The dataset
and baselines establish a reproducible evaluation suite and provide a strong
starting point for future research on Kurdish semantics and low-resource NLP.

*Ishak Soltani,Francisco Belo,Bernardo Tavares*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CRACQ是一个多维评估框架，用于评估文档在五个特质上的表现：连贯性、严谨性、适当性、完整性和质量。它基于特质自动作文评分方法，扩展到机器生成文本评估，提供基于评分标准的可解释评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单分数评估方法无法提供细粒度的特质分析，需要开发一个能够同时进行整体和特质层面评估的多维框架，以更好地理解和改进机器生成文本的质量。

Method: 基于特质自动作文评分方法，整合语言、语义和结构信号进行累积评估。使用500个合成的资助提案进行训练，并与LLM作为评判基准进行比较测试。

Result: 初步结果表明，CRACQ比直接使用LLM评估产生更稳定和可解释的特质层面判断，但在可靠性和领域范围方面仍存在挑战。

Conclusion: CRACQ为机器生成文本提供了有效的多维评估框架，能够提供比单分数方法更丰富的分析，但需要进一步改进可靠性和扩展领域适用性。

Abstract: This paper presents CRACQ, a multi-dimensional evaluation framework tailored
to evaluate documents across f i v e specific traits: Coherence, Rigor,
Appropriateness, Completeness, and Quality. Building on insights from
traitbased Automated Essay Scoring (AES), CRACQ expands its fo-cus beyond
essays to encompass diverse forms of machine-generated text, providing a
rubricdriven and interpretable methodology for automated evaluation. Unlike
singlescore approaches, CRACQ integrates linguistic, semantic, and structural
signals into a cumulative assessment, enabling both holistic and trait-level
analysis. Trained on 500 synthetic grant pro-posals, CRACQ was benchmarked
against an LLM-as-a-judge and further tested on both strong and weak real
applications. Preliminary results in-dicate that CRACQ produces more stable and
interpretable trait-level judgments than direct LLM evaluation, though
challenges in reliability and domain scope remain

*Samyak Jhaveri,Praphul Singh,Jangwon Kim,Tara Taghavi,Krishnaram Kenthapadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于长格式临床文本生成的评估集成强化学习框架，结合GRPO和DocLens评估器，直接优化事实基础和完整性，无需单独训练奖励模型或依赖人工参考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化临床文档需要与完整性、事实基础等优先级精确对齐，现有方法存在训练成本高、依赖人工参考等问题。

Method: 使用Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)与DocLens评估器相结合，DocLens提供基于对话的确定性奖励，通过简单的奖励门控策略减少训练成本。

Result: 该方法提高了临床笔记质量，GPT-5定性评估显示在事实性、完整性和简洁性方面更受青睐，遗漏和幻觉更少。

Conclusion: 该框架可扩展到现实世界设置，并能整合自定义目标如指南遵循或计费偏好，改进可能代表保守的下界估计。

Abstract: Automating clinical documentation with large language models requires precise
alignment with priorities such as completeness and factual grounding. We
present an evaluation-integrated reinforcement learning framework for long-form
clinical text generation that couples Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
with DocLens, a claim-level evaluator that provides deterministic,
dialogue-grounded rewards. Our method directly optimizes factual grounding and
completeness without training a separate reward model or relying on
human-authored references. Empirically, the approach improves clinical note
quality and reduces training cost via a simple reward-gating strategy. An
independent GPT-5 qualitative evaluation further supports these gains, showing
higher preference for GRPO outputs in factuality, completeness, and brevity,
with fewer omissions and hallucinations. Because the benchmarks are relatively
clean and the base model already well aligned, these improvements likely
represent a conservative lower bound. The framework is scalable to real-world
settings and can incorporate custom objectives such as guideline adherence or
billing preferences.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了在论证性大语言模型(ArgLLMs)中集成不同不确定性量化方法的效果，发现简单的直接提示策略在声明验证任务中优于更复杂的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在关键决策中的应用日益增多，确保其可靠性变得至关重要。不确定性量化是提高LLM可靠性的关键，特别是在基于计算论证的解释性决策框架中。

Method: 在论证性LLM框架中集成不同的LLM不确定性量化方法，通过声明验证任务评估这些方法的有效性，并设计了一种新颖的实验程序来评估UQ方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，尽管直接提示方法很简单，但在ArgLLMs中是一种有效的UQ策略，其性能显著优于更复杂的方法，特别是在处理复杂和有争议的陈述时。

Conclusion: 简单的直接提示策略在论证性LLM的不确定性量化中表现出色，这为开发更可靠的LLM决策系统提供了实用指导，同时提出的实验方法也为评估UQ方法提供了新思路。

Abstract: Research in uncertainty quantification (UQ) for large language models (LLMs)
is increasingly important towards guaranteeing the reliability of this
groundbreaking technology. We explore the integration of LLM UQ methods in
argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs), an explainable LLM framework for decision-making
based on computational argumentation in which UQ plays a critical role. We
conduct experiments to evaluate ArgLLMs' performance on claim verification
tasks when using different LLM UQ methods, inherently performing an assessment
of the UQ methods' effectiveness. Moreover, the experimental procedure itself
is a novel way of evaluating the effectiveness of UQ methods, especially when
intricate and potentially contentious statements are present. Our results
demonstrate that, despite its simplicity, direct prompting is an effective UQ
strategy in ArgLLMs, outperforming considerably more complex approaches.

*Xin Gao,Ruiyi Zhang,Daniel Du,Saurabh Mahindre,Sai Ashish Somayajula,Pengtao Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了通过提示技术让大语言模型模拟早期知识截止时间的能力，发现提示方法在直接查询特定日期后信息时有效，但在处理因果相关但未直接询问的内容时难以诱导遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在时间预测任务中广泛使用，但其对预训练数据的依赖引发污染担忧，准确预测可能反映记忆而非推理能力，导致对其泛化能力的高估。随着基于提示的遗忘技术出现，研究LLMs能否通过提示模拟早期知识截止时间成为自然问题。

Method: 构建三个评估数据集来评估LLMs遗忘能力：(1)直接事实知识，(2)语义变化，(3)因果相关知识。使用提示技术模拟早期知识截止时间。

Result: 结果显示，基于提示的模拟知识截止在直接查询特定日期后信息时有效，但在遗忘内容未被直接询问但与查询因果相关时难以诱导遗忘。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了在将LLMs应用于时间预测任务时需要更严格的评估设置。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for temporal prediction, but
their reliance on pretraining data raises contamination concerns, as accurate
predictions on pre-cutoff test data may reflect memorization rather than
reasoning, leading to an overestimation of their generalization capability.
With the recent emergence of prompting-based unlearning techniques, a natural
question arises: Can LLMs be prompted to simulate an earlier knowledge cutoff?
In this work, we investigate the capability of prompting to simulate earlier
knowledge cutoff in LLMs. We construct three evaluation datasets to assess the
extent to which LLMs can forget (1) direct factual knowledge, (2) semantic
shifts, and (3) causally related knowledge. Results demonstrate that while
prompt-based simulated knowledge cutoffs show effectiveness when directly
queried with the information after that date, they struggle to induce
forgetting when the forgotten content is not directly asked but causally
related to the query. These findings highlight the need for more rigorous
evaluation settings when applying LLMs for temporal prediction tasks. The full
dataset and evaluation code are available at

*Yifan Wang,Bolian Li,Junlin Wu,Zhaoxuan Tan,Zheli Liu,Ruqi Zhang,Ananth Grama,Qingkai Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DRIFT是一种利用真实世界用户不满意信号进行偏好训练的新方法，通过动态采样正样本来改进大语言模型，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的大语言模型部署会产生大量隐式用户不满意信号（如修正、重写），而显式满意反馈稀缺。现有偏好学习方法与这种数据分布不匹配。

Method: DRIFT以真实世界的不满意信号为基础，从不断演化的策略中动态采样正样本进行训练，避免梯度退化问题。

Result: 在WildBench和AlpacaEval2基准测试中，DRIFT相比基线方法提升显著（7B模型提升6.23%-8.95%，14B模型提升7.61%-12.29%），14B模型甚至超越GPT-4o-mini。

Conclusion: DRIFT是有效且可扩展的后训练方法，能够利用最丰富和最有信息量的信号，同时保持探索能力，产生更多样化的高质量解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world large language model deployments (e.g., conversational AI systems,
code generation assistants) naturally generate abundant implicit user
dissatisfaction (DSAT) signals, as users iterate toward better answers through
refinements, corrections, and expressed preferences, while explicit
satisfaction (SAT) feedback is scarce. Existing preference learning approaches
are poorly aligned with this data profile, as they rely on costly human
annotations or assume plentiful positive responses. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{DRIFT} (\textbf{D}issatisfaction-\textbf{R}efined \textbf{I}terative
pre\textbf{F}erence \textbf{T}raining), which anchors training on real-world
DSAT signals and samples positives dynamically from the evolving policy.
Empirically, DRIFT models trained on real-world \textit{WildFeedback} datasets
and synthetic \textit{UltraFeedback} datasets achieve up to +6.23\% (7B) /
+7.61\% (14B) on WildBench Task Score and up to +8.95\% (7B) / +12.29\% (14B)
on AlpacaEval2 win rate over base models, outperforming strong baseline methods
such as iterative DPO and SPIN. At larger scales, the improvements are
particularly pronounced: 14B models trained with DRIFT surpass GPT-4o-mini on
WildBench. Further analysis shows that DRIFT also preserves exploratory
capacity, yielding more diverse high-reward solutions rather than collapsing to
narrow subsets. Theoretically, we demonstrate that this design preserves
preference margins and avoids the gradient degeneration. These results show
that DRIFT is an effective and scalable recipe for real-world post-training
that leverages the most abundant and informative signal. The code and data are
available at https://github.com/cacayaya/DRIFT.git.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了SIMPACT框架和BluePrint数据集，用于构建行为基础的社会媒体数据集，支持LLM作为真实社交媒体代理的训练和评估，特别关注政治话语建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏标准化的数据资源来微调和评估LLM作为真实社交媒体代理，难以进行大规模社交媒体动态模拟研究。

Method: 开发SIMPACT框架，将匿名用户聚类为行为聚合角色，构建包含12种社交媒体交互类型的大规模数据集BluePrint，并制定下一动作预测任务和评估指标。

Result: 创建了BluePrint数据集，包含政治话语的匿名用户行为数据，支持上下文依赖的交互行为建模，为社交媒体模拟提供标准化数据和评估协议。

Conclusion: SIMPACT为推进严谨、符合伦理的社交媒体模拟提供了基础，BluePrint既可作为政治话语建模的评估基准，也可作为构建领域特定数据集的模板。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for simulating
social media dynamics at scale, enabling studies that would be ethically or
logistically challenging with human subjects. However, the field lacks
standardized data resources for fine-tuning and evaluating LLMs as realistic
social media agents. We address this gap by introducing SIMPACT, the
SIMulation-oriented Persona and Action Capture Toolkit, a privacy respecting
framework for constructing behaviorally-grounded social media datasets suitable
for training agent models. We formulate next-action prediction as a task for
training and evaluating LLM-based agents and introduce metrics at both the
cluster and population levels to assess behavioral fidelity and stylistic
realism. As a concrete implementation, we release BluePrint, a large-scale
dataset built from public Bluesky data focused on political discourse.
BluePrint clusters anonymized users into personas of aggregated behaviours,
capturing authentic engagement patterns while safeguarding privacy through
pseudonymization and removal of personally identifiable information. The
dataset includes a sizable action set of 12 social media interaction types
(likes, replies, reposts, etc.), each instance tied to the posting activity
preceding it. This supports the development of agents that use
context-dependence, not only in the language, but also in the interaction
behaviours of social media to model social media users. By standardizing data
and evaluation protocols, SIMPACT provides a foundation for advancing rigorous,
ethically responsible social media simulations. BluePrint serves as both an
evaluation benchmark for political discourse modeling and a template for
building domain specific datasets to study challenges such as misinformation
and polarization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于动态专家聚类和结构化压缩的统一框架，解决MoE大语言模型中的负载不均、参数冗余和通信开销三难问题，在保持模型质量的同时显著提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MoE大语言模型面临的三个核心挑战：专家负载不均衡、参数冗余以及通信开销过大，这些问题限制了MoE模型的可扩展性和实际部署效率。

Method: 采用动态专家聚类方法，基于参数和激活相似性定期重组专家；在聚类内将专家权重分解为共享基础矩阵和极低秩残差适配器；实现两阶段分层路由策略；结合异构精度方案和动态卸载机制。

Result: 在GLUE和WikiText-103上评估，框架在保持标准MoE模型质量的同时，总参数量减少约80%，吞吐量提升10-20%，专家负载方差降低超过三倍。

Conclusion: 结构重组是实现可扩展、高效且内存有效的MoE大语言模型的原则性路径，为MoE模型的优化提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) face a trilemma of load
imbalance, parameter redundancy, and communication overhead. We introduce a
unified framework based on dynamic expert clustering and structured compression
to address these issues cohesively. Our method employs an online clustering
procedure that periodically regroups experts using a fused metric of parameter
and activation similarity, which stabilizes expert utilization. To our
knowledge, this is one of the first frameworks to leverage the semantic
embedding capability of the router to dynamically reconfigure the model's
architecture during training for substantial efficiency gains. Within each
cluster, we decompose expert weights into a shared base matrix and extremely
low-rank residual adapters, achieving up to fivefold parameter reduction per
group while preserving specialization. This structure enables a two-stage
hierarchical routing strategy: tokens are first assigned to a cluster, then to
specific experts within it, drastically reducing the routing search space and
the volume of all-to-all communication. Furthermore, a heterogeneous precision
scheme, which stores shared bases in FP16 and residual factors in INT4, coupled
with dynamic offloading of inactive clusters, reduces peak memory consumption
to levels comparable to dense models. Evaluated on GLUE and WikiText-103, our
framework matches the quality of standard MoE models while reducing total
parameters by approximately 80%, improving throughput by 10% to 20%, and
lowering expert load variance by a factor of over three. Our work demonstrates
that structural reorganization is a principled path toward scalable, efficient,
and memory-effective MoE LLMs.

Motivation: 探索在教育领域开发基于检索增强生成(RAG)管道的AI教学助手，利用开源小型语言模型提供课程指导，解决生成式AI在教育中应用仍处于早期阶段的问题。

Method: 使用检索增强生成(RAG)管道，对包括LLaMA 3.1、IBM Granite 3.3和Gemma 3在内的8个小型语言模型(7-17B参数)进行基准测试，并与GPT-4o进行比较。

Result: 研究发现，通过适当的提示和针对性检索，小型语言模型在提供准确、符合教学要求的回答方面能够匹配大型语言模型的表现。

Conclusion: 小型语言模型不仅具有成本效益和隐私保护优势，还因其较低的计算和能耗要求而具有环境可持续性，使其成为教育机构在可持续和节能方式下扩展个性化学习的可行AI教学助手。

Abstract: The adoption of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) in education
is still emerging. In this study, we explore the development and evaluation of
AI teaching assistants that provide curriculum-based guidance using a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline applied to selected open-source
small language models (SLMs). We benchmarked eight SLMs, including LLaMA 3.1,
IBM Granite 3.3, and Gemma 3 (7-17B parameters), against GPT-4o. Our findings
show that with proper prompting and targeted retrieval, SLMs can match LLMs in
delivering accurate, pedagogically aligned responses. Importantly, SLMs offer
significant sustainability benefits due to their lower computational and energy
requirements, enabling real-time use on consumer-grade hardware without
depending on cloud infrastructure. This makes them not only cost-effective and
privacy-preserving but also environmentally responsible, positioning them as
viable AI teaching assistants for educational institutions aiming to scale
personalized learning in a sustainable and energy-efficient manner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: vec2vec方法虽然能找到近乎完美的对齐，但计算成本高且不稳定，需要更简单高效的替代方案。

Method: 采用三阶段方法：伪平行嵌入向量的初步匹配、变换拟合和迭代优化，学习线性变换映射。

Result: mini-vec2vec在效率上比原vec2vec方法高出数个数量级，同时达到或超过其性能表现。

Conclusion: 该方法具有稳定性高、算法步骤可解释等优点，便于扩展并在新领域和学科中推广应用。

Abstract: We build upon vec2vec, a procedure designed to align text embedding spaces
without parallel data. vec2vec finds a near-perfect alignment, but it is
expensive and unstable. We present mini-vec2vec, a simple and efficient
alternative that requires substantially lower computational cost and is highly
robust. Moreover, the learned mapping is a linear transformation. Our method
consists of three main stages: a tentative matching of pseudo-parallel
embedding vectors, transformation fitting, and iterative refinement. Our linear
alternative exceeds the original instantiation of vec2vec by orders of
magnitude in efficiency, while matching or exceeding their results. The
method's stability and interpretable algorithmic steps facilitate scaling and
unlock new opportunities for adoption in new domains and fields.

*Dzmitry Pihulski,Karol Charchut,Viktoria Novogrodskaia,Jan Kocoń*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMSQL是对WikiSQL数据集的系统性修订和转换，旨在解决原数据集的结构和标注问题，为LLM时代提供干净的文本到SQL基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WikiSQL数据集在早期NL2SQL研究中发挥了关键作用，但由于存在大小写敏感不一致、数据类型不匹配、语法错误和未回答问题等结构和标注问题，其使用率下降。需要为现代LLM模型提供更干净的基准测试。

Method: 对WikiSQL中的错误进行分类，并实施自动化的清理和重新标注方法，将数据集转换为适合LLM的格式，提供干净的自然语言问题和完整的SQL查询作为纯文本。

Result: 评估了多个大型语言模型（包括Gemma 3、LLaMA 3.2、Mistral 7B等），验证了改进后的数据集效果。

Conclusion: LLMSQL不是简单的更新，而是专门为LLM准备的基准测试，与原始WikiSQL（专为指针网络模型设计）不同，它支持现代自然语言到SQL模型的直接生成和评估。

Abstract: Converting natural language questions into SQL queries (Text-to-SQL) enables
non-expert users to interact with relational databases and has long been a
central task for natural language interfaces to data. While the WikiSQL dataset
played a key role in early NL2SQL research, its usage has declined due to
structural and annotation issues, including case sensitivity inconsistencies,
data type mismatches, syntax errors, and unanswered questions. We present
LLMSQL, a systematic revision and transformation of WikiSQL designed for the
LLM era. We classify these errors and implement automated methods for cleaning
and re-annotation. To assess the impact of these improvements, we evaluated
multiple large language models (LLMs), including Gemma 3, LLaMA 3.2, Mistral
7B, gpt-oss 20B, Phi-3.5 Mini, Qwen 2.5, OpenAI o4-mini, DeepSeek R1 and
others. Rather than serving as an update, LLMSQL is introduced as an LLM-ready
benchmark: unlike the original WikiSQL, tailored for pointer-network models
selecting tokens from input, LLMSQL provides clean natural language questions
and full SQL queries as plain text, enabling straightforward generation and
evaluation for modern natural language-to-SQL models.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了多个大语言模型从不同政治和文化视角判断政治推文攻击性的能力，发现具有显式推理能力的大型模型在意识形态和文化差异敏感性方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型在采用特定政治和文化视角时如何评估政治话语的攻击性，研究模型在跨语言和意识形态背景下的敏感性。

Method: 使用MD-Agreement数据集中2020年美国选举推文的多语言子集，评估多个LLM从不同政治立场（极右翼、保守派、中立派、进步派）判断推文攻击性的能力，涵盖英语、波兰语和俄语语境。

Result: 具有显式推理能力的大型模型（如DeepSeek-R1、o4-mini）在意识形态和文化差异敏感性方面更一致，而较小模型往往无法捕捉细微差别。推理能力显著提高了攻击性判断的个性化和可解释性。

Conclusion: 推理机制对于使LLM适应跨语言和意识形态的微妙社会政治文本分类至关重要，显式推理能力是提升模型在复杂社会政治语境中表现的关键因素。

Abstract: We explore how large language models (LLMs) assess offensiveness in political
discourse when prompted to adopt specific political and cultural perspectives.
Using a multilingual subset of the MD-Agreement dataset centered on tweets from
the 2020 US elections, we evaluate several recent LLMs - including DeepSeek-R1,
o4-mini, GPT-4.1-mini, Qwen3, Gemma, and Mistral - tasked with judging tweets
as offensive or non-offensive from the viewpoints of varied political personas
(far-right, conservative, centrist, progressive) across English, Polish, and
Russian contexts. Our results show that larger models with explicit reasoning
abilities (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, o4-mini) are more consistent and sensitive to
ideological and cultural variation, while smaller models often fail to capture
subtle distinctions. We find that reasoning capabilities significantly improve
both the personalization and interpretability of offensiveness judgments,
suggesting that such mechanisms are key to adapting LLMs for nuanced
sociopolitical text classification across languages and ideologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音对话模型中的偏见问题尚未被充分探索，副语言特征（如年龄、性别、口音）可能影响模型输出，多轮对话可能加剧偏见，影响决策和推荐任务的公平性。

Method: 使用群体不公平分数（GUS）和基于相似度的归一化统计率（SNSR）评估偏见，测试开源模型（Qwen2.5-Omni、GLM-4-Voice）和闭源API（GPT-4o Audio、Gemini-2.5-Flash），分析多轮对话中重复负面反馈的影响。

Result: 闭源模型总体偏见较低，开源模型对年龄和性别更敏感，推荐任务会放大跨群体差异，多轮对话中偏见决策可能持续存在。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统研究端到端语音对话模型偏见的成果，为构建公平可靠的音频交互系统提供见解，并发布了FairDialogue数据集和评估代码。

Abstract: While biases in large language models (LLMs), such as stereotypes and
cultural tendencies in outputs, have been examined and identified, their
presence and characteristics in spoken dialogue models (SDMs) with audio input
and output remain largely unexplored. Paralinguistic features, such as age,
gender, and accent, can affect model outputs; when compounded by multi-turn
conversations, these effects may exacerbate biases, with potential implications
for fairness in decision-making and recommendation tasks. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate biases in speech LLMs and study the impact of
multi-turn dialogues with repeated negative feedback. Bias is measured using
Group Unfairness Score (GUS) for decisions and similarity-based normalized
statistics rate (SNSR) for recommendations, across both open-source models like
Qwen2.5-Omni and GLM-4-Voice, as well as closed-source APIs such as GPT-4o
Audio and Gemini-2.5-Flash. Our analysis reveals that closed-source models
generally exhibit lower bias, while open-source models are more sensitive to
age and gender, and recommendation tasks tend to amplify cross-group
disparities. We found that biased decisions may persist in multi-turn
conversations. This work provides the first systematic study of biases in
end-to-end spoken dialogue models, offering insights towards fair and reliable
audio-based interactive systems. To facilitate further research, we release the
FairDialogue dataset and evaluation code.

Motivation: 探索语言皮层中是否存在抽象的意义表征，以及这些表征与语言形式的关系。

Method: 使用视觉和语言模型建模句子神经响应，通过生成图像和释义来提取嵌入表示，并比较预测准确性。

Result: 多图像聚合和多释义平均能显著提高预测准确性，甚至超过原始句子的预测效果，表明语言系统维护更丰富的语义表征。

Conclusion: 语言皮层中存在高度抽象、形式独立的意义表征，这些表征比语言模型所捕获的语义信息更丰富。

Abstract: The human language system represents both linguistic forms and meanings, but
the abstractness of the meaning representations remains debated. Here, we
searched for abstract representations of meaning in the language cortex by
modeling neural responses to sentences using representations from vision and
language models. When we generate images corresponding to sentences and extract
vision model embeddings, we find that aggregating across multiple generated
images yields increasingly accurate predictions of language cortex responses,
sometimes rivaling large language models. Similarly, averaging embeddings
across multiple paraphrases of a sentence improves prediction accuracy compared
to any single paraphrase. Enriching paraphrases with contextual details that
may be implicit (e.g., augmenting "I had a pancake" to include details like
"maple syrup") further increases prediction accuracy, even surpassing
predictions based on the embedding of the original sentence, suggesting that
the language system maintains richer and broader semantic representations than
language models. Together, these results demonstrate the existence of highly
abstract, form-independent meaning representations within the language cortex.

TL;DR: DiffuSpec是一个免训练框架，使用预训练扩散语言模型在单次前向传播中生成多token草稿，通过因果一致性路径搜索和自适应草稿长度控制器解决扩散模型生成中的挑战，实现最高3倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的自回归解码方式导致延迟增加，现有推测解码方法仍依赖自回归草稿器，限制了实际加速效果。

Method: 使用扩散语言模型生成多token草稿，引入因果一致性路径搜索从token网格中提取左到右路径，以及自适应草稿长度控制器动态调整提案大小。

Result: 在基准测试中实现了最高3倍的实时加速，证明了基于扩散的草稿生成是自回归草稿器的可行替代方案。

Conclusion: DiffuSpec框架成功展示了扩散模型在推测解码中的潜力，为降低LLM推理延迟提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) scale up, accuracy improves, but the
autoregressive (AR) nature of decoding increases latency since each token
requires a serial forward pass. Speculative decoding addresses this by
employing a fast drafter to propose multi-token drafts, which are then verified
in parallel by the target model. However, many deployments still rely on AR
drafters, where sequential passes limit wall-clock gains. We revisit the
drafting stage and present DiffuSpec, a training-free drop-in framework that
uses a pretrained diffusion language model (DLM) to produce multi-token drafts
in a single forward pass, while remaining compatible with standard AR
verifiers. Because DLM drafts are generated under bidirectional conditioning,
parallel per-position candidates form a token lattice in which the locally
highest-probability token at each position need not form a causal left-to-right
path. Moreover, DLM drafting requires pre-specifying a draft length, inducing a
speed-quality trade-off. To address these challenges, we introduce two
practical components: (i) a causal-consistency path search (CPS) over this
lattice that extracts a left-to-right path aligned with AR verification; and
(ii) an adaptive draft-length (ADL) controller that adjusts next proposal size
based on recent acceptance feedback and realized generated length. Across
benchmarks, DiffuSpec yields up to 3x wall-clock speedup, establishing
diffusion-based drafting as a robust alternative to autoregressive drafters for
speculative decoding.

Abstract: Improving air quality and addressing climate change relies on accurate
understanding and analysis of air pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions.
However, emission-related knowledge is often fragmented and highly specialized,
while existing methods for accessing and compiling emissions data remain
inefficient. These issues hinder the ability of non-experts to interpret
emissions information, posing challenges to research and management. To address
this, we present Emission-GPT, a knowledge-enhanced large language model agent
tailored for the atmospheric emissions domain. Built on a curated knowledge
base of over 10,000 documents (including standards, reports, guidebooks, and
peer-reviewed literature), Emission-GPT integrates prompt engineering and
question completion to support accurate domain-specific question answering.
Emission-GPT also enables users to interactively analyze emissions data via
natural language, such as querying and visualizing inventories, analyzing
source contributions, and recommending emission factors for user-defined
scenarios. A case study in Guangdong Province demonstrates that Emission-GPT
can extract key insights--such as point source distributions and sectoral
trends--directly from raw data with simple prompts. Its modular and extensible
architecture facilitates automation of traditionally manual workflows,
positioning Emission-GPT as a foundational tool for next-generation emission
inventory development and scenario-based assessment.

Motivation: 沉默螺旋理论原本用于解释人类社会中的意见表达行为，但该理论的心理机制不直接适用于大语言模型。研究旨在探索纯统计语言生成是否会在LLM群体中产生类似沉默螺旋的动态。

Method: 提出了评估LLM代理中沉默螺旋的框架，通过系统控制'历史'和'角色'信号的可用性，使用趋势测试和集中度测量来分析意见动态。

Result: 实验显示：历史和角色信号共同产生强烈的多数主导并复制沉默螺旋模式；仅历史信号导致强烈锚定效应；仅角色信号产生多样但无关联的意见，表明没有历史锚定时无法出现沉默螺旋动态。

Conclusion: 该研究连接了计算社会学和负责任AI设计，强调需要监控和减轻LLM代理系统中出现的从众现象。

Abstract: The Spiral of Silence (SoS) theory holds that individuals with minority views
often refrain from speaking out for fear of social isolation, enabling majority
positions to dominate public discourse. When the 'agents' are large language
models (LLMs), however, the classical psychological explanation is not directly
applicable, since SoS was developed for human societies. This raises a central
question: can SoS-like dynamics nevertheless emerge from purely statistical
language generation in LLM collectives? We propose an evaluation framework for
examining SoS in LLM agents. Specifically, we consider four controlled
conditions that systematically vary the availability of 'History' and 'Persona'
signals. Opinion dynamics are assessed using trend tests such as Mann-Kendall
and Spearman's rank, along with concentration measures including kurtosis and
interquartile range. Experiments across open-source and closed-source models
show that history and persona together produce strong majority dominance and
replicate SoS patterns; history signals alone induce strong anchoring; and
persona signals alone foster diverse but uncorrelated opinions, indicating that
without historical anchoring, SoS dynamics cannot emerge. The work bridges
computational sociology and responsible AI design, highlighting the need to
monitor and mitigate emergent conformity in LLM-agent systems.

TL;DR: ChunkLLM是一个轻量级可插拔训练框架，通过QK适配器和分块适配器解决Transformer自注意力二次复杂度问题，在保持性能的同时显著提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer自注意力机制的二次计算复杂度问题，同时避免现有方法存在的语义不完整性和训练推理效率低的问题。

Method: 提出QK适配器（Q-Adapter和K-Adapter）用于特征压缩和分块注意力获取，以及分块适配器用于检测分块边界。采用注意力蒸馏方法训练QK适配器，并在推理时仅在检测到分块边界时触发分块选择。

Result: 在长短文本基准测试中表现优异，长上下文基准上保持98.64%性能，KV缓存保留率48.58%，处理120K长文本时相比原始Transformer获得最高4.48倍加速。

Conclusion: ChunkLLM有效解决了Transformer的计算效率问题，在保持性能的同时显著提升推理速度，为长文本处理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Transformer-based large models excel in natural language processing and
computer vision, but face severe computational inefficiencies due to the
self-attention's quadratic complexity with input tokens. Recently, researchers
have proposed a series of methods based on block selection and compression to
alleviate this problem, but they either have issues with semantic
incompleteness or poor training-inference efficiency. To comprehensively
address these challenges, we propose ChunkLLM, a lightweight and pluggable
training framework. Specifically, we introduce two components: QK Adapter
(Q-Adapter and K-Adapter) and Chunk Adapter. The former is attached to each
Transformer layer, serving dual purposes of feature compression and chunk
attention acquisition. The latter operates at the bottommost layer of the
model, functioning to detect chunk boundaries by leveraging contextual semantic
information. During the training phase, the parameters of the backbone remain
frozen, with only the QK Adapter and Chunk Adapter undergoing training.
Notably, we design an attention distillation method for training the QK
Adapter, which enhances the recall rate of key chunks. During the inference
phase, chunk selection is triggered exclusively when the current token is
detected as a chunk boundary, thereby accelerating model inference.
Experimental evaluations are conducted on a diverse set of long-text and
short-text benchmark datasets spanning multiple tasks. ChunkLLM not only
attains comparable performance on short-text benchmarks but also maintains
98.64% of the performance on long-context benchmarks while preserving a 48.58%
key-value cache retention rate. Particularly, ChunkLLM attains a maximum
speedup of 4.48x in comparison to the vanilla Transformer in the processing of
120K long texts.

TL;DR: 该研究通过分析多个大语言模型对罗马尼亚历史争议问题的回答，评估了模型在不同语言和上下文中的偏见和不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 认识到历史常因文化和国家意识形态而被扭曲呈现，大语言模型基于特定数据集训练可能缺乏中立性，从而影响用户认知。

Method: 研究分三个阶段进行：首先让LLM回答历史问题，然后要求用数值评分回答相同问题，验证回答格式对模型立场的影响。

Result: 二元回答稳定性相对较高但不完美，且因语言而异。模型常在语言间或格式间改变立场，数值评分常与初始选择不符，最一致的模型未必最准确或中立。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型在特定语言情境下存在不一致性的倾向，强调了LLM回答的语境依赖性。

Abstract: In this case study, we select a set of controversial Romanian historical
questions and ask multiple Large Language Models to answer them across
languages and contexts, in order to assess their biases. Besides being a study
mainly performed for educational purposes, the motivation also lies in the
recognition that history is often presented through altered perspectives,
primarily influenced by the culture and ideals of a state, even through large
language models. Since they are often trained on certain data sets that may
present certain ambiguities, the lack of neutrality is subsequently instilled
in users. The research process was carried out in three stages, to confirm the
idea that the type of response expected can influence, to a certain extent, the
response itself; after providing an affirmative answer to some given question,
an LLM could shift its way of thinking after being asked the same question
again, but being told to respond with a numerical value of a scale. Results
show that binary response stability is relatively high but far from perfect and
varies by language. Models often flip stance across languages or between
formats; numeric ratings frequently diverge from the initial binary choice, and
the most consistent models are not always those judged most accurate or
neutral. Our research brings to light the predisposition of models to such
inconsistencies, within a specific contextualization of the language for the
question asked.

Motivation: 现有LLM智能体主要依赖环境级手册和任务级指导，但忽略了实例级上下文（如物体位置、配方等可验证事实），这导致在复杂任务中频繁失败。

Method: 提出任务无关的ILCL方法，使用紧凑的TODO森林指导探索，通过轻量级的计划-执行-提取循环自动生成高精度、可复用的上下文文档。

Result: 在TextWorld、ALFWorld和Crafter上的实验显示显著提升：ReAct在TextWorld中的平均成功率从37%提升至95%，IGE从81%提升至95%。

Conclusion: 通过将一次性探索转化为持久可复用的知识，该方法补充现有上下文，使LLM智能体更加可靠高效。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents typically receive two kinds of context: (i)
environment-level manuals that define interaction interfaces and global rules,
and (ii) task-level guidance or demonstrations tied to specific goals. In this
work, we identify a crucial but overlooked third type of context,
instance-level context, which consists of verifiable and reusable facts tied to
a specific environment instance, such as object locations, crafting recipes,
and local rules. We argue that the absence of instance-level context is a
common source of failure for LLM agents in complex tasks, as success often
depends not only on reasoning over global rules or task prompts but also on
making decisions based on precise and persistent facts. Acquiring such context
requires more than memorization: the challenge lies in efficiently exploring,
validating, and formatting these facts under tight interaction budgets. We
formalize this problem as Instance-Level Context Learning (ILCL) and introduce
our task-agnostic method to solve it. Our method performs a guided exploration,
using a compact TODO forest to intelligently prioritize its next actions and a
lightweight plan-act-extract loop to execute them. This process automatically
produces a high-precision context document that is reusable across many
downstream tasks and agents, thereby amortizing the initial exploration cost.
Experiments across TextWorld, ALFWorld, and Crafter demonstrate consistent
gains in both success and efficiency: for instance, ReAct's mean success rate
in TextWorld rises from 37% to 95%, while IGE improves from 81% to 95%. By
transforming one-off exploration into persistent, reusable knowledge, our
method complements existing contexts to enable more reliable and efficient LLM
agents.

Motivation: 当前检索增强生成方法缺乏对训练条件如何影响知识仲裁策略的系统理解，这可能导致预训练模型产生不良的仲裁行为，浪费计算资源。

Method: 在合成传记语料库上训练基于transformer的语言模型，系统控制各种训练条件，包括文档内事实重复、信息不一致性和分布偏斜。

Result: 实验表明：文档内事实重复促进参数和上下文能力的发展；包含不一致信息或分布偏斜的语料训练鼓励模型发展稳健的知识仲裁策略。

Conclusion: 非理想的训练特性（如信息不一致、分布偏斜）不应被视为需要移除的伪影，而是学习稳健知识仲裁的重要条件，这为预训练模型和谐整合参数和上下文知识提供了实证指导。

Abstract: Large language models often encounter conflicts between in-context knowledge
retrieved at inference time and parametric knowledge acquired during
pretraining. Models that accept external knowledge uncritically are vulnerable
to misinformation, whereas models that adhere rigidly to parametric knowledge
fail to benefit from retrieval. Despite the widespread adoption of
retrieval-augmented generation, we still lack a systematic understanding of
what shapes knowledge-arbitration strategies during training. This gap risks
producing pretrained models with undesirable arbitration behaviors and,
consequently, wasting substantial computational resources after the pretraining
budget has already been spent. To address this problem, we present the first
controlled study of how training conditions influence models' use of in-context
and parametric knowledge, and how they arbitrate between them. We train
transformer-based language models on a synthetic biographies corpus while
systematically controlling various conditions. Our experiments reveal that
intra-document repetition of facts fosters the development of both parametric
and in-context capabilities. Moreover, training on a corpus that contains
inconsistent information or distributional skew encourages models to develop
robust strategies for leveraging parametric and in-context knowledge. Rather
than viewing these non-ideal properties as artifacts to remove, our results
indicate that they are important for learning robust arbitration. These
insights offer concrete, empirical guidance for pretraining models that
harmoniously integrate parametric and in-context knowledge.

Motivation: 现代语言模型依赖参数扩展来提升性能，但将所有世界知识压缩到参数中既不必要（每次提示只使用一小部分知识）也不实用（边缘设备内存和计算资源有限）。

Method: 采用内存增强架构和预训练策略，构建小型语言模型访问大型分层参数化内存库。预训练时学习将长尾世界知识存储在内存参数中，小型模型作为锚点捕捉通用知识和推理能力。

Result: 160M参数模型增强18M参数内存（从4.6B内存库提取）获得与2倍以上参数常规模型相当的性能。实验将参数化内存扩展到超过21B参数，证明分层前馈内存在不同transformer架构中均有效。

Conclusion: 内存增强架构能显著提升小型语言模型性能，使其在有限参数下达到更大模型的性能水平，为边缘设备部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The impressive performance gains of modern language models currently rely on
scaling parameters: larger models store more world knowledge and reason better.
Yet compressing all world knowledge into parameters is unnecessary, as only a
fraction is used per prompt, and impractical for edge devices with limited
inference-time memory and compute. We address this shortcoming by a
memory-augmented architecture and a pretraining strategy aligned with existing
hardware paradigms. We introduce small language models that access large
hierarchical parametric memory banks encoding world knowledge. During
pretraining and inference, we fetch a small, context-dependent memory block and
add it to the model. Our pretraining learns to store long-tail world knowledge
in the memory parameters, while the small language model acts as an anchor
capturing common knowledge and general reasoning abilities. Through
trillion-token-scale experiments, we show significant gains: a 160M-parameters
model augmented with an 18M-parameters memory fetched from a 4.6B memory bank
obtains comparable performance to a regular model with more than 2x the
parameters. Through extensive experiments, we study the optimal type and size
of parametric memories in transformers, scaling them to over 21B parameters. We
find that our proposed hierarchical feed-forward memories work robustly across
transformer architectures, whether added during pretraining or post-hoc.

Motivation: 在资源受限环境下，从多个LLM中选择最可靠响应具有挑战性，现有方法依赖昂贵的外部验证器或多次采样，而多LLM系统潜力大但表现不如单LLM自一致性。

Method: 使用校准的对数似然分数，隐式利用这些模型的固有知识和置信度来选择最佳响应。

Conclusion: 该方法计算高效，能够有效利用多LLM系统的多样性潜力，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities, yet
selecting the most reliable response from multiple LLMs remains a challenge,
particularly in resource-constrained settings. Existing approaches often depend
on costly external verifiers, human evaluators, or self-consistency techniques
that require multiple samples from a single model. While multi-LLM systems
produce more diverse responses than single models and thus have greater
potential, they often underperform compared to single LLM self-consistency. We
propose a principled, novel and computationally efficient method to select the
best response from multiple different LLMs using a calibrated log-likelihood
score, implicitly leveraging the inherent knowledge and confidence of these
models. Our method demonstrates improvements of approx. 4%, 3%, and 5% across
both debate (multi-round LLM discussions) and non-debate (Best-of-N with
multiple LLMs) settings on GSM8K, MMLU (6 subsets), and ARC datasets

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统主要依赖非结构化文档，而忽略了关系数据库提供的精确、及时且可高效查询的事实信息。数据库和文档在不同查询中具有互补优势，但简单组合会引入噪声和成本，因此需要智能选择最适合每个查询的知识源。

Method: 构建了一个规则驱动的路由框架：路由代理基于显式规则为候选增强路径评分并选择最合适的路径；规则制定专家代理使用QA反馈随时间优化规则以保持适应性；路径级元缓存重用语义相似查询的过往路由决策以减少延迟和成本。

Result: 在三个QA基准测试上的实验表明，该框架始终优于静态策略和学习路由基线，实现了更高的准确性，同时保持适度的计算成本。

Conclusion: 通过系统性地选择最适合每个查询的知识源，该框架有效平衡了问答任务的准确性和效率，证明了规则驱动路由在检索增强生成中的价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on general
Question Answering (QA), yet they often struggle in domain-specific scenarios
where accurate and up-to-date information is required. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by enriching LLMs with external
knowledge, but existing systems primarily rely on unstructured documents, while
largely overlooking relational databases, which provide precise, timely, and
efficiently queryable factual information, serving as indispensable
infrastructure in domains such as finance, healthcare, and scientific research.
Motivated by this gap, we conduct a systematic analysis that reveals three
central observations: (i) databases and documents offer complementary strengths
across queries, (ii) naively combining both sources introduces noise and cost
without consistent accuracy gains, and (iii) selecting the most suitable source
for each query is crucial to balance effectiveness and efficiency. We further
observe that query types show consistent regularities in their alignment with
retrieval paths, suggesting that routing decisions can be effectively guided by
systematic rules that capture these patterns. Building on these insights, we
propose a rule-driven routing framework. A routing agent scores candidate
augmentation paths based on explicit rules and selects the most suitable one; a
rule-making expert agent refines the rules over time using QA feedback to
maintain adaptability; and a path-level meta-cache reuses past routing
decisions for semantically similar queries to reduce latency and cost.
Experiments on three QA benchmarks demonstrate that our framework consistently
outperforms static strategies and learned routing baselines, achieving higher
accuracy while maintaining moderate computational cost.

mechanism of LLMs remains largely unexplored due to insufficient, isolated, and
small-scale evaluation. For instance, are LLMs similar to humans in modifying
certain knowledge? What differs editing and unlearning as training data
increases? This paper proposes KnowledgeSmith, a unified framework to
systematically understand the updating mechanism of LLMs. We first cast editing
and unlearning as instances of one constrained optimization problem. Then, we
propose an automatic dataset generator that provides structured interventions
across multiple graph levels and data scales, enabling controlled studies of
how different modification strategies propagate through model knowledge.
Extensive experiments demonstrate nuanced insights over knowledge propagation,
plasticity scaling, consistency, and robustness. For instance, our results show
that LLMs do not exhibit similar updating as humans for different levels of
knowledge, and there exists consistency-capacity trade-off. We hope our
findings can offer suggestions to the design of more reliable and scalable
strategies. Code: https://github.com/AIFrontierLab/KnowledgeSmith.git

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出系统化框架，通过数据库级别的结构化领域语句和子字符串匹配检索，提升LLM将自然语言查询转换为SQL的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖不现实的特定查询文本提示来表达领域知识，而自然语言查询常使用领域特定词汇，需要理解这些词汇与数据库模式结构的关系。

Method: 在数据库级别关联结构化领域语句，使用子字符串匹配检索与用户查询相关的领域语句。

Result: 在11个现实数据库模式上评估，证明数据库级别的结构化领域语句比现有特定查询文本提示更实用准确，子字符串匹配检索比其他检索方法准确率显著更高。

Conclusion: 系统化的数据库级别结构化领域语句框架能有效提升LLM在NL到SQL转换任务中的性能。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) for translating Natural
Language (NL) queries into SQL varies significantly across databases (DBs). NL
queries are often expressed using a domain specific vocabulary, and mapping
these to the correct SQL requires an understanding of the embedded domain
expressions, their relationship to the DB schema structure. Existing benchmarks
rely on unrealistic, ad-hoc query specific textual hints for expressing domain
knowledge. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for associating
structured domain statements at the database level. We present retrieval of
relevant structured domain statements given a user query using sub-string level
match. We evaluate on eleven realistic DB schemas covering diverse domains
across five open-source and proprietary LLMs and demonstrate that (1) DB level
structured domain statements are more practical and accurate than existing
ad-hoc query specific textual domain statements, and (2) Our sub-string match
based retrieval of relevant domain statements provides significantly higher
accuracy than other retrieval approaches.

*Sophie L. Wang,Phillip Isola,Brian Cheung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过简单的提示工程（如"看"或"听"等感官提示），可以激活纯文本训练的LLMs中隐含的多模态表征，使其与专业视觉和音频编码器的表征对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试纯文本训练的LLMs是否包含隐含的多模态规律，以及是否可以通过感官提示来激活这些潜在结构。

Method: 使用感官提示（如'看'或'听'）来引导LLMs，使其在生成下一个token时仿佛基于潜在的视觉或听觉证据进行预测。

Result: 发现轻量级的提示工程能够可靠地激活纯文本训练LLMs中的模态适当表征。

Conclusion: 纯文本训练的LLMs内部表征确实受到语言中编码的多模态规律的隐性塑造，通过感官提示可以显性地激活这些潜在结构。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained purely on text ostensibly lack any
direct perceptual experience, yet their internal representations are implicitly
shaped by multimodal regularities encoded in language. We test the hypothesis
that explicit sensory prompting can surface this latent structure, bringing a
text-only LLM into closer representational alignment with specialist vision and
audio encoders. When a sensory prompt tells the model to 'see' or 'hear', it
cues the model to resolve its next-token predictions as if they were
conditioned on latent visual or auditory evidence that is never actually
supplied. Our findings reveal that lightweight prompt engineering can reliably
activate modality-appropriate representations in purely text-trained LLMs.

Motivation: 解决医疗系统中患者分诊效率低、专科转诊不准确的问题，通过AI技术优化临床工作流程。

Method: 采用混合架构：有限状态机处理结构化对话流程，协作代理使用大语言模型分析症状并确定转诊优先级，基于模块化微服务框架构建。

Result: 在国家级医院IT平台部署2个月内完成55,000+用户对话，验证显示首次转诊准确率超过人类水平，咨询时间缩短至1/3。

Conclusion: CLARITY证明了AI临床辅助系统在真实医疗环境中的可行性和优越性，能够安全高效地提升患者分诊和转诊质量。

Abstract: We present CLARITY (Clinical Assistant for Routing, Inference, and Triage),
an AI-driven platform designed to facilitate patient-to-specialist routing,
clinical consultations, and severity assessment of patients' conditions. Its
hybrid architecture combines a Finite State Machine (FSM) for structured
dialogue flows with collaborative agents that employ Large Language Model (LLM)
to analyze symptoms and prioritize referrals to appropriate specialists. Built
on a modular microservices framework, CLARITY ensures safe, efficient, and
robust performance, flexible and readily scalable to meet the demands of
existing workflows and IT solutions in healthcare.
  We report integration of our clinical assistant into a large-scale
nation-wide inter-hospital IT platform, with over 55,000 content-rich user
dialogues completed within the two months of deployment, 2,500 of which were
expert-annotated for a consequent validation. The validation results show that
CLARITY surpasses human-level performance in terms of the first-attempt routing
precision, naturally requiring up to 3 times shorter duration of the
consultation than with a human.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于概率上下文无关文法(PCFG)的新框架来研究语言模型如何习得语法，通过合成语言训练小模型来精确控制语法复杂性、递归深度和子语法结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型模型取得了令人印象深刻的结果，但对其学习动态知之甚少。该研究旨在理解语言模型如何获得语法能力，特别是关注语法习得过程。

Method: 使用PCFG生成合成语言训练小模型，通过控制语法复杂性、递归深度和子语法结构来研究学习动态。推导了训练损失和KL散度的递归公式，并进行子语法预训练实验。

Result: 发现与儿童不同，Transformer同时减少所有子语法的损失；子语法预训练能改善小模型的最终损失；预训练模型内部表示更符合语法子结构；模型在处理深层递归结构时存在困难。

Conclusion: 该工作开启了在PCFG上研究Transformer学习动态的新方向，将其作为探测语言模型学习的通用测试平台，揭示了神经网络在表示层次语法方面的基本挑战。

Abstract: We introduce a new framework for understanding how language models acquire
syntax. While large models achieve impressive results, little is known about
their learning dynamics. Our approach starts with the observation that most
domains of interest, such as natural language syntax, coding languages,
arithmetic problems, are captured by probabilistic context-free grammars
(PCFGs). We study the learning dynamics of small models trained on synthetic
languages generated from PCFGs, enabling precise control over grammar
complexity, recursion depth, and subgrammar structure. We prove several
general, recursive formulae for the training loss and Kullback-Leibler
divergence over the subgrammar structure of a PCFG. Empirically, we find that
unlike children, who first master simple substructures before progressing to
more complex constructions, transformers reduce loss across all subgrammars in
parallel. We further show that subgrammar pretraining can improve the final
loss for smaller models, and that pretrained models develop internal
representations more aligned with the grammar's substructure. Finally, we
demonstrate that models struggle with deeper recursive structures (a limitation
even of large language models), revealing fundamental challenges in how neural
networks represent hierarchical syntax. Overall, our work initiates the study
of the learning dynamics of transformers on PCFGs as a versatile testbed for
probing learning in language models, opening a research direction with many
open questions.

*Anant Gupta,Karthik Singaravadivelan,Zekun Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Cobweb框架通过构建层次化原型树实现文档检索，提供多粒度相关性信号和透明推理路径，在保持竞争力的同时提高了对嵌入质量的鲁棒性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经文档检索方法将语料库视为扁平向量云，忽略了语料结构且缺乏解释性，需要更结构化和透明的检索方法。

Method: 使用Cobweb框架将句子嵌入组织成原型树，通过粗到细的遍历进行文档排序，内部节点作为概念原型，实现了两种推理方法：广义最佳优先搜索和轻量级路径求和排序器。

Result: 在MS MARCO和QQP数据集上的实验表明，该方法在强编码器嵌入上与点积搜索性能相当，但在GPT-2向量上点积性能崩溃时仍能保持稳健检索。

Conclusion: Cobweb框架提供了有竞争力的检索效果、对嵌入质量的改进鲁棒性、可扩展性以及通过层次化原型的可解释检索。

Abstract: Neural document retrieval often treats a corpus as a flat cloud of vectors
scored at a single granularity, leaving corpus structure underused and
explanations opaque. We use Cobweb--a hierarchy-aware framework--to organize
sentence embeddings into a prototype tree and rank documents via coarse-to-fine
traversal. Internal nodes act as concept prototypes, providing multi-granular
relevance signals and a transparent rationale through retrieval paths. We
instantiate two inference approaches: a generalized best-first search and a
lightweight path-sum ranker. We evaluate our approaches on MS MARCO and QQP
with encoder (e.g., BERT/T5) and decoder (GPT-2) representations. Our results
show that our retrieval approaches match the dot product search on strong
encoder embeddings while remaining robust when kNN degrades: with GPT-2
vectors, dot product performance collapses whereas our approaches still
retrieve relevant results. Overall, our experiments suggest that Cobweb
provides competitive effectiveness, improved robustness to embedding quality,
scalability, and interpretable retrieval via hierarchical prototypes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于知识图谱的RAG系统评估方法，扩展了RAGAS框架，通过多跳推理和语义社区聚类提供更全面的评分指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估指标难以有效捕捉现代LLM生成内容的关键特征，这些内容通常具有高流畅性和自然性。RAG系统评估仍然是一个具有挑战性的任务。

Method: 扩展RAGAS框架为基于知识图谱的评估范式，引入多跳推理和语义社区聚类技术，构建更全面的评分指标。

Result: 与RAGAS分数相比，该方法在人类标注子集上显示出更好的相关性，并且对生成输出的细微语义差异更加敏感。

Conclusion: 基于知识图谱的评估方法为RAG系统提供了更深入的理解和更细致的性能视角，同时指出了RAG系统评估的关键挑战和未来研究方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) has become a significant research focus and is
utilized in various fields, such as text generation and dialog systems. One of
the most essential applications of LLM is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG),
which greatly enhances generated content's reliability and relevance. However,
evaluating RAG systems remains a challenging task. Traditional evaluation
metrics struggle to effectively capture the key features of modern
LLM-generated content that often exhibits high fluency and naturalness.
Inspired by the RAGAS tool, a well-known RAG evaluation framework, we extended
this framework into a KG-based evaluation paradigm, enabling multi-hop
reasoning and semantic community clustering to derive more comprehensive
scoring metrics. By incorporating these comprehensive evaluation criteria, we
gain a deeper understanding of RAG systems and a more nuanced perspective on
their performance. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we compare
its performance with RAGAS scores and construct a human-annotated subset to
assess the correlation between human judgments and automated metrics. In
addition, we conduct targeted experiments to demonstrate that our KG-based
evaluation method is more sensitive to subtle semantic differences in generated
outputs. Finally, we discuss the key challenges in evaluating RAG systems and
highlight potential directions for future research.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了三种语音语言模型中的模态适配器如何将语音编码器输出转换为语言模型可理解的表示，发现存在两种策略：基于语义的英语中间语言表示和基于语音的英语单词表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解语音语言模型中关键的模态适配器如何转换表示，因为目前对这些适配器的工作机制知之甚少。

Method: 通过寻找模态适配器输出表示与解码器语言模型标记的最邻近匹配，分析三种语音语言模型的表示策略。

Result: 发现使用Whisper编码器的模型采用基于语义的英语中间语言表示，能够处理未见语言；而其他模型如Phi-4则采用基于语音的英语单词表示。

Conclusion: 模态适配器的表示策略取决于语音编码器的训练目标：仅语音识别训练导致语音表示，包含翻译训练则产生语义表示。

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) that integrate speech with large language
models (LMs) rely on modality adapters (MAs) to map the output of speech
encoders to a representation that is understandable to the decoder LM. Yet we
know very little about how these crucial MAs transform representations. Here we
examine the MA output representation in three SLMs (SALMONN, Qwen2-Audio and
Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct). By finding the nearest decoder LM token to an MA
representation, we uncover two strategies for MA representations. For models
using a Whisper encoder, MAs appear to represent the meaning of the input using
an English-based interlingua, allowing them to handle languages unseen in
instruction tuning. For models that don't, like Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct, MAs
instead represent the phonetics of the input, but expressed with English words.
We hypothesise that which arises depends on whether the speech encoder is
trained only for speech recognition or also for translation.

Motivation: 语言模型如何利用上下文信息对用户来说是不透明的，现有工作缺乏评估高亮解释在准确解释上下文利用方面的有效性。

Method: 引入金标准高亮解释评估框架，使用已知真实上下文使用的受控测试案例，评估了四种高亮解释方法（包括新适配的MechLight方法）在四种上下文场景、四个数据集和五个语言模型上的表现。

Result: MechLight在所有上下文场景中表现最佳，但所有方法在处理长上下文时都遇到困难，并表现出位置偏差。

Conclusion: 高亮解释方法在提供可靠的上下文利用解释方面存在基本挑战，需要新方法来实现在规模上的可靠解释。

Abstract: Context utilisation, the ability of Language Models (LMs) to incorporate
relevant information from the provided context when generating responses,
remains largely opaque to users, who cannot determine whether models draw from
parametric memory or provided context, nor identify which specific context
pieces inform the response. Highlight explanations (HEs) offer a natural
solution as they can point the exact context pieces and tokens that influenced
model outputs. However, no existing work evaluates their effectiveness in
accurately explaining context utilisation. We address this gap by introducing
the first gold standard HE evaluation framework for context attribution, using
controlled test cases with known ground-truth context usage, which avoids the
limitations of existing indirect proxy evaluations. To demonstrate the
framework's broad applicability, we evaluate four HE methods -- three
established techniques and MechLight, a mechanistic interpretability approach
we adapt for this task -- across four context scenarios, four datasets, and
five LMs. Overall, we find that MechLight performs best across all context
scenarios. However, all methods struggle with longer contexts and exhibit
positional biases, pointing to fundamental challenges in explanation accuracy
that require new approaches to deliver reliable context utilisation
explanations at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在面向客户应用中的部署增多，需要了解用户与聊天机器人和人类客服沟通方式的差异，以改进模型训练策略。

Method: 比较用户与LLM聊天机器人和人类客服的沟通风格差异，并测试两种策略：后训练阶段的数据增强和推理时用户消息重构。

Result: 用户在与聊天机器人交流时表现出不同的语法流畅度、礼貌程度和词汇多样性。基于风格多样化数据集训练的模型表现优于仅使用原始或风格统一数据集的模型。

Conclusion: LLM需要适应部署后用户沟通风格的变化，数据增强是有效的策略，而推理时消息重构效果较差。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in customer-facing
applications, a critical yet underexplored question is how users communicate
differently with LLM chatbots compared to human agent. In this study, we
present empirical evidence that users adopt distinct communication styles when
users interact with chatbots versus human agents. Our analysis reveals
significant differences in grammatical fluency, politeness, and lexical
diversity in user language between the two settings. These findings suggest
that models trained exclusively on human-human interaction data may not
adequately accommodate the communication style shift that occurs once an LLM
chatbot is deployed. To enhance LLM robustness to post-launch communication
style changes, we experimented with two strategies: (1) data augmentation
during the post-training phase and (2) inference-time user message
reformulation. Our results indicate that models trained on stylistically
diverse datasets significantly outperform those trained exclusively on original
or stylistically uniform datasets, while inference-time reformulation proved
less effective. These insights help us to better adapt our models for improved
LLM-user interaction experiences.

Abstract: Recent developments have enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to engage in
complex reasoning tasks through deep thinking. However, the capacity of
reasoning has not been successfully transferred to non-high-resource languages
due to resource constraints, which struggles with multilingual reasoning tasks.
To this end, we propose Structured-of-Thought (SoT), a training-free method
that improves the performance on multilingual reasoning through a multi-step
transformation: Language Thinking Transformation and Structured Knowledge
Transformation. The SoT method converts language-specific semantic information
into language-agnostic structured representations, enabling the models to
understand the query in different languages more sophisticated. Besides, SoT
effectively guides LLMs toward more concentrated reasoning to maintain
consistent underlying reasoning pathways when handling cross-lingual variations
in expression. Experimental results demonstrate that SoT outperforms several
strong baselines on multiple multilingual reasoning benchmarks when adapting to
various backbones of LLMs. It can also be integrated with other training-free
strategies for further improvements. Our code is available at

further development of self-improvement in MLLMs. We also include commonly used
evaluations and downstream applications. Finally, we conclude by outlining open

Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) research has primarily focused on closed-book
factual question answering (QA), while contextual QA remains unexplored,
despite its importance in real-world applications. In this work, we focus on UQ
for the contextual QA task and propose a theoretically grounded approach to
quantify epistemic uncertainty. We begin by introducing a task-agnostic,
token-level uncertainty measure defined as the cross-entropy between the
predictive distribution of the given model and the unknown true distribution.
By decomposing this measure, we isolate the epistemic component and approximate
the true distribution by a perfectly prompted, idealized model. We then derive
an upper bound for epistemic uncertainty and show that it can be interpreted as
semantic feature gaps in the given model's hidden representations relative to
the ideal model. We further apply this generic framework to the contextual QA
task and hypothesize that three features approximate this gap: context-reliance
(using the provided context rather than parametric knowledge), context
comprehension (extracting relevant information from context), and honesty
(avoiding intentional lies). Using a top-down interpretability approach, we
extract these features by using only a small number of labeled samples and
ensemble them to form a robust uncertainty score. Experiments on multiple QA
benchmarks in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings show that
our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised
(sampling-free and sampling-based) and supervised UQ methods, achieving up to a
13-point PRR improvement while incurring a negligible inference overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估框架主要关注静态基准和单轮评估，无法捕捉真实对话中随时间变化的退化动态，需要新的方法来理解LLM在多轮对话中的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用生存分析框架，分析36,951轮对话，使用Cox比例风险模型、加速失效时间模型和随机生存森林方法，将对话失败建模为时间到事件过程。

Result: 发现突发语义漂移(P2P)会灾难性地增加对话失败风险，而渐进累积漂移则具有高度保护作用，能显著降低失败风险并延长对话时长。AFT模型表现最佳。

Conclusion: 生存分析是评估LLM鲁棒性的强大范式，为设计弹性对话代理提供具体见解，并挑战了对话AI系统中语义一致性必要性的普遍假设。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized conversational AI, yet their
robustness in extended multi-turn dialogues remains poorly understood. Existing
evaluation frameworks focus on static benchmarks and single-turn assessments,
failing to capture the temporal dynamics of conversational degradation that
characterize real-world interactions. In this work, we present the first
comprehensive survival analysis of conversational AI robustness, analyzing
36,951 conversation turns across 9 state-of-the-art LLMs to model failure as a
time-to-event process. Our survival modeling framework-employing Cox
proportional hazards, Accelerated Failure Time, and Random Survival Forest
approaches-reveals extraordinary temporal dynamics. We find that abrupt,
prompt-to-prompt(P2P) semantic drift is catastrophic, dramatically increasing
the hazard of conversational failure. In stark contrast, gradual, cumulative
drift is highly protective, vastly reducing the failure hazard and enabling
significantly longer dialogues. AFT models with interactions demonstrate
superior performance, achieving excellent discrimination and exceptional
calibration. These findings establish survival analysis as a powerful paradigm
for evaluating LLM robustness, offer concrete insights for designing resilient
conversational agents, and challenge prevailing assumptions about the necessity
of semantic consistency in conversational AI Systems.

Method: 使用来自真实场景的匿名数据，构建了14个旅游领域数据集，涵盖7个常见NLP任务，分析不同LLM在这些任务上的表现。

Result: 通用基准测试结果不足以理解模型在低资源任务中的表现；即使训练FLOPs很大，现成LLM在复杂领域特定场景中仍会遇到性能瓶颈；推理能力对较小LLM提升更显著，使其在特定任务中成为更好的判断者。

Conclusion: 需要针对特定领域构建专门的评估基准，通用基准测试在低资源任务评估中存在局限性，推理能力对提升小模型性能具有重要价值。

Abstract: Results on existing LLM benchmarks capture little information over the model
capabilities in low-resource tasks, making it difficult to develop effective
solutions in these domains. To address these challenges, we curated 14
travel-domain datasets spanning 7 common NLP tasks using anonymised data from
real-world scenarios, and analysed the performance across LLMs. We report on
the accuracy, scaling behaviour, and reasoning capabilities of LLMs in a
variety of tasks. Our results confirm that general benchmarking results are
insufficient for understanding model performance in low-resource tasks. Despite
the amount of training FLOPs, out-of-the-box LLMs hit performance bottlenecks
in complex, domain-specific scenarios. Furthermore, reasoning provides a more
significant boost for smaller LLMs by making the model a better judge on
certain tasks.

Motivation: 现有多模态实体链接方法未充分探索高质量负样本选择的重要性，这可能在度量学习中发挥关键作用。

Method: 在生成对抗框架下解决多模态实体链接问题：生成器负责生成高质量负样本，判别器负责度量学习任务；由于生成过程是离散的，使用策略梯度技术优化生成器。

Result: 在Wiki-MEL、Richpedia-MEL和WikiDiverse数据集上的实验结果表明，PGMEL通过选择具有挑战性的负样本来学习有意义的表示，并优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: PGMEL方法有效解决了多模态实体链接中负样本选择的问题，通过生成对抗网络框架提升了表示学习性能。

Abstract: The task of entity linking, which involves associating mentions with their
respective entities in a knowledge graph, has received significant attention
due to its numerous potential applications. Recently, various multimodal entity
linking (MEL) techniques have been proposed, targeted to learn comprehensive
embeddings by leveraging both text and vision modalities. The selection of
high-quality negative samples can potentially play a crucial role in
metric/representation learning. However, to the best of our knowledge, this
possibility remains unexplored in existing literature within the framework of
MEL. To fill this gap, we address the multimodal entity linking problem in a
generative adversarial setting where the generator is responsible for
generating high-quality negative samples, and the discriminator is assigned the
responsibility for the metric learning tasks. Since the generator is involved
in generating samples, which is a discrete process, we optimize it using policy
gradient techniques and propose a policy gradient-based generative adversarial
network for multimodal entity linking (PGMEL). Experimental results based on
Wiki-MEL, Richpedia-MEL and WikiDiverse datasets demonstrate that PGMEL learns
meaningful representation by selecting challenging negative samples and
outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于对比学习编码器的评估框架，用于检测LLM在印度文化背景下的刻板印象偏见，并创建了包含2,575个句子的IndiCASA数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于嵌入的偏见评估方法在捕捉印度等文化多样化背景下的细微刻板印象方面存在不足，而LLM在高风险应用中的部署需要严格的偏见评估。

Method: 使用对比学习训练的编码器通过嵌入相似性捕捉细粒度偏见，并构建了涵盖种姓、性别、宗教、残疾和社会经济地位五个维度的IndiCASA数据集。

Result: 评估多个开源LLM发现所有模型都表现出不同程度的刻板印象偏见，其中残疾相关偏见尤为持久，宗教偏见相对较低可能得益于全球去偏见努力。

Conclusion: 研究证明了需要更公平的模型开发，特别是在文化多样化背景下，当前的去偏见方法在特定文化维度上仍存在不足。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant traction across critical
domains owing to their impressive contextual understanding and generative
capabilities. However, their increasing deployment in high stakes applications
necessitates rigorous evaluation of embedded biases, particularly in culturally
diverse contexts like India where existing embedding-based bias assessment
methods often fall short in capturing nuanced stereotypes. We propose an
evaluation framework based on a encoder trained using contrastive learning that
captures fine-grained bias through embedding similarity. We also introduce a
novel dataset - IndiCASA (IndiBias-based Contextually Aligned Stereotypes and
Anti-stereotypes) comprising 2,575 human-validated sentences spanning five
demographic axes: caste, gender, religion, disability, and socioeconomic
status. Our evaluation of multiple open-weight LLMs reveals that all models
exhibit some degree of stereotypical bias, with disability related biases being
notably persistent, and religion bias generally lower likely due to global
debiasing efforts demonstrating the need for fairer model development.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自感知强化学习方法，通过让LLM交替生成任务并尝试解决，结合难度预测和极限突破机制，在仅需少量额外数据的情况下显著提升模型推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL训练需要大量标注数据，成本高昂。本文旨在探索如何用最少的数据通过RL提升LLM的推理能力。

Method: 采用自感知方法：1）自感知难度预测 - 模型评估任务难度并优先选择具有挑战性但可解决的任务；2）自感知极限突破 - 模型识别超出能力范围的任务并主动请求外部数据突破极限。

Result: 在9个基准测试上实现了53.8%的相对提升，仅使用不到1.2%的额外数据。

Conclusion: 自感知RL方法有效，展示了自进化智能体训练的前景。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but such training
typically demands substantial efforts in creating and annotating data. In this
work, we explore improving LLMs through RL with minimal data. Our approach
alternates between the LLM proposing a task and then attempting to solve it. To
minimize data dependency, we introduce two novel mechanisms grounded in
self-awareness: (1) self-aware difficulty prediction, where the model learns to
assess task difficulty relative to its own abilities and prioritize challenging
yet solvable tasks, and (2) self-aware limit breaking, where the model
recognizes when a task is beyond its capability boundary and proactively
requests external data to break through that limit. Extensive experiments on
nine benchmarks showing a 53.8% relative improvement with less than 1.2% extra
data demonstrate the efficacy of self-aware RL and underscore the promise of
self-evolving agent training.

TL;DR: XTRA是一个跨语言主题建模框架，通过表示对齐和主题对齐机制，在共享语义空间中学习可解释且跨语言一致的主题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨语言主题建模方法在主题多样性方面有所改进，但难以确保高主题连贯性和跨语言一致性对齐。

Method: XTRA结合词袋模型和多语言嵌入，采用表示对齐（通过对比学习对齐文档-主题分布）和主题对齐（将主题-词分布投影到共享空间）的双重机制。

Result: 在多语言语料库上的实验表明，XTRA在主题连贯性、多样性和对齐质量方面显著优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: XTRA框架能够学习到可解释（连贯且多样）且跨语言对齐良好的主题，为跨语言主题建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-lingual topic modeling aims to uncover shared semantic themes across
languages. Several methods have been proposed to address this problem,
leveraging both traditional and neural approaches. While previous methods have
achieved some improvements in topic diversity, they often struggle to ensure
high topic coherence and consistent alignment across languages. We propose XTRA
(Cross-Lingual Topic Modeling with Topic and Representation Alignments), a
novel framework that unifies Bag-of-Words modeling with multilingual
embeddings. XTRA introduces two core components: (1) representation alignment,
aligning document-topic distributions via contrastive learning in a shared
semantic space; and (2) topic alignment, projecting topic-word distributions
into the same space to enforce crosslingual consistency. This dual mechanism
enables XTRA to learn topics that are interpretable (coherent and diverse) and
well-aligned across languages. Experiments on multilingual corpora confirm that
XTRA significantly outperforms strong baselines in topic coherence, diversity,
and alignment quality. Code and reproducible scripts are available at https:

TL;DR: 该论文提出了SIMPA框架，通过匹配用户生成语句与验证问卷项目，实现可解释的人格评估，解决了人格心理学与NLP之间的脱节问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人格评估中大型标注数据集稀缺以及人格心理学与自然语言处理领域脱节的问题，提高模型有效性和可解释性。

Method: 收集Reddit平台的MBTI9k和PANDORA数据集，开发SIMPA框架使用机器学习和语义相似性匹配用户语句与问卷项目。

Result: 实验显示人口统计变量影响模型有效性，SIMPA框架在人格评估方面达到与人类评估相当的效果，同时保持高可解释性和效率。

Conclusion: SIMPA框架不仅适用于人格评估，其模型无关设计、分层线索检测和可扩展性使其适用于涉及复杂标签分类学和变量线索关联的各种应用。

Abstract: Personality refers to individual differences in behavior, thinking, and
feeling. With the growing availability of digital footprints, especially from
social media, automated methods for personality assessment have become
increasingly important. Natural language processing (NLP) enables the analysis
of unstructured text data to identify personality indicators. However, two main
challenges remain central to this thesis: the scarcity of large,
personality-labeled datasets and the disconnect between personality psychology
and NLP, which restricts model validity and interpretability. To address these
challenges, this thesis presents two datasets -- MBTI9k and PANDORA --
collected from Reddit, a platform known for user anonymity and diverse
discussions. The PANDORA dataset contains 17 million comments from over 10,000
users and integrates the MBTI and Big Five personality models with demographic
information, overcoming limitations in data size, quality, and label coverage.
Experiments on these datasets show that demographic variables influence model
validity. In response, the SIMPA (Statement-to-Item Matching Personality
Assessment) framework was developed - a computational framework for
interpretable personality assessment that matches user-generated statements
with validated questionnaire items. By using machine learning and semantic
similarity, SIMPA delivers personality assessments comparable to human
evaluations while maintaining high interpretability and efficiency. Although
focused on personality assessment, SIMPA's versatility extends beyond this
domain. Its model-agnostic design, layered cue detection, and scalability make
it suitable for various research and practical applications involving complex
label taxonomies and variable cue associations with target concepts.

TL;DR: StepChain GraphRAG框架通过结合问题分解和广度优先搜索推理流程，在多跳问答任务中实现了最先进的性能表现，提升了准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前检索增强生成在多跳问答中面临迭代推理步骤与外部知识检索整合的挑战，需要更有效的方法来构建明确的证据链。

Method: 首先构建全局索引，推理时仅将检索到的段落实时解析为知识图谱，将复杂查询分解为子问题，然后基于BFS遍历动态扩展相关边，组装明确的证据链。

Result: 在MuSiQue、2WikiMultiHopQA和HotpotQA数据集上达到最先进的精确匹配和F1分数，平均EM提升2.57%，F1提升2.13%，在HotpotQA上提升最大（+4.70% EM，+3.44% F1）。

Conclusion: 该框架通过保留中间检索步骤的思维链增强了可解释性，未来工作应关注减少计算开销和解决大语言模型的幻觉问题，以提升多跳问答的效率和可靠性。

Abstract: Recent progress in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has led to more
accurate and interpretable multi-hop question answering (QA). Yet, challenges
persist in integrating iterative reasoning steps with external knowledge
retrieval. To address this, we introduce StepChain GraphRAG, a framework that
unites question decomposition with a Breadth-First Search (BFS) Reasoning Flow
for enhanced multi-hop QA. Our approach first builds a global index over the
corpus; at inference time, only retrieved passages are parsed on-the-fly into a
knowledge graph, and the complex query is split into sub-questions. For each
sub-question, a BFS-based traversal dynamically expands along relevant edges,
assembling explicit evidence chains without overwhelming the language model
with superfluous context. Experiments on MuSiQue, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and HotpotQA
show that StepChain GraphRAG achieves state-of-the-art Exact Match and F1
scores. StepChain GraphRAG lifts average EM by 2.57% and F1 by 2.13% over the
SOTA method, achieving the largest gain on HotpotQA (+4.70% EM, +3.44% F1).
StepChain GraphRAG also fosters enhanced explainability by preserving the
chain-of-thought across intermediate retrieval steps. We conclude by discussing
how future work can mitigate the computational overhead and address potential
hallucinations from large language models to refine efficiency and reliability
in multi-hop QA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型在物种保护评估中的可靠性，因为LLMs正被快速应用于生物多样性保护领域，但其评估物种的可靠性尚不确定。

Method: 对5个领先的大语言模型在21,955个物种上进行系统验证，涵盖IUCN红色名录的四个核心评估组件：分类学、保护状态、分布和威胁。

Result: 发现关键悖论：模型在分类学分类上表现出色(94.9%)，但在保护推理上持续失败(状态评估仅27.2%)。所有模型都表现出系统性偏见，偏爱有魅力的脊椎动物。

Conclusion: 建议采用混合方法，LLMs作为信息检索工具增强专家能力，但人类专家应保留风险评估和政策的最终决策权。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted in conservation to
address the biodiversity crisis, yet their reliability for species evaluation
is uncertain. This study systematically validates five leading models on 21,955
species across four core IUCN Red List assessment components: taxonomy,
conservation status, distribution, and threats. A critical paradox was
revealed: models excelled at taxonomic classification (94.9%) but consistently
failed at conservation reasoning (27.2% for status assessment). This
knowledge-reasoning gap, evident across all models, suggests inherent
architectural constraints, not just data limitations. Furthermore, models
exhibited systematic biases favoring charismatic vertebrates, potentially
amplifying existing conservation inequities. These findings delineate clear
boundaries for responsible LLM deployment: they are powerful tools for
information retrieval but require human oversight for judgment-based decisions.
A hybrid approach is recommended, where LLMs augment expert capacity while
human experts retain sole authority over risk assessment and policy.

TL;DR: 提出了首个完整的Wordle CSP公式化方法，包含约束感知的求解策略，在信息增益计算和概率约束处理方面有创新，在英语和西班牙语词典上都取得了优异的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Wordle求解器依赖信息论熵最大化或基于频率的启发式方法，缺乏正式的约束处理，需要开发基于约束满足问题的系统化求解方法。

Method: 引入CSP感知熵（在约束传播后计算信息增益）和概率CSP框架（将贝叶斯词频先验与逻辑约束集成），并进行了噪声鲁棒性和跨语言验证。

Result: CSP感知熵平均3.54次猜测，成功率99.9%，比前向检查提升1.7%，运行时间快46%；在10%噪声下保持5.3个百分点优势；概率CSP在所有噪声水平下达到100%成功率；西班牙语验证88%成功率且无需语言特定调优。

Conclusion: 形式化的CSP处理、约束感知启发式、概率-逻辑集成、鲁棒性分析和跨词典验证建立了新的性能基准，证明了原则性约束满足技术在结构化谜题求解领域优于经典信息论和基于学习的方法。

Abstract: Wordle presents an algorithmically rich testbed for constraint satisfaction
problem (CSP) solving. While existing solvers rely on information-theoretic
entropy maximization or frequency-based heuristics without formal constraint
treatment, we present the first comprehensive CSP formulation of Wordle with
novel constraint-aware solving strategies. We introduce CSP-Aware Entropy,
computing information gain after constraint propagation rather than on raw
candidate sets, and a Probabilistic CSP framework integrating Bayesian
word-frequency priors with logical constraints. Through evaluation on 2,315
English words, CSP-Aware Entropy achieves 3.54 average guesses with 99.9%
success rate, a statistically significant 1.7% improvement over Forward
Checking (t=-4.82, p<0.001, Cohen's d=0.07) with 46% faster runtime (12.9ms
versus 23.7ms per guess). Under 10% noise, CSP-aware approaches maintain 5.3
percentage point advantages (29.0% versus 23.7%, p=0.041), while Probabilistic
CSP achieves 100% success across all noise levels (0-20%) through constraint
recovery mechanisms. Cross-lexicon validation on 500 Spanish words demonstrates
88% success with zero language-specific tuning, validating that core CSP
principles transfer across languages despite an 11.2 percentage point gap from
linguistic differences (p<0.001, Fisher's exact test). Our open-source
implementation with 34 unit tests achieving 91% code coverage provides
reproducible infrastructure for CSP research. The combination of formal CSP
treatment, constraint-aware heuristics, probabilistic-logical integration,
robustness analysis, and cross-lexicon validation establishes new performance
benchmarks demonstrating that principled constraint satisfaction techniques
outperform classical information-theoretic and learning-based approaches for
structured puzzle-solving domains.

TL;DR: SRGen是一个轻量级测试时框架，通过在不确定点进行自我反思来改进LLM的推理能力，无需昂贵训练即可动态修正高不确定性token的概率分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在长链推理任务中前向自回归生成过程的脆弱性，避免早期token错误级联传播，提供更高效的自反思机制。

Method: 使用动态熵阈值识别高不确定性token，为每个识别出的token训练特定修正向量，利用已生成上下文进行自反思生成来修正token概率分布。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中显著提升模型性能，DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B在AIME2024上Pass@1提升12.0%，Cons@5提升13.3%。

Conclusion: SRGen作为即插即用方法，将反思集成到生成过程中，实现可靠LLM推理，具有有限开销和广泛兼容性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly solve complex reasoning tasks via
long chain-of-thought, but their forward-only autoregressive generation process
is fragile; early token errors can cascade, which creates a clear need for
self-reflection mechanisms. However, existing self-reflection either performs
revisions over full drafts or learns self-correction via expensive training,
both fundamentally reactive and inefficient. To address this, we propose
Self-Reflective Generation at Test Time (SRGen), a lightweight test-time
framework that reflects before generating at uncertain points. During token
generation, SRGen utilizes dynamic entropy thresholding to identify
high-uncertainty tokens. For each identified token, it trains a specific
corrective vector, which fully exploits the already generated context for a
self-reflective generation to correct the token probability distribution. By
retrospectively analyzing the partial output, this self-reflection enables more
trustworthy decisions, thereby significantly reducing the probability of errors
at highly uncertain points. Evaluated on challenging mathematical reasoning
benchmarks and a diverse set of LLMs, SRGen can consistently strengthen model
reasoning: improvements in single-pass quality also translate into stronger
self-consistency voting. Especially, on AIME2024 with
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, SRGen yields absolute improvements of +12.0% on
Pass@1 and +13.3% on Cons@5. Moreover, our findings position SRGen as a
plug-and-play method that integrates reflection into the generation process for
reliable LLM reasoning, achieving consistent gains with bounded overhead and
broad composability with other training-time (e.g., RLHF) and test-time (e.g.,
SLOT) techniques.

Motivation: LLM在特定领域数据集上微调时可能使用受版权保护的内容，现有检测方法需要内部信号或干净参考数据集，限制了实际应用。水印技术虽然可行，但可能降低文本质量或任务性能。

Method: TRACE使用私钥指导的无失真水印重写数据集，保持文本质量和下游效用。检测时利用微调对水印数据的放射性效应，引入熵门控程序选择性评分高不确定性token，显著增强检测能力。

Result: 在多样化数据集和模型家族上，TRACE始终实现显著检测（p<0.05），通常具有极强的统计证据。支持多数据集归因，即使在大规模非水印语料上继续预训练后仍保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TRACE为受版权数据集使用的可靠黑盒验证提供了一条实用途径，解决了现有方法的局限性，同时保持文本质量和任务性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on smaller,
domain-specific datasets to improve downstream performance. These datasets
often contain proprietary or copyrighted material, raising the need for
reliable safeguards against unauthorized use. Existing membership inference
attacks (MIAs) and dataset-inference methods typically require access to
internal signals such as logits, while current black-box approaches often rely
on handcrafted prompts or a clean reference dataset for calibration, both of
which limit practical applicability. Watermarking is a promising alternative,
but prior techniques can degrade text quality or reduce task performance. We
propose TRACE, a practical framework for fully black-box detection of
copyrighted dataset usage in LLM fine-tuning. \texttt{TRACE} rewrites datasets
with distortion-free watermarks guided by a private key, ensuring both text
quality and downstream utility. At detection time, we exploit the radioactivity
effect of fine-tuning on watermarked data and introduce an entropy-gated
procedure that selectively scores high-uncertainty tokens, substantially
amplifying detection power. Across diverse datasets and model families, TRACE
consistently achieves significant detections (p<0.05), often with extremely
strong statistical evidence. Furthermore, it supports multi-dataset attribution
and remains robust even after continued pretraining on large non-watermarked
corpora. These results establish TRACE as a practical route to reliable
black-box verification of copyrighted dataset usage. We will make our code
available at: https://github.com/NusIoraPrivacy/TRACE.

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于检索增强生成(RAG)的系统，用于查询英国NICE临床指南，该系统通过混合嵌入机制实现高效检索，显著提高了回答的准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NICE临床指南篇幅长、数量多，在时间紧迫的医疗系统中难以有效利用，需要一种能够快速提供精确信息的解决方案。

Method: 采用检索增强生成(RAG)架构，结合混合嵌入机制，从300份指南的10,195个文本块中检索信息，使用大型语言模型生成回答。

Result: 系统表现出色：平均倒数排名0.814，首块召回率81%，前10块召回率99.1%；RAG增强模型在忠实度方面提升64.7个百分点至99.5%，上下文精确度达1.0。

Conclusion: RAG被证明是医疗保健领域应用生成式AI的有效、可靠且可扩展的方法，能够经济高效地访问医疗指南。

Abstract: This paper presents the development and evaluation of a Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) system for querying the United Kingdom's National Institute
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guidelines using Large Language
Models (LLMs). The extensive length and volume of these guidelines can impede
their utilisation within a time-constrained healthcare system, a challenge this
project addresses through the creation of a system capable of providing users
with precisely matched information in response to natural language queries. The
system's retrieval architecture, composed of a hybrid embedding mechanism, was
evaluated against a database of 10,195 text chunks derived from three hundred
guidelines. It demonstrates high performance, with a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)
of 0.814, a Recall of 81% at the first chunk and of 99.1% within the top ten
retrieved chunks, when evaluated on 7901 queries.
  The most significant impact of the RAG system was observed during the
generation phase. When evaluated on a manually curated dataset of seventy
question-answer pairs, RAG-enhanced models showed substantial gains in
performance. Faithfulness, the measure of whether an answer is supported by the
source text, was increased by 64.7 percentage points to 99.5% for the
RAG-enhanced O4-Mini model and significantly outperformed the medical-focused
Meditron3-8B LLM, which scored 43%. This, combined with a perfect Context
Precision score of 1 for all RAG-enhanced models, confirms the system's ability
to prevent information fabrication by grounding its answers in relevant source
material. This study thus establishes RAG as an effective, reliable, and
scalable approach for applying generative AI in healthcare, enabling
cost-effective access to medical guidelines.

Motivation: 语音情感识别对于改善人机交互至关重要，但由于语音中情感细微差别的复杂性，其准确性仍然受限。

Method: 通过观看情感丰富的电影片段后记录参与者描述经历的音频片段，收集意图情感标签、自评情绪反应和效价/唤醒分数。

Conclusion: 这些发现为人类-AI交互中的语音情感识别应用提供了指导，并为开发更具上下文感知能力的AI系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is essential for improving human-computer
interaction, yet its accuracy remains constrained by the complexity of
emotional nuances in speech. In this study, we distinguish between descriptive
semantics, which represents the contextual content of speech, and expressive
semantics, which reflects the speaker's emotional state. After watching
emotionally charged movie segments, we recorded audio clips of participants
describing their experiences, along with the intended emotion tags for each
clip, participants' self-rated emotional responses, and their valence/arousal
scores. Through experiments, we show that descriptive semantics align with
intended emotions, while expressive semantics correlate with evoked emotions.
Our findings inform SER applications in human-AI interaction and pave the way
for more context-aware AI systems.

Method: 通过将ASR语料库的转录文本伪标注翻译成六种欧洲语言，在不同数据规模下训练基于LLM的S2TT系统，并比较CoT和直接提示两种策略。

Result: 随着数据量的增加，直接提示方法表现出更一致的改进，而CoT提示的改善相对不稳定。

Conclusion: 随着更大规模的S2TT资源被创建，直接提示可能成为更有效的方法。

Abstract: Recent work on Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT) has focused on LLM-based
models, introducing the increasingly adopted Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting,
where the model is guided to first transcribe the speech and then translate it.
CoT typically outperforms direct prompting primarily because it can exploit
abundant Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Text-to-Text Translation (T2TT)
datasets to explicitly model its steps. In this paper, we systematically
compare CoT and Direct prompting under increasing amounts of S2TT data. To this
end, we pseudo-label an ASR corpus by translating its transcriptions into six
European languages, and train LLM-based S2TT systems with both prompting
strategies at different data scales. Our results show that Direct improves more
consistently as the amount of data increases, suggesting that it may become a
more effective approach as larger S2TT resources are created.

TL;DR: 本文提出Llama-EntScore方法，结合Llama 3.1和命名实体识别(NER)来比较放射学报告，为初级放射科医生提供可解释的语义差异分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射学报告评估对放射科医生培训至关重要，但现有大型语言模型在专业医学领域应用存在挑战，需要专门领域知识来准确比较初步报告和最终报告之间的语义差异。

Method: 提出Llama-EntScore方法，结合Llama 3.1和NER，使用可调权重来强调或弱化特定类型的差异，生成定量相似性分数并提供解释。

Result: 该方法达到67%的精确匹配准确率和93%的±1范围内的准确率，优于单独使用LLM或NER方法。

Conclusion: Llama-EntScore方法能有效比较放射学报告，为初级医生提供有价值的反馈，有助于改进报告质量和临床知识。

Abstract: Radiology report evaluation is a crucial part of radiologists' training and
plays a key role in ensuring diagnostic accuracy. As part of the standard
reporting workflow, a junior radiologist typically prepares a preliminary
report, which is then reviewed and edited by a senior radiologist to produce
the final report. Identifying semantic differences between preliminary and
final reports is essential for junior doctors, both as a training tool and to
help uncover gaps in clinical knowledge. While AI in radiology is a rapidly
growing field, the application of large language models (LLMs) remains
challenging due to the need for specialised domain knowledge. In this paper, we
explore the ability of LLMs to provide explainable and accurate comparisons of
reports in the radiology domain. We begin by comparing the performance of
several LLMs in comparing radiology reports. We then assess a more traditional
approach based on Named-Entity-Recognition (NER). However, both approaches
exhibit limitations in delivering accurate feedback on semantic similarity. To
address this, we propose Llama-EntScore, a semantic similarity scoring method
using a combination of Llama 3.1 and NER with tunable weights to emphasise or
de-emphasise specific types of differences. Our approach generates a
quantitative similarity score for tracking progress and also gives an
interpretation of the score that aims to offer valuable guidance in reviewing
and refining their reporting. We find our method achieves 67% exact-match
accuracy and 93% accuracy within +/- 1 when compared to radiologist-provided
ground truth scores - outperforming both LLMs and NER used independently. Code

TL;DR: 论文分析了语音到文本翻译中的思维链方法，发现其实际上主要依赖转录文本而非语音信号，与级联系统行为相似，未能充分利用声学信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语音到文本翻译系统中级联方法存在的错误传播和无法利用韵律等声学线索的问题，探索思维链方法是否能真正克服这些限制。

Method: 通过归因分析、使用损坏转录的鲁棒性评估以及韵律感知测试来分析思维链方法的行为特征。

Result: 思维链方法主要依赖转录文本，很少利用语音信号，与级联系统行为相似。通过添加直接语音到文本翻译数据或注入噪声转录等简单训练干预，可以增强鲁棒性并提高语音归因。

Conclusion: 思维链方法并未实现预期的优势，需要设计能明确整合声学信息到翻译过程中的架构。

Abstract: Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT) systems built from Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR) and Text-to-Text Translation (T2TT) modules face two major
limitations: error propagation and the inability to exploit prosodic or other
acoustic cues. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has recently been introduced,
with the expectation that jointly accessing speech and transcription will
overcome these issues. Analyzing CoT through attribution methods, robustness
evaluations with corrupted transcripts, and prosody-awareness, we find that it
largely mirrors cascaded behavior, relying mainly on transcripts while barely
leveraging speech. Simple training interventions, such as adding Direct S2TT
data or noisy transcript injection, enhance robustness and increase speech
attribution. These findings challenge the assumed advantages of CoT and
highlight the need for architectures that explicitly integrate acoustic
information into translation.

Method: 构建包含11,343篇arXiv论文和4,947篇高质量综述的数据集，采用多维度指标评估大纲质量、内容质量和非文本丰富性，并设计了基于内容和基于问答的双重评估协议。

Result: SurveyBench有效挑战了现有LLM4Survey方法，在基于内容的评估中平均比人类低21%。

Conclusion: SurveyBench填补了自动文献综述评估的空白，为改进相关方法提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Academic survey writing, which distills vast literature into a coherent and
insightful narrative, remains a labor-intensive and intellectually demanding
task. While recent approaches, such as general DeepResearch agents and
survey-specialized methods, can generate surveys automatically (a.k.a.
LLM4Survey), their outputs often fall short of human standards and there lacks
a rigorous, reader-aligned benchmark for thoroughly revealing their
deficiencies. To fill the gap, we propose a fine-grained, quiz-driven
evaluation framework SurveyBench, featuring (1) typical survey topics source
from recent 11,343 arXiv papers and corresponding 4,947 high-quality surveys;
(2) a multifaceted metric hierarchy that assesses the outline quality (e.g.,
coverage breadth, logical coherence), content quality (e.g., synthesis
granularity, clarity of insights), and non-textual richness; and (3) a
dual-mode evaluation protocol that includes content-based and quiz-based
answerability tests, explicitly aligned with readers' informational needs.
Results show SurveyBench effectively challenges existing LLM4Survey approaches
(e.g., on average 21% lower than human in content-based evaluation).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的置信度校准对于可靠部署至关重要，但在多语言环境中这一关键特性尚未得到充分探索，需要研究非英语语言的校准问题。

Method: 对6个模型家族和100多种语言进行大规模校准研究，分析模型内部表示，发现最终层存在英语中心偏见，提出基于中间层的语言感知置信度集成方法。

Result: 研究发现非英语语言校准明显差于英语，中间层比最终层提供更可靠和校准更好的信号，提出的LACE方法能有效改善多语言校准。

Conclusion: 英语中心对齐存在隐藏成本，通过超越最终层的方法可以构建更公平可信的大语言模型。

Abstract: Confidence calibration, the alignment of a model's predicted confidence with
its actual accuracy, is crucial for the reliable deployment of Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, this critical property remains largely under-explored
in multilingual contexts. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale,
systematic studies of multilingual calibration across six model families and
over 100 languages, revealing that non-English languages suffer from
systematically worse calibration. To diagnose this, we investigate the model's
internal representations and find that the final layer, biased by
English-centric training, provides a poor signal for multilingual confidence.
In contrast, our layer-wise analysis uncovers a key insight that
late-intermediate layers consistently offer a more reliable and
better-calibrated signal. Building on this, we introduce a suite of
training-free methods, including Language-Aware Confidence Ensemble (LACE),
which adaptively selects an optimal ensemble of layers for each specific
language. Our study highlights the hidden costs of English-centric alignment
and offer a new path toward building more globally equitable and trustworthy
LLMs by looking beyond the final layer.

TL;DR: 本文提出EditLens模型，能够检测AI编辑文本并量化编辑程度，在区分人类写作、AI生成和混合写作方面达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大量LLM查询涉及编辑用户提供的文本而非全新生成，但现有研究主要关注检测完全AI生成的文本，缺乏对AI编辑文本的检测方法。

Method: 首先使用轻量级相似度指标量化AI编辑程度，并用人类标注验证；然后基于这些指标训练EditLens回归模型预测AI编辑量。

Result: 模型在二元分类(F1=94.7%)和三元分类(F1=90.4%)任务中达到SOTA性能，并能分析Grammarly等写作辅助工具的编辑效果。

Conclusion: AI编辑文本可被检测，且AI对人工写作的修改程度也可量化，这对作者归属、教育和政策具有重要意义。

Abstract: A significant proportion of queries to large language models ask them to edit
user-provided text, rather than generate new text from scratch. While previous
work focuses on detecting fully AI-generated text, we demonstrate that
AI-edited text is distinguishable from human-written and AI-generated text.
First, we propose using lightweight similarity metrics to quantify the
magnitude of AI editing present in a text given the original human-written text
and validate these metrics with human annotators. Using these similarity
metrics as intermediate supervision, we then train EditLens, a regression model
that predicts the amount of AI editing present within a text. Our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance on both binary (F1=94.7%) and ternary
(F1=90.4%) classification tasks in distinguishing human, AI, and mixed writing.
Not only do we show that AI-edited text can be detected, but also that the
degree of change made by AI to human writing can be detected, which has
implications for authorship attribution, education, and policy. Finally, as a
case study, we use our model to analyze the effects of AI-edits applied by
Grammarly, a popular writing assistance tool. To encourage further research, we
commit to publicly releasing our models and dataset.

Motivation: 验证先前研究中发现的大语言模型隐藏状态与fMRI脑响应之间相关性的稳健性，排除维度灾难等潜在问题，为这些模型的生物合理性和可解释性提供更强证据。

Method: 使用维度缩减技术验证相关性不受维度影响，采用新的相似性度量方法，比较不同训练数据的模型，并测试位置编码的作用。

Result: 确认先前相关性结果在维度缩减后依然存在，新相似性度量支持原结论，相关性特定于人类语言训练的模型，且依赖于位置编码。

Conclusion: 研究结果强化了先前关于大语言模型与大脑状态表征相似性的发现，为大语言模型的生物合理性和可解释性辩论提供了更坚实的证据。

Abstract: Previous work has shown correlations between the hidden states of large
language models and fMRI brain responses, on language tasks. These correlations
have been taken as evidence of the representational similarity of these models
and brain states. This study tests whether these previous results are robust to
several possible concerns. Specifically this study shows: (i) that the previous
results are still found after dimensionality reduction, and thus are not
attributable to the curse of dimensionality; (ii) that previous results are
confirmed when using new measures of similarity; (iii) that correlations
between brain representations and those from models are specific to models
trained on human language; and (iv) that the results are dependent on the
presence of positional encoding in the models. These results confirm and
strengthen the results of previous research and contribute to the debate on the
biological plausibility and interpretability of state-of-the-art large language
models.

Result: 系统比较了神经主题模型和LLM在主题质量方面的表现，为"大多数神经主题模型已过时"的说法提供了实证检验。

Conclusion: 在大语言模型时代，主题建模可以重新定义为长文本生成任务，LLM通过零样本提示能够与神经主题模型竞争，挑战了传统主题建模方法。

Abstract: Traditional topic models such as neural topic models rely on inference and
generation networks to learn latent topic distributions. This paper explores a
new paradigm for topic modeling in the era of large language models, framing TM
as a long-form generation task whose definition is updated in this paradigm. We
propose a simple but practical approach to implement LLM-based topic model
tasks out of the box (sample a data subset, generate topics and representative
text with our prompt, text assignment with keyword match). We then investigate
whether the long-form generation paradigm can beat NTMs via zero-shot
prompting. We conduct a systematic comparison between NTMs and LLMs in terms of
topic quality and empirically examine the claim that "a majority of NTMs are
outdated."

TL;DR: NN-Rank是一种基于多语言模型隐藏表示和无标注目标语言数据的源语言排序算法，在词性标注和命名实体识别任务上优于现有方法，即使使用少量目标语言数据也能产生高质量排序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的跨语言迁移方法在源语言选择上依赖词汇和语言特征，但缺乏利用多语言模型表示和无标注目标语言数据的能力。

Method: 利用多语言模型的隐藏表示和无标注目标语言数据，通过计算表示相似度来对源语言进行排序。

Result: 在词性标注任务上NDCG提升达35.56，命名实体识别任务上提升18.14；使用仅25个目标语言样本就能达到全数据92.8%的排序效果。

Conclusion: NN-Rank提供了一种有效且数据高效的源语言排序方法，显著优于现有基线，在数据稀缺场景下仍保持竞争力。

Abstract: We present NN-Rank, an algorithm for ranking source languages for
cross-lingual transfer, which leverages hidden representations from
multilingual models and unlabeled target-language data. We experiment with two
pretrained multilingual models and two tasks: part-of-speech tagging (POS) and
named entity recognition (NER). We consider 51 source languages and evaluate on
56 and 72 target languages for POS and NER, respectively. When using in-domain
data, NN-Rank beats state-of-the-art baselines that leverage lexical and
linguistic features, with average improvements of up to 35.56 NDCG for POS and
18.14 NDCG for NER. As prior approaches can fall back to language-level
features if target language data is not available, we show that NN-Rank remains
competitive using only the Bible, an out-of-domain corpus available for a large
number of languages. Ablations on the amount of unlabeled target data show
that, for subsets consisting of as few as 25 examples, NN-Rank produces
high-quality rankings which achieve 92.8% of the NDCG achieved using all
available target data for ranking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Web代理处理过长网页内容时会超出上下文限制、增加计算成本，并面临提示注入等安全风险。现有的修剪策略要么丢弃相关内容，要么保留无关上下文，导致动作预测不理想。

Method: 利用轻量级LLM检索器，根据任务目标从可访问性树观察中提取最相关的行，通过修剪噪声和无关内容来优化观察处理。

Result: 在WorkArena和WebArena基准测试中，FocusAgent在保持强基线性能的同时，将观察大小减少了50%以上。其变体显著降低了提示注入攻击（包括横幅和弹窗攻击）的成功率，同时在无攻击环境中保持任务成功性能。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的目标检索是构建高效、有效且安全的Web代理的实用且鲁棒的策略。

Abstract: Web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) must process lengthy web
page observations to complete user goals; these pages often exceed tens of
thousands of tokens. This saturates context limits and increases computational
cost processing; moreover, processing full pages exposes agents to security
risks such as prompt injection. Existing pruning strategies either discard
relevant content or retain irrelevant context, leading to suboptimal action
prediction. We introduce FocusAgent, a simple yet effective approach that
leverages a lightweight LLM retriever to extract the most relevant lines from
accessibility tree (AxTree) observations, guided by task goals. By pruning
noisy and irrelevant content, FocusAgent enables efficient reasoning while
reducing vulnerability to injection attacks. Experiments on WorkArena and
WebArena benchmarks show that FocusAgent matches the performance of strong
baselines, while reducing observation size by over 50%. Furthermore, a variant
of FocusAgent significantly reduces the success rate of prompt-injection
attacks, including banner and pop-up attacks, while maintaining task success
performance in attack-free settings. Our results highlight that targeted
LLM-based retrieval is a practical and robust strategy for building web agents
that are efficient, effective, and secure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多LLM系统通过文本通信会丢失丰富语义信息并产生token级生成延迟，需要探索超越文本的通信方式

Method: 使用神经网络投影和融合源模型与目标模型的KV-Cache，实现直接语义传输；采用可学习门控机制选择受益于缓存通信的目标层

Result: C2C比单个模型平均准确率提高8.5-10.5%，比文本通信范式性能提升约3.0-5.0%，同时延迟平均加速2.0倍

Conclusion: KV-Cache可作为有效的模型间通信媒介，C2C通过直接语义通信避免了中间文本生成，实现了更好的性能和效率

Abstract: Multi-LLM systems harness the complementary strengths of diverse Large
Language Models, achieving performance and efficiency gains unattainable by a
single model. In existing designs, LLMs communicate through text, forcing
internal representations to be transformed into output token sequences. This
process both loses rich semantic information and incurs token-by-token
generation latency. Motivated by these limitations, we ask: Can LLMs
communicate beyond text? Oracle experiments show that enriching the KV-Cache
semantics can improve response quality without increasing cache size,
supporting KV-Cache as an effective medium for inter-model communication. Thus,
we propose Cache-to-Cache (C2C), a new paradigm for direct semantic
communication between LLMs. C2C uses a neural network to project and fuse the
source model's KV-cache with that of the target model to enable direct semantic
transfer. A learnable gating mechanism selects the target layers that benefit
from cache communication. Compared with text communication, C2C utilizes the
deep, specialized semantics from both models, while avoiding explicit
intermediate text generation. Experiments show that C2C achieves 8.5-10.5%
higher average accuracy than individual models. It further outperforms the text
communication paradigm by approximately 3.0-5.0%, while delivering an average
2.0x speedup in latency. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着推理链的延长，关键的中间步骤和原始提示会被淹没在上下文中，导致注意力不足和错误。需要一种方法来引导LLM在复杂推理任务中保持注意力。

Method: 将推理轨迹分解为结构化计划，自动对齐模型注意力到最相关的推理步骤，使模型在整个生成过程中保持专注。

Result: 在六个基准测试中优于最先进的提示方法，显著缩小了"非推理"模型与专用推理模型之间的性能差距。

Conclusion: Self-Anchor有潜力使大多数LLM无需重新训练即可处理复杂推理任务，为提示方法提供了轻量级替代方案。

Abstract: To solve complex reasoning tasks for Large Language Models (LLMs),
prompting-based methods offer a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning. However, as reasoning chains extend, critical
intermediate steps and the original prompt will be buried in the context,
receiving insufficient attention and leading to errors. In this paper, we
propose Self-Anchor, a novel pipeline that leverages the inherent structure of
reasoning to steer LLM attention. Self-Anchor decomposes reasoning trajectories
into structured plans and automatically aligns the model's attention to the
most relevant inference steps, allowing the model to maintain focus throughout
generation. Our experiment shows that Self-Anchor outperforms SOTA prompting
methods across six benchmarks. Notably, Self-Anchor significantly reduces the
performance gap between ``non-reasoning'' models and specialized reasoning
models, with the potential to enable most LLMs to tackle complex reasoning
tasks without retraining.

Conclusion: 奖励模型和评估指标研究领域的更紧密合作有助于克服共同挑战，提高模型训练和评估的质量。

Abstract: The emergence of reinforcement learning in post-training of large language
models has sparked significant interest in reward models. Reward models assess
the quality of sampled model outputs to generate training signals. This task is
also performed by evaluation metrics that monitor the performance of an AI
model. We find that the two research areas are mostly separate, leading to
redundant terminology and repeated pitfalls. Common challenges include
susceptibility to spurious correlations, impact on downstream reward hacking,
methods to improve data quality, and approaches to meta-evaluation. Our
position paper argues that a closer collaboration between the fields can help
overcome these issues. To that end, we show how metrics outperform reward
models on specific tasks and provide an extensive survey of the two areas.
Grounded in this survey, we point to multiple research topics in which closer
alignment can improve reward models and metrics in areas such as preference
elicitation methods, avoidance of spurious correlations and reward hacking, and
calibration-aware meta-evaluation.

Motivation: 当前网络代理评估局限于沙盒环境或人工任务，需要真实开放网络环境下的评估平台来发现实际应用中的失败模式。

Method: 构建BrowserArena平台，收集用户任务，进行Arena式头对头比较，使用步骤级人工反馈分析代理轨迹，并针对发现的失败模式构建专门数据集进行研究。

Result: 识别出三个一致的失败模式：验证码解析、弹窗移除和直接URL导航。发现不同语言模型在这些任务上表现各异，如o4-mini使用更多策略绕过验证码，而DeepSeek-R1在验证码解析上误导用户。

Conclusion: 当前网络代理存在多样性和脆弱性，该基准测试方法为大规模评估和理解网络代理失败模式提供了有效途径。

Abstract: LLM web agents now browse and take actions on the open web, yet current agent
evaluations are constrained to sandboxed environments or artificial tasks. We
introduce BrowserArena, a live open-web agent evaluation platform that collects
user-submitted tasks, runs Arena-style head-to-head comparisons, and uses
step-level human feedback to surface failure modes. Collecting and analyzing
step-level annotations on the agent traces, we identify three consistent
failure modes: captcha resolution, pop-up banner removal, and direct navigation
to URLs. By constructing targeted datasets to further study these tasks, we
discover variations in how different language models navigate these failure
modes. We find, for example, that o4-mini deploys a wider variety of strategies
to circumvent captcha resolution than other models and DeepSeek-R1 consistently
misleads users about captcha resolution. Our findings surface both the
diversity and brittleness of current web agents. More broadly, our benchmarking
methodology provides an approach to evaluating and understanding web agent
failure modes at scale.

Conclusion: RefineShot基准解决了ShotBench的局限性，为电影摄影理解任务提供了更可靠的评估框架，有助于推动该领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: Cinematography understanding refers to the ability to recognize not only the
visual content of a scene but also the cinematic techniques that shape
narrative meaning. This capability is attracting increasing attention, as it
enhances multimodal understanding in real-world applications and underpins
coherent content creation in film and media. As the most comprehensive
benchmark for this task, ShotBench spans a wide range of cinematic concepts and
VQA-style evaluations, with ShotVL achieving state-of-the-art results on it.
However, our analysis reveals that ambiguous option design in ShotBench and
ShotVL's shortcomings in reasoning consistency and instruction adherence
undermine evaluation reliability, limiting fair comparison and hindering future
progress. To overcome these issues, we systematically refine ShotBench through
consistent option restructuring, conduct the first critical analysis of
ShotVL's reasoning behavior, and introduce an extended evaluation protocol that
jointly assesses task accuracy and core model competencies. These efforts lead
to RefineShot, a refined and expanded benchmark that enables more reliable
assessment and fosters future advances in cinematography understanding.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于分布无关风险控制的方法，通过动态提前退出机制来防御恶意上下文示例对LLM的影响，在保证安全性的同时提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs能够从少量上下文示例中学习新任务，但这种灵活性带来了安全隐患：恶意示例可能被注入而未被发现，从而影响模型性能。

Method: 定义零样本下的安全行为基准，应用分布无关风险控制来限制上下文示例对性能的负面影响，采用动态提前退出机制忽略关注不安全输入的注意力头。

Result: 理论分析和实证结果表明，该方法能有效控制恶意上下文示例的风险，同时在有益示例上实现显著的计算效率提升。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为LLMs提供内置的安全机制，能够在保持灵活性的同时抵御恶意上下文攻击，实现安全性和效率的平衡。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate a remarkable ability to learn new
tasks from a few in-context examples. However, this flexibility introduces
safety concerns: LLMs can be influenced by incorrect or malicious
demonstrations -- for example, if an adversary tampers with or injects harmful
examples without a human supervisor noticing. This motivates principled designs
in which the system itself includes built-in mechanisms to guard against such
attacks. We propose a novel approach to limit the degree to which harmful
demonstrations can degrade model performance. First, we define a baseline
``safe'' behavior for the model -- the model's performance given no in-context
demonstrations (zero-shot). Next, we apply distribution-free risk control
(DFRC) to control the extent to which in-context samples can decay performance
below zero-shot. We achieve this by leveraging dynamic early exit prediction,
ignoring later attention heads that attend the most to the unsafe inputs.
Finally, we propose modifications to DFRC that allow it to both control risk
for harmful inputs \textit{and} leverage performance and efficiency gains on
helpful inputs. We present both theoretical and empirical results showing that
our approach can effectively control risk for harmful in-context demonstrations
while simultaneously achieving substantial computational efficiency gains with
helpful demonstrations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现大型多模态模型中的一小部分注意力头负责编码空间关系知识，这些注意力头的激活（称为功能向量）可以被提取和操作来改善模型在关系任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型多模态模型展现出强大的上下文学习能力，但其支持任务学习的内在机制仍然不透明，需要深入理解模型如何编码和处理空间关系知识。

Method: 使用因果中介分析识别影响关系预测的注意力头，提取多模态功能向量，并在保持模型参数冻结的情况下用少量训练数据微调这些功能向量。

Result: 提取的功能向量能够提高零样本推理准确率，经过微调后显著优于上下文学习基线，并能通过线性组合解决涉及未训练空间关系的类比问题。

Conclusion: 大型多模态模型在局部内部结构中编码空间关系知识，这些知识可以被系统提取和优化，这有助于理解模型模块化特性并增强对关系推理的控制。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) demonstrate impressive in-context learning
abilities from limited multimodal demonstrations, yet the internal mechanisms
supporting such task learning remain opaque. Building on prior work of large
language models, we show that a small subset of attention heads in the
vision-language model OpenFlamingo-4B is responsible for transmitting
representations of spatial relations. The activations of these attention heads,
termed function vectors, can be extracted and manipulated to alter an LMM's
performance on relational tasks. First, using both synthetic and real image
datasets, we apply causal mediation analysis to identify attention heads that
strongly influence relational predictions, and extract multimodal function
vectors that improve zero-shot accuracy at inference time. We further
demonstrate that these multimodal function vectors can be fine-tuned with a
modest amount of training data, while keeping LMM parameters frozen, to
significantly outperform in-context learning baselines. Finally, we show that
relation-specific function vectors can be linearly combined to solve analogy
problems involving novel and untrained spatial relations, highlighting the
strong generalization ability of this approach. Our results show that LMMs
encode spatial relational knowledge within localized internal structures, which
can be systematically extracted and optimized, thereby advancing our
understanding of model modularity and enhancing control over relational
reasoning in LMMs.

Abstract: While agentic AI has advanced in automating individual tasks, managing
complex multi-agent workflows remains a challenging problem. This paper
presents a research vision for autonomous agentic systems that orchestrate
collaboration within dynamic human-AI teams. We propose the Autonomous Manager
Agent as a core challenge: an agent that decomposes complex goals into task
graphs, allocates tasks to human and AI workers, monitors progress, adapts to
changing conditions, and maintains transparent stakeholder communication. We
formalize workflow management as a Partially Observable Stochastic Game and
identify four foundational challenges: (1) compositional reasoning for
hierarchical decomposition, (2) multi-objective optimization under shifting
preferences, (3) coordination and planning in ad hoc teams, and (4) governance
and compliance by design. To advance this agenda, we release MA-Gym, an
open-source simulation and evaluation framework for multi-agent workflow
orchestration. Evaluating GPT-5-based Manager Agents across 20 workflows, we
find they struggle to jointly optimize for goal completion, constraint
adherence, and workflow runtime - underscoring workflow management as a
difficult open problem. We conclude with organizational and ethical
implications of autonomous management systems.

Abstract: Agentic systems enable the intelligent use of research tooling, augmenting a
researcher's ability to investigate and propose novel solutions to existing
problems. Within Additive Manufacturing (AM), alloy discovery remains a complex
challenge, often requiring expertise in the various domains of materials
science, thermodynamic simulations, and experimental analysis. Large Language
Model (LLM) enabled agents can facilitate this endeavor by utilizing their
extensive knowledge base to dispatch tool calls via Model Context Protocol
(MCP) to perform actions such as Thermo-Calc property diagram calculations and
lack of fusion process map generation. In addition, the multi-agent system
developed in this work is able to effectively reason through complex user
prompts and provide analysis on the printability of proposed alloys. These
agents can dynamically adjust their task trajectory to the outcomes of tool
call results, effectively enabling autonomous decision-making in practical
environments. This work aims to utilize LLM enabled agents to automate and
accelerate the task of alloy discovery within the field of additive
manufacturing and showcase the benefits of adopting this multi-agent system.

Conclusion: 本文为CSPP提供了多RL方法的基准测试，并提供了可重用的带起重机调度的Gym环境，为未来研究和实际部署奠定了基础。

Abstract: Container stowage planning (CSPP) is a critical component of maritime
transportation and terminal operations, directly affecting supply chain
efficiency. Owing to its complexity, CSPP has traditionally relied on human
expertise. While reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been applied to CSPP,
systematic benchmark comparisons across different algorithms remain limited. To
address this gap, we develop a Gym environment that captures the fundamental
features of CSPP and extend it to include crane scheduling in both multi-agent
and single-agent formulations. Within this framework, we evaluate five RL
algorithms: DQN, QR-DQN, A2C, PPO, and TRPO under multiple scenarios of varying
complexity. The results reveal distinct performance gaps with increasing
complexity, underscoring the importance of algorithm choice and problem
formulation for CSPP. Overall, this paper benchmarks multiple RL methods for
CSPP while providing a reusable Gym environment with crane scheduling, thus
offering a foundation for future research and practical deployment in maritime
logistics.

Abstract: The integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into smart grids presents unique
opportunities to enhance both transportation systems and energy networks.
However, ensuring safe and interpretable interactions between drivers,
vehicles, and the surrounding environment remains a critical challenge. This
paper presents a multi-modal large language model (LLM)-based framework to
process multimodal sensor data - such as object detection, semantic
segmentation, and vehicular telemetry - and generate natural-language alerts
for drivers. The framework is validated using real-world data collected from
instrumented vehicles driving on urban roads, ensuring its applicability to
real-world scenarios. By combining visual perception (YOLOv8), geocoded
positioning, and CAN bus telemetry, the framework bridges raw sensor data and
driver comprehension, enabling safer and more informed decision-making in urban
driving scenarios. Case studies using real data demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in generating context-aware alerts for critical situations, such
as proximity to pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles. This paper
highlights the potential of LLMs as assistive tools in e-mobility, benefiting
both transportation systems and electric networks by enabling scalable fleet
coordination, EV load forecasting, and traffic-aware energy planning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文研究了基础模型在多模态联合推理中的表现，特别是在跨模态冲突场景下。研究发现模型在单模态冲突识别中表现良好（90%准确率），但在跨模态冲突中表现急剧下降（仅3%），这归因于跨模态注意力不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究基础模型在现实任务中处理多模态信息的能力，特别是当不同模态之间存在交互和关联时，模型是否能进行联合推理。通过跨模态冲突场景来检验模型是优先处理某一模态还是能协调处理冲突。

Method: 使用跨模态冲突实验来测试基础模型的表现，分析注意力机制中的不平衡问题，并提出通过在每个训练实例中显式组合多个模态的简单可扩展方法来减少注意力不平衡。

Result: 实验显示模型在单模态冲突识别中准确率达90%，但在跨模态冲突中降至3%。研究发现模型存在严重的跨模态注意力不平衡，某些模态被过度优先处理。提出的方法能显著减少注意力不平衡，并提升多个视觉-语言基准测试的性能。

Conclusion: 跨模态注意力不平衡是基础模型在多模态推理中的关键问题，需要通过系统性地处理跨模态上下文来构建更可靠的基础模型。简单地扩大多模态数据集并不能解决这一问题，需要显式地训练跨模态推理能力。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) deployed in real-world tasks such as computer-use
agents must integrate diverse modalities. How good are FMs at performing joint
reasoning, simultaneously reasoning over multiple modalities, especially when
the modalities interact and relate to each other to form cross-modal context?
To better understand this problem, we study FMs on cross-modal conflicts:
scenarios where conflicting evidence is presented across modalities. This
allows us to examine whether FMs prioritize one modality over another or reason
jointly to reconcile the conflict. Our experiments reveal that FMs can
recognize conflicts in unimodal contexts, composed of a single modality, 90% of
the time, but the ratio falls as low as 3% when evidence is split across
modalities -- similar observations hold in cross-lingual contexts, composed of
multiple languages. We trace this failure to cross-modal attention imbalance,
showing that FMs exhibit extreme asymmetry in attention scores,
disproportionately prioritizing certain modalities. We show that cross-modal
attention imbalance does not go away by simply scaling up multimodal or
multilingual datasets blindly, since they lack training examples that
explicitly require cross-modal reasoning. We demonstrate that even a simple and
scalable method of explicitly combining multiple modalities within each
training instance significantly reduces attention imbalance. Reduced attention
imbalance directly translates to improved downstream performance on several
vision-language benchmarks. Our findings underscore the importance of
systematically addressing cross-modal contexts to build reliable foundation
models.

TL;DR: 研究表明测试时缩放(TTS)在大量样本下会达到性能瓶颈，提出温度维度缩放能显著提升LLM推理能力，使基础模型达到与RL训练模型相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时缩放方法在样本数增加时性能提升有限，某些难题无法通过单一温度采样解决，需要探索更有效的缩放维度。

Method: 提出温度维度缩放方法，在不同采样温度下生成多个推理轨迹，通过多温度投票机制减少计算开销。

Result: 在多个模型和推理基准测试中，温度缩放相比单温度TTS提升7.3个百分点，基础模型性能接近RL训练模型。

Conclusion: 温度缩放是解锁基础模型潜力的简单有效方法，测试时缩放比之前认为的更强大。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can improve reasoning at inference time through
test-time scaling (TTS), where multiple reasoning traces are generated and the
best one is selected. Prior work shows that increasing the number of samples K
steadily improves accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that this trend does
not hold indefinitely: at large K, further scaling yields no gains, and certain
hard questions remain unsolved regardless of the number of traces.
Interestingly, we find that different sampling temperatures solve different
subsets of problems, implying that single-temperature scaling explores only
part of a model's potential. We therefore propose scaling along the temperature
dimension, which enlarges the reasoning boundary of LLMs. Averaged over Qwen3
(0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B) and five representative reasoning benchmarks (AIME
2024/2025, MATH500, LiveCodeBench, Hi-ToM), temperature scaling yields an
additional 7.3 points over single-temperature TTS. Temperature scaling also
enables base models to reach performance comparable to reinforcement learning
(RL)-trained counterparts, without additional post-training. We further provide
a comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon and design a multi-temperature
voting method that reduces the overhead of temperature scaling. Overall, our
findings suggest that TTS is more powerful than previously thought, and that
temperature scaling offers a simple and effective way to unlock the latent
potential of base models.

Motivation: 现有可能性理论存在局限性，需要一种更适用于现实世界事件评估的新概念，特别是在规划问题中评估不同计划的可行性和完成难度。

Method: 将事件视为具有促使其发生的先决条件和阻碍其发生的约束，可能性计算基于先决条件成立和约束不成立的概率函数。采用Łukasiewicz多值逻辑解释连接词。

Result: 开发了一种新的可能性理论框架，能够评估多个计划中哪个最容易或最可行完成，并通过车辆路径规划示例进行了验证。

Conclusion: 该可能性模型可能正确捕捉了人类关于计划的正常推理过程，在规划问题中具有应用潜力，并为未来应用提供了方向。

Abstract: This paper offers a new concept of {\it possibility} as an alternative to the
now-a-days standard concept originally introduced by L.A. Zadeh in 1978. This
new version was inspired by the original but, formally, has nothing in common
with it other than that they both adopt the {\L}ukasiewicz multivalent
interpretation of the logical connectives. Moreover, rather than seeking to
provide a general notion of possibility, this focuses specifically on the
possibility of a real-world event. An event is viewed as having prerequisites
that enable its occurrence and constraints that may impede its occurrence, and
the possibility of the event is computed as a function of the probabilities
that the prerequisites hold and the constraints do not. This version of
possibility might appropriately be applied to problems of planning. When there
are multiple plans available for achieving a goal, this theory can be used to
determine which plan is most possible, i.e., easiest or most feasible to
complete. It is speculated that this model of reasoning correctly captures
normal human reasoning about plans. The theory is elaborated and an
illustrative example for vehicle route planning is provided. There is also a
suggestion of potential future applications.

AutoMaAS, a self-evolving multi-agent architecture search framework that
leverages neural architecture search principles to automatically discover

on performance-cost analysis, (2) dynamic cost-aware optimization with
real-time parameter adjustment, (3) online feedback integration for continuous
architecture refinement, and (4) enhanced interpretability through decision
tracing mechanisms. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate
that AutoMaAS achieves 1.0-7.1\% performance improvement while reducing
inference costs by 3-5\% compared to state-of-the-art methods. The framework
shows superior transferability across datasets and LLM backbones, establishing

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型的普及，其多模态接口引入了新的安全漏洞，现有红队方法要么局限于有限的对抗模式，要么依赖人工工程，缺乏对新兴真实世界漏洞的可扩展探索。

Method: 提出ARMs自适应红队代理，采用推理增强的多步骤编排自动优化红队策略。设计了11种多模态攻击策略，通过模型上下文协议集成17种红队算法，并使用分层记忆和epsilon-greedy攻击探索算法平衡攻击多样性和有效性。

Conclusion: ARMs能够系统性地进行全面的风险评估，揭示VLM的新兴漏洞。基于ARMs-Bench的安全微调可显著提高多模态安全对齐，为应对新兴威胁提供可行指导。

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) gain prominence, their multimodal interfaces
also introduce new safety vulnerabilities, making the safety evaluation
challenging and critical. Existing red-teaming efforts are either restricted to
a narrow set of adversarial patterns or depend heavily on manual engineering,
lacking scalable exploration of emerging real-world VLM vulnerabilities. To
bridge this gap, we propose ARMs, an adaptive red-teaming agent that
systematically conducts comprehensive risk assessments for VLMs. Given a target
harmful behavior or risk definition, ARMs automatically optimizes diverse
red-teaming strategies with reasoning-enhanced multi-step orchestration, to
effectively elicit harmful outputs from target VLMs. We propose 11 novel
multimodal attack strategies, covering diverse adversarial patterns of VLMs
(e.g., reasoning hijacking, contextual cloaking), and integrate 17 red-teaming
algorithms into ARMs via model context protocol (MCP). To balance the diversity
and effectiveness of the attack, we design a layered memory with an
epsilon-greedy attack exploration algorithm. Extensive experiments on instance-
and policy-based benchmarks show that ARMs achieves SOTA attack success rates,
exceeding baselines by an average of 52.1% and surpassing 90% on
Claude-4-Sonnet. We show that the diversity of red-teaming instances generated
by ARMs is significantly higher, revealing emerging vulnerabilities in VLMs.
Leveraging ARMs, we construct ARMs-Bench, a large-scale multimodal safety
dataset comprising over 30K red-teaming instances spanning 51 diverse risk
categories, grounded in both real-world multimodal threats and regulatory
risks. Safety fine-tuning with ARMs-Bench substantially improves the robustness
of VLMs while preserving their general utility, providing actionable guidance
to improve multimodal safety alignment against emerging threats.

Abstract: Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS) systems have become indispensable for
modern manufacturing operations, enabling optimized resource allocation and
production efficiency in increasingly complex and dynamic environments. While
algorithms for solving abstracted scheduling problems have been extensively
investigated, the critical prerequisite of specifying manufacturing
requirements into formal constraints remains manual and labor-intensive.
Although recent advances of generative models, particularly Large Language
Models (LLMs), show promise in automating constraint specification from
heterogeneous raw manufacturing data, their direct application faces challenges
due to natural language ambiguity, non-deterministic outputs, and limited
domain-specific knowledge. This paper presents a constraint-centric
architecture that regulates LLMs to perform reliable automated constraint
specification for production scheduling. The architecture defines a
hierarchical structural space organized across three levels, implemented
through domain-specific representation to ensure precision and reliability
while maintaining flexibility. Furthermore, an automated production scenario
adaptation algorithm is designed and deployed to efficiently customize the
architecture for specific manufacturing configurations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully balances the generative
capabilities of LLMs with the reliability requirements of manufacturing
systems, significantly outperforming pure LLM-based approaches in constraint
specification tasks.

Conclusion: NCV提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，显著提高了LLM推理验证的可解释性和效率。

Abstract: Verifying multi-step reasoning in large language models is difficult due to
imprecise error localization and high token costs. Existing methods either
assess entire reasoning chains, suffering attention dilution, or rely on
expensive multi-sampling. We introduce Node-wise Consistency Verification
(NCV), a training-free framework that recasts verification as lightweight
binary consistency checks at the node level. By decomposing the chain of
thought into interconnected verification nodes, NCV precisely localizes errors
and avoids unnecessary long-form generation. Experiments demonstrate that our
approach enhances interpretability and efficiency, presenting a scalable
solution for reliable LLM reasoning verification. On public datasets, NCV
achieves a 10\% to 25\% improvement in F1 scores over baselines while utilizing
$6\times$~$58\times$ fewer tokens than traditional methods like CoT-based
verifiers.

*Wonjoong Kim,Sangwu Park,Yeonjun In,Sein Kim,Dongha Lee,Chanyoung Park*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TRACE是一个用于评估工具增强LLM代理性能的多维度框架，通过证据库积累推理步骤知识，能够有效分析代理的推理轨迹，解决了传统仅匹配最终答案的评估方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具增强基准虽然包含复杂用户请求和多样化工具，但评估方法仍局限于答案匹配。随着解决用户请求所需步骤增加，需要超越最终答案来评估问题解决轨迹，包括效率、幻觉和适应性等被忽视的方面。

Method: 引入TRACE框架，通过证据库积累先前推理步骤的知识，实现对代理推理轨迹的多方面分析和评估。创建元评估数据集，在现有基准基础上添加多样且有缺陷的轨迹，并标注多方面性能分数。

Result: 验证结果显示TRACE能够准确评估复杂行为，具有可扩展性和成本效益，即使使用小型开源LLM也能有效工作。应用该方法评估代理在解决工具增强任务时产生的轨迹，提供了先前未报告的观察和见解。

Conclusion: TRACE框架为工具增强LLM代理提供了全面、多维度的评估方法，能够有效分析推理轨迹的各个方面，解决了传统评估方法的局限性，为代理性能评估提供了新的视角和方法。

Abstract: Although recent tool-augmented benchmarks incorporate complex user requests
and diverse tools, the evaluation methods for most of them remain limited to
answer matching. However, as the number of steps required to resolve a user
request increases, a proper evaluation of an agent's performance must go beyond
the final answer to also assess the problem-solving trajectory, including
previously ignored aspects such as efficiency, hallucination, and adaptivity.
The most straightforward method for evaluating these aspects is to compare an
agent's trajectory with the ground-truth trajectory, but this approach is
fundamentally limited since annotating all valid ground-truth trajectories is
prohibitively expensive. However, a simple LLM-based evaluator struggles to
assess trajectories in detail without ground truth. To effectively evaluate the
agents in this manner, we introduce TRACE, a framework for the
multi-dimensional evaluation of tool-augmented LLM agent performance. By
incorporating an evidence bank, which accumulates knowledge gathered from
preceding reasoning steps, TRACE enables a multi-faceted analysis and
evaluation of an agent's reasoning trajectory effectively. To validate our
framework, we develop a new meta-evaluation dataset by augmenting existing
benchmarks with diverse and flawed trajectories, each labeled with
multi-faceted performance scores. Our results confirm that TRACE accurately
evaluates these complex behaviors in a scalable and cost-effective manner, even
with small open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we apply our method to evaluate the
trajectories that agents produce while solving tool-augmented tasks, presenting
previously unreported observations and their corresponding insights.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文挑战了机器学习中训练模型能完全满足目标函数的假设（OSA），指出在现实条件下由于近似、估计和优化误差，系统必然偏离预期目标。即使目标定义良好，完美捕捉开发者意图（如人类偏好对齐）也是不可能的，导致目标错配不可避免。基于数学结果，这些差距在强优化压力下会演变成Goodhart定律失效模式，因此需要对通用AI系统的优化设置原则性限制，否则持续优化可能导致失控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战机器学习中普遍但未经检验的假设——训练模型能完全满足目标函数（OSA），揭示其在现实条件下的系统性失效，并探讨这对AI安全的影响。

Method: 采用学习范式无关的框架，分析近似误差、估计误差和优化误差如何导致OSA失效，结合数学结果证明目标错配在强优化下会演变成Goodhart定律失效模式。

Result: 证明OSA在现实条件下必然失效，目标错配不可避免，且在缺乏数学表征的情况下，这些差距在强优化压力下会演变成Goodhart定律失效模式，导致失控风险。

Conclusion: 需要对通用AI系统的优化设置原则性限制，以防止持续优化将系统推向可预测且不可逆的失控状态。

Abstract: A common but rarely examined assumption in machine learning is that training
yields models that actually satisfy their specified objective function. We call
this the Objective Satisfaction Assumption (OSA). Although deviations from OSA
are acknowledged, their implications are overlooked. We argue, in a
learning-paradigm-agnostic framework, that OSA fails in realistic conditions:
approximation, estimation, and optimization errors guarantee systematic
deviations from the intended objective, regardless of the quality of its
specification. Beyond these technical limitations, perfectly capturing and
translating the developer's intent, such as alignment with human preferences,
into a formal objective is practically impossible, making misspecification
inevitable. Building on recent mathematical results, absent a mathematical
characterization of these gaps, they are indistinguishable from those that
collapse into Goodhart's law failure modes under strong optimization pressure.
Because the Goodhart breaking point cannot be located ex ante, a principled
limit on the optimization of General-Purpose AI systems is necessary. Absent
such a limit, continued optimization is liable to push systems into predictable
and irreversible loss of control.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出BayesianRouter框架，结合离线RM强度学习和在线贝叶斯选择，解决单一奖励模型限制对齐质量和过拟合的问题，在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLHF/RLAIF依赖单一奖励模型，限制了对齐质量并可能导致过拟合。现有路由方法存在冷启动和探索不足的问题。

Method: 混合路由框架：离线阶段训练多任务路由器估计每个RM的可靠性；在线阶段使用贝叶斯Thompson采样进行按查询的RM选择，用离线嵌入作为高斯先验初始化权重向量，并通过在线奖励自适应更新后验分布。

Result: 在指令跟随（AlpacaEval-2、Arena-Hard、MT-Bench）和推理（GSM8K、MMLU）基准测试中，BayesianRouter始终优于单个RM、RM集成和现有路由方法。

Conclusion: BayesianRouter通过结合离线和在线学习，有效解决了RM路由中的冷启动和探索不足问题，显著提升了大语言模型的对齐质量。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human or AI feedback (RLHF / RLAIF) has become
the standard paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, most
pipelines rely on a single reward model (RM), limiting alignment quality and
risking overfitting. Recent work explores RM routing--dynamically selecting an
RM from a candidate pool to exploit complementary strengths while maintaining
$O(1)$ RM calls--but existing methods suffer from cold-start and insufficient
exploration. We propose BayesianRouter, a hybrid routing framework that
combines offline RM strengths learning with online Bayesian selection. In the
offline stage, a multi-task router is trained on preference data to estimate
per-RM reliability. In the online stage, a Bayesian Thompson sampling router
performs per-query RM selection, initializing RM-specific weight vectors with
offline embeddings as Gaussian priors and adaptively updating their posteriors
with online rewards to adapt to the evolving policy distribution. Extensive
experiments on instruction-following (AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, MT-Bench) and
reasoning (GSM8K, MMLU) benchmarks show that BayesianRouter consistently
outperforms individual RMs, RM ensembling, and existing routing methods.

Motivation: 离散扩散模型（DDM）的优化面临挑战：非自回归范式使得重要性采样难以处理且展开过程复杂，这困扰了如GRPO等强化学习方法。

Method: 首先澄清DDM的理论基础，构建能够捕捉有价值token波动的重要性估计器；然后为视觉序列精心定制展开方法，产生多样化的补全和可靠的优化梯度。

Result: 在数学推理、编码和视觉生成基准测试中，MaskGRPO带来了更稳定和高效的更新，导致更强的推理性能和更好的生成质量。

Conclusion: 该研究确立了MaskGRPO作为一个系统性的策略优化方法，并且是离散化视觉扩散的首个实用方法。

Abstract: Optimizing discrete diffusion model (DDM) with rewards remains a challenge:
the non-autoregressive paradigm makes importance sampling intractable and
rollout complex, puzzling reinforcement learning methods such as Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this study, we introduce MaskGRPO, the first
viable approach to enable scalable multimodal reinforcement learning in
discrete diffusion with effective importance sampling and modality-specific
adaptations. To this end, we first clarify the theoretical foundation for DDMs,
which facilitates building an importance estimator that captures valuable token
fluctuation for gradient updates. We then delicately tailored the rollout
method for visual sequences, which yields diverse completions and reliable
optimization gradients. Upon math reasoning, coding, and visual generation
benchmarks, MaskGRPO brings more stable and efficient updates, leading to
stronger reasoning performance and better generation quality. This study
establishes MaskGRPO as a systematic policy optimization approach and the first
practical way for discretized visual diffusion.

Motivation: 当前主流的深度学习方法是黑盒系统，缺乏对其推理过程的解释，这限制了其可信度和采用。XAI方法旨在通过提供模型决策过程的解释来克服这一挑战，但不同XAI方法中隐含的哲学假设会影响解释的有效性。

Method: 研究XAI方法中隐含的本体论和认识论假设，分析这些假设如何影响AI解释在不同领域的有效性和解释。探讨XAI方法中看似小的技术变化如何对应于关于解释的基本假设的重要差异。

Result: 分析表明，忽略底层本体-认识论范式而选择XAI方法存在风险。不同的XAI方法基于不同的哲学假设，这些假设会影响解释的效度和解释方式。

Conclusion: 在选择XAI方法时需要考虑其隐含的本体论和认识论假设，并根据不同的应用领域选择和调整合适的XAI方法，以确保解释的有效性和适用性。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is being applied in almost every field. At the
same time, the currently dominant deep learning methods are fundamentally
black-box systems that lack explanations for their inferences, significantly
limiting their trustworthiness and adoption. Explainable AI (XAI) methods aim
to overcome this challenge by providing explanations of the models' decision
process. Such methods are often proposed and developed by engineers and
scientists with a predominantly technical background and incorporate their
assumptions about the existence, validity, and explanatory utility of different
conceivable explanatory mechanisms. However, the basic concept of an
explanation -- what it is, whether we can know it, whether it is absolute or
relative -- is far from trivial and has been the subject of deep philosophical
debate for millennia. As we point out here, the assumptions incorporated into
different XAI methods are not harmless and have important consequences for the
validity and interpretation of AI explanations in different domains. We
investigate ontological and epistemological assumptions in explainability
methods when they are applied to AI systems, meaning the assumptions we make
about the existence of explanations and our ability to gain knowledge about
those explanations. Our analysis shows how seemingly small technical changes to
an XAI method may correspond to important differences in the underlying
assumptions about explanations. We furthermore highlight the risks of ignoring
the underlying onto-epistemological paradigm when choosing an XAI method for a
given application, and we discuss how to select and adapt appropriate XAI
methods for different domains of application.

Motivation: 虽然反事实解释在可解释AI中是强大工具，但在基于规则的智能环境领域缺乏成熟的生成方法。

Method: 开发了一个插件来扩展现有的智能环境解释引擎，并进行了用户研究(N=17)来评估生成的反事实解释与传统因果解释的效果。

Result: 用户偏好高度情境化：因果解释因其语言简洁性和在时间压力下的适用性而受青睐；反事实解释因其可操作内容而在用户想要解决问题时更受欢迎。

Conclusion: 本文为智能环境中的新型解释提供了实用框架，并为选择何时使用每种解释类型提供了实证依据。

Abstract: Explainability is increasingly seen as an essential feature of rule-based
smart environments. While counterfactual explanations, which describe what
could have been done differently to achieve a desired outcome, are a powerful
tool in eXplainable AI (XAI), no established methods exist for generating them
in these rule-based domains. In this paper, we present the first formalization
and implementation of counterfactual explanations tailored to this domain. It
is implemented as a plugin that extends an existing explanation engine for
smart environments. We conducted a user study (N=17) to evaluate our generated
counterfactuals against traditional causal explanations. The results show that
user preference is highly contextual: causal explanations are favored for their
linguistic simplicity and in time-pressured situations, while counterfactuals
are preferred for their actionable content, particularly when a user wants to
resolve a problem. Our work contributes a practical framework for a new type of
explanation in smart environments and provides empirical evidence to guide the
choice of when each explanation type is most effective.

Motivation: 研究动机是探究现代AI系统是否真正具备类比推理能力，还是仅仅依赖统计捷径。通过故意在训练中省略某些结构规则，来测试模型在未见过规则上的泛化能力。

Method: 使用序列到序列transformer模型和基于视觉的架构（如CoPINet和Dual-Contrast Network），在Impartial-RAVEN数据集上进行评估，故意在训练中省略若干结构规则。

Result: 实验结果显示，transformer模型在熟悉规则上表现良好，但在面对新颖或被省略规则时准确率急剧下降。token级准确率与完整答案准确率之间的差距凸显了当前方法的根本局限性。

Conclusion: 研究结论表明当前深度学习模型在抽象推理方面存在根本性限制，需要开发能够超越模式识别、实现稳健抽象推理的新架构。

Abstract: Analogical reasoning lies at the core of human cognition and remains a
fundamental challenge for artificial intelligence. Raven's Progressive Matrices
(RPM) serve as a widely used benchmark to assess abstract reasoning by
requiring the inference of underlying structural rules. While many vision-based
and language-based models have achieved success on RPM tasks, it remains
unclear whether their performance reflects genuine reasoning ability or
reliance on statistical shortcuts. This study investigates the generalization
capacity of modern AI systems under conditions of incomplete training by
deliberately omitting several structural rules during training. Both
sequence-to-sequence transformer models and vision-based architectures such as
CoPINet and the Dual-Contrast Network are evaluated on the Impartial-RAVEN
(I-RAVEN) dataset. Experiments reveal that although transformers demonstrate
strong performance on familiar rules, their accuracy declines sharply when
faced with novel or omitted rules. Moreover, the gap between token-level
accuracy and complete answer accuracy highlights fundamental limitations in
current approaches. These findings provide new insights into the reasoning
mechanisms underlying deep learning models and underscore the need for
architectures that move beyond pattern recognition toward robust abstract
reasoning.

Abstract: Deep research has revolutionized data analysis, yet data scientists still
devote substantial time to manually crafting visualizations, highlighting the
need for robust automation from natural language queries. However, current
systems struggle with complex datasets containing multiple files and iterative
refinement. Existing approaches, including simple single- or multi-agent
systems, often oversimplify the task, focusing on initial query parsing while
failing to robustly manage data complexity, code errors, or final visualization
quality. In this paper, we reframe this challenge as a collaborative
multi-agent problem. We introduce CoDA, a multi-agent system that employs
specialized LLM agents for metadata analysis, task planning, code generation,
and self-reflection. We formalize this pipeline, demonstrating how
metadata-focused analysis bypasses token limits and quality-driven refinement
ensures robustness. Extensive evaluations show CoDA achieves substantial gains
in the overall score, outperforming competitive baselines by up to 41.5%. This
work demonstrates that the future of visualization automation lies not in
isolated code generation but in integrated, collaborative agentic workflows.

Conclusion: 通过结合连续和离散两种模态，CCDD在潜在空间中具有丰富的语义表达力，同时保持了良好的可训练性和样本质量。

Abstract: Diffusion language models, especially masked discrete diffusion models, have
achieved great success recently. While there are some theoretical and primary
empirical results showing the advantages of latent reasoning with looped
transformers or continuous chain-of-thoughts, continuous diffusion models
typically underperform their discrete counterparts. In this paper, we argue
that diffusion language models do not necessarily need to be in the discrete
space. In particular, we prove that continuous diffusion models have stronger
expressivity than discrete diffusions and looped transformers. We attribute the
contradiction between the theoretical expressiveness and empirical performance
to their practical trainability: while continuous diffusion provides
intermediate supervision that looped transformers lack, they introduce
additional difficulty decoding tokens into the discrete token space from the
continuous representation space. We therefore propose Coevolutionary Continuous
Discrete Diffusion (CCDD), which defines a joint multimodal diffusion process
on the union of a continuous representation space and a discrete token space,
leveraging a single model to simultaneously denoise in the joint space. By
combining two modalities, CCDD is expressive with rich semantics in the latent
space, as well as good trainability and sample quality with the help of
explicit discrete tokens. We also propose effective architectures and advanced
training/sampling techniques for CCDD, which reveals strong empirical
performance in extensive language modeling experiments on real-world tasks.

Conclusion: 该算法实现了无需额外训练的高效扩散模型采样，在少量步骤内生成高质量图像，性能优于现有ODE求解器，与最新蒸馏模型相当。

Abstract: The diffusion model is a state-of-the-art generative model that generates an
image by applying a neural network iteratively. Moreover, this generation
process is regarded as an algorithm solving an ordinary differential equation
or a stochastic differential equation. Based on the analysis of the truncation
error of the diffusion ODE and SDE, our study proposes a training-free
algorithm that generates high-quality 512 x 512 and 1024 x 1024 images in eight
steps, with flexible guidance scales. To the best of my knowledge, our
algorithm is the first one that samples a 1024 x 1024 resolution image in 8
steps with an FID performance comparable to that of the latest distillation
model, but without additional training. Meanwhile, our algorithm can also
generate a 512 x 512 image in 8 steps, and its FID performance is better than
the inference result using state-of-the-art ODE solver DPM++ 2m in 20 steps. We
validate our eight-step image generation algorithm using the COCO 2014, COCO
2017, and LAION datasets. And our best FID performance is 15.7, 22.35, and
17.52. While the FID performance of DPM++2m is 17.3, 23.75, and 17.33. Further,
it also outperforms the state-of-the-art AMED-plugin solver, whose FID
performance is 19.07, 25.50, and 18.06. We also apply the algorithm in
five-step inference without additional training, for which the best FID
performance in the datasets mentioned above is 19.18, 23.24, and 19.61,
respectively, and is comparable to the performance of the state-of-the-art AMED
Pulgin solver in eight steps, SDXL-turbo in four steps, and the
state-of-the-art diffusion distillation model Flash Diffusion in five steps. We
also validate our algorithm in synthesizing 1024 * 1024 images within 6 steps,
whose FID performance only has a limited distance to the latest distillation

Abstract: The visualization of 3D point cloud data is essential in fields such as
autonomous navigation, environmental monitoring, and disaster response, where
tasks like object recognition, structural analysis, and spatiotemporal
exploration rely on clear and effective visual representation. Despite
advancements in AI-driven processing, visualization remains a critical tool for
interpreting complex spatial datasets. However, designing effective point cloud
visualizations presents significant challenges due to the sparsity, density
variations, and scale of the data. In this work, we analyze the design space of
spatial point cloud visualization, highlighting a gap in systematically mapping
visualization techniques to analytical objectives. We introduce a taxonomy that
categorizes four decades of visualization design choices, linking them to
fundamental challenges in modern applications. By structuring visualization
strategies based on data types, user objectives, and visualization techniques,
our framework provides a foundation for advancing more effective,
interpretable, and user-centered visualization techniques.

We evaluate GS-Share against state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating that our
system achieves higher fidelity, particularly for extrapolated views, with
improvements of 11%, 22%, and 74% in PSNR, LPIPS, and Depth L1, respectively.
Furthermore, GS-Share is significantly more compact, reducing map transmission
overhead by 36%.
