This paper presents a\ncomprehensive information-theoretic analysis of how rule encodings in system\nprompts influence attention mechanisms and compliance behaviour. We demonstrate\nthat rule formats with low syntactic entropy and highly concentrated anchors\nreduce attention entropy and improve pointer fidelity, but reveal a fundamental\ntrade-off between anchor redundancy and attention entropy that previous work\nfailed to recognize. Through formal analysis of multiple attention\narchitectures including causal, bidirectional, local sparse, kernelized, and\ncross-attention mechanisms, we establish bounds on pointer fidelity and show\nhow anchor placement strategies must account for competing fidelity and entropy\nobjectives. Combining these insights with a dynamic rule verification\narchitecture, we provide a formal proof that hot reloading of verified rule\nsets increases the asymptotic probability of compliant outputs. These findings\nunderscore the necessity of principled anchor design and dual enforcement\nmechanisms to protect LLM-based agents against prompt injection attacks while\nmaintaining compliance in evolving domains."}

Existing frameworks often intertwine inference, memory,\nand control in a single prompt, which can reduce coherence and predictability.\nThe Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) is introduced as an alternative\narchitecture that separates these functions. In SCL, the language model is\ndedicated to inference, memory is maintained externally, and execution is\nguided by a lightweight controller within a goal-directed loop. This design\noffloads cognitive load from the model and allows intermediate results to be\nstored, revisited, and checked before actions are taken, providing a clearer\nbasis for traceability and evaluation.\n  We evaluate SCL against prompt-based baselines including ReAct and common\nLangChain agents across three scenarios: temperature-based travel planning,\nemail drafting with conditional send, and constraint-guided image generation.\nAll systems share the same base model and tools under matched decoding\nsettings. Across 360 episodes, SCL shows modest but consistent improvements.\nTask success averages 86.3 percent compared with 70-77 percent for baselines.\nGoal fidelity is higher, redundant calls are fewer, intermediate states are\nreused more reliably, and unsupported assertions per 100 tool calls are\nreduced.

Direct modifications by LLMs typically introduce inconsistencies\nbetween local edits and the overall narrative requirements. To address these\nissues, we propose Dramaturge, a task and feature oriented divide-and-conquer\napproach powered by hierarchical multiple LLM agents. It consists of a Global\nReview stage to grasp the overall storyline and structural issues, a\nScene-level Review stage to pinpoint detailed scene and sentence flaws, and a\nHierarchical Coordinated Revision stage that coordinates and integrates\nstructural and detailed improvements throughout the script. The top-down task\nflow ensures that high-level strategies guide local modifications, maintaining\ncontextual consistency. The review and revision workflow follows a\ncoarse-to-fine iterative process, continuing through multiple rounds until no\nfurther substantive improvements can be made.

Teamwork achieves channel expansion\nwithout altering the pretrained diffusion model architecture by coordinating\nand adapting multiple instances of the base diffusion model (\\ie, teammates).\nWe employ a novel variation of Low Rank-Adaptation (LoRA) to jointly address\nboth adaptation and coordination between the different teammates.

This capability would be particularly beneficial\nin elementary and middle-school mathematics education, where most work remains\nhandwritten, because seeing students' full working of a problem provides\nvaluable insights into their learning processes, but is extremely\ntime-consuming to grade. We present two experiments investigating MLLM\nperformance on handwritten student mathematics classwork. Experiment A examines\n288 handwritten responses from Ghanaian middle school students solving\narithmetic problems with objective answers. In this context, models achieved\nnear-human accuracy (95%, k = 0.90) but exhibited occasional errors that human\neducators would be unlikely to make. Experiment B evaluates 150 mathematical\nillustrations from American elementary students, where the drawings are the\nanswer to the question. These tasks lack single objective answers and require\nsophisticated visual interpretation as well as pedagogical judgment in order to\nanalyze and evaluate them. We attempted to separate MLLMs' visual capabilities\nfrom their pedagogical abilities by first asking them to grade the student\nillustrations directly, and then by augmenting the image with a detailed human\ndescription of the illustration. We found that when the models had to analyze\nthe student illustrations directly, they struggled, achieving only k = 0.20\nwith ground truth scores, but when given human descriptions, their agreement\nlevels improved dramatically to k = 0.47, which was in line with human-to-human\nagreement levels. This gap suggests MLLMs can \"see\" and interpret arithmetic\nwork relatively well, but still struggle to \"see\" student mathematical\nillustrations."}

To ensure broad applicability, we\nidentify two fundamental problems: what information to extract from the\ndecoding trajectory, and how to utilize it effectively. We first observe that\nrelying directly on per-step model confidence yields poor performance. This is\nmainly due to the bidirectional decoding nature of dLLMs: each newly decoded\ntoken influences the confidence of other decoded tokens, making model\nconfidence highly redundant and washing out structural signal regarding\ndecoding order or dependencies. To overcome this, we propose a novel\ninformation extraction scheme called the Directed Decoding Map (DDM), which\ncaptures structural relationships between decoding steps and better reveals\nmodel-specific behaviors. Furthermore, to make full use of the extracted\nstructural information during attribution, we propose Gaussian-Trajectory\nAttribution (GTA), where we fit a cell-wise Gaussian distribution at each\ndecoding position for each target model, and define the likelihood of a\ntrajectory as the attribution score: if a trajectory exhibits higher\nlog-likelihood under the distribution of a specific model, it is more likely to\nhave been generated by that model.

(2) No additional latency:\nreasoning is amortized during the listening window; once the user stops\nspeaking, the agent halts thinking and begins speaking without further delay.\nExperiments demonstrate the effectiveness of chronological thinking through\nboth objective metrics and human evaluations show consistent improvements in\nresponse quality. Furthermore, chronological thinking robustly handles\nconversational dynamics and attains competitive performance on full-duplex\ninteraction metrics."}

Given the prevalence of\npretraining from natural images to mitigate medical data scarcity, we also\nexamine transferring pretrained weights to new token mixers. Our results show\nthat, for classification, low-complexity token mixers (e.g. grouped convolution\nor pooling) are sufficient, aligning with findings on natural images.\nPretrained weights remain useful despite the domain gap introduced by the new\ntoken mixer. For segmentation, we find that the local inductive bias of\nconvolutional token mixers is essential. Grouped convolutions emerge as the\npreferred choice, as they reduce runtime and parameter count compared to\nstandard convolutions, while the MetaFormer's channel-MLPs already provide the\nnecessary cross-channel interactions.

While the\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism has enhanced reasoning in text-based tasks,\nits application to video understanding remains underexplored. This paper\npresents a systematic analysis revealing that CoT often degrades performance in\nvideo reasoning, generating verbose but misleading internal monologues, and\nleading to hallucinated visual details and overridden correct intuitions - a\nphenomenon we term \"visual thinking drift\". We explain this drift through a\nBayesian lens, positing that CoT traces often diverge from actual visual\nevidence, instead amplifying internal biases or language priors, causing models\nto storytell rather than engage in grounded reasoning. To counteract this, we\nintroduce Visual Evidence Reward (VER), a novel reinforcement learning\nframework that explicitly rewards the generation of reasoning traces that are\nverifiably grounded in visual evidence. Comprehensive evaluation across 10\ndiverse video understanding benchmarks demonstrates that our Video-VER\nconsistently achieves top performance.

Their\ndistinctive decoding mechanism enables faster inference speed and strong\nperformance in code generation and mathematical tasks. In this work, we show\nthat the decoding mechanism of dLLMs not only enhances model utility but also\ncan be used as a powerful tool for model attribution. A key challenge in this\nproblem lies in the diversity of attribution scenarios, including\ndistinguishing between different models as well as between different\ncheckpoints or backups of the same model. To ensure broad applicability, we\nidentify two fundamental problems: what information to extract from the\ndecoding trajectory, and how to utilize it effectively. We first observe that\nrelying directly on per-step model confidence yields poor performance. This is\nmainly due to the bidirectional decoding nature of dLLMs: each newly decoded\ntoken influences the confidence of other decoded tokens, making model\nconfidence highly redundant and washing out structural signal regarding\ndecoding order or dependencies. To overcome this, we propose a novel\ninformation extraction scheme called the Directed Decoding Map (DDM), which\ncaptures structural relationships between decoding steps and better reveals\nmodel-specific behaviors. Furthermore, to make full use of the extracted\nstructural information during attribution, we propose Gaussian-Trajectory\nAttribution (GTA), where we fit a cell-wise Gaussian distribution at each\ndecoding position for each target model, and define the likelihood of a\ntrajectory as the attribution score: if a trajectory exhibits higher\nlog-likelihood under the distribution of a specific model, it is more likely to\nhave been generated by that model.

Through a systematic evaluation of 3 Llama Guards and 2 GPT-oss\nmodels, we confirmed that inserting benign documents into the guardrail context\nalters the judgments of input and output guardrails in around 11% and 8% of\ncases, making them unreliable. We separately analyzed the effect of each\ncomponent in the augmented context: retrieved documents, user query, and\nLLM-generated response. The two mitigation methods we tested only bring minor\nimprovements. These results expose a context-robustness gap in current\nguardrails and motivate training and evaluation protocols that are robust to\nretrieval and query composition."}

For example, an LM might represent\n\"Ann loves pie\" by binding \"Ann\" to \"pie\", allowing it to later retrieve \"Ann\"\nwhen asked \"Who loves pie?\" Prior research on short lists of bound entities\nfound strong evidence that LMs implement such retrieval via a positional\nmechanism, where \"Ann\" is retrieved based on its position in context. In this\nwork, we find that this mechanism generalizes poorly to more complex settings;\nas the number of bound entities in context increases, the positional mechanism\nbecomes noisy and unreliable in middle positions. To compensate for this, we\nfind that LMs supplement the positional mechanism with a lexical mechanism\n(retrieving \"Ann\" using its bound counterpart \"pie\") and a reflexive mechanism\n(retrieving \"Ann\" through a direct pointer). Through extensive experiments on\nnine models and ten binding tasks, we uncover a consistent pattern in how LMs\nmix these mechanisms to drive model behavior. We leverage these insights to\ndevelop a causal model combining all three mechanisms that estimates next token\ndistributions with 95% agreement.

Bengali, being a low-resource language\nwith a high regional dialectal diversity, has seen limited progress in\ndeveloping such systems. Existing systems are not optimized for real-time use\nand focus only on standard Bengali. In this work, we present BanglaTalk, the\nfirst real-time speech assistance system for Bengali regional dialects.\nBanglaTalk follows the client-server architecture and uses the Real-time\nTransport Protocol (RTP) to ensure low-latency communication. To address\ndialectal variation, we introduce a dialect-aware ASR system, BRDialect,\ndeveloped by fine-tuning the IndicWav2Vec model in ten Bengali regional\ndialects. It outperforms the baseline ASR models by 12.41-33.98% on the\nRegSpeech12 dataset. Furthermore, BanglaTalk can operate at a low bandwidth of\n24 kbps while maintaining an average end-to-end delay of 4.9 seconds. Low\nbandwidth usage and minimal end-to-end delay make the system both\ncost-effective and interactive for real-time use cases, enabling inclusive and\naccessible speech technology for the diverse community of Bengali speakers."}

These models have demonstrated\nstate-of-the-art performance in speech-to-speech understanding and generation\nbenchmarks, together with promising scaling laws, primarily enabled by the\nrepresentational alignment between text and speech. Nevertheless, they suffer\nfrom shortcomings, partly owing to the disproportionately longer sequences of\nspeech tokens in contrast to textual tokens. This results in a large compute\nimbalance between modalities during pre-training as well as during inference,\nand a potential hindrance to effectively aligning speech and text, ultimately\ntranslating to several orders of magnitude slower scaling laws. We introduce\nthe Latent Speech-Text Transformer (LST), which makes pre-training speech-text\nmodels more data-efficient by dynamically and inexpensively aggregating speech\ntokens into latent speech patches. These patches serve as higher-level units\nthat can either align with corresponding textual units to aid capability\ntransfer or even encapsulate common speech sequences like silences to be more\ncompute-efficient. We show that LST outperforms vanilla approaches on\nspeech-to-speech as well as text-to-text benchmarks in both data- and\ncompute-controlled settings, the former indicating more effective\nrepresentational alignment and the latter indicating steeper scaling laws for\nspeech-text models. On HellaSwag story completion, LST achieves 6.5% absolute\ngain in speech accuracy under compute-controlled training and 5.3% under\ndata-controlled training, while also improving text performance. We will\nrelease our models, code, and the evaluation data to facilitate further\nresearch."}

To investigate this gap, we present EgoNight, the\nfirst comprehensive benchmark for nighttime egocentric vision, with visual\nquestion answering (VQA) as the core task. A key feature of EgoNight is the\nintroduction of day-night aligned videos, which enhance night annotation\nquality using the daytime data and reveal clear performance gaps between\nlighting conditions. To achieve this, we collect both synthetic videos rendered\nby Blender and real-world recordings, ensuring that scenes and actions are\nvisually and temporally aligned. Leveraging these paired videos, we construct\nEgoNight-VQA, supported by a novel day-augmented night auto-labeling engine and\nrefinement through extensive human verification. Each QA pair is double-checked\nby annotators for reliability. In total, EgoNight-VQA contains 3658 QA pairs\nacross 90 videos, spanning 12 diverse QA types, with more than 300 hours of\nhuman work. Evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models\n(MLLMs) reveal substantial performance drops when transferring from day to\nnight, underscoring the challenges of reasoning under low-light conditions.\nBeyond VQA, EgoNight also introduces two auxiliary tasks, day-night\ncorrespondence retrieval and egocentric depth estimation at night, that further\nexplore the boundaries of existing models. We believe EgoNight-VQA provides a\nstrong foundation for advancing application-driven egocentric vision research\nand for developing models that generalize across illumination domains. All the\ndata and code will be made available upon acceptance."}
