Here we provide evidence for a\nconvergent architecture. Across a range of LLMs, we find that diverse\nevaluative judgments are computed along a dominant dimension, which we term the\nValence-Assent Axis (VAA). This axis jointly encodes subjective valence (\"what\nis good\") and the model's assent to factual claims (\"what is true\").

However, the standard cross-entropy loss treats all\ntokens equally, ignoring their heterogeneous contributions across a reasoning\ntrajectory. This uniform treatment leads to misallocated supervision and weak\ngeneralization, especially in complex, long-form reasoning tasks. To address\nthis, we introduce \\textbf{V}ariance-\\textbf{C}ontrolled\n\\textbf{O}ptimization-based \\textbf{RE}weighting (VCORE), a principled\nframework that reformulates CoT supervision as a constrained optimization\nproblem. By adopting an optimization-theoretic perspective, VCORE enables a\nprincipled and adaptive allocation of supervision across tokens, thereby\naligning the training objective more closely with the goal of robust reasoning\ngeneralization. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that VCORE consistently\noutperforms existing token reweighting methods. Across both in-domain and\nout-of-domain settings, VCORE achieves substantial performance gains on\nmathematical and coding benchmarks, using models from the Qwen3 series (4B, 8B,\n32B) and LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct. Moreover, we show that VCORE serves as a more\neffective initialization for subsequent reinforcement learning, establishing a\nstronger foundation for advancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The Code\nwill be released at https://github.com/coder-gx/VCORE."}

However, training them to succeed on long-horizon,\ndomain-specialized tasks remains challenging. Current methods primarily fall\ninto two categories. The first relies on dense human annotations through\nbehavior cloning, which is prohibitively expensive for long-horizon tasks that\ncan take days or months. The second depends on outcome-driven sampling, which\noften collapses due to the rarity of valid positive trajectories on\ndomain-specialized tasks. We introduce Apollo, a sampling framework that\nintegrates asynchronous human guidance with action-level data filtering.\nInstead of requiring annotators to shadow every step, Apollo allows them to\nintervene only when the agent drifts from a promising trajectory, by providing\nprior knowledge, strategic advice, etc. This lightweight design makes it\npossible to sustain interactions for over 30 hours and produces valuable\ntrajectories at a lower cost. Apollo then applies supervision control to filter\nout sub-optimal actions and prevent error propagation. Together, these\ncomponents enable reliable and effective data collection in long-horizon\nenvironments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Apollo, we evaluate it using\nInnovatorBench. Our experiments show that when applied to train the GLM-4.5\nmodel on InnovatorBench, Apollo achieves more than a 50% improvement over the\nuntrained baseline and a 28% improvement over a variant trained without human\ninteraction.

In\nthis paper, we propose MemeArena, an agent-based arena-style evaluation\nframework that provides a context-aware and unbiased assessment for mLLMs'\nunderstanding of multimodal harmfulness. Specifically, MemeArena simulates\ndiverse interpretive contexts to formulate evaluation tasks that elicit\nperspective-specific analyses from mLLMs. By integrating varied viewpoints and\nreaching consensus among evaluators, it enables fair and unbiased comparisons\nof mLLMs' abilities to interpret multimodal harmfulness. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our framework effectively reduces the evaluation biases of\njudge agents, with judgment results closely aligning with human preferences,\noffering valuable insights into reliable and comprehensive mLLM evaluations in\nmultimodal harmfulness understanding.

Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) addresses this issue by grounding LLMs in external knowledge;\nHowever, the effectiveness of RAG critically depends on whether the model can\nadequately access relevant information. Existing RAG systems rely on a single\nretriever with fixed top-k selection, restricting access to a narrow and static\nsubset of the corpus. As a result, this single-retriever paradigm has become\nthe primary bottleneck for comprehensive external information acquisition,\nespecially in tasks requiring corpus-level reasoning. To overcome this\nlimitation, we propose MARAG-R1, a reinforcement-learned multi-tool RAG\nframework that enables LLMs to dynamically coordinate multiple retrieval\nmechanisms for broader and more precise information access. MARAG-R1 equips the\nmodel with four retrieval tools -- semantic search, keyword search, filtering,\nand aggregation -- and learns both how and when to use them through a two-stage\ntraining process: supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning.\nThis design allows the model to interleave reasoning and retrieval,\nprogressively gathering sufficient evidence for corpus-level synthesis.\nExperiments on GlobalQA, HotpotQA, and 2WikiMultiHopQA demonstrate that\nMARAG-R1 substantially outperforms strong baselines and achieves new\nstate-of-the-art results in corpus-level reasoning tasks."}

While\nrecent efforts have reduced this gap, its underlying causes remain largely\nunexplored. In this paper, we address this by showing that the multilingual\nreasoning gap largely stems from failures in language understanding-the model's\ninability to represent the multilingual input meaning into the dominant\nlanguage (i.e., English) within its reasoning trace. This motivates us to\nexamine whether understanding failures can be detected, as this ability could\nhelp mitigate the multilingual reasoning gap.

However, such vision driven embodied agents open a new attack\nsurface: visual backdoor attacks, where the agent behaves normally until a\nvisual trigger appears in the scene, then persistently executes an\nattacker-specified multi-step policy. We introduce BEAT, the first framework to\ninject such visual backdoors into MLLM-based embodied agents using objects in\nthe environments as triggers. Unlike textual triggers, object triggers exhibit\nwide variation across viewpoints and lighting, making them difficult to implant\nreliably. BEAT addresses this challenge by (1) constructing a training set that\nspans diverse scenes, tasks, and trigger placements to expose agents to trigger\nvariability, and (2) introducing a two-stage training scheme that first applies\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) and then our novel Contrastive Trigger Learning\n(CTL). CTL formulates trigger discrimination as preference learning between\ntrigger-present and trigger-free inputs, explicitly sharpening the decision\nboundaries to ensure precise backdoor activation. Across various embodied agent\nbenchmarks and MLLMs, BEAT achieves attack success rates up to 80%, while\nmaintaining strong benign task performance, and generalizes reliably to\nout-of-distribution trigger placements. Notably, compared to naive SFT, CTL\nboosts backdoor activation accuracy up to 39% under limited backdoor data.\nThese findings expose a critical yet unexplored security risk in MLLM-based\nembodied agents, underscoring the need for robust defenses before real-world\ndeployment."}
