For most of these tasks, performance can be measured with\nobjective metrics, such as the number of correct answers. However, other\nlanguage features are not easily quantified. For example, arousal,\nconcreteness, or gender associated with a given word, as well as the extent to\nwhich we experience words with senses and relate them to a specific sense.\nThose features have been studied for many years by psycholinguistics,\nconducting large-scale experiments with humans to produce ratings for thousands\nof words. This opens an opportunity to evaluate how well LLMs align with human\nratings on these word features, taking advantage of existing studies that cover\nmany different language features in a large number of words. In this paper, we\nevaluate the alignment of a representative group of LLMs with human ratings on\ntwo psycholinguistic datasets: the Glasgow and Lancaster norms. These datasets\ncover thirteen features over thousands of words. The results show that\nalignment is \\textcolor{black}{generally} better in the Glasgow norms evaluated\n(arousal, valence, dominance, concreteness, imageability, familiarity, and\ngender) than on the Lancaster norms evaluated (introceptive, gustatory,\nolfactory, haptic, auditory, and visual).

To this end, we\npropose VoteSplat, a novel 3D scene understanding framework that integrates\nHough voting with 3DGS. Specifically, Segment Anything Model (SAM) is utilized\nfor instance segmentation, extracting objects, and generating 2D vote maps. We\nthen embed spatial offset vectors into Gaussian primitives. These offsets\nconstruct 3D spatial votes by associating them with 2D image votes, while depth\ndistortion constraints refine localization along the depth axis.

A common limitation in\nexisting vision-based automatic pest counting research is that models are\ntypically evaluated on datasets with ground truth but deployed in real-world\nscenarios without assessing the reliability of counting results due to the lack\nof ground truth. To this end, this paper proposed a method for comprehensively\nevaluating pest counting confidence in the image, based on information related\nto counting results and external environmental conditions. First, a pest\ndetection network is used for pest detection and counting, extracting counting\nresult-related information. Then, the pest images undergo image quality\nassessment, image complexity assessment, and pest distribution uniformity\nassessment. And the changes in image clarity caused by stirring during image\nacquisition are quantified by calculating the average gradient magnitude.\nNotably, we designed a hypothesis-driven multi-factor sensitivity analysis\nmethod to select the optimal image quality assessment and image complexity\nassessment methods. And we proposed an adaptive DBSCAN clustering algorithm for\npest distribution uniformity assessment. Finally, the obtained information\nrelated to counting results and external environmental conditions is input into\na regression model for prediction, resulting in the final pest counting\nconfidence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study dedicated to\ncomprehensively evaluating counting confidence in counting tasks, and\nquantifying the relationship between influencing factors and counting\nconfidence through a model.

Understanding the interactions across these scales is\nessential for fully comprehending such complex problems. However, visualizing\nmultivariate, multiscale data within an integrated view where correlations\nacross space, scales, and fields are easily perceived remains challenging. To\naddress this, we introduce a novel local spatial statistical visualization of\nflow fields across multiple fields and turbulence scales. Our method leverages\nthe curvelet transform for scale decomposition of fields of interest, a\nlevel-set-restricted centroidal Voronoi tessellation to partition the spatial\ndomain into local regions for statistical aggregation, and a set of glyph\ndesigns that combines information across scales and fields into a single, or\nreduced set of perceivable visual representations. Each glyph represents data\naggregated within a Voronoi region and is positioned at the Voronoi site for\ndirect visualization in a 3D view centered around flow features of interest.

While other technologies may also pose substantial\nrisks, AI's pervasive reach makes its societal effects especially profound. The\ncomplexity of AI systems, coupled with their remarkable capabilities, can lead\nto a reliance on technologies that operate beyond direct human oversight or\nunderstanding. To mitigate the risks that arise, several theoretical tools and\nguidelines have been developed, alongside efforts to create technological tools\naimed at safeguarding Trustworthy AI.

However, the independent development of voice and gesture\ngeneration technologies, alongside the growing popularity of virtual reality\n(VR), presents significant questions about the integration of these signals and\ntheir ability to convey emotional detail in immersive environments. In this\npaper, we evaluate the influence of real and synthetic gestures and speech,\nalongside varying levels of immersion (VR vs. 2D displays) and emotional\ncontexts (positive, neutral, negative) on user perceptions. We investigate how\nimmersion affects the perceived match between gestures and speech and the\nimpact on key aspects of user experience, including emotional and empathetic\nresponses and the sense of co-presence. Our findings indicate that while VR\nenhances the perception of natural gesture-voice pairings, it does not\nsimilarly improve synthetic ones - amplifying the perceptual gap between them.\nThese results highlight the need to reassess gesture appropriateness and refine\nAI-driven synthesis for immersive environments.

A\ndrafter-based speculative decoding leverages one or more smaller language\nmodels, a.k.a. drafters or draft models, to sample a draft sequence or tree\nconsisting of multiple tokens, followed by verification by a base LLM, a target\nmodel, accepting a subset as its valid generation. As it is usually considered\nthat the speculative decoding requires one-to-one mapping between vocabularies\nof the target model and the draft model, it has been natural to share the\nvocabulary between them, or even share the LM head as in EAGLE or Medusa. We\nfirst identify that this draft token sampling scheme inherently contains an\nunnecessary inference overhead in drafting, especially for some target LLMs\nwith very large vocabularies. Then, we propose a simple technique, VocabTrim,\nto mitigate the drafting overhead to improve the generation speed in\nmemory-bound environment. VocabTrim reconstructs the drafter LM head to contain\nonly a limited set of tokens, selected by the most frequently sampled from the\nvocabulary of the target model.

Recently, with the development of Diffusion-based Dense Prediction\n(DDP) models, the exploration of DA designs tailored to this framework is worth\nexploring, since the diffusion model is effective in modeling the distribution\ntransformation that comprises domain information. In this work, we propose a\ntraining-free mechanism for DDP frameworks, endowing them with DA capabilities.\nOur motivation arises from the observation that the exposure bias (e.g., noise\nstatistics bias) in diffusion brings domain shift, and different domains in\nconditions of DDP models can also be effectively captured by the noise\nprediction statistics. Based on this, we propose a training-free Domain Noise\nAlignment (DNA) approach, which alleviates the variations of noise statistics\nto domain changes during the diffusion sampling process, thereby achieving\ndomain adaptation. Specifically, when the source domain is available, we\ndirectly adopt the DNA method to achieve domain adaptation by aligning the\nnoise statistics of the target domain with those of the source domain. For the\nmore challenging source-free DA, inspired by the observation that regions\ncloser to the source domain exhibit higher confidence meeting variations of\nsampling noise, we utilize the statistics from the high-confidence regions\nprogressively to guide the noise statistic adjustment during the sampling\nprocess. Notably, our method demonstrates the effectiveness of enhancing the DA\ncapability of DDP models across four common dense prediction tasks.

NCAs display striking emergent behaviors including\nself-regeneration, generalization and robustness to unseen situations, and\nspontaneous motion. Despite their success in texture synthesis and\nmorphogenesis, NCAs remain largely confined to low-resolution grids. This\nlimitation stems from (1) training time and memory requirements that grow\nquadratically with grid size, (2) the strictly local propagation of information\nwhich impedes long-range cell communication, and (3) the heavy compute demands\nof real-time inference at high resolution. In this work, we overcome this\nlimitation by pairing NCA with a tiny, shared implicit decoder, inspired by\nrecent advances in implicit neural representations. Following NCA evolution on\na coarse grid, a lightweight decoder renders output images at arbitrary\nresolution. We also propose novel loss functions for both morphogenesis and\ntexture synthesis tasks, specifically tailored for high-resolution output with\nminimal memory and computation overhead. Combining our proposed architecture\nand loss functions brings substantial improvement in quality, efficiency, and\nperformance.

This study investigates the ability of LLMs to simulate\nrisky decision-making scenarios. We compare model-generated decisions with\nactual human responses in a series of lottery-based tasks, using transportation\nstated preference survey data from participants in Sydney, Dhaka, Hong Kong,\nand Nanjing. Demographic inputs were provided to two LLMs -- ChatGPT 4o and\nChatGPT o1-mini -- which were tasked with predicting individual choices. Risk\npreferences were analyzed using the Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA)\nframework.

As its\nbasic information source, the technique consists of compiling and categorizing\n223 CR photographs of airplane welds.

A modified U-net model is prepared using the improved data\nto produce semantic fault division veils. To assess the effectiveness of the\nmodel, NDE boundaries such as Case, estimating exactness, and misleading call\nrate are used. Tiny a90/95 characteristics, which provide strong\ndifferentiating evidence of flaws, reveal that the suggested approach achieves\nexceptional awareness in defect detection. Considering a 90/95, size error, and\nfake call rate in the weld area, the consolidated expansion approach clearly\nwins. Due to the framework's fast derivation speed, large images can be broken\ndown efficiently and quickly.

We propose verbalization fine-tuning (VFT), a pre-RL\nintervention that trains models to explicitly acknowledge when they are\ninfluenced by prompt cues--hints which point to incorrect answers (e.g., \"a\nStanford professor thinks the answer is A\"). To evaluate VFT, we subsequently\ntrain models with RL on environments where held-out prompt cues signal which\nincorrect answers will receive high reward, incentivizing models to reward hack\nby exploiting cues instead of reasoning correctly. We measure how often models\nexploit these cues without verbalizing it. After RL, only 6% of the VFT-trained\nmodel's responses consist of undetected reward hacks. In comparison, when we\nperform RL without VFT, the rate of undetected reward hacks goes up to 88%;\nwith a debiasing baseline intervention, this increases further to 99%.

To address this challenge, we propose a semantic-aware relational\nmessage passing.

In this manner, our model not only leverages the structure and\nfeatures of edges within the knowledge graph but also more accurately captures\nand propagates the contextual information most relevant to the specific link\nprediction task, thereby effectively mitigating interference from irrelevant\ninformation.

This eliminates the need to sample the space of all\npossible boxes that constrains conventional detectors and thus solves the dual\nproblems of loss sparsity during training and heuristics-based postprocessing\nduring inference. Second, it conceptualizes and outputs the video objects as\nfully integrated and indivisible 3D boxes or tracklets instead of generating\nimage-specific 2D boxes and linking these boxes together to construct the video\nobject, as done in most conventional detectors. This allows it to scale\neffortlessly with available computational resources by simply increasing the\nlength of the video subsequence that the network takes as input, even\ngeneralizing to multi-object tracking if the subsequence can span the entire\nvideo.

However, their autoregressive decoding process limits inference\nspeed, making them unsuitable for real-time applications. In contrast,\nCTC-based models offer faster, non-autoregressive decoding but struggle to\nmodel linguistic dependencies effectively. Addressing this challenge, we\npropose a novel auxiliary loss framework called Language-Aware Intermediate\nLoss (LAIL) to enhance CTC-based ASR using the linguistic knowledge of large\nlanguage models (LLMs).

In particular, how LLMs balance self-interest and\ncollective well-being is a critical challenge for ensuring alignment,\nrobustness, and safe deployment. In this paper, we examine the challenge of\ncostly sanctioning in multi-agent LLM systems, where an agent must decide\nwhether to invest its own resources to incentivize cooperation or penalize\ndefection. To study this, we adapt a public goods game with institutional\nchoice from behavioral economics, allowing us to observe how different LLMs\nnavigate social dilemmas over repeated interactions. Our analysis reveals four\ndistinct behavioral patterns among models: some consistently establish and\nsustain high levels of cooperation, others fluctuate between engagement and\ndisengagement, some gradually decline in cooperative behavior over time, and\nothers rigidly follow fixed strategies regardless of outcomes. Surprisingly, we\nfind that reasoning LLMs, such as the o1 series, struggle significantly with\ncooperation, whereas some traditional LLMs consistently achieve high levels of\ncooperation. These findings suggest that the current approach to improving\nLLMs, which focuses on enhancing their reasoning capabilities, does not\nnecessarily lead to cooperation, providing valuable insights for deploying LLM\nagents in environments that require sustained collaboration.

However, transferring\nthis success to biomedicine is hindered by the scarcity of large-scale\nbiomedical image-text corpora, the heterogeneity of image modalities, and\nfragmented data standards across institutions. These limitations hinder the\ndevelopment of a unified and generalizable biomedical foundation model trained\nfrom scratch. To overcome this, we introduce MMKD-CLIP, a generalist biomedical\nfoundation model developed via Multiple Medical CLIP Knowledge Distillation.\nRather than relying on billion-scale raw data, MMKD-CLIP distills knowledge\nfrom nine state-of-the-art domain-specific or generalist biomedical CLIP\nmodels, each pretrained on millions of biomedical image-text pairs. Our\ntwo-stage training pipeline first performs CLIP-style pretraining on over 2.9\nmillion biomedical image-text pairs from 26 image modalities, followed by\nfeature-level distillation using over 19.2 million feature pairs extracted from\nteacher models. We evaluate MMKD-CLIP on 58 diverse biomedical datasets,\nencompassing over 10.8 million biomedical images across nine image modalities.\nThe evaluation spans six core task types: zero-shot classification, linear\nprobing, cross-modal retrieval, visual question answering, survival prediction,\nand cancer diagnosis. MMKD-CLIP consistently outperforms all teacher models\nwhile demonstrating remarkable robustness and generalization across image\ndomains and task settings.

Notably, Seg-R1 achieves\nremarkable performance with purely RL-based training, achieving .873 S-measure\non COD10K without complex model modification. Moreover, we found that pure RL\ntraining demonstrates strong open-world generalization. Despite being trained\nsolely on foreground segmentation image-mask pairs without text supervision,\nSeg-R1 achieves impressive zero-shot performance on referring segmentation and\nreasoning segmentation tasks, with 71.4 cIoU on RefCOCOg test and 56.7 gIoU on\nReasonSeg test, outperforming models fully supervised on these datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "Seg-R1\u5229\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7GRPO\u7b56\u7565\u548cSAM2\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u5728COD\u548cSOD\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u524d\u666f\u5206\u5272\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528GRPO\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u70b9\u4e0e\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408SAM2\u751f\u6210\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u5728COD10K\u4e0a\u8fbe\u52300.873 S-measure\uff0c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2dRefCOCOg\u548cReasonSeg\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523071.4 cIoU\u548c56.7 gIoU\u3002", "conclusion": "Seg-R1\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7eaf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u4fee\u6539\u6216\u6587\u672c\u76d1\u7763\u3002"}}

We reproduce their results on both GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019)\nand Pythia 6.9B (Biderman et al., 2023). We extend their work in three\nsignificant directions. First, we explore the generalizability of these\nfindings to even larger models by replicating the experiments on Llama 3.1 8B\n(Grattafiori et al., 2024), discovering greatly reduced attention head\nspecialization. Second, we investigate the impact of prompt structure by\nintroducing variations where we avoid repeating the counterfactual statement\nverbatim or we change the premise word, observing a marked decrease in the\nlogit for the counterfactual token. Finally, we test the validity of the\nauthors' claims for prompts of specific domains, discovering that certain\ncategories of prompts skew the results by providing the factual prediction\ntoken as part of the subject of the sentence.

In this paper, we present a method to solve\nthese two problems jointly from a sequence of observed point clouds of a single\narticulated object. The main challenge in our problem setting is that the point\nclouds are not assumed to be generated by a fixed set of moving points.\nInstead, each point cloud in the sequence could be an arbitrary sampling of the\nobject surface at that particular time step. Such scenarios occur when the\nobject undergoes major occlusions, or if the dataset is collected using\nmeasurements from multiple sensors asynchronously. In these scenarios, methods\nthat rely on tracking point correspondences are not appropriate. We present an\nalternative approach based on a compact but effective representation where we\nrepresent the object as a collection of simple building blocks modeled as 3D\nGaussians. We parameterize the Gaussians with time-dependent rotations,\ntranslations, and scales that are shared across all time steps. With our\nrepresentation, part segmentation can be achieved by building correspondences\nbetween the observed points and the Gaussians. Moreover, the transformation of\neach point across time can be obtained by following the poses of the assigned\nGaussian (even when the point is not observed). Experiments show that our\nmethod outperforms existing methods that solely rely on finding point\ncorrespondences. Additionally, we extend existing datasets to emulate\nreal-world scenarios by considering viewpoint occlusions. We further\ndemonstrate that our method is more robust to missing points as compared to\nexisting approaches on these challenging datasets, even when some parts are\ncompletely occluded in some time-steps.

To\ngenerate large-scale and denser colored point clouds, we propose a deep\nlearning-based Joint Geometry and Attribute Up-sampling (JGAU) method that\nlearns to model both geometry and attribute patterns while leveraging spatial\nattribute correlations. First, we establish and release a large-scale dataset\nfor colored point cloud up-sampling called SYSU-PCUD, containing 121\nlarge-scale colored point clouds with diverse geometry and attribute\ncomplexities across six categories and four sampling rates. Second, to improve\nthe quality of up-sampled point clouds, we propose a deep learning-based JGAU\nframework that jointly up-samples geometry and attributes. It consists of a\ngeometry up-sampling network and an attribute up-sampling network, where the\nlatter leverages the up-sampled auxiliary geometry to model neighborhood\ncorrelations of the attributes. Third, we propose two coarse attribute\nup-sampling methods, Geometric Distance Weighted Attribute Interpolation\n(GDWAI) and Deep Learning-based Attribute Interpolation (DLAI), to generate\ncoarse up-sampled attributes for each point. Then, an attribute enhancement\nmodule is introduced to refine these up-sampled attributes and produce\nhigh-quality point clouds by further exploiting intrinsic attribute and\ngeometry patterns. Extensive experiments show that the Peak Signal-to-Noise\nRatio (PSNR) achieved by the proposed JGAU method is 33.90 decibels, 32.10\ndecibels, 31.10 decibels, and 30.39 decibels for up-sampling rates of 4 times,\n8 times, 12 times, and 16 times, respectively.

Following a top-down approach, a generic foundation for safety\nanalysis and assurance is outlined at an abstract level that can be refined for\nspecific AI systems and applications and is prepared for future innovation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347AI\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u79f0\u4e3a\u201c\u6570\u636e\u63a7\u5236\u201d\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u63a7\u5236\u7406\u8bba\u548cAI\u6280\u672f\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6570\u636e\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4fdd\u969c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540cAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8AI\u5de5\u7a0b\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u969c\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u521b\u65b0\u3002"}}

This separate\nencoding fails to bridge the modality gap effectively, and more critically,\nthese methods struggle with the sparsity and noise of single-frame LiDAR, often\nrequiring point cloud accumulation or additional priors to improve reliability.\nInspired by recent progress in detector-free matching paradigms (e.g.\nMatchAnything), we revisit the projection-based approach and introduce the\ndetector-free framework for direct point-pixel matching between LiDAR and\ncamera views.

These large-model agents mark a paradigm shift from\nstatic inference systems to interactive, memory-augmented entities. While these\ncapabilities significantly expand the functional scope of AI, they also\nintroduce qualitatively novel security risks - such as memory poisoning, tool\nmisuse, reward hacking, and emergent misalignment - that extend beyond the\nthreat models of conventional systems or standalone LLMs. In this survey, we\nfirst examine the structural foundations and key capabilities that underpin\nincreasing levels of agent autonomy, including long-term memory retention,\nmodular tool use, recursive planning, and reflective reasoning.

Concept erasing has been investigated with the goals of deleting\ntarget concepts in diffusion models while preserving other concepts with\nminimal distortion. To achieve these goals, recent concept erasing methods\nusually fine-tune the cross-attention layers of diffusion models. In this work,\nwe first show that merely updating the cross-attention layers in diffusion\nmodels, which is mathematically equivalent to adding \\emph{linear} modules to\nweights, may not be able to preserve diverse remaining concepts. Then, we\npropose a novel framework, dubbed Concept Pinpoint Eraser (CPE), by adding\n\\emph{nonlinear} Residual Attention Gates (ResAGs) that selectively erase (or\ncut) target concepts while safeguarding remaining concepts from broad\ndistributions by employing an attention anchoring loss to prevent the\nforgetting. Moreover, we adversarially train CPE with ResAG and learnable text\nembeddings in an iterative manner to maximize erasing performance and enhance\nrobustness against adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments on the erasure of\ncelebrities, artistic styles, and explicit contents demonstrated that the\nproposed CPE outperforms prior arts by keeping diverse remaining concepts while\ndeleting the target concepts with robustness against attack prompts.

Myles Eugenio"], "title": "Objective-Free Local Learning and Emergent Language Structure in Thinking Machines", "comment": "22 pages, 7 figures", "summary": "We present a neuro-symbolic framework for generative language modeling based\non local, event-driven emergent learning. At its core is a hierarchical\nHopfield memory chain acting as a compositional short-term memory and dynamic\ntokenizer (retokenizer). Rather than relying on predefined tokens or\nsupervision, the model builds structure from scratch, learning symbol sequences\nas multi-scale representations. It constructs projection tensors that bind\nco-occurring features into hierarchical tokens, introducing redundancy (i.e an\nemergent gauge structure) and enabling compression of local activations into\nlong-range dependencies. Curiously, we find that the retokenizer can filter\nnatural language patterns from noise, generating synthetic languages with\ncoherent internal morphology -- quantifiably the same as human language.\nLanguage is learned in a local (Hebbian) fashion, where model constraints\ndictate allowed emergent structure, and new information is retained in\nalignment with this structure. The absence of a global objective enables a form\nof plasticity not found in conventional language models, allowing the system to\ngeneralize beyond its initial inference class -- even without explicit data. We\ndemonstrate that briefly activating a new neuron during inference binds\ndistributed multi-scale token features into a symbolic embedding. These\nemergent embedding neurons act as long-term memory and support a key-value\nmechanism for compositional inference and generalization.

This work introduces SemFaceEdit, a\nnovel method that streamlines the appearance and geometric editing process by\ngenerating semantic fields on generative radiance manifolds. Utilizing latent\ncodes, our method effectively disentangles the geometry and appearance\nassociated with different facial semantics within the generated image. In\ncontrast to existing methods that can change the appearance of the entire\nradiance field, our method enables the precise editing of particular facial\nsemantics while preserving the integrity of other regions. Our network\ncomprises two key modules: the Geometry module, which generates semantic\nradiance and occupancy fields, and the Appearance module, which is responsible\nfor predicting RGB radiance. We jointly train both modules in adversarial\nsettings to learn semantic-aware geometry and appearance descriptors. The\nappearance descriptors are then conditioned on their respective semantic latent\ncodes by the Appearance Module, facilitating disentanglement and enhanced\ncontrol.

Building upon the\nachievements of the AG-ReID 2023 Challenge, this paper introduces the AG-VPReID\n2025 Challenge - the first large-scale video-based competition focused on\nhigh-altitude (80-120m) aerial-ground ReID. Constructed on the new AG-VPReID\ndataset with 3,027 identities, over 13,500 tracklets, and approximately 3.7\nmillion frames captured from UAVs, CCTV, and wearable cameras, the challenge\nfeatured four international teams. These teams developed solutions ranging from\nmulti-stream architectures to transformer-based temporal reasoning and\nphysics-informed modeling. The leading approach, X-TFCLIP from UAM, attained\n72.28% Rank-1 accuracy in the aerial-to-ground ReID setting and 70.77% in the\nground-to-aerial ReID setting, surpassing existing baselines while highlighting\nthe dataset's complexity.

To address this critical issue, we propose a\nunified, probability-agnostic, and adaptive framework, namely, CP-Guard, which\nis a tailored defense mechanism for CP deployed by each agent to accurately\ndetect and eliminate malicious agents in its collaboration network. Our key\nidea is to enable CP to reach a consensus rather than a conflict against an ego\nagent's perception results. Based on this idea, we first develop a\nprobability-agnostic sample consensus (PASAC) method to effectively sample a\nsubset of the collaborators and verify the consensus without prior\nprobabilities of malicious agents. Furthermore, we define collaborative\nconsistency loss (CCLoss) for object detection task and bird's eye view (BEV)\nsegmentation task to capture the discrepancy between an ego agent and its\ncollaborators, which is used as a verification criterion for consensus. In\naddition, we propose online adaptive threshold via dual sliding windows to\ndynamically adjust the threshold for consensus verification and ensure the\nreliability of the systems in dynamic environments.

In visual paraphrase attacks, an image is altered while preserving\nits core semantic regions, termed Non-Melting Points (NMPs). PECCAVI\nstrategically embeds watermarks within these NMPs and employs multi-channel\nfrequency domain watermarking. It also incorporates noisy burnishing to counter\nreverse-engineering efforts aimed at locating NMPs to disrupt the embedded\nwatermark, thereby enhancing durability. PECCAVI is model-agnostic.

Recently, pretrained vision-language\nmodels (VLMs) such as CLIP have been leveraged in GFSS to improve\ngeneralization on novel classes through multi-modal prototypes learning.\nHowever, existing prototype-based methods are inherently deterministic,\nlimiting the adaptability of learned prototypes to diverse samples,\nparticularly for novel classes with scarce annotations. To address this, we\npropose FewCLIP, a probabilistic prototype calibration framework over\nmulti-modal prototypes from the pretrained CLIP, thus providing more adaptive\nprototype learning for GFSS. Specifically, FewCLIP first introduces a prototype\ncalibration mechanism, which refines frozen textual prototypes with learnable\nvisual calibration prototypes, leading to a more discriminative and adaptive\nrepresentation. Furthermore, unlike deterministic prototype learning\ntechniques, FewCLIP introduces distribution regularization over these\ncalibration prototypes.

One hope is that they can support\nmathematics learning, including word-problem solving. Since LLMs can handle\ntextual input with ease, they appear well-suited for solving mathematical word\nproblems. Yet their real competence, whether they can make sense of the\nreal-world context, and the implications for classrooms remain unclear. We\nconducted a scoping review from a mathematics-education perspective, including\nthree parts: a technical overview, a systematic review of word problems used in\nresearch, and a state-of-the-art empirical evaluation of LLMs on mathematical\nword problems. First, in the technical overview, we contrast the\nconceptualization of word problems and their solution processes between LLMs\nand students. In computer-science research this is typically labeled\nmathematical reasoning, a term that does not align with usage in mathematics\neducation. Second, our literature review of 213 studies shows that the most\npopular word-problem corpora are dominated by s-problems, which do not require\na consideration of realities of their real-world context. Finally, our\nevaluation of GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1, and o3 on 287 word problems\nshows that most recent LLMs solve these s-problems with near-perfect accuracy,\nincluding a perfect score on 20 problems from PISA. LLMs still showed\nweaknesses in tackling problems where the real-world context is problematic or\nnon-sensical. In sum, we argue based on all three aspects that LLMs have\nmastered a superficial solution process but do not make sense of word problems,\nwhich potentially limits their value as instructional tools in mathematics\nclassrooms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u7b80\u5355\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u60c5\u5883\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76LLMs\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u9898\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6559\u5b66\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6280\u672f\u6982\u8ff0\u3001\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\uff08213\u9879\u7814\u7a76\uff09\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08287\u9053\u5e94\u7528\u9898\uff09\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5206\u6790LLMs\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u5e94\u7528\u9898\uff08s-problems\uff09\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9700\u8981\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u60c5\u5883\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u8868\u9762\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u60c5\u5883\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u8bfe\u5802\u4e2d\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

For the high-frequency components, we apply a High-frequency\nFeature Refinement (HFR) to amplify the prominence of key features and filter\nout noises, restoring fine-grained details in blurred images. For the\nlow-frequency components, we use a Multi-granularity State Space Model (MG-SSM)\nto aggregate feature representations with different receptive fields,\nextracting spatially-varying contexts while capturing long-range dependencies\nwith linear complexity. The utilization of multi-granularity contexts is\nessential for distinguishing similar vertebrae and improving segmentation\naccuracy.

In this\npaper, we introduce $\\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$, a multi-modal large language model\ndesigned to process these four types of data simultaneously and achieve strong\nperformance across diverse urban tasks compared with general MLLMs. In\n$\\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$, we first curate a diverse urban instruction dataset\nencompassing both single-modal and cross-modal urban data, spanning from\nlocation view to global view of urban environment. Additionally, we propose a\nmulti-stage training framework that decouples spatial reasoning enhancement\nfrom domain knowledge learning, thereby improving the compatibility and\ndownstream performance of $\\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$ across diverse urban tasks.\nFinally, we also extend existing benchmark for urban research to assess the\nperformance of MLLMs across a wide range of urban tasks. Experimental results\nfrom three cities demonstrate that $\\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$ outperforms\nopen-source and proprietary MLLMs in both single-modal tasks and complex\ncross-modal tasks and shows robust generalization abilities across cities.\nSource codes and data are openly accessible to the research community via\nhttps://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/UrbanLLaVA.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578bUrbanLLaVA\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u57ce\u5e02\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57ce\u5e02\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u7684\u6210\u529f\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u673a\u4f1a\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u6307\u4ee4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cUrbanLLaVA\u5728\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u4e13\u6709MLLMs\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u8de8\u57ce\u5e02\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "UrbanLLaVA\u4e3a\u57ce\u5e02\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5904\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5176\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5df2\u5f00\u6e90\u3002"}}

To systematically study this problem, we first introduce\n$\\textbf{T2IS-Bench}$ with 596 diverse instructions across 26 subcategories,\nproviding comprehensive coverage for T2IS generation. Building on this, we\npropose $\\textbf{T2IS-Eval}$, an evaluation framework that transforms user\ninstructions into multifaceted assessment criteria and employs effective\nevaluators to adaptively assess consistency fulfillment between criteria and\ngenerated sets. Subsequently, we propose $\\textbf{AutoT2IS}$, a training-free\nframework that maximally leverages pretrained Diffusion Transformers'\nin-context capabilities to harmonize visual elements to satisfy both\nimage-level prompt alignment and set-level visual consistency. Extensive\nexperiments on T2IS-Bench reveal that diverse consistency challenges all\nexisting methods, while our AutoT2IS significantly outperforms current\ngeneralized and even specialized approaches. Our method also demonstrates the\nability to enable numerous underexplored real-world applications, confirming\nits substantial practical value.

However, these methods rely heavily on sufficient motion\nparallax in the input images or videos. When the camera motion range becomes\nlimited or even stationary (i.e., small camera motion), existing methods\nencounter two primary challenges: incorrect representation of scene geometry\nand inaccurate estimation of camera parameters. These challenges make prior\nmethods struggle to produce satisfactory results or even become invalid. To\naddress the first challenge, we propose a novel Distribution-based Depth\nRegularization (DDR) that ensures the rendering weight distribution to align\nwith the true distribution. Specifically, unlike previous methods that use\ndepth loss to calculate the error of the expectation, we calculate the\nexpectation of the error by using Gumbel-softmax to differentiably sample\npoints from discrete rendering weight distribution. Additionally, we introduce\nconstraints that enforce the volume density of spatial points before the object\nboundary along the ray to be near zero, ensuring that our model learns the\ncorrect geometry of the scene. To demystify the DDR, we further propose a\nvisualization tool that enables observing the scene geometry representation at\nthe rendering weight level. For the second challenge, we incorporate camera\nparameter learning during training to enhance the robustness of our model to\ncamera parameters.

However, this unified paradigm\nfails in the potential discontinuous temporal features of objects due to frame\nimaging and the heterogeneous spatial features between background and objects.\nTo address this issue, we disentangle the spatiotemporal features into various\nlatent representations to alleviate the spatiotemporal mismatching between\nbackground and objects. In this work, we introduce event camera to compensate\nfor frame camera, and propose a spatiotemporal-disentangled Gaussian splatting\nframework for high-dynamic scene reconstruction. As for dynamic scene, we\nfigure out that background and objects have appearance discrepancy in\nframe-based spatial features and motion discrepancy in event-based temporal\nfeatures, which motivates us to distinguish the spatiotemporal features between\nbackground and objects via clustering. As for dynamic object, we discover that\nGaussian representations and event data share the consistent spatiotemporal\ncharacteristic, which could serve as a prior to guide the spatiotemporal\ndisentanglement of object Gaussians.

In response to\nthis challenge, we introduce \\textit{Trident}, a face forgery detection\nframework that employs triplet learning with a Siamese network architecture for\nenhanced adaptability across diverse forgery methods. \\textit{Trident} is\ntrained on curated triplets to isolate nuanced differences of forgeries,\ncapturing fine-grained features that distinguish pristine samples from\nmanipulated ones while controlling for other variables. To further enhance\ngeneralizability, we incorporate domain-adversarial training with a forgery\ndiscriminator.

However, the heavy\nreliance of existing systems on photometric rendering loss for camera tracking\nundermines their robustness, especially in unbounded outdoor environments with\nsevere viewpoint and illumination changes. To address these challenges, we\npropose TVG-SLAM, a robust RGB-only 3DGS SLAM system that leverages a novel\ntri-view geometry paradigm to ensure consistent tracking and high-quality\nmapping. We introduce a dense tri-view matching module that aggregates reliable\npairwise correspondences into consistent tri-view matches, forming robust\ngeometric constraints across frames. For tracking, we propose Hybrid Geometric\nConstraints, which leverage tri-view matches to construct complementary\ngeometric cues alongside photometric loss, ensuring accurate and stable pose\nestimation even under drastic viewpoint shifts and lighting variations. For\nmapping, we propose a new probabilistic initialization strategy that encodes\ngeometric uncertainty from tri-view correspondences into newly initialized\nGaussians.

However,\nlarge-scale datasets, specially those constructed from crowd-sourcing and\nweb-scraping, often suffer from label noise, inconsistencies, and errors. This\nproblem is particularly pronounced in manufacturing domains, where obtaining\nhigh-quality labels is costly and time-consuming. This paper introduces\nVision-Language Sanitization and Refinement (VLSR), which is a\nvision-language-based framework for label sanitization and refinement in\nmulti-label manufacturing image datasets. This method embeds both images and\ntheir associated textual labels into a shared semantic space leveraging the\nCLIP vision-language model. Then two key tasks are addressed in this process by\ncomputing the cosine similarity between embeddings. First, label sanitization\nis performed to identify irrelevant, misspelled, or semantically weak labels,\nand surface the most semantically aligned label for each image by comparing\nimage-label pairs using cosine similarity between image and label embeddings.\nSecond, the method applies density-based clustering on text embeddings,\nfollowed by iterative cluster merging, to group semantically similar labels\ninto unified label groups. The Factorynet dataset, which includes noisy labels\nfrom both human annotations and web-scraped sources, is employed to evaluate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed framework. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat the VLSR framework successfully identifies problematic labels and improves\nlabel consistency.

Our highlights are: 1) we\ndevelop a denoising diffusion model with local (plane) and global (volume/text)\nguidance, using an adaptive weighting strategy to optimize attention allocation\nto different conditions; 2) we introduce a reinforcement learning-based\nframework with unsupervised rewards to extract the key slice summary from\nredundant sequences, fully integrating information across multiple planes to\nreduce learning difficulty; 3) we provide text-driven uncertainty modeling for\ncoarse prediction, and leverage it to adjust the classification probability for\noverall performance improvement. Extensive experiments on a large 3D uterine US\ndataset show the efficacy of our method, in terms of plane localization and CUA\ndiagnosis.

In this paper, a framework called PCLVis is\nproposed to help general users analyze process communication latency (PCL)\nevents. Instead of the physical link layer information, the PCLVis uses the MPI\nprocess communication data for the analysis. First, a spatial PCL event\nlocating method is developed.

In this graph, a sliding window algorithm is\ndesigned to generate the PCL events abstraction. Meanwhile, a new glyph called\nthe communication state glyph (CS-Glyph) is designed for each process to show\nits communication states, including its in/out messages and load balance. Each\nleaf node can be further unfolded to view additional information. Third, a PCL\nevent attribution strategy is formulated to help users optimize their\nsimulations.

However, to date, existing TTA methods primarily focus\non single-model adaptation. In this work, we investigate an intriguing\nquestion: how does cross-model knowledge influence the TTA process? Our\nfindings reveal that, in TTA's unsupervised online setting, each model can\nprovide complementary, confident knowledge to the others, even when there are\nsubstantial differences in model size. For instance, a smaller model like\nMobileViT (10.6M parameters) can effectively guide a larger model like ViT-Base\n(86.6M parameters). In light of this, we propose COCA, a Cross-Model\nCo-Learning framework for TTA, which mainly consists of two main strategies. 1)\nCo-adaptation adaptively integrates complementary knowledge from other models\nthroughout the TTA process, reducing individual model biases. 2)\nSelf-adaptation enhances each model's unique strengths via unsupervised\nlearning, enabling diverse adaptation to the target domain.

Although existing deepfake detection\nmodels demonstrate outstanding performance in detection metrics, most methods\nonly provide simple binary classification results, lacking interpretability. In\ncritical domains such as law, interpretability is crucial for enhancing the\ncredibility and authority of decisions. Recent studies attempt to improve the\ninterpretability of classification results by providing spatial manipulation\nmasks or temporal forgery segments. However, the practical effectiveness of\nthese methods remains suboptimal due to limitations of the forgery data. Most\ncurrent deepfake datasets predominantly offer binary labels, only a few\ndatasets with localization annotations. However, they suffer from restricted\nforgery scenarios, limited diversity in deepfake types, and insufficient data\nscale, making them inadequate for complex real-world scenarios.

The recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)\ntechniques and their variants, 4DGS, achieve high-quality renderings of dynamic\nsurgical scenes in real-time.

GeoProg3D consists of two key components: (i) a Geography-aware\nCity-scale 3D Language Field (GCLF) that leverages a memory-efficient\nhierarchical 3D model to handle large-scale data, integrated with geographic\ninformation for efficiently filtering vast urban spaces using directional cues,\ndistance measurements, elevation data, and landmark references; and (ii)\nGeographical Vision APIs (GV-APIs), specialized geographic vision tools such as\narea segmentation and object detection. Our framework employs large language\nmodels (LLMs) as reasoning engines to dynamically combine GV-APIs and operate\nGCLF, effectively supporting diverse geographic vision tasks. To assess\nperformance in city-scale reasoning, we introduce GeoEval3D, a comprehensive\nbenchmark dataset containing 952 query-answer pairs across five challenging\ntasks: grounding, spatial reasoning, comparison, counting, and measurement.\nExperiments demonstrate that GeoProg3D significantly outperforms existing 3D\nlanguage fields and vision-language models across multiple tasks. To our\nknowledge, GeoProg3D is the first framework enabling compositional geographic\nreasoning in high-fidelity city-scale 3D environments via natural language.

A prevalent issue in compositional generation is the misalignment\nof spatial relationships, as models often fail to faithfully generate images\nthat reflect the spatial configurations specified between objects in the input\nprompts. To address this challenge, we propose a novel probabilistic framework\nfor modeling the relative spatial positioning of objects in a scene, leveraging\nthe concept of Probability of Superiority (PoS). Building on this insight, we\nmake two key contributions. First, we introduce a novel evaluation metric,\nPoS-based Evaluation (PSE), designed to assess the alignment of 2D and 3D\nspatial relationships between text and image, with improved adherence to human\njudgment. Second, we propose PoS-based Generation (PSG), an inference-time\nmethod that improves the alignment of 2D and 3D spatial relationships in T2I\nmodels without requiring fine-tuning. PSG employs a Part-of-Speech PoS-based\nreward function that can be utilized in two distinct ways: (1) as a\ngradient-based guidance mechanism applied to the cross-attention maps during\nthe denoising steps, or (2) as a search-based strategy that evaluates a set of\ninitial noise vectors to select the best one. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat the PSE metric exhibits stronger alignment with human judgment compared to\ntraditional center-based metrics, providing a more nuanced and reliable measure\nof complex spatial relationship accuracy in text-image alignment.

Conventional object\ndetection approaches classify objects into known classes, which limits the AV's\nability to detect and appropriately respond to Out-of-Distribution (OOD)\nobjects. This problem is a significant safety concern since the AV may fail to\ndetect objects or misclassify them, which can potentially lead to hazardous\nsituations such as accidents. Consequently, we propose a novel object detection\napproach that shifts the emphasis from conventional class-based classification\nto object harmfulness determination. Instead of object detection by their\nspecific class, our method identifies them as either 'harmful' or 'harmless'\nbased on whether they pose a danger to the AV. This is done based on the object\nposition relative to the AV and its trajectory. With this metric, our model can\neffectively detect previously unseen objects to enable the AV to make safer\nreal-time decisions.

In this paper, we\npropose a novel ToF depth denoising network leveraging motion-invariant graph\nfusion to simultaneously enhance temporal stability and spatial sharpness.\nSpecifically, despite depth shifts across frames, graph structures exhibit\ntemporal self-similarity, enabling cross-frame geometric attention for graph\nfusion. Then, by incorporating an image smoothness prior on the fused graph and\ndata fidelity term derived from ToF noise distribution, we formulate a maximum\na posterior problem for ToF denoising.

These are coupled via selective joint attention layers\nand incorporate key architectural choices, such as temporally aligned\npositional embeddings and localized joint attention masking, to enable\neffective cross-modal interaction while preserving modality-specific strengths.\nTrained with an inpainting-style objective, JAM-Flow supports a wide array of\nconditioning inputs-including text, reference audio, and reference\nmotion-facilitating tasks such as synchronized talking head generation from\ntext, audio-driven animation, and much more, within a single, coherent model.\nJAM-Flow significantly advances multi-modal generative modeling by providing a\npractical solution for holistic audio-visual synthesis. project page:\nhttps://joonghyuk.com/jamflow-web", "AI": {"tldr": "JAM-Flow\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5408\u6210\u9762\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u8bed\u97f3\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6269\u6563Transformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u8f93\u5165\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u9762\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u8bed\u97f3\u5408\u6210\u89c6\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u5185\u5728\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u548cMM-DiT\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Motion-DiT\u548cAudio-DiT\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8054\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "result": "JAM-Flow\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u8f93\u5165\u6761\u4ef6\uff08\u5982\u6587\u672c\u3001\u53c2\u8003\u97f3\u9891\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u8bf4\u8bdd\u5934\u90e8\u751f\u6210\u548c\u97f3\u9891\u9a71\u52a8\u52a8\u753b\u3002", "conclusion": "JAM-Flow\u4e3a\u6574\u4f53\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u5408\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Traditional frame-based cameras\nstruggle to detect small objects in complex environments due to their low frame\nrates, limited dynamic range, and data redundancy. Event cameras, with\nmicrosecond temporal resolution and high dynamic range, provide a more\neffective solution for SOD. However, existing event-based object detection\ndatasets are limited in scale, feature large targets size, and lack diverse\nbackgrounds, making them unsuitable for SOD benchmarks. In this paper, we\nintroduce a Event-based Small object detection (EVSOD) dataset (namely EV-UAV),\nthe first large-scale, highly diverse benchmark for anti-UAV tasks. It includes\n147 sequences with over 2.3 million event-level annotations, featuring\nextremely small targets (averaging 6.8 $\\times$ 5.4 pixels) and diverse\nscenarios such as urban clutter and extreme lighting conditions.

The key innovation lies in\na two-stage training strategy. In the first stage, we pre-train the model on\npartial scenes that provide dense semantic information but relatively simple\ngeometry. These partial point clouds are derived from multi-view RGB-D inputs\nvia pixel-wise depth projection. To enable open-vocabulary learning, we\nleverage a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) and a 2D segmentation\nfoundation model to generate open-vocabulary labels for each viewpoint,\noffering rich and aligned supervision. An auxiliary inter-frame consistency\nmodule is introduced to enforce feature consistency across varying viewpoints\nand enhance spatial understanding. In the second stage, we fine-tune the model\non complete scene-level point clouds, which are sparser and structurally more\ncomplex. We aggregate the partial vocabularies associated with each scene and\ngenerate pseudo labels using the pre-trained model, effectively bridging the\nsemantic gap between dense partial observations and large-scale 3D\nenvironments. Extensive experiments on ScanNet, ScanNet200, and S3DIS\nbenchmarks demonstrate that PGOV3D achieves competitive performance in\nopen-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation.", "AI": {"tldr": "PGOV3D\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u90e8\u5206\u573a\u666f\u5230\u5168\u5c40\u573a\u666f\u7684\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c473D\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\u4ec5\u89c6\u4e3a\u4f20\u9012\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5a92\u4ecb\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5176\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "1. \u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bc6\u96c6\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u4f46\u51e0\u4f55\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u573a\u666f\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c2D\u5206\u5272\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u6807\u7b7e\u30022. \u5fae\u8c03\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u4e14\u7ed3\u6784\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u573a\u666f\u70b9\u4e91\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u5408\u90e8\u5206\u8bcd\u6c47\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u3002", "result": "\u5728ScanNet\u3001ScanNet200\u548cS3DIS\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cPGOV3D\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "PGOV3D\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c473D\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose Partial\nForward Blocking (PFB), a novel framework for lossless training acceleration.\nThe efficiency of PFB stems from its unique adaptive pruning pipeline: sample\nimportance is assessed based on features extracted from the shallow layers of\nthe target model. Less important samples are then pruned, allowing only the\nretained ones to proceed with the subsequent forward pass and loss\nback-propagation. This mechanism significantly reduces the computational\noverhead of deep-layer forward passes and back-propagation for pruned samples,\nwhile also eliminating the need for auxiliary backward computations and proxy\nmodel training. Moreover, PFB introduces probability density as an indicator of\nsample importance. Combined with an adaptive distribution estimation module,\nour method dynamically prioritizes relatively rare samples, aligning with the\nconstantly evolving training state. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\nsignificant superiority of PFB in performance and speed. On ImageNet, PFB\nachieves a 0.5% accuracy improvement and 33% training time reduction with 40%\ndata pruned.", "AI": {"tldr": "PFB\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6d45\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u8bc4\u4f30\u6837\u672c\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u526a\u679d\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u989d\u5916\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u68af\u5ea6\u6216\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPartial Forward Blocking (PFB)\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d45\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u8bc4\u4f30\u6837\u672c\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5e76\u52a8\u6001\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6982\u7387\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u5e03\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet\u4e0a\uff0c\u526a\u679d40%\u6570\u636e\u65f6\uff0cPFB\u5b9e\u73b00.5%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u548c33%\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "PFB\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65e0\u635f\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a0\u901f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Existing\napproaches often rely on semantic-level alignment, expecting the model to learn\nnew motion concepts and combine them with other entities (e.g., ''cats'' or\n''dogs'') to produce visually appealing results.

This finding indicates that each head focuses its attention\non a subset of labels through cooperation among its SNPs. This underlying\nlearning mechanism is generalized to large-scale MHA (LS-MHA) using a single\nmatrix value representing single-head performance (SHP), analogous to\nsingle-filter performance in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The results\nindicate that each SHP matrix comprises multiple unit clusters such that each\nlabel being explicitly recognized by a few heads with negligible noise. This\nleads to an increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) along the transformer blocks,\nthereby improving classification accuracy. These features give rise to several\ndistinct vision transformer (ViT) architectures that achieve the same accuracy\nbut differ in their LS-MHA structures. As a result, their soft committee yields\nsuperior accuracy, an outcome not typically observed in CNNs which rely on\nhundreds of filters. In addition, a significant reduction in latency is\nachieved without affecting the accuracy by replacing the initial transformer\nblocks with convolutional layers.

In this work,\nwe first identify a critical issue with existing conditional PT methods: using\nVII as the \"condition\" of prompts yields suboptimal performance, and even\nrandom noise-conditioned prompts can outperform the VII-conditioned\ncounterparts. On further analysis, we find that learning dynamic prompts\nconditioned on Textual Class Information (TCI) is the key to solving the BNT\nproblem. Motivated by this, we then propose Class-adaptive Prompt Tuning\n(CaPT), which enables fast adaptation of tuned models to new classes by\nlearning TCI-conditioned prompts from base classes. Remarkably, CaPT can be\nused as a plugin to mitigate the BNT problem for existing unconditional PT\nschemes. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets show that CaPT consistently\nimproves the performance of five strong unconditional PT baselines with\nnegligible additional computational cost. Additionally, by integrating CaPT\nwith our recently proposed DePT framework, we devise a new conditional PT\napproach, termed DeCaPT, which outperforms the H ACC of the state-of-the-art\nconditional PT scheme by 3.49%, averaged over the 11 datasets.

This paper introduces Video Mixture of Block\nAttention (VMoBA), a novel sparse attention mechanism specifically adapted for\nVDMs. Motivated by an in-depth analysis of attention patterns within\npre-trained video transformers, which revealed strong spatio-temporal locality,\nvarying query importance, and head-specific concentration levels, VMoBA\nenhances the original MoBA framework with three key modifications: (1) a\nlayer-wise recurrent block partition scheme (1D-2D-3D) to dynamically adapt to\ndiverse spatio-temporal attention patterns and improve efficiency; (2) global\nblock selection to prioritize the most salient query-key block interactions\nacross an entire attention head; and (3) threshold-based block selection to\ndynamically determine the number of attended blocks based on their cumulative\nsimilarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VMoBA significantly\naccelerates the training of VDMs on longer sequences, achieving 2.92x FLOPs and\n1.48x latency speedup, while attaining comparable or even superior generation\nquality to full attention.

This gap is critical, as user-aligned\nbehavior is essential for trust, comfort, and widespread adoption of autonomous\nvehicles. A core challenge is the lack of large-scale real-world datasets\nannotated with diverse and fine-grained driving preferences, hindering the\ndevelopment and evaluation of personalized E2EAD models. In this work, we\npresent the first large-scale real-world dataset enriched with annotations\ncapturing diverse driving preferences, establishing a foundation for\npersonalization in E2EAD. We extract static environmental features from\nreal-world road topology and infer dynamic contextual cues using a fine-tuned\nvisual language model (VLM), enabling consistent and fine-grained scenario\nconstruction. Based on these scenarios, we derive objective preference\nannotations through behavioral distribution analysis and rule-based heuristics.\nTo address the inherent subjectivity of driving style, we further employ the\nVLM to generate subjective annotations by jointly modeling scene semantics and\ndriver behavior. Final high-quality labels are obtained through a\nhuman-in-the-loop verification process that fuses both perspectives. Building\non this dataset, we propose the first benchmark for evaluating personalized\nE2EAD models. We assess several state-of-the-art models with and without\npreference conditioning, demonstrating that incorporating personalized\npreferences results in behavior more aligned with human driving.

A presentation video of our approach is available at\n  https://youtu.be/_SGNhhNz0fE", "summary": "While recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have enabled fast reconstruction\nof high-quality 3D scenes from images, extracting accurate surface meshes\nremains a challenge. Current approaches extract the surface through costly\npost-processing steps, resulting in the loss of fine geometric details or\nrequiring significant time and leading to very dense meshes with millions of\nvertices. More fundamentally, the a posteriori conversion from a volumetric to\na surface representation limits the ability of the final mesh to preserve all\ngeometric structures captured during training. We present MILo, a novel\nGaussian Splatting framework that bridges the gap between volumetric and\nsurface representations by differentiably extracting a mesh from the 3D\nGaussians. We design a fully differentiable procedure that constructs the\nmesh-including both vertex locations and connectivity-at every iteration\ndirectly from the parameters of the Gaussians, which are the only quantities\noptimized during training. Our method introduces three key technical\ncontributions: a bidirectional consistency framework ensuring both\nrepresentations-Gaussians and the extracted mesh-capture the same underlying\ngeometry during training; an adaptive mesh extraction process performed at each\ntraining iteration, which uses Gaussians as differentiable pivots for Delaunay\ntriangulation; a novel method for computing signed distance values from the 3D\nGaussians that enables precise surface extraction while avoiding geometric\nerosion.

However, due to the need for per-sample network\ntraining, the encoding speeds of these methods are too slow for practical\nadoption. We develop a library to allow us to disentangle and review the\ncomponents of methods from the NeRV family, reframing their performance in\nterms of not only size-quality trade-offs, but also impacts on training time.\nWe uncover principles for effective video INR design and propose a\nstate-of-the-art configuration of these components, Rabbit NeRV (RNeRV). When\nall methods are given equal training time (equivalent to 300 NeRV epochs) for 7\ndifferent UVG videos at 1080p, RNeRV achieves +1.27% PSNR on average compared\nto the best-performing alternative for each video in our NeRV library. We then\ntackle the encoding speed issue head-on by investigating the viability of\nhyper-networks, which predict INR weights from video inputs, to disentangle\ntraining from encoding to allow for real-time encoding. We propose masking the\nweights of the predicted INR during training to allow for variable, higher\nquality compression, resulting in 1.7% improvements to both PSNR and MS-SSIM at\n0.037 bpp on the UCF-101 dataset, and we increase hyper-network parameters by\n0.4% for 2.5%/2.7% improvements to PSNR/MS-SSIM with equal bpp and similar\nspeeds.
