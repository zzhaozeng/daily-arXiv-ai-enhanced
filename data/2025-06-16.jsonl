The information\nneeds regarding datasets are implicitly embedded in particular research tasks,\nrather than explicitly expressed in search queries. However, existing\nscientific retrieval and question-answering (QA) datasets typically address\nstraightforward questions, which do not align with the distribution of\nreal-world research inquiries. To bridge this gap, we developed ScIRGen, a\ndataset generation framework for scientific QA \\& retrieval that more\naccurately reflects the information needs of professional science researchers,\nand uses it to create a large-scale scientific retrieval-augmented generation\n(RAG) dataset with realistic queries, datasets and papers. Technically, we\ndesigned a dataset-oriented information extraction method that leverages\nacademic papers to augment the dataset representation. We then proposed a\nquestion generation framework by employing cognitive taxonomy to ensure the\nquality of synthesized questions. We also design a method to automatically\nfilter synthetic answers based on the perplexity shift of LLMs, which is highly\naligned with human judgment of answers' validity. Collectively, these\nmethodologies culminated in the creation of the 61k QA dataset, ScIRGen-Geo. We\nbenchmarked representative methods on the ScIRGen-Geo dataset for their\nquestion-answering and retrieval capabilities, finding out that current methods\nstill suffer from reasoning from complex questions.

While BridgeTower further enhances\nperformance by building bridges between encoders, it \\textit{(i)} suffers from\nineffective layer-by-layer utilization of unimodal representations,\n\\textit{(ii)} restricts the flexible exploitation of different levels of\nunimodal semantic knowledge, and \\textit{(iii)} is limited to the evaluation on\ntraditional low-resolution datasets only with the Two-Tower VLM architecture.\nIn this work, we propose Manager, a lightweight, efficient and effective plugin\nthat adaptively aggregates insights from different levels of pre-trained\nunimodal experts to facilitate more comprehensive VL alignment and fusion.\nFirst, under the Two-Tower VLM architecture, we introduce ManagerTower, a novel\nVLM that introduces the manager in each cross-modal layer. Whether with or\nwithout VL pre-training, ManagerTower outperforms previous strong baselines and\nachieves superior performance on 4 downstream VL tasks.

Their synergy can mitigate the semantic\nambiguity caused by the multi-grid algorithm and further improve performance.\nCode and models are available at https://github.com/LooperXX/ManagerTower."}

Model quantization, particularly to low\nbit-widths like 4-bit, aims to alleviate this difficulty, yet existing\nPost-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) methods\nexhibit significant limitations. PTQ often incurs substantial accuracy drop,\nwhile QAT achieves high accuracy but suffers from prohibitive computational\ncosts, limited generalization to downstream tasks, training instability, and\nlacking of open-source codebase. To address these challenges, this paper\nintroduces General, Practical, and Lightning Quantization (GPLQ), a novel\nframework designed for efficient and effective ViT quantization. GPLQ is\nfounded on two key empirical insights: the paramount importance of activation\nquantization and the necessity of preserving the model's original optimization\n``basin'' to maintain generalization. Consequently, GPLQ employs a sequential\n``activation-first, weights-later'' strategy. Stage 1 keeps weights in FP32\nwhile quantizing activations with a feature mimicking loss in only 1 epoch to\nkeep it stay in the same ``basin'', thereby preserving generalization. Stage 2\nquantizes weights using a PTQ method. As a result, GPLQ is 100x faster than\nexisting QAT methods, lowers memory footprint to levels even below FP32\ntraining, and achieves 4-bit model performance that is highly competitive with\nFP32 models in terms of both accuracy on ImageNet and generalization to diverse\ndownstream tasks, including fine-grained visual classification and object\ndetection.

We introduce a\nmethodological framework that deliberately maintains a frozen large language\nmodel (LLM) and a frozen vision transformer (ViT), connected solely by training\na linear adapter during visual instruction tuning. This design is fundamental\nto our approach: by keeping the language model frozen, we ensure it maintains\nits original language representations without adaptation to visual data.\nConsequently, the linear adapter must map visual features directly into the\nLLM's existing representational space rather than allowing the language model\nto develop specialized visual understanding through fine-tuning. Our\nexperimental design uniquely enables the use of pre-trained sparse autoencoders\n(SAEs) of the LLM as analytical probes.

Unlike traditional MLLMs that answer the\nquestion or reasoning solely on the language space, our VGR first detects\nrelevant regions that may help to solve problems, and then provides precise\nanswers based on replayed image regions. To achieve this, we conduct a\nlarge-scale SFT dataset called VGR -SFT that contains reasoning data with mixed\nvision grounding and language deduction. The inference pipeline of VGR allows\nthe model to choose bounding boxes for visual reference and a replay stage is\nintroduced to integrates the corresponding regions into the reasoning process,\nenhancing multimodel comprehension. Experiments on the LLaVA-NeXT-7B baseline\nshow that VGR achieves superior performance on multi-modal benchmarks requiring\ncomprehensive image detail understanding. Compared to the baseline, VGR uses\nonly 30\\% of the image token count while delivering scores of +4.1 on MMStar,\n+7.1 on AI2D, and a +12.9 improvement on ChartQA."}
