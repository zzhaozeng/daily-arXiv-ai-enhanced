Our\nexperiments with four LLMs across three QA datasets covering a total of 48\nlanguages reveal a surprising ability of LLMs to extract the relevant\ninformation from out-language passages, but a much weaker ability to formulate\na full answer in the correct language.

To\naddress these issues, we propose a unified attack detection model termed\nFrequency-Aware and Attack-Agnostic CLIP (FA\\textsuperscript{3}-CLIP), which\nintroduces attack-agnostic prompt learning to express generic live and fake\ncues derived from the fusion of spatial and frequency features, enabling\nunified detection of live faces and all categories of attacks.

However, the IHC staining process is both time-consuming and\ncostly. To address these limitations, the application of deep learning models\nfor direct translation of cost-effective Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained\nimages into IHC stained images has emerged as an efficient solution.\nNevertheless, the conversion from H&E to IHC images presents significant\nchallenges, primarily due to alignment discrepancies between image pairs and\nthe inherent diversity in IHC staining style patterns. To overcome these\nchallenges, we propose the Style Distribution Constraint Feature Alignment\nNetwork (SCFANet), which incorporates two innovative modules: the Style\nDistribution Constrainer (SDC) and Feature Alignment Learning (FAL). The SDC\nensures consistency between the generated and target images' style\ndistributions while integrating cycle consistency loss to maintain structural\nconsistency. To mitigate the complexity of direct image-to-image translation,\nthe FAL module decomposes the end-to-end translation task into two subtasks:\nimage reconstruction and feature alignment. Furthermore, we ensure pathological\nconsistency between generated and target images by maintaining pathological\npattern consistency and Optical Density (OD) uniformity. Extensive experiments\nconducted on the Breast Cancer Immunohistochemical (BCI) dataset demonstrate\nthat our SCFANet model outperforms existing methods, achieving precise\ntransformation of H&E-stained images into their IHC-stained counterparts.

The retrieved references are fed\ninto the model to augment the generation process. We jointly optimize both the\ngeneration and citation tasks within a single framework to increase efficiency.\nTrained on 500K papers from arXiv, our model achieves a top-1 retrieval\naccuracy of 40.1% on our evaluation dataset, outperforming baselines such as\nE5-Mistral-7B-Instruct (15.0%) and BM25 (9.8%).

Additionally, concerns over\nprivacy and proprietary knowledge sharing hinder cross-organizational\ncollaboration, leading to siloed expertise. To address these challenges, we\npropose AgentNet, a decentralized, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based\nframework that enables LLM-based agents to autonomously evolve their\ncapabilities and collaborate efficiently in a Directed Acyclic Graph\n(DAG)-structured network. Unlike traditional multi-agent systems that depend on\nstatic role assignments or centralized control, AgentNet allows agents to\nspecialize dynamically, adjust their connectivity, and route tasks without\nrelying on predefined workflows. AgentNet's core design is built upon several\nkey innovations: (1) Fully Decentralized Paradigm: Removing the central\norchestrator, allowing agents to coordinate and specialize autonomously,\nfostering fault tolerance and emergent collective intelligence. (2) Dynamically\nEvolving Graph Topology: Real-time adaptation of agent connections based on\ntask demands, ensuring scalability and resilience.(3) Adaptive Learning for\nExpertise Refinement: A retrieval-based memory system that enables agents to\ncontinuously update and refine their specialized skills.

One particularly intriguing application is transforming\ncharacters from anime films into interactive, playable entities. This allows\nplayers to immerse themselves in the dynamic anime world as their favorite\ncharacters for life simulation through language instructions. Such games are\ndefined as infinite game since they eliminate predetermined boundaries and\nfixed gameplay rules, where players can interact with the game world through\nopen-ended language and experience ever-evolving storylines and environments.\nRecently, a pioneering approach for infinite anime life simulation employs\nlarge language models (LLMs) to translate multi-turn text dialogues into\nlanguage instructions for image generation. However, it neglects historical\nvisual context, leading to inconsistent gameplay. Furthermore, it only\ngenerates static images, failing to incorporate the dynamics necessary for an\nengaging gaming experience. In this work, we propose AnimeGamer, which is built\nupon Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate each game state,\nincluding dynamic animation shots that depict character movements and updates\nto character states, as illustrated in Figure 1. We introduce novel\naction-aware multimodal representations to represent animation shots, which can\nbe decoded into high-quality video clips using a video diffusion model. By\ntaking historical animation shot representations as context and predicting\nsubsequent representations, AnimeGamer can generate games with contextual\nconsistency and satisfactory dynamics. Extensive evaluations using both\nautomated metrics and human evaluations demonstrate that AnimeGamer outperforms\nexisting methods in various aspects of the gaming experience.

Despite the\nsuccess of experience replay and parameter-efficient methods in alleviating\ncatastrophic forgetting problem, naively applying these methods causes a\nfailure to leverage the shared primitives between skills. To tackle these\nissues, we propose Primitive Prompt Learning (PPL), to achieve lifelong robot\nmanipulation via reusable and extensible primitives. Within our two stage\nlearning scheme, we first learn a set of primitive prompts to represent shared\nprimitives through multi-skills pre-training stage, where motion-aware prompts\nare learned to capture semantic and motion shared primitives across different\nskills. Secondly, when acquiring new skills in lifelong span, new prompts are\nappended and optimized with frozen pretrained prompts, boosting the learning\nvia knowledge transfer from old skills to new ones. For evaluation, we\nconstruct a large-scale skill dataset and conduct extensive experiments in both\nsimulation and real-world tasks, demonstrating PPL's superior performance over\nstate-of-the-art methods."}

The primary task of existing\nattribution methods lies in efficiently and accurately identifying the\nrelationships among input-prediction interactions. Particularly when the input\ndata is discrete, such as images, analyzing the relationship between inputs and\noutputs poses a significant challenge due to the combinatorial explosion. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel and efficient black-box attribution mechanism,\nLiMA (Less input is More faithful for Attribution), which reformulates the\nattribution of important regions as an optimization problem for submodular\nsubset selection. First, to accurately assess interactions, we design a\nsubmodular function that quantifies subset importance and effectively captures\ntheir impact on decision outcomes. Then, efficiently ranking input sub-regions\nby their importance for attribution, we improve optimization efficiency through\na novel bidirectional greedy search algorithm. LiMA identifies both the most\nand least important samples while ensuring an optimal attribution boundary that\nminimizes errors. Extensive experiments on eight foundation models demonstrate\nthat our method provides faithful interpretations with fewer regions and\nexhibits strong generalization, shows an average improvement of 36.3% in\nInsertion and 39.6% in Deletion. Our method also outperforms the naive greedy\nsearch in attribution efficiency, being 1.6 times faster.
