While CNNs like ResNet and YOLO remain highly effective\nfor image-based tasks, recent transformer-based LLMs introduce new capabilities\nsuch as dynamic context reasoning, language-guided prompts, and holistic scene\nunderstanding. However, when used out-of-the-box, the full potential of LLMs\nremains underexploited, often resulting in suboptimal performance on\nspecialized visual tasks. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison\nof fine-tuned traditional CNNs, zero-shot pre-trained multi-modal LLMs, and\nfine-tuned multi-modal LLMs on the challenging task of artificial text overlay\ndetection in images. A key contribution of our study is demonstrating that LLMs\ncan be effectively fine-tuned on very limited data (fewer than 1,000 images) to\nachieve up to 36% accuracy improvement, matching or surpassing CNN-based\nbaselines that typically require orders of magnitude more data. By exploring\nhow language-guided models can be adapted for precise visual understanding with\nminimal supervision, our work contributes to the broader effort of bridging\nvision and language, offering novel insights into efficient cross-modal\nlearning strategies. These findings highlight the adaptability and data\nefficiency of LLM-based approaches for real-world object detection tasks and\nprovide actionable guidance for applying multi-modal transformers in\nlow-resource visual environments. To support continued progress in this area,\nwe have made the code used to fine-tune the models available in our GitHub,\nenabling future improvements and reuse in related applications."}

However,\nsuch delays often result in non-memorized images that are poorly aligned with\nthe input prompts, highlighting the need to promote earlier escape so that CFG\ncan be applied sooner in the denoising process.

When candidate diversity is curtailed,\neven by a modest amount, TTS becomes much more likely to produce unsafe\noutputs. We present a reference-guided diversity reduction protocol (RefDiv)\nthat serves as a diagnostic attack to stress test TTS pipelines. Through\nextensive experiments across four open-source models (Qwen3, Mistral, Llama3.1,\nGemma3) and two widely used TTS strategies (Monte Carlo Tree Search and\nBest-of-N), constraining diversity consistently signifies the rate at which TTS\nproduces unsafe results.

While open-set detection methods aim to\naddress this by identifying such instances as 'Unknown', this is often\ninsufficient. Rather than treating all unknowns as a single class, assigning\nthem more descriptive subcategories can enhance decision-making in\nsafety-critical contexts. For example, identifying an object as an 'Unknown\nAnimal' (requiring an urgent stop) versus 'Unknown Debris' (requiring a safe\nlane change) is far more useful than just 'Unknown' in autonomous driving. To\nbridge this gap, we introduce TARO, a novel detection framework that not only\nidentifies unknown objects but also classifies them into coarse parent\ncategories within a semantic hierarchy. TARO employs a unique architecture with\na sparsemax-based head for modeling objectness, a hierarchy-guided relabeling\ncomponent that provides auxiliary supervision, and a classification module that\nlearns hierarchical relationships.

We identify that the fundamental challenge extends beyond error\naccumulation to a critical discrepancy between the training assumption (seeing\nclean data) and the test-time autoregressive reality (conditioning on\nself-generated, error-prone outputs). To bridge this hypothesis gap, SVI\nincorporates Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning, a new type of efficient training that\nrecycles the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)'s self-generated errors into\nsupervisory prompts, thereby encouraging DiT to actively identify and correct\nits own errors. This is achieved by injecting, collecting, and banking errors\nthrough closed-loop recycling, autoregressively learning from error-injected\nfeedback.

To this end, we propose ReFIne, a new training framework that\nintegrates supervised fine-tuning with GRPO to encourage models to: (i) improve\ninterpretability by producing structured, tag-based traces with high-level\nplanning that are easier for humans to follow; (ii) enhance faithfulness by\nexplicitly disclosing the decisive information guiding each solution, with\nconsistent cross-section references; and (iii) promote reliability by providing\nself-assessments of both the derivation's soundness and the confidence of the\nfinal answer. We apply ReFIne to the Qwen3 models at multiple scales\n(1.7B/4B/8B) and evaluate across mathematical benchmarks of varying difficulty.\nOur experimental results show that ReFIne models generate clearer and\nbetter-structured reasoning traces (interpretability +44.0%), more faithfully\nexpose their underlying decision process (faithfulness +18.8%), and offer\ninformative confidence estimates (reliability +42.4%).

To address this, we present SilvaScenes, a new\ndataset for instance segmentation of tree species from under-canopy images.\nCollected across five bioclimatic domains in Quebec, Canada, SilvaScenes\nfeatures 1476 trees from 24 species with annotations from forestry experts. We\ndemonstrate the relevance and challenging nature of our dataset by benchmarking\nmodern deep learning approaches for instance segmentation. Our results show\nthat, while tree segmentation is easy, with a top mean average precision (mAP)\nof 67.65%, species classification remains a significant challenge with an mAP\nof only 35.69%. Our dataset and source code will be available at\nhttps://github.com/norlab-ulaval/SilvaScenes."}

Humans showed +13.7 percentage point\n(pp) bias (Cohen's h = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.21-0.34), while AI models showed +34.3\npercentage point bias (h = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.65-0.76), a 2.5-fold stronger effect\n(P$<$0.001). Study 2 confirmed this bias operates across AI architectures\n(+25.8pp, 95% CI: 24.1-27.6%), demonstrating that AI systems systematically\ndevalue creative content when labeled as \"AI-generated\" regardless of which AI\ncreated it. We also find that attribution labels cause evaluators to invert\nassessment criteria, with identical features receiving opposing evaluations\nbased solely on perceived authorship. This suggests AI models have absorbed\nhuman cultural biases against artificial creativity during training. Our study\nrepresents the first controlled comparison of attribution bias between human\nand artificial evaluators in aesthetic judgment, revealing that AI systems not\nonly replicate but amplify this human tendency."}

Inspired by\nthis success, similar strategies have been applied to multimodal reasoning, yet\ntheir impact on visual perception remains unclear. To investigate this gap, we\nintroduce DisTANCE, a perception-centric benchmark for visual estimation tasks.\nEvaluation results show that LVLMs exhibit limited estimation precision, and\ninference-time scaling offers only marginal gains. We attribute this to the\nfast perception paradigm of current LVLMs, where visual understanding is\ntreated as a one-shot output without modeling the underlying perceptual\nprocess. To address this, we propose Perception-Time Scaling (PTS), a novel\nparadigm that encourages token-rich perception and decomposes complex\nperception problems into intermediate tractable sub-problems, thereby enabling\nperception to align with and benefit from inference-time scaling. Combined with\nreinforcement learning techniques, PTS significantly improves perception\naccuracy, raising high-precision performance on DisTANCE from 8.0% to 64.7%,\nand generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks. Surprisingly, even though PTS data\nare purely synthetic, combining them with math reasoning data yields consistent\ngains in both reasoning and real-world perception benchmarks. Further analysis\nreveals that PTS introduces more perception-related tokens and increases the\nmodel's attention to image tokens. Our code and data will be publicly released."}

The prevailing\nparadigm, prefix-tuning, simply concatenates knowledge embeddings with text\ninputs. However, this shallow fusion overlooks the rich relational semantics\nwithin KGs and imposes a significant implicit reasoning burden on the LLM to\ncorrelate the prefix with the text. To address these, we propose\nSemantic-condition Tuning (SCT), a new knowledge injection paradigm comprising\ntwo key modules. First, a Semantic Graph Module employs a Graph Neural Network\nto extract a context-aware semantic condition from the local graph\nneighborhood, guided by knowledge-enhanced relations. Subsequently, this\ncondition is passed to a Condition-Adaptive Fusion Module, which, in turn,\nadaptively modulates the textual embedding via two parameterized projectors,\nenabling a deep, feature-wise, and knowledge-aware interaction. The resulting\npre-fused embedding is then fed into the LLM for fine-tuning. Extensive\nexperiments on knowledge graph benchmarks demonstrate that SCT significantly\noutperforms prefix-tuning and other strong baselines.

However, there are still crucial challenges in LVLMs such as object\nhallucination, generating descriptions of objects that are not in the input\nimage. Here, we argue that uncertain visual tokens within the VE is a key\nfactor that contributes to object hallucination. Our statistical analysis found\nthat there are positive correlations between visual tokens with high epistemic\nuncertainty and the occurrence of hallucinations. Furthermore, we show\ntheoretically and empirically that visual tokens in early VE layers that\nexhibit large representation deviations under small adversarial perturbations\nindicate high epistemic uncertainty. Based on these findings, we propose a\nsimple yet effective strategy to mitigate object hallucination by modifying the\nVE only. Our method comprises a proxy method with adversarial perturbations for\nidentifying uncertain visual tokens efficiently and a method to mask these\nuncertain visual tokens during the self-attention process in the middle layers\nof the VE, suppressing their influence on visual encoding and thus alleviating\nhallucinations.

As memory size and\nretrieval depth increase, performance improves monotonically, unlike text\nmemories that degrade with long prompts. To grow memory at low cost, we\nintroduce an auto-scaling data flywheel that (i) discovers new environments via\nsearch, (ii) synthesizes tasks with an open-source VLM, (iii) rolls out\ntrajectories with the agent, and (iv) verifies success with the same VLM.
