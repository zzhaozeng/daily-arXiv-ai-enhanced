In scientific visualization,\nvolume rendering plays a crucial role in helping researchers analyze and\ninterpret complex 3D data. Recently, photorealistic rendering techniques have\ngained popularity in scientific visualization, yet they face significant\nchallenges. One of the most prominent issues is slow rendering performance and\nhigh pixel variance caused by Monte Carlo integration. In this work, we\nintroduce a novel radiance caching approach for path-traced volume rendering.\nOur method leverages advances in volumetric scene representation and adapts 3D\nGaussian splatting to function as a multi-level, path-space radiance cache.\nThis cache is designed to be trainable on the fly, dynamically adapting to\nchanges in scene parameters such as lighting configurations and transfer\nfunctions. By incorporating our cache, we achieve less noisy, higher-quality\nimages without increasing rendering costs. To evaluate our approach, we compare\nit against a baseline path tracer that supports uniform sampling and next-event\nestimation and the state-of-the-art for neural radiance caching. Through both\nquantitative and qualitative analyses, we demonstrate that our path-space\nradiance cache is a robust solution that is easy to integrate and significantly\nenhances the rendering quality of volumetric visualization applications while\nmaintaining comparable computational efficiency."}

However, little attention has been given to the\nimmersive understanding of architectural styles and structural knowledge, which\nremains largely confined to browsing static text-image pairs. Therefore, can we\ndraw inspiration from 3D in-the-wild reconstruction techniques and use\nunconstrained photo collections to create an immersive approach for\nunderstanding the 3D structure of architectural components? To this end, we\nextend language embedded 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) and propose a novel\nframework for open-vocabulary scene understanding from unconstrained photo\ncollections. Specifically, we first render multiple appearance images from the\nsame viewpoint as the unconstrained image with the reconstructed radiance\nfield, then extract multi-appearance CLIP features and two types of language\nfeature uncertainty maps-transient and appearance uncertainty-derived from the\nmulti-appearance features to guide the subsequent optimization process. Next,\nwe propose a transient uncertainty-aware autoencoder, a multi-appearance\nlanguage field 3DGS representation, and a post-ensemble strategy to effectively\ncompress, learn, and fuse language features from multiple appearances. Finally,\nto quantitatively evaluate our method, we introduce PT-OVS, a new benchmark\ndataset for assessing open-vocabulary segmentation performance on unconstrained\nphoto collections.

Although negative prompt tuning has enhanced the OOD detection\ncapabilities of vision-language models, these tuned models often suffer from\nreduced generalization performance on unseen classes and styles. To address\nthis challenge, we propose a novel method called Knowledge Regularized Negative\nFeature Tuning (KR-NFT), which integrates an innovative adaptation architecture\ntermed Negative Feature Tuning (NFT) and a corresponding\nknowledge-regularization (KR) optimization strategy. Specifically, NFT applies\ndistribution-aware transformations to pre-trained text features, effectively\nseparating positive and negative features into distinct spaces. This separation\nmaximizes the distinction between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images.\nAdditionally, we introduce image-conditional learnable factors through a\nlightweight meta-network, enabling dynamic adaptation to individual images and\nmitigating sensitivity to class and style shifts. Compared to traditional\nnegative prompt tuning, NFT demonstrates superior efficiency and scalability.\nTo optimize this adaptation architecture, the KR optimization strategy is\ndesigned to enhance the discrimination between ID and OOD sets while mitigating\npre-trained knowledge forgetting.

This approach uniquely\ncombines pruning with key-value cache quantization and incorporates a fast\npruning technique that eliminates the need for additional fine-tuning or weight\nadjustments, achieving efficient compression without compromising accuracy.\nComprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets, including LLaVA-1.5 7B and\n13B, demonstrate our method superiority over state-of-the-art techniques such\nas SparseGPT and Wanda across various compression levels.

To achieve this, we propose a\nmasked autoencoder-based, structure-aware reconstruction framework that learns\nthe continuity of normal bone structures. Even in the presence of avulsion, the\nmodel attempts to reconstruct the normal structure, resulting in large\nreconstruction errors at the avulsion site. For evaluation, we constructed a\nnovel dataset comprising normal and avulsion ultrasound images from 16 baseball\nplayers, with pixel-level annotations under orthopedic supervision. Our method\noutperformed existing approaches, achieving a pixel-wise AUC of 0.965 and an\nimage-wise AUC of 0.967.

Diversity has however often been addressed in\nan ad hoc manner in NLP, and with few explicit links to other domains where\nthis notion is better theorized. We survey articles in the ACL Anthology from\nthe past 6 years, with \"diversity\" or \"diverse\" in their title. We find a wide\nrange of settings in which diversity is quantified, often highly specialized\nand using inconsistent terminology. We put forward a unified taxonomy of why,\nwhat on, where, and how diversity is measured in NLP. Diversity measures are\ncast upon a unified framework from ecology and economy (Stirling, 2007) with 3\ndimensions of diversity: variety, balance and disparity.

Conventional alignment methods typically employ off-policy\nlearning and depend on human-annotated datasets, which limits their broad\napplicability and introduces distribution shift issues during training. To\naddress these challenges, we propose Self-Generated Preference Optimization\nbased on Self-Improver (SGPO), an innovative alignment framework that leverages\nan on-policy self-improving mechanism. Specifically, the improver refines\nresponses from a policy model to self-generate preference data for direct\npreference optimization (DPO) of the policy model. Here, the improver and\npolicy are unified into a single model, and in order to generate higher-quality\npreference data, this self-improver learns to make incremental yet discernible\nimprovements to the current responses by referencing supervised fine-tuning\noutputs. Experimental results on AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard show that the\nproposed SGPO significantly improves performance over DPO and baseline\nself-improving methods without using external preference data."}

This limitation persists even though VLMs are equipped\nwith strong vision and language backbones. While supervised data and complex\nreward functions have been proposed to improve detailed image captioning, we\nidentify a simpler underlying issue: a bias towards the end-of-sequence (EOS)\ntoken, which is introduced during cross-entropy training. We propose an\nunsupervised method to debias the model's tendency to predict the EOS token\nprematurely. By reducing this bias, we encourage the generation of longer, more\ndetailed captions without the need for intricate reward functions or\nsupervision.

We show\nthat policy brittleness often stems from non-unique optimal actions, a common\noccurrence when multiple valid traces exist in a reasoning task. This\ntheoretical lens provides a unified explanation for a range of seemingly\ndisparate failures, reframing them as rational outcomes of optimizing rewards\nthat may be incomplete or noisy, especially in the presence of action\ndegeneracy.

Achieving both temporal consistency, or realistic lighting remains\ndifficult, particularly in dynamic scenarios with complex object motion,\nperspective changes, and varying illumination. While 2D diffusion models have\nshown promise for producing photorealistic edits, they often struggle with\nmaintaining temporal coherence across frames. Conversely, traditional 3D\nrendering methods excel in spatial and temporal consistency but fall short in\nachieving photorealistic lighting. In this work, we propose a hybrid object\ninsertion pipeline that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Specifically,\nwe focus on inserting bracelets into dynamic wrist scenes, leveraging the high\ntemporal consistency of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for initial rendering and\nrefining the results using a 2D diffusion-based enhancement model to ensure\nrealistic lighting interactions. Our method introduces a shading-driven\npipeline that separates intrinsic object properties (albedo, shading,\nreflectance) and refines both shading and sRGB images for photorealism. To\nmaintain temporal coherence, we optimize the 3DGS model with multi-frame\nweighted adjustments. This is the first approach to synergize 3D rendering and\n2D diffusion for video object insertion, offering a robust solution for\nrealistic and consistent video editing.

In this paper, we aim to\nexpand the scope of computer vision to include the novel task of inferring the\nhidden liquid levels of opaque containers by sensing the tiny vibrations on\ntheir surfaces. Our method provides a first-of-a-kind way to inspect the fill\nlevel of multiple sealed containers remotely, at once, without needing physical\nmanipulation and manual weighing. First, we propose a novel speckle-based\nvibration sensing system for simultaneously capturing scene vibrations on a 2D\ngrid of points. We use our system to efficiently and remotely capture a dataset\nof vibration responses for a variety of everyday liquid containers. Then, we\ndevelop a transformer-based approach for analyzing the captured vibrations and\nclassifying the container type and its hidden liquid level at the time of\nmeasurement.

To solve this problem, we introduce a novel framework\ntermed ``Reasoning-Rendering-Visual-Feedback'' (RRVF), which enables MLLMs to\nlearn complex visual reasoning from only raw images. This framework builds on\nthe ``Asymmetry of Verification'' principle to train MLLMs, i.e., verifying the\nrendered output against a source image is easier than generating it. We\ndemonstrate that this relative ease provides an ideal reward signal for\noptimization via Reinforcement Learning (RL) training, reducing the reliance on\nthe image-text supervision.

Camera\nparameters, such as exposure time, also influence the appearance of snowflakes,\nmaking the problem difficult to solve and heavily dependent on network\ngeneralization. In this paper, we propose to address the challenge of desnowing\nby using event cameras, which offer compressed visual information with\nsubmillisecond latency, making them ideal for de-snowing images, even in the\npresence of ego-motion. Our method leverages the fact that snowflake occlusions\nappear with a very distinctive streak signature in the spatio-temporal\nrepresentation of event data.

The empirical results are\nexciting, e.g., the fine-tuned FluxKontext achieves highly competitive\nperformance across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks, including 7.24 on\nGEdit-EN, 3.80 on ImgEdit-Full, and 8.78 on Complex-Edit, showing stronger\ninstruction following and higher perceptual quality while maintaining identity.\nThese scores markedly exceed all previously published open-source methods and\nsubstantially narrow the gap to leading proprietary models. We hope the full\nrelease of GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M can help to catalyze further open research in\ninstruction-guided image editing."}

Therefore, can we\ndraw inspiration from 3D in-the-wild reconstruction techniques and use\nunconstrained photo collections to create an immersive approach for\nunderstanding the 3D structure of architectural components? To this end, we\nextend language embedded 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) and propose a novel\nframework for open-vocabulary scene understanding from unconstrained photo\ncollections. Specifically, we first render multiple appearance images from the\nsame viewpoint as the unconstrained image with the reconstructed radiance\nfield, then extract multi-appearance CLIP features and two types of language\nfeature uncertainty maps-transient and appearance uncertainty-derived from the\nmulti-appearance features to guide the subsequent optimization process. Next,\nwe propose a transient uncertainty-aware autoencoder, a multi-appearance\nlanguage field 3DGS representation, and a post-ensemble strategy to effectively\ncompress, learn, and fuse language features from multiple appearances.

Current parameter reduction\ntechniques primarily involve training MLLMs from Small Language Models (SLMs),\nbut these methods offer limited flexibility and remain computationally\nintensive. To address this gap, we propose to directly compress existing MLLMs\nthrough structural pruning combined with efficient recovery training.\nSpecifically, we investigate two structural pruning paradigms--layerwise and\nwidthwise pruning--applied to the language model backbone of MLLMs, alongside\nsupervised finetuning and knowledge distillation. Additionally, we assess the\nfeasibility of conducting recovery training with only a small fraction of the\navailable data. Our results show that widthwise pruning generally maintains\nbetter performance in low-resource scenarios with limited computational\nresources or insufficient finetuning data. As for the recovery training,\nfinetuning only the multimodal projector is sufficient at small compression\nlevels (< 20%). Furthermore, a combination of supervised finetuning and\nhidden-state distillation yields optimal recovery across various pruning\nlevels. Notably, effective recovery can be achieved with as little as 5% of the\noriginal training data, while retaining over 95% of the original performance.\nThrough empirical study on two representative MLLMs, i.e., LLaVA-v1.5-7B and\nBunny-v1.0-3B, this study offers actionable insights for practitioners aiming\nto compress MLLMs effectively without extensive computation resources or\nsufficient data."}
