These modifications enhance graph fidelity while preserving the core spectral reasoning pipeline. Experimental results on ProofWriter, EntailmentBank, and CLUTRR benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains (up to +3.8\\%), improved generalization to adversarial cases, and reduced inference noise. The novelty lies in performing semantic and symbolic refinement entirely upstream of the spectral inference stage, enabling efficient, interpretable, and scalable reasoning without relying on quadratic attention mechanisms. In summary, this work extends the Spectral NSR framework with modular, semantically grounded preprocessing steps that improve graph quality without altering the core spectral reasoning engine.

To reduce the cognitive load on the decision maker, previous work has introduced the Pareto pruning problem, where the goal is to compute a fixed-size subset of Pareto optimal solutions that best represent the full set, as evaluated by a given quality measure. Reframing Pareto pruning as a multiwinner voting problem, we conduct an axiomatic analysis of existing quality measures, uncovering several unintuitive behaviors. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a new measure, directed coverage. We also analyze the computational complexity of optimizing various quality measures, identifying previously unknown boundaries between tractable and intractable cases depending on the number and structure of the objectives. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation, demonstrating that the choice of quality measure has a decisive impact on the characteristics of the selected set of solutions and that our proposed measure performs competitively or even favorably across a range of settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684Pareto\u526a\u679d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u2014\u2014\u6709\u5411\u8986\u76d6\uff08directed coverage\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8d28\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u8bb8\u591a\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\u6d89\u53ca\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6848\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6240\u6709Pareto\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u90fd\u662f\u5019\u9009\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u6839\u636e\u4e3b\u89c2\u504f\u597d\u9009\u62e9\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u4e3a\u51cf\u8f7b\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86Pareto\u526a\u679d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06Pareto\u526a\u679d\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u591a\u8d62\u5bb6\u6295\u7968\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u516c\u7406\u5316\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u2014\u2014\u6709\u5411\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u5404\u79cd\u8d28\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8d28\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u975e\u76f4\u89c2\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u4e0d\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u60c5\u51b5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u65b0\u8fb9\u754c\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8d28\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u6240\u9009\u89e3\u96c6\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6709\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6709\u5411\u8986\u76d6\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6709\u5411\u8986\u76d6\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing multi-objective alignment methods rely on manually specified preference weights, which not only burden users with difficult preference specification tasks but also lead to suboptimal training efficiency due to exploration of irrelevant preference combinations. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel framework named PRO, i.e., PReference Orchestrator, which features a lightweight preference adapter that automatically infers prompt-specific preference weights during both training and deployment phases. Specifically, the adapter automatically learns appropriate preference weights for each prompt by training on normalized reward scores from multiple reward models for preferred responses, which inherently reflect effective preference balances across objectives. Additionally, We provide theoretical analysis proving that our prompt-aware preference mechanism achieves superior performance compared to fixed preference weights in multi-objective alignment scenarios.

It is even known that modern SAT solvers work efficiently on instances of small treewidth. Since these solvers are widely applied, research interests in compact encodings into (Q)SAT for solving and to understand encoding limitations. Even more general is the graph parameter clique-width, which unlike treewidth can be small for dense graphs. Although algorithms are available for clique-width, little is known about encodings. We initiate the quest to understand encoding capabilities with clique-width by considering abstract argumentation, which is a robust framework for reasoning with conflicting arguments. It is based on directed graphs and asks for computationally challenging properties, making it a natural candidate to study computational properties. We design novel reductions from argumentation problems to (Q)SAT. Our reductions linearly preserve the clique-width, resulting in directed decomposition-guided (DDG) reductions.

We first identify a patent-specific failure mode of SimCSE style dropout augmentation: it produces overly uniform embeddings that lose semantic cohesion. To remedy this, we propose section-based augmentation, where different sections of a patent (e.g., abstract, claims, background) serve as complementary views. This design introduces natural semantic and structural diversity, mitigating over-dispersion and yielding embeddings that better preserve both global structure and local continuity. On large-scale benchmarks, our fully self-supervised method matches or surpasses citation-and IPC-supervised baselines in prior-art retrieval and classification, while avoiding reliance on brittle or incomplete annotations.

Decision-makers often rank expected potential outcomes (or their corresponding utility and desirability) to compare the preferences of candidate actions. In this paper, we study new counterfactual decision-making rules by introducing two new metrics: the probabilities of potential outcome ranking (PoR) and the probability of achieving the best potential outcome (PoB). PoR reveals the most probable ranking of potential outcomes for an individual, and PoB indicates the action most likely to yield the top-ranked outcome for an individual.

We evaluated 15 open-weight LLMs on pathology and radiology reports across six use cases, colorectal liver metastases, liver tumours, neurodegenerative diseases, soft-tissue tumours, melanomas, and sarcomas, at three institutes in the Netherlands, UK, and Czech Republic. Models included general-purpose and medical-specialised LLMs of various sizes, and six prompting strategies were compared: zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, self-consistency, and prompt graph. Performance was assessed using task-appropriate metrics, with consensus rank aggregation and linear mixed-effects models quantifying variance. Top-ranked models achieved macro-average scores close to inter-rater agreement across tasks. Small-to-medium general-purpose models performed comparably to large models, while tiny and specialised models performed worse. Prompt graph and few-shot prompting improved performance by ~13%. Task-specific factors, including variable complexity and annotation variability, influenced results more than model size or prompting strategy.

While prior surveys focus on efficiency by examining how to shorten reasoning chains or reduce computation, this view overlooks a fundamental challenge: current LLMs apply uniform reasoning strategies regardless of task complexity, generating long traces for trivial problems while failing to extend reasoning for difficult tasks. This survey reframes reasoning through the lens of {adaptivity}: the capability to allocate reasoning effort based on input characteristics such as difficulty and uncertainty. We make three contributions. First, we formalize deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning within the LLM context, connecting these classical cognitive paradigms with their algorithmic realizations. Second, we formalize adaptive reasoning as a control-augmented policy optimization problem balancing task performance with computational cost, distinguishing learned policies from inference-time control mechanisms. Third, we propose a systematic taxonomy organizing existing methods into training-based approaches that internalize adaptivity through reinforcement learning, supervised fine-tuning, and learned controllers, and training-free approaches that achieve adaptivity through prompt conditioning, feedback-driven halting, and modular composition. This framework clarifies how different mechanisms realize adaptive reasoning in practice and enables systematic comparison across diverse strategies.

Code and additional details are available at: https://qihang-zhang.com/Learning-Sys-Blog/2025/10/15/weighted-product-of-experts.html", "summary": "Lossless compression techniques are crucial in an era of rapidly growing data. Traditional universal compressors like gzip offer low computational overhead, high speed, and broad applicability across data distributions. However, they often lead to worse compression rates than modern neural compressors, which leverage large-scale training data to model data distributions more effectively. Despite their advantages, neural compressors struggle to generalize to unseen data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that performs Test-Time Steering via a Weighted Product of Experts (wPoE). At inference, our method adaptively combines a universal compression model with a pretrained neural language model, ensuring the compression rate is at least as good as that of the best individual model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of text compression without requiring fine-tuning.

However, existing embedding methods face critical limitations when modeling diverse relationship types at scale: Euclidean models struggle with hierarchies, vector space models cannot capture asymmetry, and hyperbolic models fail on symmetric relations. We propose HyperComplEx, a hybrid embedding framework that adaptively combines hyperbolic, complex, and Euclidean spaces via learned attention mechanisms. A relation-specific space weighting strategy dynamically selects optimal geometries for each relation type, while a multi-space consistency loss ensures coherent predictions across spaces. We evaluate HyperComplEx on computer science research knowledge graphs ranging from 1K papers (~25K triples) to 10M papers (~45M triples), demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines including TransE, RotatE, DistMult, ComplEx, SEPA, and UltraE. Additional tests on standard benchmarks confirm significantly higher results than all baselines. On the 10M-paper dataset, HyperComplEx achieves 0.612 MRR, a 4.8% relative gain over the best baseline, while maintaining efficient training, achieving 85 ms inference per triple. The model scales near-linearly with graph size through adaptive dimension allocation.

Such evaluations often rely on a curated benchmark set of input prompts provided to the LLM, where the output for each prompt may be assessed in a binary fashion (e.g., harmful/non-harmful or does not leak/leaks sensitive information), and the aggregation of binary scores is used to evaluate the LLM. However, existing approaches to evaluation often neglect statistical uncertainty quantification. With an applied statistics audience in mind, we provide background on LLM text generation and evaluation, and then describe a Bayesian approach for quantifying uncertainty in binary evaluation metrics. We focus in particular on uncertainty that is induced by the probabilistic text generation strategies typically deployed in LLM-based systems. We present two case studies applying this approach: 1) evaluating refusal rates on a benchmark of adversarial inputs designed to elicit harmful responses, and 2) evaluating pairwise preferences of one LLM over another on a benchmark of open-ended interactive dialogue examples. We demonstrate how the Bayesian approach can provide useful uncertainty quantification about the behavior of LLM-based systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff08\u5982\u6709\u5bb3\u8f93\u51fa\u6216\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8f93\u5165\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff09\u65f6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u7531LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6027\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u884c\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c1) \u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8f93\u5165\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u7387\uff0c2) \u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u4e92\u52a8\u5bf9\u8bdd\u793a\u4f8b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u4e00\u4e2aLLM\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2aLLM\u7684\u6210\u5bf9\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u5173LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6709\u7528\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u91cf\u5316LLM\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Phase I generates natural-language crash reconstructions from multimodal inputs. Phase II performs in-depth crash reasoning by combining these reconstructions with temporal Event Data Recorder (EDR).For validation, we applied it to all LVD cases, focusing on a subset of 39 complex crashes where multiple EDR records per collision introduced ambiguity (e.g., due to missing or conflicting data).The evaluation of the 39 LVD crash cases revealed our framework achieved perfect accuracy across all test cases, successfully identifying both the most relevant EDR event and correctly distinguishing striking versus struck vehicles, surpassing the 92% accuracy achieved by human researchers on the same challenging dataset.

Notably, GPT-4o demonstrates robust multilingual performance even on cross-lingual tasks, and Claude~3.5~Sonnet achieves competitive accuracy on knowledge and reasoning benchmarks. However, all models struggle to some extent with the unique linguistic challenges of each language, such as Turkish agglutinative morphology and Cantonese colloquialisms. Smaller open-source models (LLaMA-2~13B, Mistral~7B) lag substantially in fluency and accuracy, highlighting the resource disparity.

Our method leverages paraphrase sets to enforce prediction consistency using a novel, skew-aware aggregation strategy for robust target computation.

We analyze six open-source guard models and show that our approach reduces semantic variability across paraphrases by ~58%, improves benchmark accuracy by ~2.5% on average, and generalizes to unseen stylistic variations. Intriguingly, we discover a bidirectional relationship between model calibration and consistency: our robustness training improves calibration by up to 40%, revealing a fundamental connection between these properties.

Alexander"], "title": "LLM enhanced graph inference for long-term disease progression modelling", "comment": null, "summary": "Understanding the interactions between biomarkers among brain regions during neurodegenerative disease is essential for unravelling the mechanisms underlying disease progression. For example, pathophysiological models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) typically describe how variables, such as regional levels of toxic proteins, interact spatiotemporally within a dynamical system driven by an underlying biological substrate, often based on brain connectivity. However, current methods grossly oversimplify the complex relationship between brain connectivity by assuming a single-modality brain connectome as the disease-spreading substrate. This leads to inaccurate predictions of pathology spread, especially during the long-term progression period. Meanhwile, other methods of learning such a graph in a purely data-driven way face the identifiability issue due to lack of proper constraint. We thus present a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as expert guides on the interaction of regional variables to enhance learning of disease progression from irregularly sampled longitudinal patient data. By leveraging LLMs' ability to synthesize multi-modal relationships and incorporate diverse disease-driving mechanisms, our method simultaneously optimizes 1) the construction of long-term disease trajectories from individual-level observations and 2) the biologically-constrained graph structure that captures interactions among brain regions with better identifiability. We demonstrate the new approach by estimating the pathology propagation using tau-PET imaging data from an Alzheimer's disease cohort. The new framework demonstrates superior prediction accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional approaches while revealing additional disease-driving factors beyond conventional connectivity measures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u6307\u5bfc\u4ece\u7eb5\u5411\u75c5\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u957f\u671f\u75be\u75c5\u8f68\u8ff9\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u751f\u7269\u7ea6\u675f\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\uff08AD\uff09\u7684\u75c5\u7406\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63cf\u8ff0\u8111\u533a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u751f\u7269\u6807\u8bb0\u7269\u4ea4\u4e92\u65f6\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7b80\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u75c5\u7406\u4f20\u64ad\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u800c\u7eaf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9002\u5f53\u7ea6\u675f\u800c\u9762\u4e34\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528LLMs\u5408\u6210\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u75be\u75c5\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e2a\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u957f\u671f\u75be\u75c5\u8f68\u8ff9\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u751f\u7269\u7ea6\u675f\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u6355\u83b7\u8111\u533a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u8fde\u63a5\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u989d\u5916\u75be\u75c5\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7LLMs\u7684\u5f15\u5165\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u66f4\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5730\u9884\u6d4bAD\u75c5\u7406\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u66f4\u591a\u75be\u75c5\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

True LLM understanding, analogous to human expertise, requires making consistent, well-founded decisions across multiple instances and diverse domains, relying on relevant and domain-grounded decision factors.

In this context, understanding is defined as the ability to identify and rely on the correct decision factors, features that determine outcomes within a domain. STaDS jointly assesses understanding through: (i) question and instruction comprehension, (ii) knowledge-based prediction, and (iii) reliance on relevant decision factors. By analyzing 9 frontier LLMs across 15 diverse decision settings, we find that (a) most models struggle to achieve consistently strong accuracy across diverse domains; (b) models can be accurate yet globally unfaithful, and there are frequent mismatches between stated rationales and factors driving predictions.

Previous studies tend to rely on the model itself to implicitly learn semantic modeling during training, and resort to inefficient and costly manual annotations for these two challenges. To mitigate these limitations, we propose enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) speech projector, where each expert specializes in the semantic subspace of a specific language, enabling fine-grained modeling of speech features. Additionally, we introduce a multi-stage training paradigm that utilizes readily available monolingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) and monolingual ST data, facilitating speech-text alignment and improving translation capabilities. During training, we leverage a combination of language-specific loss and intra-group load balancing loss to guide the MoE speech projector in efficiently allocating tokens to the appropriate experts, across expert groups and within each group, respectively. To bridge the data gap across different training stages and improve adaptation to the CS scenario, we further employ a transition loss, enabling smooth transitions of data between stages, to effectively address the scarcity of high-quality CS speech translation data.

Using high-level modelling languages such as Essence, a modeller may express their problems in terms of abstract structures. These are structures not natively supported by the solvers, and so they have to be transformed into or represented as other structures before solving. For example, nested sets are abstract structures, and they can be represented as matrices in constraint solvers. Many problems contain symmetries and one very common and highly successful technique used in constraint programming is to \"break\" symmetries, to avoid searching for symmetric solutions. This can speed up the solving process by many orders of magnitude. Most of these symmetry-breaking techniques involve placing some kind of ordering for the variables of the problem, and picking a particular member under the symmetries, usually the smallest. Unfortunately, applying this technique to abstract variables produces a very large number of complex constraints that perform poorly in practice. In this paper, we demonstrate a new incomplete method of breaking the symmetries of abstract structures by better exploiting their representations. We apply the method in breaking the symmetries arising from indistinguishable objects, a commonly occurring type of symmetry, and show that our method is faster than the previous methods proposed in (Akg\u00fcn et al. 2025).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5229\u7528\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8868\u793a\u6765\u6253\u7834\u7ea6\u675f\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u907f\u514d\u641c\u7d22\u5bf9\u79f0\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6253\u7834\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u662f\u63d0\u9ad8\u6c42\u89e3\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f46\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u62bd\u8c61\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u5927\u91cf\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\u8868\u793a\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u7279\u5b9a\u6210\u5458\u6253\u7834\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9488\u5bf9\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u5bf9\u8c61\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6253\u7834\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6c42\u89e3\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5229\u7528\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6253\u7834\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u662f\u7ea6\u675f\u7f16\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u91cd\u5927\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

However, the critical aspect of role allocation strategies remains underexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that allocating roles with differing viewpoints to specific positions significantly impacts MAD's performance in reasoning tasks. Specifically, we find a novel role allocation strategy, \"Truth Last\", which can improve MAD performance by up to 22% in reasoning tasks. To address the issue of unknown truth in practical applications, we propose the Multi-Agent Debate Consistency (MADC) strategy, which systematically simulates and optimizes its core mechanisms.

However, the selection of in-context demonstrations plays a crucial role and can significantly affect LLMs' performance. Most existing demonstration selection methods primarily focus on semantic similarity between test inputs and demonstrations, often overlooking the importance of label distribution alignment. To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage demonstration selection method, TopK + Label Distribution Divergence (L2D), which leverages a fine-tuned BERT-like small language model (SLM) to generate label distributions and calculate their divergence for both test inputs and candidate demonstrations. This enables the selection of demonstrations that are not only semantically similar but also aligned in label distribution with the test input. Extensive experiments across seven text classification benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms previous demonstration selection strategies. Further analysis reveals a positive correlation between the performance of LLMs and the accuracy of the underlying SLMs used for label distribution estimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ICL\uff09\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u793a\u4f8b\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5TopK + L2D\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8003\u8651\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u9f50\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u793a\u4f8b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528TopK\u9009\u62e9\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u5019\u9009\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684BERT\u7c7b\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08SLM\uff09\u751f\u6210\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u5e03\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u5176\u6563\u5ea6\uff08L2D\uff09\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8f93\u5165\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LLMs\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u7528\u4e8e\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u5e03\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684SLMs\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\u5173\u7cfb\u3002"}}

ARCTraj addresses this gap by recording temporally ordered, object-level actions that capture how humans iteratively transform inputs into outputs, revealing intermediate reasoning steps that conventional datasets overlook. Collected via the O2ARC web interface, it contains around 10,000 trajectories annotated with task identifiers, timestamps, and success labels across 400 training tasks from the ARC-AGI-1 benchmark. It further defines a unified reasoning pipeline encompassing data collection, action abstraction, Markov decision process (MDP) formulation, and downstream learning, enabling integration with reinforcement learning, generative modeling, and sequence modeling methods such as PPO, World Models, GFlowNets, Diffusion agents, and Decision Transformers.

These emissions are largely contributed to by the production, use and disposal of consumer products. Thus, it is important to build tools to estimate the environmental impact of consumer goods, an essential part of which is conducting Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs). LCAs specify and account for the appropriate processes involved with the production, use, and disposal of the products. We present SpiderGen, an LLM-based workflow which integrates the taxonomy and methodology of traditional LCA with the reasoning capabilities and world knowledge of LLMs to generate the procedural information used for LCA. We additionally evaluate the output of SpiderGen using real-world LCA documents as ground-truth. We find that SpiderGen provides accurate LCA process information that is either fully correct or has minor errors, achieving an F1-Score of 62% across 10 sample data points.

Despite their unprecedented ability to synthesize information, a critical gap persists in evaluation: existing benchmarks primarily assess discriminative understanding or unconstrained image generation separately, failing to measure the integrated cognitive process of generative reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose that geometric construction provides an ideal testbed as it inherently demands a fusion of language comprehension and precise visual generation. We introduce GGBench, a benchmark designed specifically to evaluate geometric generative reasoning. It provides a comprehensive framework for systematically diagnosing a model's ability to not only understand and reason but to actively construct a solution, thereby setting a more rigorous standard for the next generation of intelligent systems.

We conducted a systematic analysis using statistical methods to verify how sensitive the Attack Success Rate (ASR) is when we apply variations to prompts designed to elicit inappropriate content from LLMs. Our results show that even small prompt modifications can significantly change the Attack Success Rate (ASR) according to the statistical tests we run, making the models more or less susceptible to types of attack.

Although the Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) paradigm offers a promising solution by promoting consensus among multiple agents to enhance reliability, it relies on the unrealistic assumption that all debaters are rational and reflective, which is a condition that may not hold when agents themselves are prone to hallucinations. To address this gap, we introduce the Multi-agent Undercover Gaming (MUG) protocol, inspired by social deduction games like \"Who is Undercover?\". MUG reframes MAD as a process of detecting \"undercover\" agents (those suffering from hallucinations) by employing multimodal counterfactual tests. Specifically, we modify reference images to introduce counterfactual evidence and observe whether agents can accurately identify these changes, providing ground-truth for identifying hallucinating agents and enabling robust, crowd-powered multimodal reasoning. MUG advances MAD protocols along three key dimensions: (1) enabling factual verification beyond statistical consensus through counterfactual testing; (2) introducing cross-evidence reasoning via dynamically modified evidence sources instead of relying on static inputs; and (3) fostering active reasoning, where agents engage in probing discussions rather than passively answering questions.

Consequently, research has focused on evaluating the robustness of LLMs, an essential quality for real-world tasks. In this paper, we employ simple multi-turn follow-up prompts to evaluate models' answer changes, model accuracy dynamics across turns with Markov chains, and examine whether linear probes can predict these changes. Our results show significant vulnerabilities in LLM robustness: a simple \"Think again\" prompt led to an approximate 10% accuracy drop for Gemini 1.5 Flash over nine turns, while combining this prompt with a semantically equivalent reworded question caused a 7.5% drop for Claude 3.5 Haiku. Additionally, we find that model accuracy across turns can be effectively modeled using Markov chains, enabling the prediction of accuracy probabilities over time. This allows for estimation of the model's stationary (long-run) accuracy, which we find to be on average approximately 8% lower than its first-turn accuracy for Gemini 1.5 Flash. Our results from a model's hidden states also reveal evidence that linear probes can help predict future answer changes.

While recent progress has shown promising results, they still suffer from two key limitations: (i) the reasoning processes lack the depth and iterative refinement characteristic of human cognition; and (ii) the reasoning processes exhibit instability, which compromises their reliability in downstream applications. In this work, we present STaR (slow-thinking for table reasoning), a new framework achieving cognitive table reasoning, in which LLMs are equipped with slow-thinking capabilities by explicitly modeling step-by-step thinking and uncertainty-aware inference. During training, STaR employs two-stage difficulty-aware reinforcement learning (DRL), progressively learning from simple to complex queries under a composite reward. During inference, STaR performs trajectory-level uncertainty quantification by integrating token-level confidence and answer consistency, enabling selection of more credible reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that STaR achieves superior performance and enhanced reasoning stability. Moreover, strong generalization over out-of-domain datasets further demonstrates STaR's potential as a reliable and cognitively inspired solution for table reasoning with LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The low initial bias amplifies toward the model's inherent bias level (+36%), whereas the high initial bias decays toward it (-26%).

In this paper, we use the systems' preference bias to study their hidden language: During the process of compressing the input images (typically containing multiple concepts) into texts and then reconstructing them into images, the systems' inherent preference bias introduces specific shifts in the outputs, disrupting the original input concept co-occurrence. We employ the multi-round \"telephone game\" to strategically leverage this bias. By observing the co-occurrence frequencies of concepts in telephone games, we quantitatively investigate the concept connection strength in the understanding of multimodal systems, i.e., \"hidden language.\" We also contribute Telescope, a dataset of 10,000+ concept pairs, as the database of our telephone game framework. Our telephone game is test-time scalable: By iteratively running telephone games, we can construct a global map of concept connections in multimodal systems' understanding. Here we can identify preference bias inherited from training, assess generalization capability advancement, and discover more stable pathways for fragile concept connections. Furthermore, we use Reasoning-LLMs to uncover unexpected concept relationships that transcend textual and visual similarities, inferring how multimodal systems understand and simulate the world.

In this paper, we introduce Squid Game, a dynamic and adversarial evaluation environment with resource-constrained and asymmetric information settings elaborated to evaluate LLMs through interactive gameplay against other LLM opponents. Notably, Squid Game consists of six elimination-style levels, focusing on multi-faceted abilities, such as instruction-following, code, reasoning, planning, and safety alignment. We evaluate over 50 LLMs on Squid Game, presenting the largest behavioral evaluation study of general LLMs on dynamic adversarial scenarios. We observe a clear generational phase transition on performance in the same model lineage and find evidence that some models resort to speculative shortcuts to win the game, indicating the possibility of higher-level evaluation paradigm contamination in static benchmarks.

There is a substantial risk that some of these decision induce harm to people, by infringing their well-being or their fundamental human rights.

This obstructs the ability to trace what went into a decision, which in turn is a prerequisite to any attempt of reconstructing a responsibility chain. Specifically, such traceability is linked to a documentation that will stand up in court when determining the cause of some AI-based decision that inadvertently or intentionally violates the law.\n  This paper takes a radical, yet practical, approach to this problem, by enforcing the documentation of each and every component that goes into the training or inference of an automated decision.

This study investigates whether state-of-the-art text-to-speech systems have internalized the human tendency to reduce speech rate to convey politeness - a non-obvious prosodic marker. We prompted 22 synthetic voices from two leading AI platforms (AI Studio and OpenAI) to read a fixed script under both \"polite and formal\" and \"casual and informal\" conditions and measured the resulting speech duration. Across both AI platforms, the polite prompt produced slower speech than the casual prompt with very large effect sizes, an effect that was statistically significant for all of AI Studio's voices and for a large majority of OpenAI's voices. These results demonstrate that AI can implicitly learn and replicate psychological nuances of human communication, highlighting its emerging role as a social actor capable of reinforcing human social norms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u8bed\u97f3\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u4ee5\u5185\u5316\u4eba\u7c7b\u901a\u8fc7\u964d\u4f4e\u8bed\u901f\u4f20\u8fbe\u793c\u8c8c\u7684\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u7f16\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u63a2\u8ba8AI\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u4f53\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u793e\u4ea4\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u542b\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5982\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u901f\u53d8\u5316\u4f20\u8fbe\u793c\u8c8c\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728AI Studio\u548cOpenAI\u4e24\u4e2a\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u4f7f\u752822\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u58f0\u97f3\uff0c\u5728\u201c\u793c\u8c8c\u548c\u6b63\u5f0f\u201d\u4e0e\u201c\u968f\u610f\u548c\u975e\u6b63\u5f0f\u201d\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6717\u8bfb\u56fa\u5b9a\u811a\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bed\u97f3\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\uff0c\u793c\u8c8c\u63d0\u793a\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u8bed\u901f\u663e\u8457\u6162\u4e8e\u968f\u610f\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4e14\u6548\u5e94\u91cf\u975e\u5e38\u5927\uff0c\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u80fd\u591f\u9690\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u590d\u5236\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ea4\u6d41\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u7ec6\u5fae\u5dee\u522b\uff0c\u7a81\u663e\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u80fd\u591f\u5f3a\u5316\u4eba\u7c7b\u793e\u4f1a\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u65b0\u5174\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

This is the extended version of the paper accepted at AAAI 2026, which includes all technical appendices and additional experimental details", "summary": "This paper systematically examines nation-level biases exhibited by Large Language Models (LLMs) within the domain of International Relations (IR). Leveraging historical records from the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), we developed a bias evaluation framework comprising three distinct tests to explore nation-level bias in various LLMs, with a particular focus on the five permanent members of the UNSC. Experimental results show that, even with the general bias patterns across models (e.g., favorable biases toward the western nations, and unfavorable biases toward Russia), these still vary based on the LLM. Notably, even within the same LLM, the direction and magnitude of bias for a nation change depending on the evaluation context. This observation suggests that LLM biases are fundamentally multidimensional, varying across models and tasks. We also observe that models with stronger reasoning abilities show reduced bias and better performance. Building on this finding, we introduce a debiasing framework that improves LLMs' factual reasoning combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Reflexion-based self-reflection techniques. Experiments show it effectively reduces nation-level bias, and improves performance, particularly in GPT-4o-mini and LLama-3.3-70B.

While rule-based approaches offer interpretability through predefined psychological principles, they often lack generalizability and flexibility. Conversely, data-driven methods can learn complex behaviors from large-scale datasets, but are typically inefficient, opaque, and difficult to align with human intuitions. To bridge this gap, we propose RLSLM, a hybrid Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates a rule-based Social Locomotion Model, grounded in empirical behavioral experiments, into the reward function of a reinforcement learning framework. The social locomotion model generates an orientation-sensitive social comfort field that quantifies human comfort across space, enabling socially aligned navigation policies with minimal training. RLSLM then jointly optimizes mechanical energy and social comfort, allowing agents to avoid intrusions into personal or group space. A human-agent interaction experiment using an immersive VR-based setup demonstrates that RLSLM outperforms state-of-the-art rule-based models in user experience. Ablation and sensitivity analyses further show the model's significantly improved interpretability over conventional data-driven methods.

We present \\PiAttention, a periodic sparse Transformer that factorizes attention into ring-local neighborhoods, deterministic $\u03c0$-stride skips, and an adaptive fusion gate. The periodic structure provides predictable coverage of distant tokens, while the sparse footprint keeps the per-layer complexity linear in context length.

However, most existing approaches assume that communication is instantaneous, reliable, and has unlimited bandwidth; these conditions are rarely met in real-world deployments. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in robust and efficient communication strategies for MARL under realistic constraints, including message perturbations, transmission delays, and limited bandwidth. Furthermore, because the challenges of low-latency reliability, bandwidth-intensive data sharing, and communication-privacy trade-offs are central to practical MARL systems, we focus on three applications involving cooperative autonomous driving, distributed simultaneous localization and mapping, and federated learning. Finally, we identify key open challenges and future research directions, advocating a unified approach that co-designs communication, learning, and robustness to bridge the gap between theoretical MARL models and practical implementations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u7efc\u8ff0\u7cfb\u7edf\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MARL\uff09\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u901a\u4fe1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6d88\u606f\u6270\u52a8\u3001\u4f20\u8f93\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u6709\u9650\u5e26\u5bbd\u3002\u91cd\u70b9\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MARL\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u901a\u4fe1\u662f\u5373\u65f6\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u5e26\u5bbd\u65e0\u9650\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u5f80\u5f80\u9762\u4e34\u8bf8\u591a\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5982\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u5e26\u5bbd\u9650\u5236\u548c\u6d88\u606f\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u56de\u987e\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\u5728\u6d88\u606f\u6270\u52a8\u3001\u4f20\u8f93\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u6709\u9650\u5e26\u5bbd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0bMARL\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u4e09\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\uff08\u534f\u540c\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fSLAM\u548c\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u6765\u63a2\u8ba8\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u3002", "result": "\u7efc\u8ff0\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u5728\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u5e26\u5bbd\u5bc6\u96c6\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u9690\u79c1\u6298\u8877\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u8054\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u5f25\u5408\u7406\u8bbaMARL\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u91c7\u7528\u8054\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7efc\u5408\u8003\u8651\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u9650\u5236\u3002"}}

Physicians draw on these multimodal and temporal sources of EHR data to form a comprehensive view of a patient's health, which is crucial for informed therapeutic decision-making. Yet, most predictive models fail to fully capture the interactions, redundancies, and temporal patterns across multiple data modalities, often focusing on a single data type or overlooking these complexities. In this paper, we present CURENet, a multimodal model (Combining Unified Representations for Efficient chronic disease prediction) that integrates unstructured clinical notes, lab tests, and patients' time-series data by utilizing large language models (LLMs) for clinical text processing and textual lab tests, as well as transformer encoders for longitudinal sequential visits. CURENet has been capable of capturing the intricate interaction between different forms of clinical data and creating a more reliable predictive model for chronic illnesses. We evaluated CURENet using the public MIMIC-III and private FEMH datasets, where it achieved over 94\\% accuracy in predicting the top 10 chronic conditions in a multi-label framework.

We collect responses from approximately 50 students across five quizzes and receive project reports from 14 teams. LLM-generated scores are compared against human evaluations conducted independently by the course teaching assistants (TAs). Our results show that GPT-4o achieves strong correlation with human graders (up to 0.98) and exact score agreement in 55\\% of quiz cases.

Do they form shared multilingual representations with language-specific decoding, and if so, why does performance still favor the dominant training language? To address this, we train a series of LLMs on different mixtures of multilingual data and analyze their internal mechanisms using cross-layer transcoders (CLT) and attribution graphs. Our results provide strong evidence for pivot language representations: the model employs nearly identical representations across languages, while language-specific decoding emerges in later layers. Attribution analyses reveal that decoding relies in part on a small set of high-frequency language features in the final layers, which linearly read out language identity from the first layers in the model. By intervening on these features, we can suppress one language and substitute another in the model's outputs. Finally, we study how the dominant training language influences these mechanisms across attribution graphs and decoding pathways. We argue that understanding this pivot-language mechanism is crucial for improving multilingual alignment in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u591a\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u5982\u4f55\u8868\u793a\u8fd9\u79cd\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u7528\u51e0\u4e4e\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u8868\u793a\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5b9a\u89e3\u7801\u5728\u540e\u671f\u5c42\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u8bed\u8a00LLMs\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5171\u4eab\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5b9a\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u53ca\u6027\u80fd\u504f\u5411\u4e3b\u5bfc\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217LLMs\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u8de8\u5c42\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\uff08CLT\uff09\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u7528\u51e0\u4e4e\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u8868\u793a\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5b9a\u89e3\u7801\u5728\u540e\u671f\u5c42\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u3002\u5c5e\u6027\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u89e3\u7801\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6700\u7ec8\u5c42\u4e2d\u7684\u5c11\u91cf\u9ad8\u9891\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u5c42\u7ebf\u6027\u8bfb\u53d6\u8bed\u8a00\u8eab\u4efd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5e72\u9884\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6291\u5236\u4e00\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u5e76\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u4e2d\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e3b\u5bfc\u8bed\u8a00\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u5728LLMs\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

However, models often rely on annotations that reflect dominant cultural norms, limiting model ability to recognize emotional expression in dialects often excluded from training data distributions, such as African American Vernacular English (AAVE). This study examines emotion recognition model performance on AAVE compared to General American English (GAE). We analyze 2.7 million tweets geo-tagged within Los Angeles. Texts are scored for strength of AAVE using computational approximations of dialect features. Annotations of emotion presence and intensity are collected on a dataset of 875 tweets with both high and low AAVE densities. To assess model accuracy on a task as subjective as emotion perception, we calculate community-informed \"silver\" labels where AAVE-dense tweets are labeled by African American, AAVE-fluent (ingroup) annotators. On our labeled sample, GPT and BERT-based models exhibit false positive prediction rates of anger on AAVE more than double than on GAE. SpanEmo, a popular text-based emotion model, increases false positive rates of anger from 25 percent on GAE to 60 percent on AAVE. Additionally, a series of linear regressions reveals that models and non-ingroup annotations are significantly more correlated with profanity-based AAVE features than ingroup annotations. Linking Census tract demographics, we observe that neighborhoods with higher proportions of African American residents are associated with higher predictions of anger (Pearson's correlation r = 0.27) and lower joy (r = -0.10). These results find an emergent safety issue of emotion AI reinforcing racial stereotypes through biased emotion classification.

Under review at IWSDS 2026", "summary": "LLMs are increasingly employed as judges across a variety of tasks, including those involving everyday social interactions. Yet, it remains unclear whether such LLM-judges can reliably assess tasks that require social or conversational judgment. We investigate how an LLM's conviction is changed when a task is reframed from a direct factual query to a Conversational Judgment Task. Our evaluation framework contrasts the model's performance on direct factual queries with its assessment of a speaker's correctness when the same information is presented within a minimal dialogue, effectively shifting the query from \"Is this statement correct?\" to \"Is this speaker correct?\". Furthermore, we apply pressure in the form of a simple rebuttal (\"The previous answer is incorrect.\") to both conditions. This perturbation allows us to measure how firmly the model maintains its position under conversational pressure. Our findings show that while some models like GPT-4o-mini reveal sycophantic tendencies under social framing tasks, others like Llama-8B-Instruct become overly-critical. We observe an average performance change of 9.24% across all models, demonstrating that even minimal dialogue context can significantly alter model judgment, underscoring conversational framing as a key factor in LLM-based evaluation.

Traditional manual analysis approach is time-consuming and limited by human errors. To enhance efficiency and accuracy, large language models (LLMs) with strong analytical and inferencing capabilities can be employed. However, high-quality analysis reports with well-structured formatting cannot be obtained through a single instruction input to the LLM. To tackle this issue, we propose a method that first decomposes the complex task into several sub-tasks and designs effective system prompts and user prompts for each sub-task. Multi-round interactions with the LLM incorporating self-check and reflection are then conducted to enable structured data extraction as well as multi-step analysis and evaluation. Furthermore, custom tools are defined and invoked to generate figures and compute metrics.

We present an architecture that resolves this tension through offline data augmentation and efficient parallel retrieval from structured episodic memory. Our system transforms biographical data into 1,774 enriched first-person memories with affective-semantic metadata, then employs two-stage retrieval achieving 0.52s prompt generation. Evaluation using LLM-as-judge and RAGAs metrics shows our approach achieves parity with traditional RAG on GPT-4 while significantly outperforming it on smaller models (GPT-3.5, GPT-3), suggesting particular value for resource-constrained deployments. Beyond dialogue, the structured memory enables novel visualization tools: spatiotemporal heatmaps, emotional trajectory analysis, and interactive path tracking, positioning the system as both a dialogue interface and research tool for biographical analysis.

Previous research has focused on detecting and addressing negative attention heads that induce negative bias. However, the underlying detailed factors influencing negative bias remain underexplored. In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs exhibit format-level negative bias, meaning the prompt format more influences their responses than the semantics of the negative response. For the fine-grained study of the negative bias, we introduce a pipeline for constructing the evaluation set, which systematically categorizes the dataset into three subsets based on the model's parametric knowledge: correct, incorrect, and insufficient relevant knowledge. Through analysis of this evaluation set, we identify a shortcut behavior in which models tend to generate negative responses when they lack sufficient knowledge to answer a yes-no question, leading to negative bias. We further examine how negative bias changes under various prompting scenarios related to parametric knowledge. We observe that providing relevant context and offering an \"I don't know\" option generally reduces negative bias, whereas chain-of-thought prompting tends to amplify the bias. Finally, we demonstrate that the degree of negative bias can vary depending on the type of prompt, which influences the direction of the response. Our work reveals the various factors that influence negative bias, providing critical insights for mitigating it in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u8d1f\u5411\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5373\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5426\u5b9a\u6027\u56de\u5e94\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u77e5\u8bc6\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u7ec6\u5206\u4e3a\u6b63\u786e\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e09\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8d1f\u5411\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e76\u5904\u7406\u5f15\u8d77\u8d1f\u5411\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\uff0c\u4f46\u5f71\u54cd\u8d1f\u5411\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u56e0\u7d20\u4ecd\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u63d0\u793a\u683c\u5f0f\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u77e5\u8bc6\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u8d1f\u5411\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5206\u4e3a\u4e09\u7c7b\uff08\u6b63\u786e\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0d\u8db3\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u63d0\u4f9b\u201c\u6211\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u201d\u9009\u9879\u3001\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63d0\u793a\uff09\u5bf9\u8d1f\u5411\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8db3\u591f\u77e5\u8bc6\u65f6\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5426\u5b9a\u56de\u5e94\uff0c\u5373\u5b58\u5728\u6377\u5f84\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u63d0\u4f9b\u76f8\u5173\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u201c\u6211\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u201d\u9009\u9879\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u8d1f\u5411\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u800c\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63d0\u793a\u4f1a\u52a0\u5267\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8d1f\u5411\u504f\u89c1\u53d7\u63d0\u793a\u7c7b\u578b\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u65b9\u5411\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u51cf\u8f7b\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u8d1f\u5411\u504f\u89c1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

However, it remains unclear whether these tool-enabled gains reflect trustworthy reasoning. Focusing on the Code Interpreter tool, we show that even when tools are selected and executed correctly, TaLMs treat tool outputs as substitutes for reasoning, producing solutions that appear correct but lack coherent justification. We term this failure mode Tool-Induced Myopia (TIM), and study it using PYMATH, a benchmark of 1,679 competition-level mathematical problems for which Python code is helpful but not sufficient. We further develop a multi-dimensional evaluation suite to quantify reasoning degradation in TaLMs relative to their non-tool counterparts. Our findings reveal that while TaLMs achieve up to a 19.3 percentage point gain in final-answer accuracy, their reasoning behavior consistently deteriorates (e.g., non-tool LLMs win up to 41.5% more often in pairwise comparisons of the reasoning process). This degradation intensifies with tool use; the more frequently a model invokes tools, the less coherent its reasoning becomes. Moreover, tool use shifts errors from arithmetic mistakes toward global reasoning failures (logic, assumption, creativity); with TIM present in ~55% of high-risk cases. Finally, we propose a preference-optimization-based framework that realigns TaLMs to use tools as assistive evidence, improving both final-answer accuracy and reasoning depth under tool use.

Existing approaches typically apply general-purpose prompting or retrieval strategies without leveraging this structured context, limiting performance in high-stakes settings. We address this gap with EMSQA, an 24.3K-question multiple-choice dataset spanning 10 clinical subject areas and 4 certification levels, accompanied by curated, subject area-aligned knowledge bases (40K documents and 2M tokens). Building on EMSQA, we introduce (i) Expert-CoT, a prompting strategy that conditions chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning on specific clinical subject area and certification level, and (ii) ExpertRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline that grounds responses in subject area-aligned documents and real-world patient data. Experiments on 4 LLMs show that Expert-CoT improves up to 2.05% over vanilla CoT prompting. Additionally, combining Expert-CoT with ExpertRAG yields up to a 4.59% accuracy gain over standard RAG baselines.

We introduce a novel dataset of 176 symptom-diagnosis pairs extracted from House M.D., a medical television series validated for teaching rare disease recognition in medical education. We evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT 4o mini, GPT 5 mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Gemini 2.5 Pro on narrative-based diagnostic reasoning tasks.

While these translations demand discourse-level coherence and strict terminological precision, current evaluation methods predominantly focus on segment-level accuracy and fluency. To address this limitation, we introduce DiscoX, a new benchmark for discourse-level and expert-level Chinese-English translation. It comprises 200 professionally-curated texts from 7 domains, with an average length exceeding 1700 tokens. To evaluate performance on DiscoX, we also develop Metric-S, a reference-free system that provides fine-grained automatic assessments across accuracy, fluency, and appropriateness. Metric-S demonstrates strong consistency with human judgments, significantly outperforming existing metrics. Our experiments reveal a remarkable performance gap: even the most advanced LLMs still trail human experts on these tasks.

Among these, direct preference optimization (DPO) has emerged as a widely adopted technique that fine-tunes LLMs on preferred completions over less favorable ones. While most frontier LLMs do not disclose their curated preference pairs, the broader LLM community has released several open-source DPO datasets, including TuluDPO, ORPO, UltraFeedback, HelpSteer, and Code-Preference-Pairs. However, systematic comparisons remain scarce, largely due to the high computational cost and the lack of rich quality annotations, making it difficult to understand how preferences were selected, which task types they span, and how well they reflect human judgment on a per-sample level. In this work, we present the first comprehensive, data-centric analysis of popular open-source DPO corpora. We leverage the Magpie framework to annotate each sample for task category, input quality, and preference reward, a reward-model-based signal that validates the preference order without relying on human annotations. This enables a scalable, fine-grained inspection of preference quality across datasets, revealing structural and qualitative discrepancies in reward margins. Building on these insights, we systematically curate a new DPO mixture, UltraMix, that draws selectively from all five corpora while removing noisy or redundant samples.

This challenge arises primarily due to constrained model context windows and the sparsity of relevant information within extensive contextual noise. To solve this, we propose the SAP$^{2}$ method, a novel framework that dynamically prunes and integrates relevant contextual keywords in two stages. Specifically, each stage leverages our proposed Speech-Driven Attention-based Pooling mechanism, enabling efficient compression of context embeddings while preserving speech-salient information.

Results from a pilot annotation study demonstrate that these categories provide broad coverage of adverbs in natural text and can be reliably assigned by human annotators. Incorporating this typology extends WordNet's coverage, aligns it more closely with linguistic theory, and facilitates downstream NLP applications such as word sense disambiguation, event extraction, sentiment analysis, and discourse modeling.

We propose a novel adversarial training strategy, called LANE, to address this limitation by deliberately shifting the model's learning focus to the target word. This method generates challenging negative training examples through the selective marking of alternate words in the training set. The goal is to force the model to create a greater separability between same sentences with different marked words. Experimental results on lexical semantic change detection and word sense disambiguation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach yields more discriminative word representations, improving performance over standard contrastive learning baselines. We further provide qualitative analyses showing that the proposed negatives lead to representations that better capture subtle meaning differences even in challenging environments.

The approach first clusters KG triplets based on their relations, creating reusable templates through natural language rules derived from the entity types of objects and relations. A module then leverages LLMs to refine these templates, improving clarity and coherence while preserving factual accuracy.

However, recent research has shown that machine learning models may be vulnerable in a number of ways, putting both the models and the systems theyre used in at risk. In this paper, we intend to analyze and experiment with the best of existing adversarial attack recipes and create new ones. We concentrated on developing a novel adversarial attack strategy on current state-of-the-art machine learning models by producing ambiguous inputs for the models to confound them and then constructing the path to the future development of the robustness of the models.

Large language models (LLMs) like BloombergGPT and FinMA have set new benchmarks across various financial NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, stock movement prediction, and credit risk assessment. Furthermore, FinMA-ES, a bilingual financial LLM, has also demonstrated strong performance using the FLARE and FLARE-ES benchmarks. However, the high computational demands of these models limit the accessibility of many organizations. To address this, we propose Layer-wise Adaptive Ensemble Tuning (LAET), a novel strategy that selectively fine-tunes the most effective layers of pre-trained LLMs by analyzing hidden state representations while freezing less critical layers. LAET significantly reduces computational overhead while enhancing task-specific performance. Our approach shows strong results in financial NLP tasks, outperforming existing benchmarks and state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4, even with smaller LLMs ($\\sim$3B parameters).

Our system operates on egocentric binaural audio and uses the wearer's self-speech as an anchor, leveraging turn-taking behavior and dialogue dynamics to infer conversational partners and suppress others. To enable real-time, on-device operation, we propose a dual-model architecture: a lightweight streaming model runs every 12.5 ms for low-latency extraction of the conversation partners, while a slower model runs less frequently to capture longer-range conversational dynamics. Results on real-world 2- and 3-speaker conversation test sets, collected with binaural egocentric hardware from 11 participants totaling 6.8 hours, show generalization in identifying and isolating conversational partners in multi-conversation settings. Our work marks a step toward hearing assistants that adapt proactively to conversational dynamics and engagement.

Training-time alignment methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) face prohibitive costs in expert supervision and inherent scalability limitations, offering limited dynamic control during inference. Consequently, there is an urgent need for scalable and adaptable alignment mechanisms. To address this, we propose W2S-AlignTree, a pioneering plug-and-play inference-time alignment framework that synergistically combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with the Weak-to-Strong Generalization paradigm for the first time. W2S-AlignTree formulates LLM alignment as an optimal heuristic search problem within a generative search tree. By leveraging weak model's real-time, step-level signals as alignment proxies and introducing an Entropy-Aware exploration mechanism, W2S-AlignTree enables fine-grained guidance during strong model's generation without modifying its parameters. The approach dynamically balances exploration and exploitation in high-dimensional generation search trees. Experiments across controlled sentiment generation, summarization, and instruction-following show that W2S-AlignTree consistently outperforms strong baselines. Notably, W2S-AlignTree raises the performance of Llama3-8B from 1.89 to 2.19, a relative improvement of 15.9 on the summarization task.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6W2S-AlignTree\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u5f31\u5230\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u5e38\u5e38\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u504f\u597d\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982RLHF\u9762\u4e34\u4e13\u5bb6\u76d1\u7763\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faW2S-AlignTree\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u7ed3\u5408\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22(MCTS)\u548c\u5f31\u5230\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06LLM\u5bf9\u9f50\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u641c\u7d22\u6811\u5185\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u71b5\u611f\u77e5\u63a2\u7d22\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f31\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e3a\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u751f\u6210\u3001\u6458\u8981\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cW2S-AlignTree\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6458\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cLlama3-8B\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4ece1.89\u63d0\u5347\u52302.19\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8615.9%\u3002", "conclusion": "W2S-AlignTree\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408MCTS\u548c\u5f31\u5230\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002"}}

To address this, we introduce Professional Reasoning Bench (PRBench), a realistic, open-ended, and difficult benchmark of real-world problems in Finance and Law. We open-source its 1,100 expert-authored tasks and 19,356 expert-curated criteria, making it, to our knowledge, the largest public, rubric-based benchmark for both legal and finance domains. We recruit 182 qualified professionals, holding JDs, CFAs, or 6+ years of experience, who contributed tasks inspired by their actual workflows. This process yields significant diversity, with tasks spanning 114 countries and 47 US jurisdictions. Our expert-curated rubrics are validated through a rigorous quality pipeline, including independent expert validation. Subsequent evaluation of 20 leading models reveals substantial room for improvement, with top scores of only 0.39 (Finance) and 0.37 (Legal) on our Hard subsets. We further catalog associated economic impacts of the prompts and analyze performance using human-annotated rubric categories. Our analysis shows that models with similar overall scores can diverge significantly on specific capabilities.
