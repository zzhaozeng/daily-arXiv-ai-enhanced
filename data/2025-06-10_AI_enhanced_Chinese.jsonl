Significant efforts have been\ndedicated to advancing such a system identification problem in this area.\nPrevious methods often rely on heavy optimization pipelines with a\ndifferentiable simulator and renderer to estimate physical parameters. However,\nthese approaches frequently necessitate extensive hyperparameter tuning for\neach scene and involve a costly optimization process, which limits both their\npracticality and generalizability. In this work, we propose a novel framework,\nVid2Sim, a generalizable video-based approach for recovering geometry and\nphysical properties through a mesh-free reduced simulation based on Linear\nBlend Skinning (LBS), offering high computational efficiency and versatile\nrepresentation capability. Specifically, Vid2Sim first reconstructs the\nobserved configuration of the physical system from video using a feed-forward\nneural network trained to capture physical world knowledge. A lightweight\noptimization pipeline then refines the estimated appearance, geometry, and\nphysical properties to closely align with video observations within just a few\nminutes.

Our method enables extremely fast\ncomputation of high-quality cross fields of general input shapes, typically\nwithin one second without per-shape optimization. Our method assumes a\npoint-sampled surface, or called a point-cloud surface, as input, so we can\naccommodate various different surface representations by a straightforward\npoint sampling process. Using an auto-encoder network architecture, we encode\ninput point-cloud surfaces into a sparse voxel grid with fine-grained latent\nspaces, which are decoded into both SDF-based surface geometry and cross\nfields. We also contribute a dataset of models with both high-quality signed\ndistance fields (SDFs) representations and their corresponding cross fields,\nand use it to train our network. Once trained, the network is capable of\ncomputing a cross field of an input surface in a feed-forward manner, ensuring\nhigh geometric fidelity, noise resilience, and rapid inference. Furthermore,\nleveraging the same unified latent representation, we incorporate a diffusion\nmodel for computing cross fields of new shapes generated from partial input,\nsuch as sketches.

Under review", "summary": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained significant attention for\nhigh-quality and efficient view synthesis, making it widely adopted in fields\nsuch as AR/VR, robotics, and autonomous driving. Despite its impressive\nalgorithmic performance, real-time rendering on resource-constrained devices\nremains a major challenge due to tight power and area budgets. This paper\npresents an architecture-algorithm co-design to address these inefficiencies.\nFirst, we reveal substantial redundancy caused by repeated computation of\ncommon terms/expressions during the conventional rasterization. To resolve\nthis, we propose axis-oriented rasterization, which pre-computes and reuses\nshared terms along both the X and Y axes through a dedicated hardware design,\neffectively reducing multiply-and-add (MAC) operations by up to 63%. Second, by\nidentifying the resource and performance inefficiency of the sorting process,\nwe introduce a novel neural sorting approach that predicts order-independent\nblending weights using an efficient neural network, eliminating the need for\ncostly hardware sorters. A dedicated training framework is also proposed to\nimprove its algorithmic stability. Third, to uniformly support rasterization\nand neural network inference, we design an efficient reconfigurable processing\narray that maximizes hardware utilization and throughput. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a $\\pi$-trajectory tile schedule, inspired by Morton encoding and\nHilbert curve, to optimize Gaussian reuse and reduce memory access overhead.\nComprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed design preserves\nrendering quality while achieving a speedup of $23.4\\sim27.8\\times$ and energy\nsavings of $28.8\\sim51.4\\times$ compared to edge GPUs for real-world scenes.

To address this challenge we propose a workflow that makes\nuse of natural language processing (NLP) to query a database technology and\nreturn a response in natural language. Our solution utilizes Large Language\nModels (LLMs) that are sized for edge devices to perform NLP as well as\ngraphical databases which are well suited for dynamic connected networks which\nare pervasive in the IoBT.

Our approach fine-tunes a lightweight\nbase model, Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct, using Low-Rank Adaptation and custom reward\nfunctions that jointly consider diagnostic accuracy and reasoning quality.\nTraining is performed on a single NVIDIA A100-PCIE-40GB GPU, demonstrating the\nfeasibility of deploying such models in constrained environments. We evaluate\nthe model using an LLM-as-judge framework that scores both correctness and\nexplanation quality. Experimental results show that RARL significantly improves\nVLM performance in medical image analysis and clinical reasoning, outperforming\nsupervised fine-tuning on reasoning-focused tasks by approximately 7.78%, while\nrequiring fewer computational resources. Additionally, we demonstrate the\ngeneralization capabilities of our approach on unseen datasets, achieving\naround 27% improved performance compared to supervised fine-tuning and about 4%\nover traditional RL fine-tuning. Our experiments also illustrate that diversity\nprompting during training and reasoning prompting during inference are crucial\nfor enhancing VLM performance. Our findings highlight the potential of\nreasoning-guided learning and reasoning prompting to steer medical VLMs toward\nmore transparent, accurate, and resource-efficient clinical decision-making.\nCode and data are publicly available.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aRARL\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u5347\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRARL\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3001\u900f\u660e\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578bQwen2-VL-2B-Instruct\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u8003\u8651\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u5757NVIDIA A100-PCIE-40GB GPU\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "RARL\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6bd4\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7ea67.78%\uff0c\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7ea64%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u793a\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u900f\u660e\u6027\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

This is because, while the\ntoken vocabulary may allow for different tokenizations of a string, the\ntokenizer always maps the string to only one of these tokenizations--the\ncanonical tokenization. However, multiple lines of empirical evidence suggest\nthat large language models do not always generate canonical token sequences,\nand this comes with several negative consequences. In this work, we first show\nthat, to generate a canonical token sequence, a model needs to generate\n(partial) canonical token sequences at each step of the autoregressive\ngeneration process underpinning its functioning. Building upon this theoretical\nresult, we introduce canonical sampling, a simple and efficient sampling method\nthat precludes a given model from generating non-canonical token sequences.\nFurther, we also show that, in comparison with standard sampling, the\ndistribution of token sequences generated using canonical sampling is provably\ncloser to the true distribution of token sequences used during training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u79f0\u4e3a\u201c\u89c4\u8303\u91c7\u6837\u201d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u975e\u89c4\u8303\u6807\u8bb0\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u975e\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u8fd9\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u201c\u89c4\u8303\u91c7\u6837\u201d\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u9ad8\u6548\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u89c4\u8303\u91c7\u6837\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u5e03\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u91c7\u6837\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c4\u8303\u91c7\u6837\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

In this phenomenon, LLMs either omit\n(neglecting to address certain parts) or misinterpret (responding to invented\nquery parts) elements of the given query, leading to intent hallucinated\ngeneration. To systematically evaluate intent hallucination, we introduce\nFAITHQA, a novel benchmark for intent hallucination that contains 20,068\nproblems, covering both query-only and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)\nsetups with varying topics and difficulty. FAITHQA is the first hallucination\nbenchmark that goes beyond factual verification, tailored to identify the\nfundamental cause of intent hallucination. By evaluating various LLMs on\nFAITHQA, we find that (1) intent hallucination is a common issue even for\nstate-of-the-art models, and (2) the phenomenon stems from omission or\nmisinterpretation of LLMs. To facilitate future research, we introduce an\nautomatic LLM generation evaluation metric, CONSTRAINT SCORE, for detecting\nintent hallucination.

To study this problem, we propose\nPrecise Information Control (PIC), a new task formulation that requires models\nto generate long-form outputs grounded in a provided set of short\nself-contained statements, known as verifiable claims, without adding any\nunsupported ones. For comprehensiveness, PIC includes a full setting that tests\na model's ability to include exactly all input claims, and a partial setting\nthat requires the model to selectively incorporate only relevant claims. We\npresent PIC-Bench, a benchmark of eight long-form generation tasks (e.g.,\nsummarization, biography generation) adapted to the PIC setting, where LMs are\nsupplied with well-formed, verifiable input claims. Our evaluation of a range\nof open and proprietary LMs on PIC-Bench reveals that, surprisingly,\nstate-of-the-art LMs still intrinsically hallucinate in over 70% of outputs. To\nalleviate this lack of faithfulness, we introduce a post-training framework,\nusing a weakly supervised preference data construction method, to train an 8B\nPIC-LM with stronger PIC ability--improving from 69.1% to 91.0% F1 in the full\nPIC setting.

However, their vulnerability to adversarial\nattacks-such as point dropping, shifting, and adding-poses a critical challenge\nto the reliability of 3D vision systems. These attacks can compromise the\nsemantic and structural integrity of point clouds, rendering many existing\ndefense mechanisms ineffective. To address this issue, a defense strategy named\nKNN-Defense is proposed, grounded in the manifold assumption and\nnearest-neighbor search in feature space. Instead of reconstructing surface\ngeometry or enforcing uniform point distributions, the method restores\nperturbed inputs by leveraging the semantic similarity of neighboring samples\nfrom the training set. KNN-Defense is lightweight and computationally\nefficient, enabling fast inference and making it suitable for real-time and\npractical applications. Empirical results on the ModelNet40 dataset\ndemonstrated that KNN-Defense significantly improves robustness across various\nattack types. In particular, under point-dropping attacks-where many existing\nmethods underperform due to the targeted removal of critical points-the\nproposed method achieves accuracy gains of 20.1%, 3.6%, 3.44%, and 7.74% on\nPointNet, PointNet++, DGCNN, and PCT, respectively.

In addition,\nthe development of various advanced deep neural networks is another reason for\nthis breakthrough. However, challenges remain in applying the technique in the\nreal world. First, existing sign language datasets do not cover the whole sign\nvocabulary. Second, most of the sign language datasets provide only single view\nRGB videos, which makes it difficult to handle hand occlusions when performing\nISLR. To fill this gap, this paper presents a dual-view sign language dataset\nfor ISLR named NationalCSL-DP, which fully covers the Chinese national sign\nlanguage vocabulary.

Furthermore, a CNN transformer network is also proposed as a strong\nbaseline and an extremely simple but effective fusion strategy for prediction.\nExtensive experiments were conducted to prove the effectiveness of the datasets\nas well as the baseline. The results show that the proposed fusion strategy can\nsignificantly increase the performance of the ISLR, but it is not easy for the\nsequence-to-sequence model, regardless of whether the early-fusion or\nlate-fusion strategy is applied, to learn the complementary features from the\nsign videos of two vertical views.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53cc\u89c6\u89d2\u4e2d\u56fd\u624b\u8bed\u6570\u636e\u96c6NationalCSL-DP\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2aCNN-Transformer\u7f51\u7edc\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u624b\u8bed\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u5168\u4e14\u591a\u4e3a\u5355\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u624b\u90e8\u906e\u6321\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u53cc\u89c6\u89d2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5b64\u7acb\u624b\u8bed\u8bc6\u522b\uff08ISLR\uff09\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u8986\u76d6\u4e2d\u56fd\u56fd\u5bb6\u624b\u8bed\u8bcd\u6c47\u7684\u53cc\u89c6\u89d2\u6570\u636e\u96c6NationalCSL-DP\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cdCNN-Transformer\u7f51\u7edc\u53ca\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86ISLR\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5e8f\u5217\u5230\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u4ece\u53cc\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u4e92\u8865\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cc\u89c6\u89d2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u4e3aISLR\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5229\u7528\u53cc\u89c6\u89d2\u4fe1\u606f\u4ecd\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

We attempt to address this\nquestion by conducting a meta-analysis surveying more than 150\nprompting-related papers from leading NLP and AI conferences from 2022 to 2025\nand blogs. We propose a property- and human-centric framework for evaluating\nprompt quality, encompassing 21 properties categorized into six dimensions. We\nthen examine how existing studies assess their impact on LLMs, revealing their\nimbalanced support across models and tasks, and substantial research gaps.\nFurther, we analyze correlations among properties in high-quality natural\nlanguage prompts, deriving prompting recommendations. We then empirically\nexplore multi-property prompt enhancements in reasoning tasks, observing that\nsingle-property enhancements often have the greatest impact. Finally, we\ndiscover that instruction-tuning on property-enhanced prompts can result in\nbetter reasoning models.

However, recent detectors have shown greater robustness against\nsuch basic attacks. In this work, we introduce Adversarial Paraphrasing, a\ntraining-free attack framework that universally humanizes any AI-generated text\nto evade detection more effectively. Our approach leverages an off-the-shelf\ninstruction-following LLM to paraphrase AI-generated content under the guidance\nof an AI text detector, producing adversarial examples that are specifically\noptimized to bypass detection. Extensive experiments show that our attack is\nboth broadly effective and highly transferable across several detection\nsystems. For instance, compared to simple paraphrasing attack--which,\nironically, increases the true positive at 1% false positive (T@1%F) by 8.57%\non RADAR and 15.03% on Fast-DetectGPT--adversarial paraphrasing, guided by\nOpenAI-RoBERTa-Large, reduces T@1%F by 64.49% on RADAR and a striking 98.96% on\nFast-DetectGPT.

However, their\neffectiveness in medical applications remains limited due to the inherent\ndiscrepancies between data and tasks in medical scenarios and those in the\ngeneral domain. Concretely, existing medical MLLMs face the following critical\nlimitations: (1) limited coverage of medical knowledge beyond imaging, (2)\nheightened susceptibility to hallucinations due to suboptimal data curation\nprocesses, (3) lack of reasoning capabilities tailored for complex medical\nscenarios. To address these challenges, we first propose a comprehensive data\ncuration procedure that (1) efficiently acquires rich medical knowledge data\nnot only from medical imaging but also from extensive medical texts and\ngeneral-domain data; and (2) synthesizes accurate medical captions, visual\nquestion answering (VQA), and reasoning samples. As a result, we build a\nmultimodal dataset enriched with extensive medical knowledge. Building on the\ncurated data, we introduce our medical-specialized MLLM: Lingshu. Lingshu\nundergoes multi-stage training to embed medical expertise and enhance its\ntask-solving capabilities progressively. Besides, we preliminarily explore the\npotential of applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards paradigm\nto enhance Lingshu's medical reasoning ability.

Specifically, our approach firstly encodes and\naligns input modalities using pre-trained multi-modal encoders, then employs a\nrepresentation decomposition framework to separate common emotional content\nfrom unique cues, and finally integrates these decomposed signals via an\nattention mechanism to form a dynamic soft prompt for a multi-modal LLM.\nExtensive experiments on three representative tasks for affective computing,\nnamely, multi-modal aspect-based sentiment analysis, multi-modal emotion\nanalysis, and hateful meme detection, demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach, which consistently outperforms strong baselines and state-of-the-art\nmodels.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u548c\u51b2\u7a81\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u60c5\u611f\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5bf9\u9f50\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5206\u89e3\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6574\u5408\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u8f6f\u63d0\u793a\u8f93\u5165LLM\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We provide a comprehensive and scientifically sound\ncomparison of IS methods applied to an essential NLP task -- Automatic Text\nClassification (ATC), considering several classification solutions and many\ndatasets. Our findings reveal a significant untapped potential for IS\nsolutions. We also propose two novel IS solutions that are noise-oriented and\nredundancy-aware, specifically designed for large datasets and transformer\narchitectures. Our final solution achieved an average reduction of 41\\% in\ntraining sets, while maintaining the same levels of effectiveness in all\ndatasets. Importantly, our solutions demonstrated speedup improvements of 1.67x\n(up to 2.46x), making them scalable for datasets with hundreds of thousands of\ndocuments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u535a\u58eb\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u9009\u62e9\uff08IS\uff09\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5197\u4f59\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dNLP\u9886\u57df\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u578b\u5bc6\u96c6\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u9009\u62e9\u6280\u672f\u6f5c\u529b\u5de8\u5927\u4f46\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u5168\u9762\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86IS\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\uff08ATC\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cTransformer\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u65b0\u578bIS\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u7ec8\u65b9\u6848\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c1141%\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53471.67\u500d\uff08\u6700\u9ad82.46\u500d\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u4f8b\u9009\u62e9\u6280\u672f\u5728NLP\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Experimental results show that, with only $12%$ forget set and\n$8%$ synthesized boundary data, RULE outperforms existing baselines by up to\n$17.5%$ forget quality and $16.3%$ naturalness response while maintaining\ngeneral utility, achieving forget--retain Pareto optimality.

Significant attention has focused on using reward\nmodels as a means for fine-tuning generative models. However, the reward models\nthemselves -- which directly encode human value judgments by turning\nprompt-response pairs into scalar rewards -- remain relatively understudied. We\npresent a novel approach to reward model interpretability through exhaustive\nanalysis of their responses across their entire vocabulary space. By examining\nhow different reward models score every possible single-token response to\nvalue-laden prompts, we uncover several striking findings: (i) substantial\nheterogeneity between models trained on similar objectives, (ii) systematic\nasymmetries in how models encode high- vs low-scoring tokens, (iii) significant\nsensitivity to prompt framing that mirrors human cognitive biases, and (iv)\novervaluation of more frequent tokens. We demonstrate these effects across ten\nrecent open-source reward models of varying parameter counts and architectures.\nOur results challenge assumptions about the interchangeability of reward\nmodels, as well as their suitability as proxies of complex and\ncontext-dependent human values.

In essence, the problem is that\ncertain forms of sentences like \"Some Italians come from a warm country,\" when\nconjoined as in \"(Only) Some Italians come from a warm country and are blond,\"\nsound infelicitous, even though no obvious alternative triggers a conflicting\nscalar implicature. In this paper, we offer a conceptual analysis of Magri's\nfirst puzzle by situating it within its original theoretical framework. We\nargue that the oddness arises from the collective or concurrent reading of the\nconjunctive predicate: in examples such as \"(Only) Some Italians come from a\nwarm country and are blond,\" this interpretation generates an indirect\ncontextual contradiction. Moreover, we suggest that the pragmatic mechanisms\ngoverning scalar implicature generation extend beyond what is captured by\nexhaustification-based grammatical licensing accounts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86Magri\uff082016\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u8c1c\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u3001\u96c6\u4f53/\u5e76\u53d1\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u66f4\u65b0\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u4e92\u52a8\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u67d0\u4e9b\u53e5\u5b50\u5728\u8fde\u8bcd\u65f6\u7684\u4e0d\u81ea\u7136\u6e90\u4e8e\u95f4\u63a5\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u77db\u76fe\u3002", "motivation": "Magri\uff082016\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u4e8e\u8fde\u8bcd\u7684\u8c1c\u9898\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u5df2\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u4f46\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ecd\u672a\u89e3\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u8c1c\u9898\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u5ff5\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c06Magri\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u8c1c\u9898\u7f6e\u4e8e\u5176\u539f\u59cb\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u8fde\u8bcd\u53e5\u5b50\u7684\u4e0d\u81ea\u7136\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u6210\u56e0\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u8fde\u8bcd\u53e5\u5b50\u7684\u4e0d\u81ea\u7136\u6027\u6e90\u4e8e\u96c6\u4f53\u6216\u5e76\u53d1\u89e3\u91ca\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u95f4\u63a5\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u6807\u91cf\u542b\u4e49\u7684\u8bed\u7528\u673a\u5236\u8d85\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a77\u5c3d\u5316\u7684\u8bed\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5bf9\u6807\u91cf\u542b\u4e49\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8fde\u8bcd\u53e5\u5b50\u4e2d\u9690\u85cf\u7684\u8bed\u7528\u77db\u76fe\u3002"}}

Unlike traditional computer vision models that rely on\ndomain-specific training and extensive datasets, modern LLMs can interpret and\ndescribe complex visual scenes using simple natural language prompts. However,\ndespite growing interest in their applications, there has been limited\ninvestigation into how different LLMs perform in safety-critical visual tasks\nwithin the construction domain. To address this gap, this study conducts a\ncomparative evaluation of five state-of-the-art LLMs: Claude-3 Opus, GPT-4.5,\nGPT-4o, GPT-o3, and Gemini 2.0 Pro, to assess their ability to identify\npotential hazards from real-world construction images. Each model was tested\nunder three prompting strategies: zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought\n(CoT). Zero-shot prompting involved minimal instruction, few-shot incorporated\nbasic safety context and a hazard source mnemonic, and CoT provided\nstep-by-step reasoning examples to scaffold model thinking. Quantitative\nanalysis was performed using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics across all\nconditions. Results reveal that prompting strategy significantly influenced\nperformance, with CoT prompting consistently producing higher accuracy across\nmodels. Additionally, LLM performance varied under different conditions, with\nGPT-4.5 and GPT-o3 outperforming others in most settings. The findings also\ndemonstrate the critical role of prompt design in enhancing the accuracy and\nconsistency of multimodal LLMs for construction safety applications.

Despite recent progress in SLG, existing\nmethods still often suffer from incorrect lexical ordering and low semantic\naccuracy. This is primarily due to sentence-level condition, which encodes the\nentire sentence of the input text into a single feature vector as a condition\nfor SLG. This approach fails to capture the temporal structure of sign language\nand lacks the granularity of word-level semantics, often leading to disordered\nsign sequences and ambiguous motions. To overcome these limitations, we propose\nGLOS, a sign language generation framework with temporally aligned gloss-level\nconditioning. First, we employ gloss-level conditions, which we define as\nsequences of gloss embeddings temporally aligned with the motion sequence. This\nenables the model to access both the temporal structure of sign language and\nword-level semantics at each timestep.

Existing approaches, such as quantization, have demonstrated\npromising results in reducing memory usage. However, current quantization\nmethods cannot take both effectiveness and efficiency into account. In this\npaper, we propose MoQAE, a novel mixed-precision quantization method via\nmixture of quantization-aware experts. First, we view different quantization\nbit-width configurations as experts and use the traditional mixture of experts\n(MoE) method to select the optimal configuration. To avoid the inefficiency\ncaused by inputting tokens one by one into the router in the traditional MoE\nmethod, we input the tokens into the router chunk by chunk.

Notably, SPTI\nrequires no model training, only inference with off the shelf models. Given a\nprivate dataset, SPTI produces synthetic images of substantially higher quality\nthan prior DP approaches. On the LSUN Bedroom dataset, SPTI attains an FID less\nthan or equal to 26.71 under epsilon equal to 1.0, improving over Private\nEvolution FID of 40.36. Similarly, on MM CelebA HQ, SPTI achieves an FID less\nthan or equal to 33.27 at epsilon equal to 1.0, compared to 57.01 from DP fine\ntuning baselines.

However,\nexisting H&E-to-IHC studies often overlook the cross-channel correlations\nbetween cell nuclei and cell membranes. To address this issue, we propose a\nnovel Cross-Channel Perception Learning (CCPL) strategy. Specifically, CCPL\nfirst decomposes HER2 immunohistochemical staining into Hematoxylin and DAB\nstaining channels, corresponding to cell nuclei and cell membranes,\nrespectively. Using the pathology foundation model Gigapath's Tile Encoder,\nCCPL extracts dual-channel features from both the generated and real images and\nmeasures cross-channel correlations between nuclei and membranes. The features\nof the generated and real stained images, obtained through the Tile Encoder,\nare also used to calculate feature distillation loss, enhancing the model's\nfeature extraction capabilities without increasing the inference burden.\nAdditionally, CCPL performs statistical analysis on the focal optical density\nmaps of both single channels to ensure consistency in staining distribution and\nintensity. Experimental results, based on quantitative metrics such as PSNR,\nSSIM, PCC, and FID, along with professional evaluations from pathologists,\ndemonstrate that CCPL effectively preserves pathological features, generates\nhigh-quality virtual stained images, and provides robust support for automated\npathological diagnosis using multimedia medical data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8de8\u901a\u9053\u611f\u77e5\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff08CCPL\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3H&E-to-IHC\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u7ec6\u80de\u6838\u4e0e\u7ec6\u80de\u819c\u8de8\u901a\u9053\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u901a\u9053\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u865a\u62df\u67d3\u8272\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709H&E-to-IHC\u7814\u7a76\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u7ec6\u80de\u6838\u4e0e\u7ec6\u80de\u819c\u7684\u8de8\u901a\u9053\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u75c5\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "CCPL\u5c06HER2\u514d\u75ab\u7ec4\u5316\u67d3\u8272\u5206\u89e3\u4e3aHematoxylin\u548cDAB\u67d3\u8272\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u5229\u7528Gigapath\u7684Tile Encoder\u63d0\u53d6\u53cc\u901a\u9053\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8de8\u901a\u9053\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u84b8\u998f\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u67d3\u8272\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCCPL\u5728PSNR\u3001SSIM\u3001PCC\u548cFID\u7b49\u5b9a\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u5bb6\u8bc4\u4ef7\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5176\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u7559\u75c5\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u865a\u62df\u67d3\u8272\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "conclusion": "CCPL\u4e3a\u591a\u5a92\u4f53\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u75c5\u7406\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u7684\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Our approach\ngenerates domain-specific keywords and related word lists using TF and Term\nTF-IDF methods and constructs prompt-target pairs. We evaluate models by\nmeasuring their ability to complete these prompts with the correct\ndomain-specific targets, providing a direct assessment of domain knowledge with\nlow computational cost. Through comprehensive experiments across multiple\nmodels (GPT-2 medium/XL, Llama-2/3.1, OLMo-2, Qwen-2, Mistral) and domains, we\ndemonstrate that our benchmark strongly correlates with expert-generated\nbenchmarks while providing a more accurate measure of domain knowledge than\ntraditional perplexity metrics. We reveal that domain adaptation happens\nrapidly in smaller models (within 500 steps) and illustrate a new approach to\ndomain knowledge evaluation in base models during training for early stopping.\nBy extending mechanistic analysis to domain adaptation, we discover that\ninitial-to-mid layers are primarily responsible for attribute extraction, while\nlater layers focus on next token prediction. Furthermore, we show that during\nadaptation, forgetting begins in the middle layers, where attribute extraction\nhappens and is amplified in later layers. Our work provides both a practical\nevaluation methodology for domain-specific LMs and novel insights into\nknowledge representation during adaptation, with implications for more\nefficient fine-tuning strategies and targeted approaches to mitigate\ncatastrophic forgetting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u9886\u57df\u8bed\u6599\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5b8c\u6210\u578b\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8bc4\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u521b\u5efa\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528TF\u548cTerm TF-IDF\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u9886\u57df\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u548c\u63d0\u793a-\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5b8c\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e14\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\uff1b\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

Through extensive experiments on the\nQwen2.5, LLaMA3 and Gemma3 families, we demonstrate that this degradation is\nwidespread across SLMs. In some settings, models trained on only 8k long CoT\nexamples lose up to 75% of their original performance before fine-tuning.\nStrikingly, we further observe that for some particularly small models, even\ntraining on 220k long CoT examples fails to recover or surpass their original\nperformance prior to fine-tuning.

Towards this goal, we introduce Rank-one Concept Redirection (ROCR),\na novel training-free method, as a promising solution path. ROCR performs\nunlearning by targeting the invariants in downstream tasks, specifically the\nactivated dangerous concepts. It is capable of modifying model parameters\nwithin seconds to redirect the model's perception of a specific unlearning\ntarget concept to another harmless concept. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat ROCR significantly improves unlearning effectiveness compared to\ntraditional methods while generating highly natural outputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86LLM\uff08\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u9057\u5fd8\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u4f9d\u8d56\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6ORT\u548c\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5ROCR\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u4e8e\u5176\u6548\u679c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u8fbe\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faORT\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165ROCR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u5371\u9669\u6982\u5ff5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f62\u5f0f\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cROCR\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u7136\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u9057\u5fd8\u5e94\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f62\u5f0f\u65e0\u5173\u6027\uff0cROCR\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

A key source of inefficiency stems from the\nVLM's need to process dense and redundant visual information. Visual inputs\ncontain significant regions irrelevant to text semantics, rendering the\nassociated computations ineffective for inference. This paper introduces a\nnovel Event-Priori-Based Vision-Language Model, termed EP-VLM. Its core\ncontribution is a novel mechanism leveraging motion priors derived from dynamic\nevent vision to enhance VLM efficiency. Inspired by human visual cognition,\nEP-VLM first employs event data to guide the patch-wise sparsification of RGB\nvisual inputs, progressively concentrating VLM computation on salient regions\nof the visual input. Subsequently, we construct a position-preserving\ntokenization strategy for the visual encoder within the VLM architecture. This\nstrategy processes the event-guided, unstructured, sparse visual input while\naccurately preserving positional understanding within the visual input.\nExperimental results demonstrate that EP-VLM achieves significant efficiency\nimprovements while maintaining nearly lossless accuracy compared to baseline\nmodels from the Qwen2-VL series. For instance, against the original\nQwen2-VL-2B, EP-VLM achieves 50% FLOPs savings while retaining 98% of the\noriginal accuracy on the RealWorldQA dataset.

The framework's core innovation is the\nintroduction of three synergistic modules: the Hierarchical Edge Module (HEM),\nwhich explicitly extracts a multi-scale pyramid of edge features that\ncorresponds to the semantic hierarchy at early network stages; the Synergistic\nEdge Fusion (SEF) module, for deeply fusing these edge priors with semantic\ninformation at each respective scale; and the Cross Stage Partial Omni-Kernel\nModule (CSPOKM), which maximally refines the most detail-rich feature layers\nusing an Omni-Kernel operator - comprising anisotropic large-kernel\nconvolutions and mixed-domain attention - all within a computationally\nefficient Cross-Stage Partial (CSP) framework. On a large-scale dataset\ncomprising 120 pollen classes, HieraEdgeNet achieves a mean Average Precision\n(mAP@.5) of 0.9501, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baseline\nmodels such as YOLOv12n and RT-DETR.

However, their ability to attend to truly critical\ninformation during long-context reasoning and generation still falls behind the\npace. Specifically, our preliminary experiments reveal that certain distracting\npatterns can misdirect the model's attention during inference, and removing\nthese patterns substantially improves reasoning accuracy and generation\nquality. We attribute this phenomenon to spurious correlations in the training\ndata, which obstruct the model's capacity to infer authentic causal\ninstruction-response relationships. This phenomenon may induce redundant\nreasoning processes, potentially resulting in significant inference overhead\nand, more critically, the generation of erroneous or suboptimal responses. To\nmitigate this, we introduce a two-stage framework called Learning to Focus\n(LeaF) leveraging intervention-based inference to disentangle confounding\nfactors. In the first stage, LeaF employs gradient-based comparisons with an\nadvanced teacher to automatically identify confounding tokens based on causal\nrelationships in the training corpus. Then, in the second stage, it prunes\nthese tokens during distillation to enact intervention, aligning the student's\nattention with the teacher's focus distribution on truly critical context\ntokens.

However, existing methods\nfail to model complicated motion patterns for video editing, and are\nfundamentally limited to object replacement, where tasks with non-rigid object\nmotions like multi-object and portrait editing are largely neglected.

A prevalent solution is a dual-system\narchitecture, employing a small model for rapid, reactive decisions and a\nlarger model for slower but more informative analyses. Existing dual-system\ndesigns often implement parallel architectures where inference is either\ndirectly conducted using the large model at each current frame or retrieved\nfrom previously stored inference results. However, these works still struggle\nto enable large models for a timely response to every online frame. Our key\ninsight is to shift intensive computations of the current frame to previous\ntime steps and perform a batch inference of multiple time steps to make large\nmodels respond promptly to each time step. To achieve the shifting, we\nintroduce Efficiency through Thinking Ahead (ETA), an asynchronous system\ndesigned to: (1) propagate informative features from the past to the current\nframe using future predictions from the large model, (2) extract current frame\nfeatures using a small model for real-time responsiveness, and (3) integrate\nthese dual features via an action mask mechanism that emphasizes\naction-critical image regions.

Therefore, we apply SNNs to monocular 3D object detection and propose\nthe SpikeSMOKE architecture in this paper, which is a new attempt for low-power\nmonocular 3D object detection.

Furthermore, to ensure precise asset\nextraction that aligns well with the image prompts, we employ a pre-trained\nreward model to fulfill a closed-loop with feedback. We design the reward model\nto perform an inverse task that pastes the extracted assets back into the\nreference sources, which assists training with additional consistency and\nmitigates hallucination. Extensive experiments show that, with the aid of\nreward-driven optimization, AssetDropper achieves the state-of-the-art results\nin asset extraction.

Inspired by recent development in LLMs for visual\nreasoning, this paper presents VLAgent, an AI system that can create a\nstep-by-step visual reasoning plan with an easy-to-understand script and\nexecute each step of the plan in real time by integrating planning script with\nexecution verifications via an automated process supported by VLAgent. In the\ntask planning phase, VLAgent fine-tunes an LLM through in-context learning to\ngenerate a step-by-step planner for each user-submitted text-visual reasoning\ntask. During the plan execution phase, VLAgent progressively refines the\ncomposition of neuro-symbolic executable modules to generate high-confidence\nreasoning results. VLAgent has three unique design characteristics: First, we\nimprove the quality of plan generation through in-context learning, improving\nlogic reasoning by reducing erroneous logic steps, incorrect programs, and LLM\nhallucinations. Second, we design a syntax-semantics parser to identify and\ncorrect additional logic errors of the LLM-generated planning script prior to\nlaunching the plan executor. Finally, we employ the ensemble method to improve\nthe generalization performance of our step-executor. Extensive experiments with\nfour visual reasoning benchmarks (GQA, MME, NLVR2, VQAv2) show that VLAgent\nachieves significant performance enhancement for multimodal text-visual\nreasoning applications, compared to the exiting representative VLMs and LLM\nbased visual composition approaches like ViperGPT and VisProg, thanks to the\nnovel optimization modules of VLAgent back-engine (SS-Parser, Plan Repairer,\nOutput Verifiers).

To address these issues, we propose a novel Uncertainty-Guided\nand Top-k Codebook Matching SR (UGTSR) framework, which incorporates three key\ncomponents: (1) an uncertainty learning mechanism that guides the model to\nfocus on texture-rich regions, (2) a Top-k feature matching strategy that\nenhances feature matching accuracy by fusing multiple candidate features, and\n(3) an Align-Attention module that enhances the alignment of information\nbetween LR and HR features. Experimental results demonstrate significant\nimprovements in texture realism and reconstruction fidelity compared to\nexisting methods.

Jointly considering the desire and technological\ncapability divides tasks in WORKBank into four zones: Automation \"Green Light\"\nZone, Automation \"Red Light\" Zone, R&D Opportunity Zone, Low Priority Zone.\nThis highlights critical mismatches and opportunities for AI agent development.\nMoving beyond a simple automate-or-not dichotomy, our results reveal diverse\nHAS profiles across occupations, reflecting heterogeneous expectations for\nhuman involvement.

To overcome these\nchallenges, we propose M2Restore, a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based\nMamba-CNN fusion framework for efficient and robust all-in-one image\nrestoration. M2Restore introduces three key contributions: First, to boost the\nmodel's generalization across diverse degradation conditions, we exploit a\nCLIP-guided MoE gating mechanism that fuses task-conditioned prompts with\nCLIP-derived semantic priors. This mechanism is further refined via cross-modal\nfeature calibration, which enables precise expert selection for various\ndegradation types. Second, to jointly capture global contextual dependencies\nand fine-grained local details, we design a dual-stream architecture that\nintegrates the localized representational strength of CNNs with the long-range\nmodeling efficiency of Mamba. This integration enables collaborative\noptimization of global semantic relationships and local structural fidelity,\npreserving global coherence while enhancing detail restoration. Third, we\nintroduce an edge-aware dynamic gating mechanism that adaptively balances\nglobal modeling and local enhancement by reallocating computational attention\nto degradation-sensitive regions.

These capabilities enable\nsystems to better interpret the camera wearer's actions, intentions, and\nsurrounding environment. However, building large-scale egocentric multimodal\nand multitask models presents unique challenges. Egocentric data are inherently\nheterogeneous, with large variations in modality coverage across devices and\nsettings. Generating pseudo-labels for missing modalities, such as gaze or\nhead-mounted camera trajectories, is often infeasible, making standard\nsupervised learning approaches difficult to scale. Furthermore, dynamic camera\nmotion and the complex temporal and spatial structure of first-person video\npose additional challenges for the direct application of existing multimodal\nfoundation models.\n  To address these challenges, we introduce a set of efficient temporal\ntokenizers and propose EgoM2P, a masked modeling framework that learns from\ntemporally aware multimodal tokens to train a large, general-purpose model for\negocentric 4D understanding. This unified design supports multitasking across\ndiverse egocentric perception and synthesis tasks, including gaze prediction,\negocentric camera tracking, and monocular depth estimation from egocentric\nvideo. EgoM2P also serves as a generative model for conditional egocentric\nvideo synthesis. Across these tasks, EgoM2P matches or outperforms specialist\nmodels while being an order of magnitude faster.

Based on these observations, we introduce SHE (Sequence\nHallucination Eradication), a lightweight, two-stage framework that (1) detects\nhallucinations via visual-textual alignment check using our proposed adaptive\ntemporal window and (2) mitigates them via orthogonal projection onto the joint\nembedding space. We also propose a new metric (BEACH) to quantify behavioral\nhallucination severity.

To address these limitations, we propose a novel\nframework inspired by cybernetic principles, redesigning video MLLMs as\nadaptive systems capable of self-monitoring, self-correction, and dynamic\nresource allocation during inference. Our approach, CyberV, introduces a\ncybernetic loop consisting of an MLLM Inference System, a Sensor, and a\nController. Specifically, the sensor monitors forward processes of the MLLM and\ncollects intermediate interpretations, such as attention drift, then the\ncontroller determines when and how to trigger self-correction and generate\nfeedback to guide the next round.

This sequential approach creates\na mismatch -- attackers overfit to obsolete defenses, while defenders\nperpetually lag behind emerging threats. To address this, we propose\nSelf-RedTeam, an online self-play reinforcement learning algorithm where an\nattacker and defender agent co-evolve through continuous interaction. We cast\nsafety alignment as a two-player zero-sum game, where a single model alternates\nbetween attacker and defender roles -- generating adversarial prompts and\nsafeguarding against them -- while a reward LM adjudicates outcomes. This\nenables dynamic co-adaptation. Grounded in the game-theoretic framework of\nzero-sum games, we establish a theoretical safety guarantee which motivates the\ndesign of our method: if self-play converges to a Nash Equilibrium, the\ndefender will reliably produce safe responses to any adversarial input.\nEmpirically, Self-RedTeam uncovers more diverse attacks (+21.8% SBERT) compared\nto attackers trained against static defenders and achieves higher robustness on\nsafety benchmarks (e.g., +65.5% on WildJailBreak) than defenders trained\nagainst static attackers. We further propose hidden Chain-of-Thought, allowing\nagents to plan privately, which boosts adversarial diversity and reduces\nover-refusals.

As such, many algorithms\nhave been proposed to automatically produce neuron explanations, but it is\noften not clear how reliable these explanations are, or which methods produce\nthe best explanations. This can be measured via crowd-sourced evaluations, but\nthey can often be noisy and expensive, leading to unreliable results. In this\npaper, we carefully analyze the evaluation pipeline and develop a\ncost-effective and highly accurate crowdsourced evaluation strategy. In\ncontrast to previous human studies that only rate whether the explanation\nmatches the most highly activating inputs, we estimate whether the explanation\ndescribes neuron activations across all inputs.

Estimating\n6D poses from partial references, which capture only fragments of an object's\nappearance and geometry, remains challenging. To address this, we propose\nUA-Pose, an uncertainty-aware approach for 6D object pose estimation and online\nobject completion specifically designed for partial references. We assume\naccess to either (1) a limited set of RGBD images with known poses or (2) a\nsingle 2D image. For the first case, we initialize a partial object 3D model\nbased on the provided images and poses, while for the second, we use\nimage-to-3D techniques to generate an initial object 3D model. Our method\nintegrates uncertainty into the incomplete 3D model, distinguishing between\nseen and unseen regions. This uncertainty enables confidence assessment in pose\nestimation and guides an uncertainty-aware sampling strategy for online object\ncompletion, enhancing robustness in pose estimation accuracy and improving\nobject completeness. We evaluate our method on the YCB-Video, YCBInEOAT, and\nHO3D datasets, including RGBD sequences of YCB objects manipulated by robots\nand human hands.

Take the phrase \"ribonucleic\nacid\" as an example: an LLM will first decompose it into tokens, i.e.,\nartificial text fragments (\"rib\", \"on\", ...), then learn each token\nsequentially, rather than grasping the phrase as a unified, coherent semantic\nentity. This fragmented representation hinders deeper conceptual understanding\nand, ultimately, the development of truly intelligent systems. In response, we\nintroduce Concept-Aware Fine-Tuning (CAFT), a novel multi-token training method\nthat redefines how LLMs are fine-tuned. By enabling the learning of sequences\nthat span multiple tokens, this method fosters stronger concept-aware learning.\nOur experiments demonstrate significant improvements compared to conventional\nnext-token finetuning methods across diverse tasks, including traditional\napplications like text summarization and domain-specific ones like de novo\nprotein design.

Unlike\ntraditional applications where LLMs are limited to single role, LUCIFER\nintegrates them in two synergistic roles: as context extractors, structuring\nverbal stakeholder input into domain-aware representations that influence\ndecision-making through an attention space mechanism aligning LLM-derived\ninsights with the agent's learning process, and as zero-shot exploration\nfacilitators guiding the agent's action selection process during exploration.\nWe benchmark various LLMs in both roles and demonstrate that LUCIFER improves\nexploration efficiency and decision quality, outperforming flat,\ngoal-conditioned policies.

Unlike prior methods that denoise\nfuture frames based on ground-truth context frames, Self Forcing conditions\neach frame's generation on previously self-generated outputs by performing\nautoregressive rollout with key-value (KV) caching during training. This\nstrategy enables supervision through a holistic loss at the video level that\ndirectly evaluates the quality of the entire generated sequence, rather than\nrelying solely on traditional frame-wise objectives. To ensure training\nefficiency, we employ a few-step diffusion model along with a stochastic\ngradient truncation strategy, effectively balancing computational cost and\nperformance.

Although deep learning and\ndiffusion-based methods have shown promising results, they often lack physical\ninterpretability or suffer from high computational costs due to iterative\nsampling starting from random noise. Recent advances in generative modeling,\nparticularly Poisson Flow Generative Models (PFGM), enable high-fidelity image\nsynthesis by modeling the full data distribution. In this work, we propose\nResidual Poisson Flow (ResPF) Generative Models for efficient and accurate\nsparse-view CT reconstruction. Based on PFGM++, ResPF integrates conditional\nguidance from sparse measurements and employs a hijacking strategy to\nsignificantly reduce sampling cost by skipping redundant initial steps.\nHowever, skipping early stages can degrade reconstruction quality and introduce\nunrealistic structures. To address this, we embed a data-consistency into each\niteration, ensuring fidelity to sparse-view measurements. Yet, PFGM sampling\nrelies on a fixed ordinary differential equation (ODE) trajectory induced by\nelectrostatic fields, which can be disrupted by step-wise data consistency,\nresulting in unstable or degraded reconstructions. Inspired by ResNet, we\nintroduce a residual fusion module to linearly combine generative outputs with\ndata-consistent reconstructions, effectively preserving trajectory continuity.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of Poisson flow\nmodels to sparse-view CT.

NeurNCD also integrates several key\ncomponents, including feature query, feature modulation and clustering,\nfacilitating efficient feature augmentation and information exchange between\nthe pre-trained semantic segmentation network and implicit neural\nrepresentations. As a result, our framework achieves superior segmentation\nperformance in both open and closed-world settings without relying on densely\nlabelled datasets for supervised training or human interaction to generate\nsparse label supervision.

VOTE utilizes a consensus-based voting\nmechanism to improve the accuracy of object classification by integrating data\nfrom multiple CAVs. Both algorithms are designed at the edge to operate in\nreal-time, ensuring low-latency and reliable decision-making for CAVs. We\ndevelop a hardware-based controlled testbed consisting of camera-equipped\nrobotic CAVs and an edge server to evaluate the efficacy of our framework.

However, previous approaches remain disconnected from environment\nmapping, lack the spatial precision of geometric maps, or neglect additional\nmodality information beyond vision. To address this, we propose multimodal\nspatial language maps as a spatial map representation that fuses pretrained\nmultimodal features with a 3D reconstruction of the environment. We build these\nmaps autonomously using standard exploration. We present two instances of our\nmaps, which are visual-language maps (VLMaps) and their extension to\naudio-visual-language maps (AVLMaps) obtained by adding audio information. When\ncombined with large language models (LLMs), VLMaps can (i) translate natural\nlanguage commands into open-vocabulary spatial goals (e.g., \"in between the\nsofa and TV\") directly localized in the map, and (ii) be shared across\ndifferent robot embodiments to generate tailored obstacle maps on demand.\nBuilding upon the capabilities above, AVLMaps extend VLMaps by introducing a\nunified 3D spatial representation integrating audio, visual, and language cues\nthrough the fusion of features from pretrained multimodal foundation models.\nThis enables robots to ground multimodal goal queries (e.g., text, images, or\naudio snippets) to spatial locations for navigation. Additionally, the\nincorporation of diverse sensory inputs significantly enhances goal\ndisambiguation in ambiguous environments. Experiments in simulation and\nreal-world settings demonstrate that our multimodal spatial language maps\nenable zero-shot spatial and multimodal goal navigation and improve recall by\n50% in ambiguous scenarios.

While prior work has considered such asymmetric cost settings,\neffective algorithms for this scenario remain underdeveloped. In this paper, we\npropose a general framework for decision-based attacks under asymmetric query\ncosts, which we refer to as asymmetric black-box attacks. We modify two core\ncomponents of existing attacks: the search strategy and the gradient estimation\nprocess.

We design efficient algorithms that minimize total\nattack cost by balancing different query types, in contrast to earlier methods\nsuch as stealthy attacks that focus only on limiting expensive (high-cost)\nqueries. Our method can be integrated into a range of existing black-box\nattacks with minimal changes.

To develop a nuclei segmentation\nalgorithm, applicable to different types of target domain representations,\nimage-to-image translation networks can be considered as they are invariant to\ntarget domain image representations. One of the important issues with\nimage-to-image translation models is that they fail miserably when the\ninformation content between two image domains are asymmetric in nature. In this\nregard, the paper introduces a new deep generative model for segmenting nuclei\nstructures from histological images. The proposed model considers an embedding\nspace for handling information-disparity between information-rich histological\nimage space and information-poor segmentation map domain. Integrating\njudiciously the concepts of optimal transport and measure theory, the model\ndevelops an invertible generator, which provides an efficient optimization\nframework with lower network complexity. The concept of invertible generator\nautomatically eliminates the need of any explicit cycle-consistency loss. The\nproposed model also introduces a spatially-constrained squeeze operation within\nthe framework of invertible generator to maintain spatial continuity within the\nimage patches. The model provides a better trade-off between network complexity\nand model performance compared to other existing models having complex network\narchitectures.

In this respect, the paper proposes a novel deep\ngenerative model for simultaneously segmenting nuclei structures and\nnormalizing color appearance of stained histological images.This model\njudiciously integrates the merits of truncated normal distribution and spatial\nattention. The model assumes that the latent color appearance information,\ncorresponding to a particular histological image, is independent of respective\nnuclei segmentation map as well as embedding map information. The disentangled\nrepresentation makes the model generalizable and adaptable as the modification\nor loss in color appearance information cannot be able to affect the nuclei\nsegmentation map as well as embedding information. Also, for dealing with the\nstain overlap of associated histochemical reagents, the prior for latent color\nappearance code is assumed to be a mixture of truncated normal distributions.\nThe proposed model incorporates the concept of spatial attention for\nsegmentation of nuclei regions from histological images.

The primary challenge\narises from learning the distribution of indoor semantics, complicated by\nsparse, imbalanced object categories and diverse spatial scales. Existing\nmethods struggle to robustly generate unobserved areas in real time and do not\ngeneralize well to new environments. To this end, we propose \\textbf{MapBERT},\na novel framework designed to effectively model the distribution of unseen\nspaces. Motivated by the observation that the one-hot encoding of semantic maps\naligns naturally with the binary structure of bit encoding, we, for the first\ntime, leverage a lookup-free BitVAE to encode semantic maps into compact\nbitwise tokens.

To bridge this gap, we propose novel enhancements for\nmotion compression and temporal fusion for neural B-frame coding. First, we\ndesign a fine-grained motion compression method. This method incorporates an\ninteractive dual-branch motion auto-encoder with per-branch adaptive\nquantization steps, which enables fine-grained compression of bi-directional\nmotion vectors while accommodating their asymmetric bitrate allocation and\nreconstruction quality requirements. Furthermore, this method involves an\ninteractive motion entropy model that exploits correlations between\nbi-directional motion latent representations by interactively leveraging\npartitioned latent segments as directional priors. Second, we propose a\nselective temporal fusion method that predicts bi-directional fusion weights to\nachieve discriminative utilization of bi-directional multi-scale temporal\ncontexts with varying qualities. Additionally, this method introduces a\nhyperprior-based implicit alignment mechanism for contextual entropy modeling.\nBy treating the hyperprior as a surrogate for the contextual latent\nrepresentation, this mechanism implicitly mitigates the misalignment in the\nfused bi-directional temporal priors.
