Submitted to 'Logical and Symbolic Reasoning in Language Models @ AAAI 2026' conference and is under review", "summary": "Transformer-based language models display impressive reasoning-like behavior, yet remain brittle on tasks that require stable symbolic manipulation. This paper develops a unified perspective on these phenomena by interpreting self-attention and residual streams as implementing an approximate Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA). In this view, queries and keys define role spaces, values encode fillers, attention weights perform soft unbinding, and residual connections realize superposition of many bound structures. We use this algebraic lens to relate transformer internals to chain-of-thought traces, program-based reasoning, and memory-augmented tool use, and to explain characteristic failure modes such as variable confusion and inconsistency across logically related prompts. Building on this perspective, we propose VSA-inspired architectural biases, including explicit binding/unbinding heads and hyperdimensional memory layers, and training objectives that promote role-filler separation and robust superposition. Finally, we outline metrics for measuring \"VSA-likeness\" and logical compositionality, and pose theoretical and architectural open problems. Overall, the paper argues that viewing attention as soft vector-symbolic computation offers a principled route toward more interpretable and logically reliable reasoning systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06Transformer\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u6d41\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5411\u91cf\u7b26\u53f7\u67b6\u6784\uff08VSA\uff09\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "motivation": "Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7VSA\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u89e3\u91ca\u8fd9\u4e9b\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u6d41\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3aVSA\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u952e\u5b9a\u4e49\u89d2\u8272\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u503c\u7f16\u7801\u586b\u5145\u7b26\uff0c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6743\u91cd\u8fdb\u884c\u8f6f\u89e3\u7ed1\uff0c\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53e0\u52a0\u3002\u63d0\u51faVSA\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u79cdVSA\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u91caTransformer\u7684\u5185\u5728\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u3001\u7a0b\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bb0\u5fc6\u589e\u5f3a\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u91ca\u5178\u578b\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u89c6\u4e3a\u8f6f\u5411\u91cf\u7b26\u53f7\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u539f\u5219\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Prior research calls for adaptive risk-management solutions and decision-making strategies. To this end, artificial intelligence (AI), particularly agentic AI, offers a promising path forward. Agentic AI systems consist of autonomous, specialized agents capable of solving complex, dynamic tasks. While past systems have relied on single-agent models or have used multi-agent frameworks only for static functions, there is a growing need for architectures that support dynamic collaborative reasoning and context-aware outputs. To bridge this gap, we present AgroAskAI, a multi-agent reasoning system for climate adaptation decision support in agriculture, with a focus on vulnerable rural communities. AgroAskAI features a modular, role-specialized architecture that uses a chain-of-responsibility approach to coordinate autonomous agents, integrating real-time tools and datasets. The system has built-in governance mechanisms that mitigate hallucination and enable internal feedback for coherent, locally relevant strategies. The system also supports multilingual interactions, making it accessible to non-English-speaking farmers. Experiments on common agricultural queries related to climate adaptation show that, with additional tools and prompt refinement, AgroAskAI delivers more actionable, grounded, and inclusive outputs. Our experimental results highlight the potential of agentic AI for sustainable and accountable decision support in climate adaptation for agriculture.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

On this view, hallucination is a contingent behavioral artifact, remediable through improved benchmarks and reward structures. In this paper, we challenge that interpretation. Drawing on previous work on structural hallucination and empirical experiments using a Licensing Oracle, we argue that hallucination is not an optimization failure but an architectural inevitability of the transformer model.\n  Transformers do not represent the world; they model statistical associations among tokens. Their embedding spaces form a pseudo-ontology derived from linguistic co-occurrence rather than world-referential structure. At ontological boundary conditions - regions where training data is sparse or incoherent - the model necessarily interpolates fictional continuations in order to preserve coherence. No incentive mechanism can modify this structural dependence on pattern completion.\n  Our empirical results demonstrate that hallucination can only be eliminated through external truth-validation and abstention modules, not through changes to incentives, prompting, or fine-tuning. The Licensing Oracle achieves perfect abstention precision across domains precisely because it supplies grounding that the transformer lacks.\n  We conclude that hallucination is a structural property of generative architectures and that reliable AI requires hybrid systems that distinguish linguistic fluency from epistemic responsibility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6311\u6218\u4e86OpenAI\u5173\u4e8e\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5e7b\u89c9\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u9519\u8bef\u6fc0\u52b1\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5e7b\u89c9\u662fTransformer\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5fc5\u7136\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u8bc1\u660e\u5e7b\u89c9\u4e0d\u662f\u884c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u56fa\u6709\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6216\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63d2\u503c\u884c\u4e3a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5e7b\u89c9\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u5de5\u4f5c\u548c\u5229\u7528Licensing Oracle\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bba\u8bc1\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u6027\u672c\u8d28\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5916\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u5f03\u6743\u6a21\u5757\u5bf9\u6d88\u9664\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u90e8\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u5f03\u6743\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u624d\u80fd\u6d88\u9664\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u800c\u6539\u53d8\u6fc0\u52b1\u3001\u63d0\u793a\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\u5747\u65e0\u6548\u3002Licensing Oracle\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5f03\u6743\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e7b\u89c9\u662f\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u9760\u7684AI\u9700\u8981\u6df7\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u8bed\u8a00\u6d41\u5229\u6027\u548c\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8d23\u4efb\u3002"}}

In the domain of chess, this standard manifests as accuracy benchmarks against strong engines like Stockfish. However, high scalar accuracy does not necessarily imply robust conceptual understanding. This paper argues that standard accuracy metrics fail to distinguish between genuine geometric reasoning and the superficial memorization of canonical board states. To address this gap, we propose a Geometric Stability Framework, a novel evaluation methodology that rigorously tests model consistency under invariant transformations-including board rotation, mirror symmetry, color inversion, and format conversion. We applied this framework to a comparative analysis of six state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-5.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and Kimi K2 Turbo, utilizing a dataset of approximately 3,000 positions. Our results reveal a significant Accuracy-Stability Paradox. While models such as GPT-5.1 achieve near-optimal accuracy on standard positions, they exhibit catastrophic degradation under geometric perturbation, specifically in rotation tasks where error rates surge by over 600%. This disparity suggests a reliance on pattern matching over abstract spatial logic. Conversely, Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Kimi K2 Turbo demonstrate superior dual robustness, maintaining high consistency across all transformation axes. Furthermore, we analyze the trade-off between helpfulness and safety, identifying Gemini 2.5 Flash as the leader in illegal state rejection (96.0%).

Experiments demonstrate the generality of the adaptation strategy over architectures and modalities as well as the unique strength of the encoder-decoder architecture on long context modeling.

In this paper, we improve this pipeline by i) fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for viewpoint classification and ii) enriching claim representations with semantic descriptions of relevant actors drawn from Wikidata.

However, existing LLM reasoning strategies mainly rely on the LLM itself with fast or slow mode (like o1 thinking) and thus struggle to balance reasoning efficiency and accuracy across queries of varying difficulties. In this paper, we propose Cognitive-Inspired Elastic Reasoning (CogER), a framework inspired by human hierarchical reasoning that dynamically selects the most suitable reasoning strategy for each query. Specifically, CogER first assesses the complexity of incoming queries and assigns them to one of several predefined levels, each corresponding to a tailored processing strategy, thereby addressing the challenge of unobservable query difficulty. To achieve automatic strategy selection, we model the process as a Markov Decision Process and train a CogER-Agent using reinforcement learning.

While sparse and linearized attention mechanisms attempt to mitigate this, they often compromise the representation of global dependencies or fail to capture multiscale semantic granularity effectively. In this paper, we propose Multiscale Aggregated Hierarchical Attention (MAHA), a novel architectural framework that reformulates the attention mechanism through hierarchical decomposition and mathematically rigorous aggregation. Unlike conventional approaches that treat token interactions at a single resolution, MAHA dynamically partitions the input sequence into hierarchical scales via learnable downsampling operators. The core innovation lies in its aggregation strategy: we model the fusion of scalespecific attention matrices as a resource allocation problem, solved via a convex optimization framework or a Nash equilibriumbased gametheoretic approach. This ensures a theoretically optimal balance between local nuance and global context fidelity. Implemented within a hybrid dilatedconvolutional transformer backbone, MAHA utilizes differentiable optimization layers to enable endtoend training. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that MAHA achieves superior scalability; empirical FLOPs analysis confirms an 81% reduction in computational cost at a sequence length of 4096 compared to standard attention.

Relaxed Decision Diagrams (DDs) provide a versatile mechanism for deriving such dual bounds by compactly over-approximating the solution space through node merging. However, the quality of these relaxed diagrams, i.e. the tightness of the resulting dual bounds, depends critically on the variable ordering and the merging decisions executed during compilation. While dynamic variable ordering heuristics effectively tighten bounds, they often incur computational overhead when evaluated globally across the entire variable set. To mitigate this trade-off, this work introduces a novel clustering-based framework for variable ordering. Instead of applying dynamic ordering heuristics to the full set of unfixed variables, we first partition variables into clusters. We then leverage this structural decomposition to guide the ordering process, significantly reducing the heuristic's search space. Within this framework, we investigate two distinct strategies: Cluster-to-Cluster, which processes clusters sequentially using problem-specific aggregate criteria (such as cumulative vertex weights in the Maximum Weighted Independent Set Problem (MWISP)), and Pick-and-Sort, which iteratively selects and sorts representative variables from each cluster to balance local diversity with heuristic guidance. Later on, developing some theoretical results on the growth of the size of DDs for MWISP we propose two different policies for setting the number of clusters within the proposed framework. We embed these strategies into a DD-based branch-and-bound algorithm and evaluate them on the MWISP. Across benchmark instances, the proposed methodology consistently reduces computational costs compared to standard dynamic variable ordering baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u6392\u5e8f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u79bb\u6563\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u677e\u5f1b\u51b3\u7b56\u56fe\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u677e\u5f1b\u51b3\u7b56\u56fe\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f3a\u5bf9\u5076\u754c\uff0c\u4f46\u53d8\u91cf\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u5408\u5e76\u51b3\u7b56\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u6392\u5e8f\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u805a\u7c7b\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u6392\u5e8f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ecCluster-to-Cluster\u548cPick-and-Sort\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e24\u9879\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u8bbe\u7f6e\u805a\u7c7b\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6700\u5927\u6743\u91cd\u72ec\u7acb\u96c6\u95ee\u9898\uff08MWISP\uff09\u57fa\u51c6\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u91cf\u6392\u5e8f\u57fa\u7ebf\u6301\u7eed\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u805a\u7c7b\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u6392\u5e8f\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u5076\u754c\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002"}}

As the prevalence of students utilizing AI for assignments increases, concerns regarding academic integrity and the validity of assessments are growing. This study utilizes the Earth Science I section of the 2025 Korean College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT) to deeply analyze the multimodal scientific reasoning capabilities and cognitive limitations of state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. Three experimental conditions (full-page input, individual item input, and optimized multimodal input) were designed to evaluate model performance across different data structures. Quantitative results indicated that unstructured inputs led to significant performance degradation due to segmentation and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) failures. Even under optimized conditions, models exhibited fundamental reasoning flaws. Qualitative analysis revealed that \"Perception Errors\" were dominant, highlighting a \"Perception-Cognition Gap\" where models failed to interpret symbolic meanings in schematic diagrams despite recognizing visual data. Furthermore, models demonstrated a \"Calculation-Conceptualization Discrepancy,\" successfully performing calculations while failing to apply the underlying scientific concepts, and \"Process Hallucination,\" where models skipped visual verification in favor of plausible but unfounded background knowledge. Addressing the challenge of unauthorized AI use in coursework, this study provides actionable cues for designing \"AI-resistant questions\" that target these specific cognitive vulnerabilities. By exploiting AI's weaknesses, such as the gap between perception and cognition, educators can distinguish genuine student competency from AI-generated responses, thereby ensuring assessment fairness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5728\u97e9\u56fd\u9ad8\u8003\u5730\u7403\u79d1\u5b66\u8bd5\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0AI\u5728\u5904\u7406\u65e0\u7ed3\u6784\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u611f\u77e5-\u8ba4\u77e5\u5dee\u8ddd\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6297AI\u4f5c\u5f0a\u8bd5\u9898\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5b66\u751f\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u4f7f\u7528AI\u5b8c\u6210\u4f5c\u4e1a\uff0c\u5b66\u672f\u8bda\u4fe1\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6709\u6548\u6027\u53d7\u5230\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f53\u524dAI\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u4ee52025\u5e74\u97e9\u56fd\u9ad8\u8003\u5730\u7403\u79d1\u5b66I\u90e8\u5206\u4e3a\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5GPT-4o\u3001Gemini 2.5 Flash\u548cGemini 2.5 Pro\u4e09\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5168\u9875\u8f93\u5165\u3001\u5355\u9879\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u4e09\u79cd\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9a\u91cf\u4e0e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u65e0\u7ed3\u6784\u8f93\u5165\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u5206\u5272\u548cOCR\u9519\u8bef\uff1b\u5373\u4f7f\u4f18\u5316\u540e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u9519\u8bef\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97-\u6982\u5ff5\u8131\u8282\u548c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e7b\u89c9\u7b49\u6839\u672c\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u2018\u611f\u77e5-\u8ba4\u77e5\u5dee\u8ddd\u2019\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u8ba4\u77e5\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u6559\u80b2\u8005\u53ef\u636e\u6b64\u8bbe\u8ba1\u2018\u6297AI\u95ee\u9898\u2019\uff0c\u5229\u7528AI\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u8ba4\u77e5\u8131\u8282\u7b49\u5f31\u70b9\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u771f\u5b9e\u5b66\u751f\u80fd\u529b\u4e0eAI\u751f\u6210\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u4fdd\u969c\u8bc4\u4f30\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002"}}

We propose SGM, a white-box neuron-level multimodal intervention that acts like safety glasses for toxic neurons: it selectively recalibrates a small set of toxic expert neurons via expertise-weighted soft suppression, neutralizing harmful cross-modal activations without any parameter updates.

In this work, we propose subgroup-specific step-wise confidence-weighted pseudo-label estimation (SCOPE), a framework integrating model confidence and dynamic subgroup partitioning to address these issues. Specifically, SCOPE integrates the proposed step-wise confidence into pseudo label deduction, prioritizing high-quality reasoning paths over simple frequency count. Furthermore, it dynamically partitions the candidate outputs pool into independent subgroups by balancing reasoning quality against exploration diversity. By deriving local consensus via repeat sampling for each sub group, SCOPE provides diverse supervision targets to encourage broader exploration.

We introduce a scenario-grounded benchmark that evaluates LLMs across biology, chemistry, materials, and physics, where domain experts define research projects of genuine interest and decompose them into modular research scenarios from which vetted questions are sampled. The framework assesses models at two levels: (i) question-level accuracy on scenario-tied items and (ii) project-level performance, where models must propose testable hypotheses, design simulations or experiments, and interpret results. Applying this two-phase scientific discovery evaluation (SDE) framework to state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a consistent performance gap relative to general science benchmarks, diminishing return of scaling up model sizes and reasoning, and systematic weaknesses shared across top-tier models from different providers. Large performance variation in research scenarios leads to changing choices of the best performing model on scientific discovery projects evaluated, suggesting all current LLMs are distant to general scientific \"superintelligence\". Nevertheless, LLMs already demonstrate promise in a great variety of scientific discovery projects, including cases where constituent scenario scores are low, highlighting the role of guided exploration and serendipity in discovery. This SDE framework offers a reproducible benchmark for discovery-relevant evaluation of LLMs and charts practical paths to advance their development toward scientific discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u9762\u5411\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6SDE\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u573a\u666f\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5982\u8fed\u4ee3\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u5047\u8bbe\u751f\u6210\u548c\u89c2\u5bdf\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8861\u91cfLLMs\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86SDE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u3001\u5316\u5b66\u3001\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u7269\u7406\u5b66\uff0c\u7531\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u5b9a\u4e49\u771f\u5b9e\u7814\u7a76\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4ece\u4e2d\u62bd\u6837\u5ba1\u6838\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4ece\u95ee\u9898\u5c42\u9762\u548c\u9879\u76ee\u5c42\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5e94\u7528SDE\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u660e\u663e\u4f4e\u4e8e\u4e00\u822c\u79d1\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6536\u76ca\u9012\u51cf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7814\u7a76\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u5df2\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6709\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u5076\u7136\u6027\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u9762\u3002SDE\u6846\u67b6\u4e3aLLMs\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u590d\u5236\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

While the value alignment literature has developed techniques for shaping AI values, less attention has been paid to how to determine, under uncertainty, when imperfect alignment is good enough to justify delegation. We argue that rational delegation requires balancing an agent's value (mis)alignment with its epistemic accuracy and its reach (the acts it has available). This paper introduces a formal, decision-theoretic framework to analyze this tradeoff precisely accounting for a principal's uncertainty about these factors. Our analysis reveals a sharp distinction between two delegation scenarios. First, universal delegation (trusting an agent with any problem) demands near-perfect value alignment and total epistemic trust, conditions rarely met in practice. Second, we show that context-specific delegation can be optimal even with significant misalignment. An agent's superior accuracy or expanded reach may grant access to better overall decision problems, making delegation rational in expectation. We develop a novel scoring framework to quantify this ex ante decision. Ultimately, our work provides a principled method for determining when an AI is aligned enough for a given context, shifting the focus from achieving perfect alignment to managing the risks and rewards of delegation under uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While existing methods like KG-CoT improve reliability by integrating knowledge graph (KG) paths, they suffer from rigid hop-count selection (solely question-driven) and underutilization of reasoning paths (lack of guidance). To address this, we propose RFKG-CoT: First, it replaces the rigid hop-count selector with a relation-driven adaptive hop-count selector that dynamically adjusts reasoning steps by activating KG relations (e.g., 1-hop for direct \"brother\" relations, 2-hop for indirect \"father-son\" chains), formalized via a relation mask. Second, it introduces a few-shot in-context learning path guidance mechanism with CoT (think) that constructs examples in a \"question-paths-answer\" format to enhance LLMs' ability to understand reasoning paths. Experiments on four KGQA benchmarks show RFKG-CoT improves accuracy by up to 14.7 pp (Llama2-7B on WebQSP) over KG-CoT. Ablations confirm the hop-count selector and the path prompt are complementary, jointly transforming KG evidence into more faithful answers.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The former lacks immediate feedback, while the latter increases system complexity and hinders synchronized learning. Motivated by human critical thinking, we propose Stepwise Think-Critique (STC), a unified framework that interleaves reasoning and self-critique at each step within a single model. STC is trained with a hybrid reinforcement learning objective combining reasoning rewards and critique-consistency rewards to jointly optimize reasoning quality and self-evaluation.

Attribution methods, which assign credit to input features, have proven effective for explaining the decision making of computer vision models. From these, context attributions have emerged as a promising approach for explaining the behavior of autoregressive LLMs. However, current context attributions produce incomplete explanations by directly relating generated tokens to the prompt, discarding inter-generational influence in the process. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce the Context Attribution via Graph Explanations (CAGE) framework. CAGE introduces an attribution graph: a directed graph that quantifies how each generation is influenced by both the prompt and all prior generations.

To address these issues, Machine Unlearning provides techniques to remove specific information from trained models without retraining from scratch. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating unlearning in LLMs face two major limitations: they focus only on English and support only entity-level forgetting (removing all information about a person). We introduce FAME (Fictional Actors for Multilingual Erasure), a synthetic benchmark for evaluating Machine Unlearning across five languages: English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. FAME contains 1,000 fictional actor biographies and 20,000 question-answer pairs. Each biography includes information on 20 topics organized into structured categories (biography, career, achievements, personal information). This design enables both entity-level unlearning (i.e., forgetting entire identities) and instance-level unlearning (i.e., forgetting specific facts while retaining others). We provide two dataset splits to support these two different unlearning scenarios and enable systematic comparison of unlearning techniques across languages. Since FAME uses entirely fictional data, it ensures that the information was never encountered during model pretraining, allowing for a controlled evaluation of unlearning methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aFAME\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709LLMs\u9057\u5fd8\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u82f1\u8bed\u548c\u5b9e\u4f53\u7ea7\u522b\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u652f\u6301\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "FAME\u5305\u542b1000\u4e2a\u865a\u6784\u6f14\u5458\u7684\u4f20\u8bb0\u548c20000\u4e2a\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\uff0c\u6db5\u76d65\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u4f53\u7ea7\u522b\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u540c\u9057\u5fd8\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u5141\u8bb8\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u9057\u5fd8\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5b8c\u5168\u865a\u6784\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0cFAME\u786e\u4fdd\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4ece\u672a\u9047\u5230\u8fc7\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u53ef\u4ee5\u53d7\u63a7\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Current RLVR approaches typically conduct training across all generated tokens, but neglect to explore which tokens (e.g., prefix tokens) actually contribute to reasoning. This uniform training strategy spends substantial effort on optimizing low-return tokens, which in turn impedes the potential improvement from high-return tokens and reduces overall training effectiveness. To address this issue, we propose a novel RLVR approach called Progressive Prefix-token Policy Optimization (PPPO), which highlights the significance of the prefix segment of generated outputs. Specifically, inspired by the well-established human thinking theory of Path Dependence, where early-stage thoughts substantially constrain subsequent thinking trajectory, we identify an analogous phenomenon in LLM reasoning termed Beginning Lock-in Effect (BLE). PPPO leverages this finding by focusing its optimization objective on the prefix reasoning process of LLMs. This targeted optimization strategy can positively influence subsequent reasoning processes, and ultimately improve final results. To improve the learning effectiveness of LLMs on how to start reasoning with high quality, PPPO introduces two training strategies: (a) Progressive Prefix Retention, which shapes a progressive learning process by increasing the proportion of retained prefix tokens during training; (b) Continuation Accumulated Reward, which mitigates reward bias by sampling multiple continuations for one prefix token sequence, and accumulating their scores as the reward signal. Extensive experimental results on various reasoning tasks demonstrate that our proposed PPPO outperforms representative RLVR methods, with the accuracy improvements of 18.02% on only 26.17% training tokens.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5PPPO\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u6210\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u524d\u7f00\u90e8\u5206\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dRLVR\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u54ea\u4e9btoken\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u5b9e\u9645\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PPPO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u6ce8\u751f\u6210\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u524d\u7f00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u524d\u7f00\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u5ef6\u7eed\u7d2f\u79ef\u5956\u52b1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPPPO\u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u752826.17%\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3token\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8618.02%\u3002", "conclusion": "PPPO\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u524d\u7f00\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

This work addresses a fundamental question: what is the efficacy of different prompting strategies when applying LLMs to scientific information extraction? We focus on four key subtasks: event type classification (identifying synthesis steps), trigger text identification (locating event mentions), argument role extraction (recognizing parameter types), and argument text extraction (extracting parameter values). We evaluate four prompting strategies - zero-shot, few-shot, event-specific, and reflection-based - across six state-of-the-art LLMs (Gemma-3-12b-it, GPT-5-mini, O4-mini, Claude-Haiku-3.5, DeepSeek reasoning and non-reasoning) using the ZSEE dataset of 1,530 annotated sentences. Results demonstrate strong performance on event type classification (80-90\\% F1) but modest performance on fine-grained extraction tasks, particularly argument role and argument text extraction (50-65\\% F1). GPT-5-mini exhibits extreme prompt sensitivity with 11-79\\% F1 variation. Notably, advanced prompting strategies provide minimal improvements over zero-shot approaches, revealing fundamental architectural limitations. Error analysis identifies systematic hallucination, over-generalization, and inability to capture synthesis-specific nuances.

Manually written poems reach approximately 62% ASR, and automated versions 43%, with some models surpassing 90% success in single-turn interactions. The effect is structural: systems trained with RLHF, constitutional AI, and hybrid pipelines exhibit consistent degradation under minimal semiotic formal variation. Versification displaces the prompt into sparsely supervised latent regions, revealing guardrails that are excessively dependent on surface patterns. This dissociation between apparent robustness and real vulnerability exposes deep limitations in current alignment regimes.

Objective: This study aimed to explore a scalable alternative by developing and evaluating Large Language Models for Motivational Interviewing (MI-LLMs). Methods: We first curated five Chinese psychological counseling corpora and, using GPT-4 with an MI-informed prompt, transcribed multi-turn dialogues from the two highest-quality datasets (CPsyCounD and PsyDTCorpus) into 2,040 MI-style counseling conversations, of which 2,000 were used for training and 40 for testing. Three Chinese-capable open-source LLMs (Baichuan2-7B-Chat, ChatGLM-4-9B-Chat and Llama-3-8B-Chinese-Chat-v2) were fine-tuned on this corpus and were named as MI-LLMs. We evaluated MI-LLMs using round-based automatic metrics and expert manual coding with the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) Coding Manual 4.2.1. Results: Across all three models, fine-tuning substantially improved BLEU-4 and ROUGE scores compared with the base models, and manual coding showed that MI-LLMs achieved technical and relational global scores, and MI-adherent ratios that approached those of real MI dialogues, although complex reflections and reflection-to-question ratios remained less frequent. Conclusions: These findings provide initial evidence that MI-oriented fine-tuning can endow general-purpose LLMs with core MI-consistent counseling behaviors, suggesting a scalable pathway toward AI-assisted health behavior change support while underscoring the need for further work on data scale, complex MI skills and real-world intervention trials.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u6027\u8bbf\u8c08\uff08MI-LLMs\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u5f00\u6e90LLMs\u5b9e\u73b0\u5065\u5eb7\u884c\u4e3a\u6539\u53d8\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8f85\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u673a\u6027\u8bbf\u8c08\uff08MI\uff09\u867d\u6709\u6548\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5065\u5eb7\u884c\u4e3a\u6539\u53d8\uff0c\u4f46\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4eba\u529b\u8f85\u5bfc\u5458\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u7406\u4e2d\u6587\u5fc3\u7406\u54a8\u8be2\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u5229\u7528GPT-4\u5c06\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8f6c\u5f55\u4e3a2,040\u4e2aMI\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e2d\u6587\u5f00\u6e90LLMs\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728BLEU-4\u548cROUGE\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e13\u5bb6\u624b\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u663e\u793aMI-LLMs\u7684\u6280\u672f\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u6027\u5f97\u5206\u63a5\u8fd1\u771f\u5b9eMI\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u4f46\u590d\u6742\u53cd\u601d\u548c\u53cd\u601d\u95ee\u9898\u6bd4\u4ecd\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "MI\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u80fd\u591f\u8d4b\u4e88\u901a\u7528LLMs\u57fa\u672c\u7684MI\u4e00\u81f4\u8f85\u5bfc\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u8f85\u52a9\u5065\u5eb7\u884c\u4e3a\u6539\u53d8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u590d\u6742MI\u6280\u80fd\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5e72\u9884\u8bd5\u9a8c\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

However, long contexts pose significant challenges for inference efficiency, including high memory overhead from Key-Value (KV) cache and increased latency due to excessive memory accesses. Recent methods for dynamic KV selection struggle with trade-offs: block-level indexing degrades accuracy by retrieving irrelevant KV entries, while token-level indexing incurs high latency from inefficient retrieval mechanisms. In this paper, we propose CTKVR, a novel centroid-then-token KV retrieval scheme that addresses these limitations. CTKVR leverages a key observation: query vectors adjacent in position exhibit high similarity after Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and share most of their top-k KV cache entries. Based on this insight, CTKVR employs a two-stage retrieval strategy: lightweight centroids are precomputed during prefilling for centroid-grained indexing, followed by token-level refinement for precise KV retrieval. This approach balances retrieval efficiency and accuracy. To further enhance performance, we implement an optimized system for indexing construction and search using CPU-GPU co-execution. Experimentally, CTKVR achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks with less than 1% accuracy degradation. Meanwhile, CTKVR delivers 3 times and 4 times throughput speedups on Llama-3-8B and Yi-9B at 96K context length across diverse GPU hardware.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684CTKVR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5KV\u7f13\u5b58\u68c0\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u52a8\u6001KV\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e4b\u95f4\u96be\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "method": "CTKVR\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u68c0\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u9884\u586b\u5145\u9636\u6bb5\u8ba1\u7b97\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8d28\u5fc3\u7528\u4e8e\u8d28\u5fc3\u7ea7\u7d22\u5f15\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u8fdb\u884ctoken\u7ea7\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316KV\u68c0\u7d22\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5229\u7528CPU-GPU\u534f\u540c\u6267\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u7d22\u5f15\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cCTKVR\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5c0f\u4e8e1%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Llama-3-8B\u548cYi-9B\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e863\u500d\u548c4\u500d\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "CTKVR\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Many of the inherent difficulties in these tasks stem from Multi-word Expressions (MWEs), which complicate the tasks by introducing ambiguity, idiomatic expressions, infrequent usage, and a wide range of variations. Significant effort and substantial progress have been made in addressing the challenging nature of MWEs in Western languages, particularly English. This progress is attributed in part to the well-established research communities and the abundant availability of computational resources. However, the same level of progress is not true for language families such as Chinese and closely related Asian languages, which continue to lag behind in this regard. While sub-word modelling has been successfully applied to many Western languages to address rare words improving phrase comprehension, and enhancing machine translation (MT) through techniques like byte-pair encoding (BPE), it cannot be applied directly to ideograph language scripts like Chinese. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of the Chinese character decomposition technology in the context of MWE-aware neural machine translation (NMT). Furthermore, we report experiments to examine how Chinese character decomposition technology contributes to the representation of the original meanings of Chinese words and characters, and how it can effectively address the challenges of translating MWEs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This raises the possibility of replacing human roles that bottleneck existing information flows, either due to insufficient staff or process complexity. However, LLMs make mistakes and some processing roles are safety critical. For example, triaging post-operative care to patients based on hospital referral letters, or updating site access schedules in nuclear facilities for work crews. If we want to introduce LLMs into critical information flows that were previously performed by humans, how can we make them safe and reliable? Rather than make performative claims about augmented generation frameworks or graph-based techniques, this paper argues that the safety argument should focus on the type of evidence we get from evaluation points in LLM processes, particularly in frameworks that employ LLM-as-Judges (LaJ) evaluators. This paper argues that although we cannot get deterministic evaluations from many natural language processing tasks, by adopting a basket of weighted metrics it may be possible to lower the risk of errors within an evaluation, use context sensitivity to define error severity and design confidence thresholds that trigger human review of critical LaJ judgments when concordance across evaluators is low.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In contrast to prior research on byte-level LMs, which focuses predominantly on training from scratch, we train Bolmo by byteifying existing subword-level LMs. Byteification enables overcoming the limitations of subword tokenization - such as insufficient character understanding and efficiency constraints due to the fixed subword vocabulary - while performing at the level of leading subword-level LMs. Bolmo is specifically designed for byteification: our architecture resolves a mismatch between the expressivity of prior byte-level architectures and subword-level LMs, which makes it possible to employ an effective exact distillation objective between Bolmo and the source subword model. This allows for converting a subword-level LM to a byte-level LM by investing less than 1\\% of a typical pretraining token budget. Bolmo substantially outperforms all prior byte-level LMs of comparable size, and outperforms the source subword-level LMs on character understanding and, in some cases, coding, while coming close to matching the original LMs' performance on other tasks. Furthermore, we show that Bolmo can achieve inference speeds competitive with subword-level LMs by training with higher token compression ratios, and can be cheaply and effectively post-trained by leveraging the existing ecosystem around the source subword-level LM. Our results finally make byte-level LMs a practical choice competitive with subword-level LMs across a wide set of use cases.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this work, we perform a comprehensive evaluation across multiple reasoning and recall datasets, conducting a rank sweep to quantify the trade-off between SFT and PEFT. We also compare the accuracy of PEFT and SFT models across in-domain and out-of-domain adaptation, highlighting distinct generalisation behaviour and task-specific forgetting.

Recent work has proposed a simpler approach known as LatentQA: training LLMs to directly accept LLM activations as inputs and answer arbitrary questions about them in natural language. However, prior work has focused on narrow task settings for both training and evaluation. In this paper, we instead take a generalist perspective. We evaluate LatentQA-trained models, which we call Activation Oracles (AOs), in far out-of-distribution settings and examine how performance scales with training data diversity. We find that AOs can recover information fine-tuned into a model (e.g., biographical knowledge or malign propensities) that does not appear in the input text, despite never being trained with activations from a fine-tuned model. Our main evaluations are four downstream tasks where we can compare to prior white- and black-box techniques. We find that even narrowly-trained LatentQA models can generalize well, and that adding additional training datasets (such as classification tasks and a self-supervised context prediction task) yields consistent further improvements. Overall, our best AOs match or exceed prior white-box baselines on all four tasks and are the best method on 3 out of 4. These results suggest that diversified training to answer natural-language queries imparts a general capability to verbalize information about LLM activations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86LatentQA\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff08Activation Oracles, AOs\uff09\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u7684\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u5982\u4f55\u968f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u96be\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u4e13\u95e8\uff0cLatentQA\u63d0\u51fa\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u63a5\u53d7LLM\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\u5e76\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u56de\u7b54\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u4f46\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u72ed\u7a84\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86LatentQA\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff08AOs\uff09\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u7684\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u5982\u4f55\u968f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u7684\u767d\u76d2\u548c\u9ed1\u76d2\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "AOs\u53ef\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u4f20\u8bb0\u77e5\u8bc6\u6216\u6076\u610f\u503e\u5411\uff09\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u606f\u672a\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u72ed\u7a84\uff0cLatentQA\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u80fd\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u989d\u5916\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5982\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff09\u53ef\u5e26\u6765\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6700\u4f73AOs\u5728\u56db\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4e09\u9879\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u7684\u767d\u76d2\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u56de\u7b54\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u67e5\u8be2\uff0cAOs\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u63cf\u8ff0LLM\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}
