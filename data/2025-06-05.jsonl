Using five public datasets (1,471 stories, 101 annotators\nincluding critics, students, and lay readers), we (i) extract 17 reference-less\ntextual features (e.g., coherence, emotional variance, average sentence\nlength...); (ii) model individual reader preferences, deriving feature\nimportance vectors that reflect their textual priorities; and (iii) analyze\nthese vectors in a shared \"preference space\". Reader vectors cluster into two\nprofiles: 'surface-focused readers' (mainly non-experts), who prioritize\nreadability and textual richness; and 'holistic readers' (mainly experts), who\nvalue thematic development, rhetorical variety, and sentiment dynamics. Our\nresults quantitatively explain how measurements of literary quality are a\nfunction of how text features align with each reader's preferences.

Second, existing methods require tuning all\ncomponents, adding complexity. Besides, these adapters alter VFM features,\nunderutilizing the prior knowledge. To tackle these challenges, we propose a\nnew approach called ViT-Split, based on a key observation: the layers of\nseveral VFMs, like DINOv2, can be divided into two distinct components: an\nextractor for learning low-level features and an adapter for learning\ntask-specific features.

This setup resulted in high variations of\nrecording settings, camera distances, angles, and resolutions. This variation\nhelps with developing sign language understanding models capable of handling\nthe variability and complexity of real-world scenarios. The dataset consists of\n30,000 video clips performed by 18 deaf and professional signers. Additionally,\nthe dataset is linguistically rich as it provides a gloss-level annotation for\nall dataset's videos, making it useful for developing CSLR and sign language\ntranslation (SLT) systems. This paper also introduces multiple sign language\nunderstanding benchmarks, including signer-independent and unseen-sentence\nCSLR, along with gloss-based and gloss-free SLT.

Specifically, BiXFormer first categorizes multi-modal inputs into\nRGB and X, where X represents any non-RGB modalities, e.g., depth, allowing\nseparate processing for each.

We argue that a robust object referring model\nshould be grounded, meaning its predictions should be both explainable and\nfaithful to the visual content. Specifically, it should satisfy two key\nproperties: 1) Verifiable, by producing interpretable reasoning that justifies\nits predictions and clearly links them to visual evidence; and 2) Trustworthy,\nby learning to abstain when no object in the image satisfies the given\nexpression. However, most methods treat referring as a direct bounding box\nprediction task, offering limited interpretability and struggling to reject\nexpressions with no matching object. In this work, we propose Rex-Thinker, a\nmodel that formulates object referring as an explicit CoT reasoning task. Given\na referring expression, we first identify all candidate object instances\ncorresponding to the referred object category. Rex-Thinker then performs\nstep-by-step reasoning over each candidate to assess whether it matches the\ngiven expression, before making a final prediction. To support this paradigm,\nwe construct a large-scale CoT-style referring dataset named HumanRef-CoT by\nprompting GPT-4o on the HumanRef dataset. Each reasoning trace follows a\nstructured planning, action, and summarization format, enabling the model to\nlearn decomposed, interpretable reasoning over object candidates. We then train\nRex-Thinker in two stages: a cold-start supervised fine-tuning phase to teach\nthe model how to perform structured reasoning, followed by GRPO-based RL\nlearning to improve accuracy and generalization. Experiments show that our\napproach outperforms standard baselines in both precision and interpretability\non in-domain evaluation, while also demonstrating improved ability to reject\nhallucinated outputs and strong generalization in out-of-domain settings."}

To address this gap, we propose MMR-V: A Benchmark for\nMultimodal Deep Reasoning in Videos. The benchmark is characterized by the\nfollowing features. (1) Long-range, multi-frame reasoning: Models are required\nto infer and analyze evidence frames that may be far from the question frame.\n(2) Beyond perception: Questions cannot be answered through direct perception\nalone but require reasoning over hidden information. (3) Reliability: All tasks\nare manually annotated, referencing extensive real-world user understanding to\nalign with common perceptions. (4) Confusability: Carefully designed distractor\nannotation strategies to reduce model shortcuts. MMR-V consists of 317 videos\nand 1,257 tasks.

During RL training,\nR-Search provides multi-stage, multi-type rewards to jointly optimize the\nreasoning-search trajectory. Experiments on seven datasets show that R-Search\noutperforms advanced RAG baselines by up to 32.2% (in-domain) and 25.1%\n(out-of-domain).

The authors of MEMIT originally precompute approximately 44 million\nhidden vectors per edited layer, which requires a forward pass over 44 million\ntokens.

To address these challenges, task\nvector-based approaches compress task information into a single vector.\nHowever, these methods typically construct task vectors from fixed sets of\ndemonstrations and reuse them across input queries, without conditioning on the\nspecific input. This limitation can lead models to struggle with effective\nadaptation when the input query is not well aligned with the underlying\ndemonstrations, consequently degrading their generalization performance on\nunseen tasks.

To answer this question, we perform a detailed empirical study\nacross models and benchmarks, which reveals a consistent pattern of initial\nperformance improvements from additional thinking followed by a decline, due to\n\"overthinking\". To understand this non-monotonic trend, we consider a simple\nprobabilistic model, which reveals that additional thinking increases output\nvariance-creating an illusion of improved reasoning while ultimately\nundermining precision. Thus, observed gains from \"more thinking\" are not true\nindicators of improved reasoning, but artifacts stemming from the connection\nbetween model uncertainty and evaluation metric.

However, they still struggle to activate complex reasoning. In\nthis paper, rather than examining multimodal RL in isolation, we delve into\ncurrent training pipelines and identify three crucial phenomena: 1) Effective\ncold start initialization is critical for enhancing MLLM reasoning.\nIntriguingly, we find that initializing with carefully selected text data alone\ncan lead to performance surpassing many recent multimodal reasoning models,\neven before multimodal RL. 2) Standard GRPO applied to multimodal RL suffers\nfrom gradient stagnation, which degrades training stability and performance. 3)\nSubsequent text-only RL training, following the multimodal RL phase, further\nenhances multimodal reasoning. This staged training approach effectively\nbalances perceptual grounding and cognitive reasoning development. By\nincorporating the above insights and addressing multimodal RL issues, we\nintroduce ReVisual-R1, achieving a new state-of-the-art among open-source 7B\nMLLMs on challenging benchmarks including MathVerse, MathVision, WeMath,\nLogicVista, DynaMath, and challenging AIME2024 and AIME2025."}

Real-world evaluation is often challenging due to safety concerns\nand a lack of reproducibility, whereas closed-loop simulation can face\ninsufficient realism or high computational costs. Open-loop evaluation, while\nbeing efficient and data-driven, relies on metrics that generally overlook\ncompounding errors. In this paper, we propose pseudo-simulation, a novel\nparadigm that addresses these limitations. Pseudo-simulation operates on real\ndatasets, similar to open-loop evaluation, but augments them with synthetic\nobservations generated prior to evaluation using 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our key\nidea is to approximate potential future states the AV might encounter by\ngenerating a diverse set of observations that vary in position, heading, and\nspeed. Our method then assigns a higher importance to synthetic observations\nthat best match the AV's likely behavior using a novel proximity-based\nweighting scheme. This enables evaluating error recovery and the mitigation of\ncausal confusion, as in closed-loop benchmarks, without requiring sequential\ninteractive simulation. We show that pseudo-simulation is better correlated\nwith closed-loop simulations (R^2=0.8) than the best existing open-loop\napproach (R^2=0.7). We also establish a public leaderboard for the community to\nbenchmark new methodologies with pseudo-simulation. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/autonomousvision/navsim."}

However, how to extract action knowledge (or\naction representations) from videos for policy learning remains a key\nchallenge. Existing action representations such as video frames, pixelflow, and\npointcloud flow have inherent limitations such as modeling complexity or loss\nof information. In this paper, we propose to use object-centric 3D motion field\nto represent actions for robot learning from human videos, and present a novel\nframework for extracting this representation from videos for zero-shot control.\nWe introduce two novel components in its implementation. First, a novel\ntraining pipeline for training a ''denoising'' 3D motion field estimator to\nextract fine object 3D motions from human videos with noisy depth robustly.\nSecond, a dense object-centric 3D motion field prediction architecture that\nfavors both cross-embodiment transfer and policy generalization to background.\nWe evaluate the system in real world setups. Experiments show that our method\nreduces 3D motion estimation error by over 50% compared to the latest method,\nachieve 55% average success rate in diverse tasks where prior approaches\nfail~($\\lesssim 10$\\%), and can even acquire fine-grained manipulation skills\nlike insertion."}
