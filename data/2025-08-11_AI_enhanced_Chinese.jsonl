Code will be released upon acceptance", "summary": "Transfer learning of diffusion models to smaller target domains is\nchallenging, as naively fine-tuning the model often results in poor\ngeneralization. Test-time guidance methods help mitigate this by offering\ncontrollable improvements in image fidelity through a trade-off with sample\ndiversity. However, this benefit comes at a high computational cost, typically\nrequiring dual forward passes during sampling. We propose the Domain-guided\nFine-tuning (DogFit) method, an effective guidance mechanism for diffusion\ntransfer learning that maintains controllability without incurring additional\ncomputational overhead. DogFit injects a domain-aware guidance offset into the\ntraining loss, effectively internalizing the guided behavior during the\nfine-tuning process. The domain-aware design is motivated by our observation\nthat during fine-tuning, the unconditional source model offers a stronger\nmarginal estimate than the target model. To support efficient controllable\nfidelity-diversity trade-offs at inference, we encode the guidance strength\nvalue as an additional model input through a lightweight conditioning\nmechanism. We further investigate the optimal placement and timing of the\nguidance offset during training and propose two simple scheduling strategies,\ni.e., late-start and cut-off, which improve generation quality and training\nstability. Experiments on DiT and SiT backbones across six diverse target\ndomains show that DogFit can outperform prior guidance methods in transfer\nlearning in terms of FID and FDDINOV2 while requiring up to 2x fewer sampling\nTFLOPS.", "AI": {"tldr": "DogFit\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u9886\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u6548\u679c\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDomain-guided Fine-tuning (DogFit)\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u9886\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6761\u4ef6\u673a\u5236\u7f16\u7801\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u4e0a\uff0cDogFit\u5728FID\u548cFDDINOV2\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "DogFit\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

Despite its central role in planning, this aspect remains\nunderexplored in the literature. Traditional approaches rely primarily on\nsimilarities between user queries and tool descriptions, which significantly\nlimits retrieval accuracy, specifically when handling multi-step user requests.\nTo address these limitations, we propose a Knowledge Graph (KG)-based tool\nretrieval framework that captures the semantic relationships between tools and\ntheir functional dependencies.

Our model with 80\\% attention sparsity\nachieves a validation accuracy of 91.59\\%, a 0.97\\% absolute improvement over\nthe dense baseline. We hypothesize that this phenomenon is due to sparsity\nacting as a powerful implicit regularizer, preventing the model from\noverfitting by forcing it to make predictions with a more constrained and\nrobust set of features. Our work recasts attention sparsity not just as a tool\nfor computational efficiency, but as a potential method for improving the\ngeneralization and performance of Transformer models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u540e\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u5230DistilBERT\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728SST-2\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u8fbe\u523080%\u65f6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e3a91.59%\uff0c\u6bd4\u5bc6\u96c6\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e860.97%\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e8c\u6b21\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u6311\u6218\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u666e\u904d\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "method": "\u5728DistilBERT\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u540e\u5904\u7406\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728SST-2\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "80%\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e3a91.59%\uff0c\u6bd4\u5bc6\u96c6\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e860.97%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u9690\u5f0f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6539\u5584Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While exact algorithms based on MILP, CP, SAT, or dynamic\nprogramming guarantee optimality, they often suffer from poor anytime behavior\n-- meaning they struggle to find high-quality decision trees quickly when the\nsearch is stopped before completion -- due to unbalanced search space\nexploration. To address this, several anytime extensions of exact methods have\nbeen proposed, such as LDS-DL8.5, Top-k-DL8.5, and Blossom, but they have not\nbeen systematically compared, making it difficult to assess their relative\neffectiveness. In this paper, we propose CA-DL8.5, a generic, complete, and\nanytime beam search algorithm that extends the DL8.5 framework and unifies some\nexisting anytime strategies. In particular, CA-DL8.5 generalizes previous\napproaches LDS-DL8.5 and Top-k-DL8.5, by allowing the integration of various\nheuristics and relaxation mechanisms through a modular design. The algorithm\nreuses DL8.5's efficient branch-and-bound pruning and trie-based caching,\ncombined with a restart-based beam search that gradually relaxes pruning\ncriteria to improve solution quality over time. Our contributions are twofold:\n(1) We introduce this new generic framework for exact and anytime decision tree\nlearning, enabling the incorporation of diverse heuristics and search\nstrategies; (2) We conduct a rigorous empirical comparison of several\ninstantiations of CA-DL8.5 -- based on Purity, Gain, Discrepancy, and Top-k\nheuristics -- using an anytime evaluation metric called the primal gap\nintegral.

Recent diffusion-based methods have\ndemonstrated significant potential in 2D-to-3D implicit mapping, they rely on\ndata-driven statistical priors and miss the explicit modeling of light-surface\ninteraction, leading to multi-view normal direction conflicts. Moreover, the\ndiscrete sampling mechanism of diffusion models causes gradient discontinuity\nin differentiable rendering reconstruction modules, preventing 3D geometric\nerrors from being backpropagated to the normal generation network, thereby\nforcing existing methods to depend on dense normal annotations. This paper\nproposes SINGAD, a novel Self-supervised framework from a single Image for\nNormal estimation via 3D GAussian splatting guided Diffusion. By integrating\nphysics-driven light-interaction modeling and a differentiable rendering-based\nreprojection strategy, our framework directly converts 3D geometric errors into\nnormal optimization signals, solving the challenges of multi-view geometric\ninconsistency and data dependency.

It proposes an interpretable\nbias detection method aimed at identifying hidden social biases in model\noutputs, especially those semantic tendencies that are not easily captured\nthrough explicit linguistic features. The method combines nested semantic\nrepresentation with a contextual contrast mechanism. It extracts latent bias\nfeatures from the vector space structure of model outputs. Using attention\nweight perturbation, it analyzes the model's sensitivity to specific social\nattribute terms, thereby revealing the semantic pathways through which bias is\nformed. To validate the effectiveness of the method, this study uses the\nStereoSet dataset, which covers multiple stereotype dimensions including\ngender, profession, religion, and race. The evaluation focuses on several key\nmetrics, such as bias detection accuracy, semantic consistency, and contextual\nsensitivity. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves strong\ndetection performance across various dimensions. It can accurately identify\nbias differences between semantically similar texts while maintaining high\nsemantic alignment and output stability.

A key technique in merging methods is sparsification, which\nprunes redundant parameters from task vectors to mitigate interference.\nHowever, prevailing approaches employ a ``one-size-fits-all'' strategy,\napplying a uniform sparsity ratio that overlooks the inherent structural and\nstatistical heterogeneity of model parameters.

To address this limitation, we introduce \\textbf{TADrop}\n(\\textbf{T}ensor-wise \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{Drop}), an adaptive\nsparsification strategy that respects this heterogeneity. Instead of a global\nratio, TADrop assigns a tailored sparsity level to each parameter tensor based\non its distributional properties. The core intuition is that tensors with\ndenser, more redundant distributions can be pruned aggressively, while sparser,\nmore critical ones are preserved. As a simple and plug-and-play module, we\nvalidate TADrop by integrating it with foundational, classic, and SOTA merging\nmethods. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks (vision, language, and\nmultimodal) and models (ViT, BEiT) demonstrate that TADrop consistently and\nsignificantly boosts their performance.

With the emergence of large language models\n(LLMs) in communicative contexts, this understanding needs to be further\nrefined and methodologically reconsidered. The first section challenges the\ntraditional semiotic trichotomy, arguing that connectionist LLM architectures\ndestabilize established hierarchies of meaning, and proposes the Human-Machine\nCommunication (HMC) framework as a more suitable alternative. The second\nsection examines the tension between human-centred pragmatic theories and the\nmachine-centred nature of LLMs. While traditional, Gricean-inspired pragmatics\ncontinue to dominate, it relies on human-specific assumptions ill-suited to\npredictive systems like LLMs. Probabilistic pragmatics, particularly the\nRational Speech Act framework, offers a more compatible teleology by focusing\non optimization rather than truth-evaluation. The third section addresses the\nissue of substitutionalism in three forms - generalizing, linguistic, and\ncommunicative - highlighting the anthropomorphic biases that distort LLM\nevaluation and obscure the role of human communicative subjects. Finally, the\npaper introduces the concept of context frustration to describe the paradox of\nincreased contextual input paired with a collapse in contextual understanding,\nemphasizing how users are compelled to co-construct pragmatic conditions both\nfor the model and themselves.

While continuing pre-training on large\ncorpora or employing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven\nsuccessful, updating an LLM with only a few thousand or million tokens remains\nchallenging. In this work, we investigate the task of injecting small,\nunstructured information into LLMs and its relation to the catastrophic\nforgetting phenomenon. We use a dataset of recent news -- ensuring no overlap\nwith the model's pre-training data -- to evaluate the knowledge acquisition by\nprobing the model with question-answer pairs related the learned information.\nStarting from a continued pre-training baseline, we explored different\naugmentation algorithms to generate synthetic data to improve the knowledge\nacquisition capabilities. Our experiments show that simply continuing\npre-training on limited data yields modest improvements, whereas exposing the\nmodel to diverse textual variations significantly improves the learning of new\nfacts -- particularly with methods that induce greater variability through\ndiverse prompting. Furthermore, we shed light on the forgetting phenomenon in\nsmall-data regimes, illustrating the delicate balance between learning new\ncontent and retaining existing capabilities. We also confirm the sensitivity of\nRAG-based approaches for knowledge injection, which often lead to greater\ndegradation on control datasets compared to parametric methods.

However, these benchmarks are predominantly based on clean or\nprocessed multimodal inputs, without incorporating the images provided by\nreal-world Kindergarten through 12th grade (K-12) educational users. To address\nthis gap, we introduce MathReal, a meticulously curated dataset comprising\n2,000 mathematical questions with images captured by handheld mobile devices in\nauthentic scenarios. Each question is an image, containing the question text\nand visual element. We systematically classify the real images into three\nprimary categories: image quality degradation, perspective variation, and\nirrelevant content interference, which are further delineated into 14\nsubcategories. Additionally, MathReal spans five core knowledge and ability\ncategories, which encompass three question types and are divided into three\ndifficulty levels. To comprehensively evaluate the multimodal mathematical\nreasoning abilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs in real-world scenarios, we\ndesign six experimental settings that enable a systematic analysis of their\nperformance. Through extensive experimentation, we find that the\nproblem-solving abilities of existing MLLMs are significantly challenged in\nrealistic educational contexts. Based on this, we conduct a thorough analysis\nof their performance and error patterns, providing insights into their\nrecognition, comprehension, and reasoning capabilities, and outlining\ndirections for future improvements.

We then show that neural networks, acting as voting\nrules, can outperform traditional rules in minimizing axiom violations. Our\nresults suggest that data-driven approaches to social choice can inform the\ndesign of new voting systems and support the continuation of data-driven\nresearch in social choice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u8d62\u5bb6\u6295\u7968\u89c4\u5219\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u8fdd\u53cd\u516c\u7406\u7684\u9891\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6295\u7968\u89c4\u5219\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u89c4\u5219\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u8d62\u5bb6\u6295\u7968\u89c4\u5219\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u504f\u597d\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u7684\u516c\u7406\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4ee5\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u5f0f\u8865\u5145\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u5206\u6790\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6295\u7968\u89c4\u5219\u4e0e\u516c\u7406\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6295\u7968\u89c4\u5219\u3002", "result": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6295\u7968\u89c4\u5219\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u516c\u7406\u8fdd\u53cd\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u89c4\u5219\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4e3a\u65b0\u6295\u7968\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u793e\u4f1a\u9009\u62e9\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Recent open-vocabulary segmentation approaches leverage pretrained\ntext-to-image (T2I) diffusion model features for strong zero-shot transfer, but\ntypically group entire humans into a single person category, failing to\ndistinguish diverse clothing or detailed body parts. To address this, we\npropose Spectrum, a unified network for part-level pixel parsing (body parts\nand clothing) and instance-level grouping. While diffusion-based\nopen-vocabulary models generalize well across tasks, their internal\nrepresentations are not specialized for detailed human parsing. We observe\nthat, unlike diffusion models with broad representations, image-driven 3D\ntexture generators maintain faithful correspondence to input images, enabling\nstronger representations for parsing diverse clothing and body parts. Spectrum\nintroduces a novel repurposing of an Image-to-Texture (I2Tx) diffusion model --\nobtained by fine-tuning a T2I model on 3D human texture maps -- for improved\nalignment with body parts and clothing. From an input image, we extract\nhuman-part internal features via the I2Tx diffusion model and generate\nsemantically valid masks aligned to diverse clothing categories through\nprompt-guided grounding.

In response, we propose\nFourier-VLM, a simple yet efficient method that compresses visual\nrepresentations in the frequency domain. Our approach is motivated by the\nobservation that vision features output from the vision encoder exhibit\nconcentrated energy in low-frequency components.

To address these challenges, we propose\n\\textbf{VQAThinker}, a reasoning-based VQA framework that leverages large\nmultimodal models (LMMs) with reinforcement learning to jointly model video\nquality understanding and scoring, emulating human perceptual decision-making.\nSpecifically, we adopt group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a rule-guided\nreinforcement learning algorithm that enables reasoning over video quality\nunder score-level supervision, and introduce three VQA-specific rewards: (1) a\n\\textbf{bell-shaped regression reward} that increases rapidly as the prediction\nerror decreases and becomes progressively less sensitive near the ground truth;\n(2) a \\textbf{pairwise ranking reward} that guides the model to correctly\ndetermine the relative quality between video pairs; and (3) a \\textbf{temporal\nconsistency reward} that encourages the model to prefer temporally coherent\nvideos over their perturbed counterparts. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat VQAThinker achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and OOD\nVQA benchmarks, showing strong generalization for video quality scoring.\nFurthermore, evaluations on video quality understanding tasks validate its\nsuperiority in distortion attribution and quality description compared to\nexisting explainable VQA models and LMMs. These findings demonstrate that\nreinforcement learning offers an effective pathway toward building\ngeneralizable and explainable VQA models solely with score-level supervision.", "AI": {"tldr": "VQAThinker\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528GRPO\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u4e09\u79cd\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff08\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5f3a\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u5931\u771f\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u4ec5\u9700\u5206\u6570\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027VQA\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, there remains a significant research gap in combining\nthese capabilities to enable emotionally supportive interactions with virtual\ncharacters. To address this research gap, we focus on anime characters as a\ncase study because of their well-defined personalities and large fan bases.\nThis choice enables us to effectively evaluate how well LLMs can provide\nemotional support while maintaining specific character traits. We introduce\nChatAnime, the first Emotionally Supportive Role-Playing (ESRP) dataset. We\nfirst thoughtfully select 20 top-tier characters from popular anime communities\nand design 60 emotion-centric real-world scenario questions. Then, we execute a\nnationwide selection process to identify 40 Chinese anime enthusiasts with\nprofound knowledge of specific characters and extensive experience in\nrole-playing. Next, we systematically collect two rounds of dialogue data from\n10 LLMs and these 40 Chinese anime enthusiasts. To evaluate the ESRP\nperformance of LLMs, we design a user experience-oriented evaluation system\nfeaturing 9 fine-grained metrics across three dimensions: basic dialogue,\nrole-playing and emotional support, along with an overall metric for response\ndiversity.

Although both are\nclass-agnostic segmentation tasks that map from RGB space to binary space, the\nformer aims to identify the most salient objects in the image, while the latter\nfocuses on detecting perfectly camouflaged objects that blend into the\nbackground in the image. These two tasks exhibit strong contradictory\nattributes. Previous works have mostly believed that joint learning of these\ntwo tasks would confuse the network, reducing its performance on both tasks.\nHowever, here we present an opposite perspective: with the correct approach to\nlearning, the network can simultaneously possess the capability to find both\nsalient and camouflaged objects, allowing both tasks to benefit from joint\nlearning. We propose SCJoint, a joint learning scheme for SOD and COD tasks,\nassuming that the decoding processes of SOD and COD have different distribution\ncharacteristics. The key to our method is to learn the respective means and\nvariances of the decoding processes for both tasks by inserting a minimal\namount of task-specific learnable parameters within a fully shared network\nstructure, thereby decoupling the contradictory attributes of the two tasks at\na minimal cost. Furthermore, we propose a saliency-based sampling strategy\n(SBSS) to sample the training set of the SOD task to balance the training set\nsizes of the two tasks. In addition, SBSS improves the training set quality and\nshortens the training time. Based on the proposed SCJoint and SBSS, we train a\npowerful generalist network, named JoNet, which has the ability to\nsimultaneously capture both ``salient\" and ``camouflaged\".

Their adaptability raises the question of\nwhether knowledge acquired through fine-tuning in a few languages can transfer\nto unseen languages that only appeared during pre-training.

We evaluate whether minimal language-specific fine-tuning enables\ncross-lingual topic detection and whether adding targeted languages corrects\npre-training biases. Results show that LLMs fine-tuned in one or two languages\ncan reliably classify immigration-related content in unseen languages.

Finally, we train a Wavelet Diffusion Model (WDM) to\ngenerate pseudo-healthy target morphologies of the trochlear region.

Specifically, We\npropose a two-stage training strategy: first image editing, then video editing.\nThis offers two main benefits: (1) Image data scales more easily, and models\nare more efficient to train, providing useful priors for faster and better\nvideo editing training. (2) Unifying image and video generation is natural and\naligns with current trends. Moreover, we present comprehensive training data\nsynthesis pipelines, including collage-based and generative model-based data\nsynthesis. The collage-based data synthesis combines foreground objects and\nbackgrounds to generate diverse editing data, such as object manipulation,\nbackground changes, and text modifications. It can easily generate billions of\naccurate, consistent, realistic, and diverse editing pairs. We pretrain DreamVE\non extensive collage-based data to achieve strong performance in key editing\ntypes and enhance generalization and transfer capabilities. However,\ncollage-based data lacks some attribute editing cases, leading to a relative\ndrop in performance. In contrast, the generative model-based pipeline, despite\nbeing hard to scale up, offers flexibility in handling attribute editing cases.\nTherefore, we use generative model-based data to further fine-tune DreamVE.\nBesides, we design an efficient and powerful editing framework for DreamVE. We\nbuild on the SOTA T2V model and use a token concatenation with early drop\napproach to inject source image guidance, ensuring strong consistency and\neditability. The codes and models will be released.", "AI": {"tldr": "DreamVE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5148\u56fe\u50cf\u540e\u89c6\u9891\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u62fc\u8d34\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7f16\u8f91\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u56e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u800c\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u89c6\u9891\uff09\u3001\u62fc\u8d34\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7f16\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "DreamVE\u5728\u5173\u952e\u7f16\u8f91\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "DreamVE\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6307\u4ee4\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

We investigate two types of haptic\ntokenizers, a frequency-based tokenizer and an EnCodec-based tokenizer, that\nconvert haptic signals into sequences of discrete units, enabling their\nintegration with the LLaMA model. HapticLLaMA is trained in two stages: (1)\nsupervised fine-tuning using the LLaMA architecture with LoRA-based adaptation,\nand (2) fine-tuning via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). We\nassess HapticLLaMA's captioning performance using both automated n-gram metrics\nand human evaluation. HapticLLaMA demonstrates strong capability in\ninterpreting haptic vibration signals, achieving a METEOR score of 59.98 and a\nBLEU-4 score of 32.06 respectively. Additionally, over 61% of the generated\ncaptions received human ratings above 3.5 on a 7-point scale, with RLHF\nyielding a 10% improvement in the overall rating distribution, indicating\nstronger alignment with human haptic perception. These findings highlight the\npotential of large language models to process and adapt to sensory data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faHapticLLaMA\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5c06\u89e6\u89c9\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u5982\u632f\u52a8\uff09\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u89e6\u89c9\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e6\u89c9\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u8f83\u5c11\u88ab\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u5728\u865a\u62df\u73b0\u5b9e\u3001\u65e0\u969c\u788d\u548c\u5eb7\u590d\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHapticLLaMA\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9891\u7387\u548cEnCodec\u4e24\u79cd\u89e6\u89c9\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LLaMA\u67b6\u6784\u548cRLHF\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728METEOR\u548cBLEU-4\u8bc4\u5206\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c61%\u7684\u751f\u6210\u63cf\u8ff0\u83b7\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5206\u8d85\u8fc73.5\uff087\u5206\u5236\uff09\uff0cRLHF\u63d0\u534710%\u8bc4\u5206\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u5904\u7406\u611f\u5b98\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Current mainstream VQA methods typically improve\nperformance by pretraining on large-scale classification datasets (e.g.,\nImageNet, Kinetics-400), followed by fine-tuning on VQA datasets. However, this\nstrategy presents two significant challenges: (1) merely transferring semantic\nknowledge learned from pretraining is insufficient for VQA, as video quality\ndepends on multiple factors (e.g., semantics, distortion, motion, aesthetics);\n(2) pretraining on large-scale datasets demands enormous computational\nresources, often dozens or even hundreds of times greater than training\ndirectly on VQA datasets. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown\nremarkable generalization capabilities across a wide range of visual tasks, and\nhave begun to demonstrate promising potential in quality assessment. In this\nwork, we propose Q-CLIP, the first fully VLMs-based framework for VQA. Q-CLIP\nenhances both visual and textual representations through a Shared Cross-Modal\nAdapter (SCMA), which contains only a minimal number of trainable parameters\nand is the only component that requires training. This design significantly\nreduces computational cost. In addition, we introduce a set of five learnable\nquality-level prompts to guide the VLMs in perceiving subtle quality\nvariations, thereby further enhancing the model's sensitivity to video quality.\nFurthermore, we investigate the impact of different frame sampling strategies\non VQA performance, and find that frame-difference-based sampling leads to\nbetter generalization performance across datasets.

Most existing Image Manipulation Localization (IML) methods\nrely on discriminative learning and require large, high-quality annotated\ndatasets. However, current datasets lack sufficient scale and diversity,\nlimiting model performance in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, recent\nstudies have explored Constrained IML (CIML), which generates pixel-level\nannotations through algorithmic supervision. However, existing CIML approaches\noften depend on complex multi-stage pipelines, making the annotation process\ninefficient. In this work, we propose a novel generative framework based on\ndiffusion models, named UGD-IML, which for the first time unifies both IML and\nCIML tasks within a single framework. By learning the underlying data\ndistribution, generative diffusion models inherently reduce the reliance on\nlarge-scale labeled datasets, allowing our approach to perform effectively even\nunder limited data conditions. In addition, by leveraging a class embedding\nmechanism and a parameter-sharing design, our model seamlessly switches between\nIML and CIML modes without extra components or training overhead. Furthermore,\nthe end-to-end design enables our model to avoid cumbersome steps in the data\nannotation process. Extensive experimental results on multiple datasets\ndemonstrate that UGD-IML outperforms the SOTA methods by an average of 9.66 and\n4.36 in terms of F1 metrics for IML and CIML tasks, respectively.

However, existing\nmultimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially open-source ones, are\nstill falling behind with a typical success rate of 30%-50% on challenging\nbenchmarks. Previous studies on fine-tuning MLLMs with synthetic charts are\noften restricted by their inadequate similarity to the real charts, which could\ncompromise model training and performance on complex real-world charts. In this\nstudy, we show that modularizing chart generation and diversifying visual\ndetails improves chart understanding capabilities. In particular, we design a\nfive-step data synthesis pipeline, where we separate data and function creation\nfor single plot generation, condition the generation of later subplots on\nearlier ones for multi-subplot figures, visually diversify the generated\nfigures, filter out low quality data, and finally generate the question-answer\n(QA) pairs with GPT-4o.

Under the\nWeakly-Supervised VAD (WSVAD) paradigm, only video-level labels are provided\nduring training, while predictions are made at the frame level. Although\nstate-of-the-art models perform well on simple anomalies (e.g., explosions),\nthey struggle with complex real-world events (e.g., shoplifting).

Experiments across safety benchmarks, MLLMGuard and VLSBench, and\ncapability benchmarks, MMBench and MMVet, show that SDEval significantly\ninfluences safety evaluation, mitigates data contamination, and exposes safety\nlimitations of MLLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/hq-King/SDEval", "AI": {"tldr": "SDEval\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u52a8\u6001\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u5b89\u5168\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740MLLMs\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ef\u80fd\u8fc7\u65f6\u4e14\u6613\u53d7\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u52a8\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "SDEval\u91c7\u7528\u6587\u672c\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6587\u672c-\u56fe\u50cf\u52a8\u6001\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eSDEval\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u51cf\u8f7b\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\uff0c\u5e76\u66b4\u9732MLLMs\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9650\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "SDEval\u4e3aMLLMs\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Timely intervention in\nAD relies heavily on early and precise diagnosis, which remains challenging due\nto the complex and subtle structural changes in the brain. Most existing deep\nlearning methods focus only on a single plane of structural magnetic resonance\nimaging (sMRI) and struggle to accurately capture the complex and nonlinear\nrelationships among pathological regions of the brain, thus limiting their\nability to precisely identify atrophic features. To overcome these limitations,\nwe propose an innovative framework, MPF-KANSC, which integrates multi-plane\nfusion (MPF) for combining features from the coronal, sagittal, and axial\nplanes, and a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-guided spatial-channel attention\nmechanism (KANSC) to more effectively learn and represent sMRI atrophy\nfeatures. Specifically, the proposed model enables parallel feature extraction\nfrom multiple anatomical planes, thus capturing more comprehensive structural\ninformation. The KANSC attention mechanism further leverages a more flexible\nand accurate nonlinear function approximation technique, facilitating precise\nidentification and localization of disease-related abnormalities.

This paper investigates a critical question for compute-optimal\ndiffusion model deployment: Under a post-training setting without fine-tuning,\nis it more effective to reduce the number of denoising steps or to use a\ncheaper per-step inference? Intuitively, reducing the number of denoising steps\nincreases the variability of the distributions across steps, making the model\nmore sensitive to compression. In contrast, keeping more denoising steps makes\nthe differences smaller, preserving redundancy, and making post-training\ncompression more feasible. To systematically examine this, we propose PostDiff,\na training-free framework for accelerating pre-trained diffusion models by\nreducing redundancy at both the input level and module level in a post-training\nmanner. At the input level, we propose a mixed-resolution denoising scheme\nbased on the insight that reducing generation resolution in early denoising\nsteps can enhance low-frequency components and improve final generation\nfidelity.

Existing methods often struggle with diverse image variations and\ncomplex edges, primarily because direct feature concatenation causes semantic\ngaps. To address these challenges, we propose the Dual-Branch Interactive\nFusion Attention model (DBIF-AUNet). This model constructs a densely nested\nskip-connection network and innovatively refines the Dual-Domain Feature\nDisentanglement module (DDFD). The DDFD module orthogonally decouples the\nfunctions of dual-domain modules to achieve multi-scale feature complementarity\nand enhance characteristics at different levels. Concurrently, we design a\nBranch Interaction Attention Fusion module (BIAF) that works synergistically\nwith the DDFD.

While spatio-temporal fusion methods offer\npromising solutions, few have addressed the estimation of daily LST at 10 m\nresolution. In this study, we present WGAST, a Weakly-Supervised Generative\nNetwork for Daily 10 m LST Estimation via Spatio-Temporal Fusion of Terra\nMODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2. WGAST is the first end-to-end deep learning\nframework designed for this task. It adopts a conditional generative\nadversarial architecture, with a generator composed of four stages: feature\nextraction, fusion, LST reconstruction, and noise suppression. The first stage\nemploys a set of encoders to extract multi-level latent representations from\nthe inputs, which are then fused in the second stage using cosine similarity,\nnormalization, and temporal attention mechanisms. The third stage decodes the\nfused features into high-resolution LST, followed by a Gaussian filter to\nsuppress high-frequency noise.

To address\nthe inefficiency of manual scoring, this work proposes a two-stage pipeline for\ninterpretable image-level SvdH score prediction using dual-hand radiographs.\nOur approach extracts disease-relevant image regions and integrates them using\nattention-based multiple instance learning to generate image-level features for\nprediction. We propose two region extraction schemes: 1) sampling image tiles\nmost likely to contain abnormalities, and 2) cropping patches containing\ndisease-relevant joints.

This\nmakes FL a suitable learning paradigm for remote sensing (RS) image\nclassification tasks, where data centralization may be restricted due to legal\nand privacy constraints. However, a key challenge in applying FL to RS tasks is\nthe communication overhead caused by the frequent exchange of large model\nupdates between clients and the central server. To address this issue, in this\npaper we propose a novel strategy (denoted as FedX) that uses\nexplanation-guided pruning to reduce communication overhead by minimizing the\nsize of the transmitted models without compromising performance. FedX leverages\nbackpropagation-based explanation methods to estimate the task-specific\nimportance of model components and prunes the least relevant ones at the\ncentral server.

We hypothesize that street view imagery --\nan inexpensive data source with global coverage -- contains latent social\ninformation that can be extracted and interpreted through established social\nscience theory. As a proof of concept, we analyzed 2,998 street view images\nfrom 15 cities using a multimodal large language model guided by Mehta's\ntaxonomy of passive, fleeting, and enduring sociability -- one illustrative\nexample of a theory grounded in urban design that could be substituted or\ncomplemented by other sociological frameworks. We then used linear regression\nmodels, controlling for factors like weather, time of day, and pedestrian\ncounts, to test whether the inferred sociability measures correlate with\ncity-level place attachment scores from the World Values Survey and with\nenvironmental predictors (e.g., green, sky, and water view indices) derived\nfrom individual street view images.

Prior\nworks showed that the language modality can help in the adaptation process,\nexhibiting more robustness to such complex shifts. In this paper, we introduce\nTRUST, a novel UDA approach that exploits the robustness of the language\nmodality to guide the adaptation of a vision model. TRUST generates\npseudo-labels for target samples from their captions and introduces a novel\nuncertainty estimation strategy that uses normalised CLIP similarity scores to\nestimate the uncertainty of the generated pseudo-labels. Such estimated\nuncertainty is then used to reweight the classification loss, mitigating the\nadverse effects of wrong pseudo-labels obtained from low-quality captions. To\nfurther increase the robustness of the vision model, we propose a multimodal\nsoft-contrastive learning loss that aligns the vision and language feature\nspaces, by leveraging captions to guide the contrastive training of the vision\nmodel on target images. In our contrastive loss, each pair of images acts as\nboth a positive and a negative pair and their feature representations are\nattracted and repulsed with a strength proportional to the similarity of their\ncaptions. This solution avoids the need for hardly determining positive and\nnegative pairs, which is critical in the UDA setting.
