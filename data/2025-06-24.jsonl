Manual extraction is slow and\nlabor-intensive, while generic OCR models often fail due to complex layouts,\nengineering symbols, and rotated text, leading to incomplete and unreliable\noutputs. These limitations result in incomplete and unreliable outputs. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a hybrid vision-language framework that\nintegrates a rotation-aware object detection model (YOLOv11-obb) with a\ntransformer-based vision-language parser. Our structured pipeline applies\nYOLOv11-OBB to localize annotations and extract oriented bounding box (OBB)\npatches, which are then parsed into structured outputs using a fine-tuned,\nlightweight vision-language model (VLM). We curate a dataset of 1,367 2D\nmechanical drawings annotated across nine key categories. YOLOv11-OBB is\ntrained on this dataset to detect OBBs and extract annotation patches. These\nare parsed using two open-source VLMs: Donut and Florence-2. Both models are\nlightweight and well-suited for specialized industrial tasks under limited\ncomputational overhead. Following fine-tuning of both models on the curated\ndataset of image patches paired with structured annotation labels, a\ncomparative experiment is conducted to evaluate parsing performance across four\nkey metrics. Donut outperforms Florence-2, achieving 88.5% precision, 99.2%\nrecall, and a 93.5% F1-score, with a hallucination rate of 11.5%. Finally, a\ncase study demonstrates how the extracted structured information supports\ndownstream manufacturing tasks such as process and tool selection, showcasing\nthe practical utility of the proposed framework in modernizing 2D drawing\ninterpretation."}

The project page:\n  https://github.com/deep-optimization/Morse", "summary": "In this paper, we present Morse, a simple dual-sampling framework for\naccelerating diffusion models losslessly. The key insight of Morse is to\nreformulate the iterative generation (from noise to data) process via taking\nadvantage of fast jump sampling and adaptive residual feedback strategies.\nSpecifically, Morse involves two models called Dash and Dot that interact with\neach other. The Dash model is just the pre-trained diffusion model of any type,\nbut operates in a jump sampling regime, creating sufficient space for sampling\nefficiency improvement. The Dot model is significantly faster than the Dash\nmodel, which is learnt to generate residual feedback conditioned on the\nobservations at the current jump sampling point on the trajectory of the Dash\nmodel, lifting the noise estimate to easily match the next-step estimate of the\nDash model without jump sampling. By chaining the outputs of the Dash and Dot\nmodels run in a time-interleaved fashion, Morse exhibits the merit of flexibly\nattaining desired image generation performance while improving overall runtime\nefficiency. With our proposed weight sharing strategy between the Dash and Dot\nmodels, Morse is efficient for training and inference. Our method shows a\nlossless speedup of 1.78X to 3.31X on average over a wide range of sampling\nstep budgets relative to 9 baseline diffusion models on 6 image generation\ntasks. Furthermore, we show that our method can be also generalized to improve\nthe Latent Consistency Model (LCM-SDXL, which is already accelerated with\nconsistency distillation technique) tailored for few-step text-to-image\nsynthesis.

Although LLMs perform well on many technical tasks, their\nbehaviour in personal decision-making remains less understood. Previous studies\nhave assessed their rationality and moral alignment with human decisions.\nHowever, the behaviour of AI assistants in scenarios where financial rewards\nare at odds with user comfort has not yet been thoroughly explored. In this\npaper, we tackle this problem by quantifying the prices assigned by multiple\nLLMs to a series of user discomforts: additional walking, waiting, hunger and\npain. We uncover several key concerns that strongly question the prospect of\nusing current LLMs as decision-making assistants: (1) a large variance in\nresponses between LLMs, (2) within a single LLM, responses show fragility to\nminor variations in prompt phrasing (e.g., reformulating the question in the\nfirst person can considerably alter the decision), (3) LLMs can accept\nunreasonably low rewards for major inconveniences (e.g., 1 Euro to wait 10\nhours), and (4) LLMs can reject monetary gains where no discomfort is imposed\n(e.g., 1,000 Euro to wait 0 minutes). These findings emphasize the need for\nscrutiny of how LLMs value human inconvenience, particularly as we move toward\napplications where such cash-versus-comfort trade-offs are made on users'\nbehalf."}

The key challenge of this task lies in the inherent\ncomplexities of two-person dance interactions, where the partners need to\nsynchronize both with each other and with the music. Inspired by the recent\nadvances in motion synthesis, we propose a two-stage solution: encoding\ntwo-person motions into discrete tokens and then generating these tokens from\nmusic. To effectively capture intricate interactions, we represent both\ndancers' motions as a unified whole to learn the necessary motion tokens, and\nadopt a coarse-to-fine learning strategy in both the stages. Our first stage\nutilizes a VQ-VAE that hierarchically separates high-level semantic features at\na coarse temporal resolution from low-level details at a finer resolution,\nproducing two discrete token sequences at different abstraction levels.\nSubsequently, in the second stage, two generative masked transformers learn to\nmap music signals to these dance tokens: the first producing high-level\nsemantic tokens, and the second, conditioned on music and these semantic\ntokens, producing the low-level tokens. We train both transformers to learn to\npredict randomly masked tokens within the sequence, enabling them to\niteratively generate motion tokens by filling an empty token sequence during\ninference. Through the hierarchical masked modeling and dedicated interaction\nrepresentation, DuetGen achieves the generation of synchronized and interactive\ntwo-person dances across various genres.

We introduce Scene-R1, a video-grounded framework that learns to\nreason about 3D scenes without any point-wise 3D instance supervision by\npairing reinforcement-learning-driven reasoning with a two-stage grounding\npipeline. In the temporal grounding stage, we explicitly reason about the video\nand select the video snippets most relevant to an open-ended query.

Scene-R1 can also adapt to the 3D visual question\nanswering task to answer free-form questions directly from video.

While vision-language\nmodels (VLMs) have enabled open-vocabulary perception, their utility for\nfine-grained intent reasoning remains underexplored. Notably, no existing\nbenchmark evaluates multi-class intent prediction in safety-critical\nsituations, To address this gap, we introduce DRAMA-X, a fine-grained benchmark\nconstructed from the DRAMA dataset via an automated annotation pipeline.\nDRAMA-X contains 5,686 accident-prone frames labeled with object bounding\nboxes, a nine-class directional intent taxonomy, binary risk scores,\nexpert-generated action suggestions for the ego vehicle, and descriptive motion\nsummaries. These annotations enable a structured evaluation of four\ninterrelated tasks central to autonomous decision-making: object detection,\nintent prediction, risk assessment, and action suggestion. As a reference\nbaseline, we propose SGG-Intent, a lightweight, training-free framework that\nmirrors the ego vehicle's reasoning pipeline. It sequentially generates a scene\ngraph from visual input using VLM-backed detectors, infers intent, assesses\nrisk, and recommends an action using a compositional reasoning stage powered by\na large language model.

Prior solutions either employ Large Language Models (LLMs)\nover static video captions, which often omit critical visual details, or rely\non end-to-end Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that struggle with stepwise\ncompositional reasoning. Consider the complementary strengths of LLMs in\nreasoning and VLMs in perception, we propose CLiViS.

However, recent studies show that\nSDE models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which are often limited to\nunrealistic settings, e.g., digital perturbations on separate stereo views in\nstatic scenes, restricting their real-world applicability. This raises a\ncritical question: how can we design physically realizable, scene-adaptive, and\ntransferable attacks against SDE under realistic constraints?\n  To answer this, we make two key contributions. First, we propose a unified\nattack framework that extends optimization-based techniques to four core stages\nof stereo matching: feature extraction, cost-volume construction, cost\naggregation, and disparity regression. A comprehensive stage-wise evaluation\nacross 9 mainstream SDE models, under constraints like photometric consistency,\nreveals that optimization-based patches suffer from poor transferability.\nInterestingly, partially transferable patches suggest that patterns, rather\nthan pixel-level perturbations, may be key to generalizable attacks. Motivated\nby this, we present PatchHunter, the first optimization-free adversarial patch\nattack against SDE. PatchHunter formulates patch generation as a reinforcement\nlearning-driven search over a structured space of visual patterns crafted to\ndisrupt SDE assumptions.\n  We validate PatchHunter across three levels: the KITTI dataset, the CARLA\nsimulator, and real-world vehicle deployment.

This\nvariability leads to a notable drop in the performance of Egocentric Action\nRecognition models when tested in environments not seen during training. In\nthis paper, we tackle these challenges by proposing a domain generalization\napproach for Egocentric Action Recognition. Our insight is that action\nsequences often reflect consistent user intent across visual domains. By\nleveraging action sequences, we aim to enhance the model's generalization\nability across unseen environments. Our proposed method, named SeqDG,\nintroduces a visual-text sequence reconstruction objective (SeqRec) that uses\ncontextual cues from both text and visual inputs to reconstruct the central\naction of the sequence. Additionally, we enhance the model's robustness by\ntraining it on mixed sequences of actions from different domains (SeqMix). We\nvalidate SeqDG on the EGTEA and EPIC-KITCHENS-100 datasets. Results on\nEPIC-KITCHENS-100, show that SeqDG leads to +2.4% relative average improvement\nin cross-domain action recognition in unseen environments, and on EGTEA the\nmodel achieved +0.6% Top-1 accuracy over SOTA in intra-domain action\nrecognition."}

During SME, the general capabilities of LLMs can be\nnegatively affected due to the introduction of new parameters. In this paper,\nwe propose a queue-based self-correction framework (QueueEDIT) that not only\nenhances SME performance by addressing long-sequence dependency but also\nmitigates the impact of parameter bias on the general capabilities of LLMs.\nSpecifically, we first introduce a structural mapping editing loss to map the\ntriplets to the knowledge-sensitive neurons within the Transformer layers of\nLLMs. We then store the located parameters for each piece of edited knowledge\nin a queue and dynamically align previously edited parameters. In each edit, we\nselect queue parameters most relevant to the currently located parameters to\ndetermine whether previous knowledge needs realignment. Irrelevant parameters\nin the queue are frozen, and we update the parameters at the queue head to the\nLLM to ensure they do not harm general abilities.

To quantify this\nconcentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant\nmeasure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our\nempirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as\ngeneration progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they\ngenerate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output\ndistribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude\n(e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models. This stark reduction helps\nexplain why aligned models often appear less sensitive to decoding strategies.\nBuilding on this insight, we find this stability has surprising implications\nfor complex reasoning. Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g.,\nDeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating\nlonger reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic\n(lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs. We hypothesize that\nalignment tuning does not fundamentally change a model's behavior, but instead\nsteers it toward stylistic tokens (e.g., \"Sure\") that unlock low-entropy\ntrajectories already present in the base model. This view is supported by\nnudging experiments, which show that prompting base models with such tokens can\nsimilarly reduce BF.

For example, if fine-tuning removes prior edits, it\ncould serve as a defence mechanism against hidden malicious edits. Vice versa,\nthe unintended removal of edits related to bias mitigation could pose serious\nsafety concerns. We systematically investigate the interaction between model\nediting and fine-tuning in the context of T2I diffusion models, which are known\nto exhibit biases and generate inappropriate content. Our study spans two T2I\nmodel families (Stable Diffusion and FLUX), two sota editing techniques, and\nthree fine-tuning methods (DreamBooth, LoRA, and DoRA). Through an extensive\nempirical analysis across diverse editing tasks and evaluation metrics, our\nfindings reveal a trend: edits generally fail to persist through fine-tuning,\neven when fine-tuning is tangential or unrelated to the edits. Notably, we\nobserve that DoRA exhibits the strongest edit reversal effect. At the same\ntime, among editing methods, UCE demonstrates greater robustness, retaining\nsignificantly higher efficacy post-fine-tuning compared to ReFACT. These\nfindings highlight a crucial limitation in current editing methodologies,\nemphasizing the need for more robust techniques to ensure reliable long-term\ncontrol and alignment of deployed AI systems.

Prior work has largely centered on\nintra-group behavioral consistency in multi-agent systems, with limited\nattention given to behavioral consistency in multi-agent grouping scenarios. In\nthis paper, we introduce Dual-Level Behavioral Consistency (DLBC), a novel MARL\ncontrol method designed to explicitly regulate agent behaviors at both\nintra-group and inter-group levels. DLBC partitions agents into distinct groups\nand dynamically modulates behavioral diversity both within and between these\ngroups. By dynamically modulating behavioral diversity within and between these\ngroups, DLBC achieves enhanced division of labor through inter-group\nconsistency, which constrains behavioral strategies across different groups.\nSimultaneously, intra-group consistency, achieved by aligning behavioral\nstrategies within each group, fosters stronger intra-group cooperation.\nCrucially, DLBC's direct constraint of agent policy functions ensures its broad\napplicability across various algorithmic frameworks. Experimental results in\nvarious grouping cooperation scenarios demonstrate that DLBC significantly\nenhances both intra-group cooperative performance and inter-group task\nspecialization, yielding substantial performance improvements. DLBC provides\nnew ideas for behavioral consistency control of multi-intelligent body systems,\nand its potential for application in more complex tasks and dynamic\nenvironments can be further explored in the future."}

In this paper, we propose Programming by\nBackprop (PBB) as a potential driver of this effect - teaching a model to\nevaluate a program for inputs by training on its source code alone, without\never seeing I/O examples. To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of\nprograms representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source\ncode and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We\nfind evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for\ninputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations.\nFirstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code\nrather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can\nproduce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the\nprogram within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the\nprogram in-context via chain-of-thought. We further show that PBB leads to more\nrobust evaluation of programs across inputs than training on I/O pairs drawn\nfrom a distribution that mirrors naturally occurring data.

While\nwritten GEC is well-established, spoken GEC (SGEC), aiming to provide feedback\nbased on learners' speech, poses additional challenges due to disfluencies,\ntranscription errors, and the lack of structured input. SGEC systems typically\nfollow a cascaded pipeline consisting of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR),\ndisfluency detection, and GEC, making them vulnerable to error propagation\nacross modules. This work examines an End-to-End (E2E) framework for SGEC and\nfeedback generation, highlighting challenges and possible solutions when\ndeveloping these systems. Cascaded, partial-cascaded and E2E architectures are\ncompared, all built on the Whisper foundation model. A challenge for E2E\nsystems is the scarcity of GEC labeled spoken data. To address this, an\nautomatic pseudo-labeling framework is examined, increasing the training data\nfrom 77 to over 2500 hours. To improve the accuracy of the SGEC system,\nadditional contextual information, exploiting the ASR output, is investigated.\nCandidate feedback of their mistakes is an essential step to improving\nperformance. In E2E systems the SGEC output must be compared with an estimate\nof the fluent transcription to obtain the feedback. To improve the precision of\nthis feedback, a novel reference alignment process is proposed that aims to\nremove hypothesised edits that results from fluent transcription errors.\nFinally, these approaches are combined with an edit confidence estimation\napproach, to exclude low-confidence edits. Experiments on the in-house\nLinguaskill (LNG) corpora and the publicly available Speak & Improve (S&I)\ncorpus show that the proposed approaches significantly boost E2E SGEC\nperformance."}

Previous few-shot\nOOD detection works ignore the distinct diversity between different classes. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel network: Adaptive Multi-prompt Contrastive\nNetwork (AMCN), which adapts the ID-OOD separation boundary by learning inter-\nand intra-class distribution. To compensate for the absence of OOD and scarcity\nof ID {\\em image samples}, we leverage CLIP, connecting text with images,\nengineering learnable ID and OOD {\\em textual prompts}. Specifically, we first\ngenerate adaptive prompts (learnable ID prompts, label-fixed OOD prompts and\nlabel-adaptive OOD prompts).

Their low cost and power consumption\ncharacteristics confer high commercial value. However, their reasoning\nabilities are limited by the number of parameters. To address this issue, this\npaper proposes a post-training optimization paradigm called the Incremental\nTraining Strategy to enhance the reasoning ability of SVLMs. Firstly, we\nconstructed a Self-Supervised Chain-of-Thought (COT) Data Construction System,\nwhich leverages multiple LVLMs with 7B parameters or more to transform original\ndata into COT data in a self-supervised manner. Our proposed Incremental\nTraining Strategy consists of four stages. Stage 1 injects domain knowledge by\nperforming Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to the pretrained model on the COT\ndata. Stage 2 aligns the COT data format by conducting a small amount of Group\nRelative Policy Optimization (GRPO) training constrained only by format rewards\non the COT data. Stage 3 enhances reasoning ability by applying GRPO training\non the COT data with constraints on both format and accuracy rewards. The\nresulting model shows significant improvement compared to the baseline. Stage 4\naddresses the limited capacity of the SVLMs and the weak ability to capture\ncomplex patterns by proposing ClipLow GRPO (CLGRPO) to constrain the capture\nspace of the training process. We conducted extensive comparative and ablation\nexperiments on the abstract semantic recognition dataset EMOSet-118K.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the\nreasoning ability of 1B SVLM.

This tendency of LMs to\ngenerate hallucinated content undermines their reliability, especially because\nthese fabrications are often highly convincing and therefore difficult to\ndetect. While several existing methods attempt to detect hallucinations, most\nrely on analyzing multiple generations per input, leading to increased\ncomputational cost and latency. To address this, we propose a single-pass,\ntraining-free approach for effective Hallucination detectIon via Decoupled\nrEpresentations (HIDE). Our approach leverages the hypothesis that\nhallucinations result from a statistical decoupling between an LM's internal\nrepresentations of input context and its generated output. We quantify this\ndecoupling using the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) applied to\nhidden-state representations extracted while generating the output sequence. We\nconduct extensive experiments on four diverse question answering datasets,\nevaluating both faithfulness and factuality hallucinations across six\nopen-source LMs of varying scales and properties. Our results demonstrate that\nHIDE outperforms other single-pass methods in almost all settings, achieving an\naverage relative improvement of ~29% in AUC-ROC over the best-performing\nsingle-pass strategy across various models and datasets. Additionally, HIDE\nshows competitive and often superior performance with multi-pass\nstate-of-the-art methods, obtaining an average relative improvement of ~3% in\nAUC-ROC while consuming ~51% less computation time.

What drives this stability in the\ngeneration? We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of probability\nconcentration in the model's output distribution. To quantify this\nconcentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant\nmeasure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our\nempirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as\ngeneration progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they\ngenerate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output\ndistribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude\n(e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models. This stark reduction helps\nexplain why aligned models often appear less sensitive to decoding strategies.\nBuilding on this insight, we find this stability has surprising implications\nfor complex reasoning. Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g.,\nDeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating\nlonger reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic\n(lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs. We hypothesize that\nalignment tuning does not fundamentally change a model's behavior, but instead\nsteers it toward stylistic tokens (e.g., \"Sure\") that unlock low-entropy\ntrajectories already present in the base model. This view is supported by\nnudging experiments, which show that prompting base models with such tokens can\nsimilarly reduce BF.

This work proposes a few-shot learning\nframework, Domain-adapted Expert Network (DExNet), for plant disease\nclassification that compensates for the lack of sufficient training data by\ncombining observations of a number of expert critics. It starts with extracting\nthe feature embeddings as 'observations' from nine 'critics' that are\nstate-of-the-art pre-trained CNN-based architectures. These critics are 'domain\nadapted' using a publicly available leaf disease dataset having no overlapping\nclasses with the specific downstream task of interest. The observations are\nthen passed to the 'Feature Fusion Block' and finally to a classifier network\nconsisting of Bi-LSTM layers. The proposed pipeline is evaluated on the 10\nclasses of tomato leaf images from the PlantVillage dataset, achieving\npromising accuracies of 89.06%, 92.46%, and 94.07%, respectively, for 5-shot,\n10-shot, and 15-shot classification.

Consider the complementary strengths of LLMs in\nreasoning and VLMs in perception, we propose CLiViS. It is a novel\ntraining-free framework that leverages LLMs for high-level task planning and\norchestrates VLM-driven open-world visual perception to iteratively update the\nscene context. Building on this synergy, the core of CLiViS is a dynamic\nCognitive Map that evolves throughout the reasoning process. This map\nconstructs a structured representation of the embodied scene, bridging\nlow-level perception and high-level reasoning. Extensive experiments across\nmultiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of CLiViS,\nespecially in handling long-term visual dependencies.

In this paper, we propose Programming by\nBackprop (PBB) as a potential driver of this effect - teaching a model to\nevaluate a program for inputs by training on its source code alone, without\never seeing I/O examples. To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of\nprograms representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source\ncode and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We\nfind evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for\ninputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations.\nFirstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code\nrather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can\nproduce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the\nprogram within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the\nprogram in-context via chain-of-thought. We further show that PBB leads to more\nrobust evaluation of programs across inputs than training on I/O pairs drawn\nfrom a distribution that mirrors naturally occurring data.

Specifically, despite being\npost-tuned with large-scale caption data through supervised fine-tuning (SFT),\nthese models frequently fail to produce faithful descriptions in real-world\nscenarios, such as multi-concept image captioning. However, acquiring\nlarge-scale, high-quality captions for such complex settings is both costly and\ndifficult. To address the data-centric nature of SFT, we propose a\nreinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training framework. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first RL-based approach to post-train MLLMs for\npersonalized image captioning. Our method significantly enhances both visual\nrecognition and personalized generation capabilities of MLLMs, and consistently\noutperforms existing SFT-based baselines, especially in the challenging\nmulti-concept image captioning task."}

The unit cost of an LLM is\nthe computation of a token. Therefore, the tokenizer plays an important role in\nthe efficiency of a model, and they are carefully optimized to minimize the\nnumber of tokens for the text in their training corpus. One of the most popular\napplications of LLMs are chatbots that interact with users. A key observation\nis that, for those chatbots, what is important is the performance of the\ntokenizer in the user text input and the chatbot responses. Those are most\nlikely different from the text in the training corpus. So, a question that\nimmediately arises is whether there is a potential benefit in optimizing\ntokenizers for chatbot conversations. In this paper, this idea is explored for\ndifferent tokenizers by using a publicly available corpus of chatbot\nconversations to redesign their vocabularies and evaluate their performance in\nthis domain. The results show that conversation-optimized tokenizers\nconsistently reduce the number of tokens in chatbot dialogues, which can lead\nto meaningful energy savings, in the range of 5% to 10% while having minimal or\neven slightly positive impact on tokenization efficiency for the original\ntraining corpus."}

In\nthis work, we propose an incentivization-based approach that, starting entirely\nfrom scratch and without relying on any annotated or synthetic data, leverages\nreinforcement learning (RL) to foster the emergence of ultra-long, high-quality\ntext generation capabilities in LLMs. We perform RL training starting from a\nbase model, similar to R1-Zero, guiding it to engage in reasoning that\nfacilitates planning and refinement during the writing process. To support\nthis, we employ specialized reward models that steer the LLM towards improved\nlength control, writing quality, and structural formatting. Experimental\nevaluations show that our LongWriter-Zero model, trained from Qwen2.5-32B,\nconsistently outperforms traditional SFT methods on long-form writing tasks,\nachieving state-of-the-art results across all metrics on WritingBench and\nArena-Write, and even surpassing 100B+ models such as DeepSeek R1 and\nQwen3-235B.

In\naddition, it enhances existing 3D segmentation tools by providing clean\nboundaries for part decomposition."}

Existing approaches\noften rely on historical screenshots or actions to implicitly represent the\ntask state. This reliance poses challenges for GUI agents in accurately\nunderstanding task states and underscores the absence of effective mechanisms\nto store critical information in complex and lengthy cross-app tasks. To\naddress these challenges, we propose Chain-of-Memory (CoM), a novel approach\nfor explicitly modeling short-term and long-term memory in GUI agents. CoM\nachieves this by capturing action descriptions, integrating task-relevant\nscreen information, and maintaining a dedicated memory module to store and\nmanage this information. By leveraging explicit memory representations, CoM\nenables GUI agents to better understand task states and retain critical\nhistorical information persistently. To equip GUI agents with memory management\ncapabilities and evaluate the effectiveness of CoM, we developed the GUI\nOdyssey-CoM, a dataset comprising 111k screen-action pairs annotated with\nChain-of-Memory. Experimental results demonstrate that CoM significantly\nimproves GUI agents' performance in cross-application tasks. Additionally, GUI\nOdyssey-CoM enables 7B models to achieve memory management capabilities\ncomparable to 72B models. The dataset and code will be open-sourced."}

The project page:\n  https://github.com/deep-optimization/Morse", "summary": "In this paper, we present Morse, a simple dual-sampling framework for\naccelerating diffusion models losslessly. The key insight of Morse is to\nreformulate the iterative generation (from noise to data) process via taking\nadvantage of fast jump sampling and adaptive residual feedback strategies.\nSpecifically, Morse involves two models called Dash and Dot that interact with\neach other. The Dash model is just the pre-trained diffusion model of any type,\nbut operates in a jump sampling regime, creating sufficient space for sampling\nefficiency improvement. The Dot model is significantly faster than the Dash\nmodel, which is learnt to generate residual feedback conditioned on the\nobservations at the current jump sampling point on the trajectory of the Dash\nmodel, lifting the noise estimate to easily match the next-step estimate of the\nDash model without jump sampling. By chaining the outputs of the Dash and Dot\nmodels run in a time-interleaved fashion, Morse exhibits the merit of flexibly\nattaining desired image generation performance while improving overall runtime\nefficiency. With our proposed weight sharing strategy between the Dash and Dot\nmodels, Morse is efficient for training and inference. Our method shows a\nlossless speedup of 1.78X to 3.31X on average over a wide range of sampling\nstep budgets relative to 9 baseline diffusion models on 6 image generation\ntasks. Furthermore, we show that our method can be also generalized to improve\nthe Latent Consistency Model (LCM-SDXL, which is already accelerated with\nconsistency distillation technique) tailored for few-step text-to-image\nsynthesis.

However, designing effective TFs remains\nunintuitive due to the semantic gap between user intent and TF parameter space.\nResearchers have developed numerous TF optimization methods to bridge this gap.\nHowever, existing methods still face two challenges: large exploration space\nand weak generalizability. To address these issues, we propose What You Think\nis What You Get (WYTWYG) framework, which leveraging Multi-model Large Language\nModels (MLLMs) to guide the TF optimization based on user intent.

The key challenge of this task lies in the inherent\ncomplexities of two-person dance interactions, where the partners need to\nsynchronize both with each other and with the music. Inspired by the recent\nadvances in motion synthesis, we propose a two-stage solution: encoding\ntwo-person motions into discrete tokens and then generating these tokens from\nmusic. To effectively capture intricate interactions, we represent both\ndancers' motions as a unified whole to learn the necessary motion tokens, and\nadopt a coarse-to-fine learning strategy in both the stages. Our first stage\nutilizes a VQ-VAE that hierarchically separates high-level semantic features at\na coarse temporal resolution from low-level details at a finer resolution,\nproducing two discrete token sequences at different abstraction levels.\nSubsequently, in the second stage, two generative masked transformers learn to\nmap music signals to these dance tokens: the first producing high-level\nsemantic tokens, and the second, conditioned on music and these semantic\ntokens, producing the low-level tokens. We train both transformers to learn to\npredict randomly masked tokens within the sequence, enabling them to\niteratively generate motion tokens by filling an empty token sequence during\ninference. Through the hierarchical masked modeling and dedicated interaction\nrepresentation, DuetGen achieves the generation of synchronized and interactive\ntwo-person dances across various genres.

Existing literature\non improving efficiency mainly adheres to the before-reasoning paradigms such\nas prompting and reasoning or fine-tuning and reasoning, but ignores the\npromising direction of directly encouraging the model to speak concisely by\nintervening during the generation of reasoning. In order to fill the blank, we\npropose a framework dubbed ConciseHint, which continuously encourages the\nreasoning model to speak concisely by injecting the textual hint (manually\ndesigned or trained on the concise data) during the token generation of the\nreasoning process. Besides, ConciseHint is adaptive to the complexity of the\nquery by adaptively adjusting the hint intensity, which ensures it will not\nundermine model performance.
