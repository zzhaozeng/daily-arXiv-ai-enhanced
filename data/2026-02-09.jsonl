However, advertising fatigue reduces the effectiveness of repeated slogans, creating a growing demand for novel, creative, and insightful slogan generation. While recent work leverages large language models (LLMs) for this task, existing approaches often produce stylistically redundant outputs that lack a clear brand persona and appear overtly machine-generated. We argue that effective slogans should balance novelty with familiarity and propose a new paradigm that recontextualizes persona-related famous quotes for slogan generation. Well-known quotes naturally align with slogan-length text, employ rich rhetorical devices, and offer depth and insight, making them a powerful resource for creative generation. Technically, we introduce a modular framework that decomposes slogan generation into interpretable subtasks, including quote matching, structural decomposition, vocabulary replacement, and remix generation. Extensive automatic and human evaluations demonstrate marginal improvements in diversity, novelty, emotional impact, and human preference over three state-of-the-art LLM baselines."}

Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) is a widely adopted solution that enhances LVLMs by providing additional contexts from an external Knowledge Base. However, we observe that previous decoding methods for RAG are sub-optimal as they fail to sufficiently leverage multiple relevant contexts and suppress the negative effects of irrelevant contexts. To this end, we propose Relevance-aware Multi-context Contrastive Decoding (RMCD), a novel decoding method for RAG. RMCD outputs a final prediction by combining outputs predicted with each context, where each output is weighted based on its relevance to the question. By doing so, RMCD effectively aggregates useful information from multiple relevant contexts while also counteracting the negative effects of irrelevant ones. Experiments show that RMCD consistently outperforms other decoding methods across multiple LVLMs, achieving the best performance on three knowledge-intensive visual question-answering benchmarks. Also, RMCD can be simply applied by replacing the decoding method of LVLMs without additional training. Analyses also show that RMCD is robust to the retrieval results, consistently performing the best across the weakest to the strongest retrieval results.

However, most agent memory systems only emphasize semantic recall and treat experience as structures such as key-value, vector, or graph, which makes them struggle to represent and retrieve coherent events. To address this challenge, we propose a Character-and-Scene based memory architecture(CAST) inspired by dramatic theory. Specifically, CAST constructs 3D scenes (time/place/topic) and organizes them into character profiles that summarize the events of a character to represent episodic memory. Moreover, CAST complements this episodic memory with a graph-based semantic memory, which yields a robust dual memory design. Experiments demonstrate that CAST has averagely improved 8.11% F1 and 10.21% J(LLM-as-a-Judge) than baselines on various datasets, especially on open and time-sensitive conversational questions."}

Memory, with hundreds of papers released this year, therefore emerges as the critical solution to fill the utility gap. In this survey, we provide a unified view of foundation agent memory along three dimensions: memory substrate (internal and external), cognitive mechanism (episodic, semantic, sensory, working, and procedural), and memory subject (agent- and user-centric). We then analyze how memory is instantiated and operated under different agent topologies and highlight learning policies over memory operations.

Decoupling rollout generation from policy optimization (e.g., leveraging a more efficient model to rollout) could enable substantial efficiency gains, yet doing so introduces a severe distribution mismatch that destabilizes learning. We propose Jackpot, a framework that leverages Optimal Budget Rejection Sampling (OBRS) to directly reduce the discrepancy between the rollout model and the evolving policy. Jackpot integrates a principled OBRS procedure, a unified training objective that jointly updates the policy and rollout models, and an efficient system implementation enabled by top-$k$ probability estimation and batch-level bias correction. Our theoretical analysis shows that OBRS consistently moves the rollout distribution closer to the target distribution under a controllable acceptance budget. Empirically, \\sys substantially improves training stability compared to importance-sampling baselines, achieving performance comparable to on-policy RL when training Qwen3-8B-Base for up to 300 update steps of batchsize 64. Taken together, our results show that OBRS-based alignment brings us a step closer to practical and effective decoupling of rollout generation from policy optimization for RL for LLMs."}

PersonaPlex is trained on a large-scale synthetic dataset of paired prompts and user-agent conversations, generated with open-source large language models (LLM) and text-to-speech (TTS) models.

Despite these advances, significant reasoning failures persist, occurring even in seemingly simple scenarios. To systematically understand and address these shortcomings, we present the first comprehensive survey dedicated to reasoning failures in LLMs. We introduce a novel categorization framework that distinguishes reasoning into embodied and non-embodied types, with the latter further subdivided into informal (intuitive) and formal (logical) reasoning. In parallel, we classify reasoning failures along a complementary axis into three types: fundamental failures intrinsic to LLM architectures that broadly affect downstream tasks; application-specific limitations that manifest in particular domains; and robustness issues characterized by inconsistent performance across minor variations. For each reasoning failure, we provide a clear definition, analyze existing studies, explore root causes, and present mitigation strategies. By unifying fragmented research efforts, our survey provides a structured perspective on systemic weaknesses in LLM reasoning, offering valuable insights and guiding future research towards building stronger, more reliable, and robust reasoning capabilities. We additionally release a comprehensive collection of research works on LLM reasoning failures, as a GitHub repository at https://github.com/Peiyang-Song/Awesome-LLM-Reasoning-Failures, to provide an easy entry point to this area."}

Using nearly 80K novelty-annotated reviews from top-tier AI conferences, we fine-tune a large language model to capture reviewer-aligned novelty evaluation behavior. For a given manuscript, the system extracts structured representations of its ideas, methods, and claims, retrieves semantically related papers, and constructs a similarity graph that enables fine-grained, concept-level comparison to prior work. Conditioning on this structured evidence, the model produces calibrated novelty scores and human-like explanatory assessments, reducing overestimation and improving consistency relative to existing approaches."}

Our approach leverages Linear Temporal Logic Modulo Theories over finite traces (LTLfMT), a more expressive extension of classical temporal logic in which predicates are first-order formulas of arbitrary first-order theories rather than simple Boolean variables. This enhanced expressiveness enables the specification of complex tasks over unstructured and heterogeneous data domains, promoting a unified and reusable framework that eliminates the need for manual predicate encoding. However, the increased expressive power of LTLfMT introduces additional theoretical and computational challenges compared to standard LTLf specifications. We address these challenges from a theoretical standpoint, identifying a fragment of LTLfMT that is tractable but sufficiently expressive for reward specification in an infinite-state-space context. From a practical perspective, we introduce a method based on reward machines and Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) to translate first-order logic specifications and address reward sparsity. We evaluate this approach to a continuous-control setting using Non-Linear Arithmetic Theory, showing that it enables natural specification of complex tasks. Experimental results show how a tailored implementation of HER is fundamental in solving tasks with complex goals."}

These restrictions render them insufficient for many subjective tasks such as toxicity and hate-speech detection. For this reason, we introduce a quantifiable metric, paired with a statistical significance test, that attributes polarization to various annotator groups. Our metric enables direct comparisons between heavily imbalanced sociodemographic and ideological subgroups across different datasets and tasks, while also enabling analysis on multi-label settings. We apply this metric to three datasets on hate speech, and one on toxicity detection, discovering that: (1) Polarization is strongly and persistently attributed to annotator race, especially on the hate speech task. (2) Religious annotators do not fundamentally disagree with each other, but do with other annotators, a trend that is gradually diminished and then reversed with irreligious annotators. (3) Less educated annotators are more subjective, while educated ones tend to broadly agree more between themselves. Overall, our results reflect current findings around annotation patterns for various subgroups. Finally, we estimate the minimum number of annotators needed to obtain robust results, and provide an open-source Python library that implements our metric."}

Revocable decoding mitigates this by rechecking earlier tokens, yet we observe that existing verification schemes frequently trigger flip-flop oscillations, where tokens are remasked and later restored unchanged. This behaviour slows inference in two ways: remasking verified positions weakens the conditioning context for parallel drafting, and repeated remask cycles consume the revision budget with little net progress. We propose COVER (Cache Override Verification for Efficient Revision), which performs leave-one-out verification and stable drafting within a single forward pass. COVER constructs two attention views via KV cache override: selected seeds are masked for verification, while their cached key value states are injected for all other queries to preserve contextual information, with a closed form diagonal correction preventing self leakage at the seed positions. COVER further prioritises seeds using a stability aware score that balances uncertainty, downstream influence, and cache drift, and it adapts the number of verified seeds per step. Across benchmarks, COVER markedly reduces unnecessary revisions and yields faster decoding while preserving output quality."}

They lack long-context evaluation, offer insufficient challenge, and provide answers that are difficult to verify programmatically. We introduce GrAlgoBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LRMs through graph algorithm problems. Such problems are particularly well suited for probing reasoning abilities: they demand long-context reasoning, allow fine-grained control of difficulty levels, and enable standardized, programmatic evaluation. Across nine tasks, our systematic experiments reveal two major weaknesses of current LRMs. First, accuracy deteriorates sharply as context length increases, falling below 50% once graphs exceed 120 nodes. This degradation is driven by frequent execution errors, weak memory, and redundant reasoning. Second, LRMs suffer from an over-thinking phenomenon, primarily caused by extensive yet largely ineffective self-verification, which inflates reasoning traces without improving correctness. By exposing these limitations, GrAlgoBench establishes graph algorithm problems as a rigorous, multidimensional, and practically relevant testbed for advancing the study of reasoning in LRMs. Code is available at https://github.com/Bklight999/GrAlgoBench."}

Chen"], "title": "Uncertainty Drives Social Bias Changes in Quantized Large Language Models", "comment": "12 pages, 6 figures", "summary": "Post-training quantization reduces the computational cost of large language models but fundamentally alters their social biases in ways that aggregate metrics fail to capture. We present the first large-scale study of 50 quantized models evaluated on PostTrainingBiasBench, a unified benchmark of 13 closed- and open-ended bias datasets. We identify a phenomenon we term quantization-induced masked bias flipping, in which up to 21% of responses flip between biased and unbiased states after quantization, despite showing no change in aggregate bias scores. These flips are strongly driven by model uncertainty, where the responses with high uncertainty are 3-11x more likely to change than the confident ones. Quantization strength amplifies this effect, with 4-bit quantized models exhibiting 4-6x more behavioral changes than 8-bit quantized models. Critically, these changes create asymmetric impacts across demographic groups, where bias can worsen by up to 18.6% for some groups while improving by 14.1% for others, yielding misleadingly neutral aggregate outcomes. Larger models show no consistent robustness advantage, and group-specific shifts vary unpredictably across model families. Our findings demonstrate that compression fundamentally alters bias patterns, requiring crucial post-quantization evaluation and interventions to ensure reliability in practice."}

Recent attention-based alternatives exploit localization signals in MLLMs attention mechanisms without task-specific fine-tuning, but suffer from low reliability due to the lack of explicit and complementary spatial anchors in GUI images. To address this limitation, we propose Trifuse, an attention-based grounding framework that explicitly integrates complementary spatial anchors. Trifuse integrates attention, OCR-derived textual cues, and icon-level caption semantics via a Consensus-SinglePeak (CS) fusion strategy that enforces cross-modal agreement while retaining sharp localization peaks. Extensive evaluations on four grounding benchmarks demonstrate that Trifuse achieves strong performance without task-specific fine-tuning, substantially reducing the reliance on expensive annotated data. Moreover, ablation studies reveal that incorporating OCR and caption cues consistently improves attention-based grounding performance across different backbones, highlighting its effectiveness as a general framework for GUI grounding."}

However, GRPO frequently suffers from gradient signal attenuation when encountering problems that are either too trivial or overly complex. In these scenarios, the disappearance of inter-group advantages makes the gradient signal susceptible to noise, thereby jeopardizing convergence stability. While variants like DAPO attempt to rectify gradient vanishing, they do not alleviate the substantial computational overhead incurred by exhaustive rollouts on low-utility samples. In this paper, we propose Difficulty-Estimated Policy Optimization (DEPO), a novel framework designed to optimize the efficiency and robustness of reasoning alignment. DEPO integrates an online Difficulty Estimator that dynamically assesses and filters training data before the rollout phase. This mechanism ensures that computational resources are prioritized for samples with high learning potential. Empirical results demonstrate that DEPO achieves up to a 2x reduction in rollout costs without compromising model performance. Our approach significantly lowers the computational barrier for training high-performance reasoning models, offering a more sustainable path for reasoning scaling.

Conventional explanations primarily attribute this phenomenon to task complexity, such as combinatorial search explosion or long-term credit assignment challenges. In this work, we argue that these explanations are incomplete: even in linear, unbranched tasks without semantic ambiguity, autoregressive execution is subject to an intrinsic stability limit.\n  We propose that the fundamental constraint on long-horizon reasoning arises from process-level instability in autoregressive generation rather than solely from search or task complexity, reframing long-horizon reasoning as a problem of structural governance. We derive Theorem~A, showing that decision advantage in single-path autoregressive reasoning decays exponentially with execution length, imposing a fundamental bound on maintainable reasoning chains. This result implies a structural consequence: stable long-horizon reasoning requires discrete segmentation, naturally inducing graph-like execution structures such as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).\n  Empirical studies in both synthetic environments and real TextWorld tasks reveal observable performance cliffs consistent with theoretical predictions. Our findings provide a dynamical perspective on long-horizon reasoning failure and suggest new limitations on maintaining long-term coherence under purely autoregressive architectures. Furthermore, we highlight that short-horizon evaluation protocols may obscure structural instability, indicating a potential shift from scaling toward structured governance in future reasoning systems."}

In this paper, we present the first systematic study on training agentic models at the 4B-parameter scale. We identify three primary bottlenecks hindering the performance of edge-scale models: catastrophic forgetting during Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), sensitivity to reward signal noise during Reinforcement Learning (RL), and reasoning degradation caused by redundant information in long-context scenarios. To address the issues, we propose AgentCPM-Explore, a compact 4B agent model with high knowledge density and strong exploration capability. We introduce a holistic training framework featuring parameter-space model fusion, reward signal denoising, and contextual information refinement. Through deep exploration, AgentCPM-Explore achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among 4B-class models, matches or surpasses 8B-class SOTA models on four benchmarks, and even outperforms larger-scale models such as Claude-4.5-Sonnet or DeepSeek-v3.2 in five benchmarks.

Although large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in reasoning over textual transcriptions for emotion recognition, they typically neglect fine-grained prosodic information, limiting their effectiveness and interpretability. In this work, we propose VowelPrompt, a linguistically grounded framework that augments LLM-based emotion recognition with interpretable, fine-grained vowel-level prosodic cues. Drawing on phonetic evidence that vowels serve as primary carriers of affective prosody, VowelPrompt extracts pitch-, energy-, and duration-based descriptors from time-aligned vowel segments, and converts these features into natural language descriptions for better interpretability. Such a design enables LLMs to jointly reason over lexical semantics and fine-grained prosodic variation. Moreover, we adopt a two-stage adaptation procedure comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR), implemented via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to enhance reasoning capability, enforce structured output adherence, and improve generalization across domains and speaker variations. Extensive evaluations across diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that VowelPrompt consistently outperforms state-of-the-art emotion recognition methods under zero-shot, fine-tuned, cross-domain, and cross-linguistic conditions, while enabling the generation of interpretable explanations that are jointly grounded in contextual semantics and fine-grained prosodic structure."}

Combining BTs with RL has the potential for mutual benefit: a BT design encodes structured domain knowledge that can simplify RL training, while RL enables automatic learning of the controllers within BTs. However, naive integration of BTs and RL can lead to some controllers counteracting other controllers, possibly undoing previously achieved subgoals, thereby degrading the overall performance. To address this, we propose progress constraints, a novel mechanism where feasibility estimators constrain the allowed action set based on theoretical BT convergence results.

Building on this idea, we propose \\textbf{Consequence-Based Utility}, an oracle-free evaluator that scores each candidate by testing its value as an in-context exemplar in solving related yet verifiable questions. Our approach is evaluated on an original set of research-level math problems, each paired with one expert-written solution and nine LLM-generated solutions.

Motivated by the observation that the optimal balance is phase-dependent and that correct and incorrect reasoning paths often diverge only at late stages, we reformulate test-time scaling as a dynamic expand-reduce control problem over a pool of hypotheses. We propose HyPER, a training-free online control policy for multi-path decoding in mixture-of-experts models that reallocates computation under a fixed budget using lightweight path statistics. HyPER consists of an online controller that transitions from exploration to exploitation as the hypothesis pool evolves, a token-level refinement mechanism that enables efficient generation-time exploitation without full-path resampling, and a length- and confidence-aware aggregation strategy for reliable answer-time exploitation. Experiments on four mixture-of-experts language models across diverse reasoning benchmarks show that HyPER consistently achieves a superior accuracy-compute trade-off, improving accuracy by 8 to 10 percent while reducing token usage by 25 to 40 percent."}

These failures are compounded by rigid evaluation metrics that conflate genuine structural errors with acceptable variation. In this work, we present a systems-oriented approach to spoken CSW parsing. We introduce a linguistically grounded taxonomy of spoken CSW phenomena and SpokeBench, an expert-annotated gold benchmark designed to test spoken-language structure beyond standard UD assumptions. We further propose FLEX-UD, an ambiguity-aware evaluation metric, which reveals that existing parsing techniques perform poorly on spoken CSW by penalizing linguistically plausible analyses as errors. We then propose DECAP, a decoupled agentic parsing framework that isolates spoken-phenomena handling from core syntactic analysis. Experiments show that DECAP produces more robust and interpretable parses without retraining and achieves up to 52.6% improvements over existing parsing techniques. FLEX-UD evaluations further reveal qualitative improvements that are masked by standard metrics."}

We find that REINFORCE with Group Relative Advantage Estimation (GRAE) can converge to the globally optimal under undiscounted conditions, but the combination of PPO & GRAE breaks PPO's original monotonic improvement property.

Applying this framework to modern VLMs across the SEEDBench, MMMU, and POPE datasets reveals three distinct failure modes. First, models frequently preserve predicted answers while undergoing substantial internal representation drift; for perturbations such as text overlays, this drift approaches the magnitude of inter-image variability, indicating that representations move to regions typically occupied by unrelated inputs despite unchanged outputs. Second, robustness does not improve with scale; larger models achieve higher accuracy but exhibit equal or greater sensitivity, consistent with sharper yet more fragile decision boundaries. Third, we find that perturbations affect tasks differently: they harm reasoning when they disrupt how models combine coarse and fine visual cues, but on the hallucination benchmarks, they can reduce false positives by making models generate more conservative answers."}

We present FMBench, a benchmark for adaptive Markdown output formatting that evaluates models under a wide range of instruction-following scenarios with diverse structural requirements. FMBench emphasizes real-world formatting behaviors such as multi-level organization, mixed content (natural language interleaved with lists/tables/code), and strict adherence to user-specified layout constraints. To improve Markdown compliance without relying on hard decoding constraints, we propose a lightweight alignment pipeline that combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement learning fine-tuning. Starting from a base model, we first perform SFT on instruction-response pairs, and then optimize a composite objective that balances semantic fidelity with structural correctness. Experiments on two model families (OpenPangu and Qwen) show that SFT consistently improves semantic alignment, while reinforcement learning provides additional gains in robustness to challenging Markdown instructions when initialized from a strong SFT policy. Our results also reveal an inherent trade-off between semantic and structural objectives, highlighting the importance of carefully designed rewards for reliable formatted generation.

We consider tasks specified as linear temporal logic (LTL) formulae, which are commonly used in formal methods to specify properties of systems, and have recently been successfully adopted in RL. In this setting, we present a novel task embedding technique leveraging a new generation of semantic LTL-to-automata translations, originally developed for temporal synthesis. The resulting semantically labelled automata contain rich, structured information in each state that allow us to (i) compute the automaton efficiently on-the-fly, (ii) extract expressive task embeddings used to condition the policy, and (iii) naturally support full LTL.

However, they still recompute the attention and feed-forward blocks for every token position at every step -- even when many unmasked tokens are essentially fixed, resulting in substantial waste in compute. We propose SureLock: when the posterior at an unmasked position has stabilized across steps (our sure condition), we lock that position -- thereafter skipping its query projection and feed-forward sublayers -- while caching its attention keys and values so other positions can continue to attend to it. This reduces the dominant per-iteration computational cost from $O(N^2d)$ to $O(MNd)$ where $N$ is the sequence length, $M$ is the number of unlocked token positions, and $d$ is the model dimension. In practice, $M$ decreases as the iteration progresses, yielding substantial savings. On LLaDA-8B, SureLock reduces algorithmic FLOPs by 30--50% relative to the same sampler without locking, while maintaining comparable generation quality. We also provide a theoretical analysis to justify the design rationale of SureLock: monitoring only the local KL at the lock step suffices to bound the deviation in final token probabilities.

We present the first systematic analysis of what SSM-based code models actually learn and perform the first comparative analysis of SSM and Transformer-based code models. Our analysis reveals that SSMs outperform Transformers at capturing code syntax and semantics in pretraining but forgets certain syntactic and semantic relations during fine-tuning on task, especially when the task emphasizes short-range dependencies. To diagnose this, we introduce SSM-Interpret, a frequency-domain framework that exposes a spectral shift toward short-range dependencies during fine-tuning. Guided by these findings, we propose architectural modifications that significantly improve the performance of SSM-based code model, validating that our analysis directly enables better models."}

Humor generation, especially in multi-modal scenarios, is a challenging task for large language models (LLMs), which is typically as funny caption generation for images, requiring visual understanding, humor reasoning, creative imagination, and so on. Existing LLM-based approaches rely on reasoning chains or self-improvement, which suffer from limited creativity and interpretability. To address these bottlenecks, we develop a novel LLM-based humor generation mechanism based on a fundamental humor theory, GTVH. To produce funny and script-opposite captions, we introduce a humor-theory-driven multi-role LLM collaboration framework augmented with humor retrieval (HOMER). The framework consists of three LLM-based roles: (1) conflicting-script extractor that grounds humor in key script oppositions, forming the basis of caption generation; (2) retrieval-augmented hierarchical imaginator that identifies key humor targets and expands the creative space of them through diverse associations structured as imagination trees; and (3) caption generator that produces funny and diverse captions conditioned on the obtained knowledge. Extensive experiments on two New Yorker Cartoon benchmarking datasets show that HOMER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and powerful LLM reasoning strategies on multi-modal humor captioning."}

Active concept learning must balance informativeness of queries against the stability of the learner that generates and scores hypotheses. We study this trade-off in a neuro-symbolic Bayesian learner whose hypotheses are executable programs proposed by a large language model (LLM) and reweighted by Bayesian updating. We compare a Rational Active Learner that selects queries to maximize approximate expected information gain (EIG) and the human-like Positive Test Strategy (PTS) that queries instances predicted to be positive under the current best hypothesis. Across concept-learning tasks in the classic Number Game, EIG is effective when falsification is necessary (e.g., compound or exception-laden rules), but underperforms on simple concepts. We trace this failure to a support mismatch between the EIG policy and the LLM proposal distribution: highly diagnostic boundary queries drive the posterior toward regions where the generator produces invalid or overly specific programs, yielding a support-mismatch trap in the particle approximation. PTS is information-suboptimal but tends to maintain proposal validity by selecting \"safe\" queries, leading to faster convergence on simple rules. Our results suggest that \"confirmation bias\" may not be a cognitive error, but rather a rational adaptation for maintaining tractable inference in the sparse, open-ended hypothesis spaces characteristic of human thought."}

Prior jailbreaking research has explored diverse approaches, including prompt optimization, automated red teaming, obfuscation, and reinforcement learning (RL) based methods.

Since jailbreaking involves sequential interactions in which each response influences future actions, reinforcement learning provides a natural framework for this problem. Motivated by this, we propose a history-aware RL-based jailbreak framework that analyzes and reweights vulnerability signals from prior steps to guide future decisions. We show that incorporating historical information alone improves jailbreak success rates. Building on this insight, we introduce an attention-based reweighting mechanism that highlights critical vulnerabilities within the interaction history, enabling more efficient exploration with fewer queries.

POP partitions model channels into retained, candidate, and pruned regions, where prefilling defines a coarse pruning partition, and the decoding stage generates a fine-grained mask within the candidate region, avoiding full-channel re-evaluation. The coarse pruning partition preserves consistently important weights, while the fine-grained masking provides context-conditioned variation during decoding. Moreover, POP is a lightweight, plug-and-play method that requires no preprocessing, including offline calibration, retraining, or learning predictors.

Here we introduce ClinMPO, a reinforcement learning framework designed to align the internal reasoning of LLMs with professional psychiatric practice. The framework employs a specialized reward model trained independently on a dataset derived from 4,474 psychiatry journal articles and structured according to evidence-based medicine principles. We evaluated ClinMPO on a unseen subset of the benchmark designed to isolate reasoning capabilities from rote memorization. This test set comprises items where leading large-parameter LLMs consistently fail. We compared the ClinMPO-aligned light LLM performance against a cohort of 300 medical students. The ClinMPO-tuned Qwen3-8B model achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 31.4% and surpassed the human benchmark of 30.8% on these complex cases.

To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive differentially private federated learning framework that explicitly targets model efficiency under heterogeneous and privacy-constrained settings. On the client side, a lightweight local compressed module is introduced to regularize intermediate representations and constrain gradient variability, thereby mitigating noise amplification during local optimization. On the server side, an adaptive gradient clipping strategy dynamically adjusts clipping thresholds based on historical update statistics to avoid over-clipping and noise domination. Furthermore, a constraint-aware aggregation mechanism is designed to suppress unreliable or noise-dominated client updates and stabilize global optimization.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled agentic AI systems whose behaviour unfolds over multi-step trajectories. In these settings, success and failure are determined by sequences of decisions rather than a single output. While useful, it remains unclear how explanation approaches designed for static predictions translate to agentic settings where behaviour emerges over time. In this work, we bridge the gap between static and agentic explainability by comparing attribution-based explanations with trace-based diagnostics across both settings. To make this distinction explicit, we empirically compare attribution-based explanations used in static classification tasks with trace-based diagnostics used in agentic benchmarks (TAU-bench Airline and AssistantBench). Our results show that while attribution methods achieve stable feature rankings in static settings (Spearman $ρ= 0.86$), they cannot be applied reliably to diagnose execution-level failures in agentic trajectories. In contrast, trace-grounded rubric evaluation for agentic settings consistently localizes behaviour breakdowns and reveals that state tracking inconsistency is 2.7$\\times$ more prevalent in failed runs and reduces success probability by 49\\%.

As a result, recent work is increasing the focus on continual learning from real-world deployment, where user interaction logs provide a rich source of authentic human feedback and procedural knowledge. However, learning from user logs is challenging due to their unstructured and noisy nature. Vanilla LLM systems often struggle to distinguish useful feedback signals from noisy user behavior, and the disparity between user log collection and model optimization (e.g., the off-policy optimization problem) further strengthens the problem. To this end, we propose UNO (User log-driveN Optimization), a unified framework for improving LLM systems (LLMsys) with user logs. UNO first distills logs into semi-structured rules and preference pairs, then employs query-and-feedback-driven clustering to manage data heterogeneity, and finally quantifies the cognitive gap between the model's prior knowledge and the log data. This assessment guides the LLMsys to adaptively filter out noisy feedback and construct different modules for primary and reflective experiences extracted from user logs, thereby improving future responses.

Motivated by recent results that residual wide-narrow-wide (hourglass) MLPs offer superior function approximation capabilities, we revisit the long-standing MLP shape convention in Transformer, challenging the necessity of the narrow-wide-narrow design. To study this, we develop a Transformer variant that replaces the conventional FFN with a deeper hourglass-shaped FFN, comprising a stack of hourglass sub-MLPs connected by residual pathways. We posit that a deeper but lighter hourglass FFN can serve as a competitive alternative to the conventional FFN, and that parameters saved by using a lighter hourglass FFN can be more effectively utilized, such as by enlarging model hidden dimensions under fixed budgets. We confirm these through empirical validations across model scales: hourglass FFNs outperform conventional FFNs up to 400M and achieve comparable performance at larger scales to 1B parameters; hourglass FFN variants with reduced FFN and increased attention parameters show consistent improvements over conventional configurations at matched budgets. Together, these findings shed new light on recent work and prompt a rethinking of the narrow-wide-narrow MLP convention and the balance between attention and FFN towards efficient and expressive modern language models."}

However, advertising fatigue reduces the effectiveness of repeated slogans, creating a growing demand for novel, creative, and insightful slogan generation. While recent work leverages large language models (LLMs) for this task, existing approaches often produce stylistically redundant outputs that lack a clear brand persona and appear overtly machine-generated. We argue that effective slogans should balance novelty with familiarity and propose a new paradigm that recontextualizes persona-related famous quotes for slogan generation. Well-known quotes naturally align with slogan-length text, employ rich rhetorical devices, and offer depth and insight, making them a powerful resource for creative generation. Technically, we introduce a modular framework that decomposes slogan generation into interpretable subtasks, including quote matching, structural decomposition, vocabulary replacement, and remix generation. Extensive automatic and human evaluations demonstrate marginal improvements in diversity, novelty, emotional impact, and human preference over three state-of-the-art LLM baselines."}

Memory, with hundreds of papers released this year, therefore emerges as the critical solution to fill the utility gap.

Revocable decoding mitigates this by rechecking earlier tokens, yet we observe that existing verification schemes frequently trigger flip-flop oscillations, where tokens are remasked and later restored unchanged. This behaviour slows inference in two ways: remasking verified positions weakens the conditioning context for parallel drafting, and repeated remask cycles consume the revision budget with little net progress. We propose COVER (Cache Override Verification for Efficient Revision), which performs leave-one-out verification and stable drafting within a single forward pass. COVER constructs two attention views via KV cache override: selected seeds are masked for verification, while their cached key value states are injected for all other queries to preserve contextual information, with a closed form diagonal correction preventing self leakage at the seed positions. COVER further prioritises seeds using a stability aware score that balances uncertainty, downstream influence, and cache drift, and it adapts the number of verified seeds per step. Across benchmarks, COVER markedly reduces unnecessary revisions and yields faster decoding while preserving output quality."}

We factorize reasoning into a continuous latent thought vector (what to reason about) and a decoder that verbalizes the trace conditioned on this vector (how to reason). Beyond serving as a declarative buffer, latent thought vectors compress the reasoning structure into a continuous representation that abstracts away surface-level token variability, making gradient-based optimization over reasoning strategies well-posed. Our prior model maps unstructured noise to a learned manifold of valid reasoning patterns, and at test time we employ a Gibbs-style procedure that alternates between generating a candidate trace and optimizing the latent vector to better explain that trace, effectively navigating the latent manifold to refine the reasoning strategy. Training a 0.2B-parameter model from scratch on GSM8K, our method with 30 rethinking iterations surpasses baselines with 10 to 15 times more parameters, including a 3B counterpart. This result demonstrates that effective mathematical reasoning can emerge from sophisticated inference-time computation rather than solely from massive parameter counts."}

We introduce CauGym, a comprehensive dataset comprising seven core causal tasks for training and five diverse test sets. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluate five post-training approaches: SFT, DPO, KTO, PPO, and GRPO. Across five in-domain and four existing benchmarks, our experiments demonstrate that appropriate post-training enables smaller LLMs to perform causal inference competitively, often surpassing much larger models.

Recent work has addressed this problem by scaling self-consistency and parallel thinking, adding generic ``thinking tokens'' and prompting models to re-read the question before answering. Unfortunately, these approaches either inject task-agnostic tokens or mandate heuristics that do not explain -- and often ignore -- the \\emph{spontaneous} repetition that many LRMs exhibit at the head of their internal chains. In contrast, we analyze and harness the model's tendency to restate the question, which we term the \\emph{Echo of Prompt (EOP)}, as a front-loaded, compute-shaping mechanism. We formalize its probabilistic cost by casting echo removal as rejection-based conditioning and defining the \\emph{Echo Likelihood Gap} $Δ\\mathcal{L}$ as a computable proxy. This provides the missing theoretical link that links early repetition to likelihood gains and downstream accuracy. However, it does not by itself specify how to exploit EOP. Consequently, we develop \\emph{Echo-Distilled SFT (ED-SFT)} to instill an ``echo-then-reason'' pattern through supervised finetuning, and \\emph{Echoic Prompting (EP)} to re-ground the model mid-trace without training. While promising, quantifying benefits beyond verbosity is non-trivial. Therefore, we conduct length and suffix-controlled likelihood analyses together with layer-wise attention studies, showing that EOP increases answer to answer-prefix attention in middle layers, consistent with an \\emph{attention refocusing} mechanism.

This presents a serious safety challenge and can cause real-world harm. Toxicity is often subtle and context-dependent, making it difficult to detect at the token level or through coarse sentence-level signals. Moreover, efforts to mitigate toxicity often face a trade-off between safety and the coherence, or fluency of the generated text. In this work, we present a targeted subspace intervention strategy for identifying and suppressing hidden toxic patterns from underlying model representations, while preserving overall ability to generate safe fluent content. On the RealToxicityPrompts, our method achieves strong mitigation performance compared to existing baselines, with minimal impact on inference complexity. Across multiple LLMs, our approach reduces toxicity of state-of-the-art detoxification systems by 8-20%, while maintaining comparable fluency. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses, we show that our approach achieves effective toxicity reduction without impairing generative performance, consistently outperforming existing baselines."}

Since jailbreaking involves sequential interactions in which each response influences future actions, reinforcement learning provides a natural framework for this problem. Motivated by this, we propose a history-aware RL-based jailbreak framework that analyzes and reweights vulnerability signals from prior steps to guide future decisions. We show that incorporating historical information alone improves jailbreak success rates.

However, learning from user logs is challenging due to their unstructured and noisy nature. Vanilla LLM systems often struggle to distinguish useful feedback signals from noisy user behavior, and the disparity between user log collection and model optimization (e.g., the off-policy optimization problem) further strengthens the problem. To this end, we propose UNO (User log-driveN Optimization), a unified framework for improving LLM systems (LLMsys) with user logs. UNO first distills logs into semi-structured rules and preference pairs, then employs query-and-feedback-driven clustering to manage data heterogeneity, and finally quantifies the cognitive gap between the model's prior knowledge and the log data. This assessment guides the LLMsys to adaptively filter out noisy feedback and construct different modules for primary and reflective experiences extracted from user logs, thereby improving future responses.

Motivated by recent results that residual wide-narrow-wide (hourglass) MLPs offer superior function approximation capabilities, we revisit the long-standing MLP shape convention in Transformer, challenging the necessity of the narrow-wide-narrow design. To study this, we develop a Transformer variant that replaces the conventional FFN with a deeper hourglass-shaped FFN, comprising a stack of hourglass sub-MLPs connected by residual pathways. We posit that a deeper but lighter hourglass FFN can serve as a competitive alternative to the conventional FFN, and that parameters saved by using a lighter hourglass FFN can be more effectively utilized, such as by enlarging model hidden dimensions under fixed budgets. We confirm these through empirical validations across model scales: hourglass FFNs outperform conventional FFNs up to 400M and achieve comparable performance at larger scales to 1B parameters; hourglass FFN variants with reduced FFN and increased attention parameters show consistent improvements over conventional configurations at matched budgets. Together, these findings shed new light on recent work and prompt a rethinking of the narrow-wide-narrow MLP convention and the balance between attention and FFN towards efficient and expressive modern language models."}

We show that reasoning fidelity-the consistency between a GenRM's preference decision and reference decision rationales-is highly predictive of downstream RLHF outcomes, beyond standard label accuracy. Specifically, we repurpose existing reward-model benchmarks to compute Spurious Correctness (S-Corr)-the fraction of label-correct decisions with rationales misaligned with golden judgments. Our empirical evaluation reveals substantial S-Corr even for competitive GenRMs, and higher S-Corr is associated with policy degeneration under optimization. To improve fidelity, we propose Rationale-Centric Alignment, R-Align, which augments training with gold judgments and explicitly supervises rationale alignment. R-Align reduces S-Corr on RM benchmarks and yields consistent gains in actor performance across STEM, coding, instruction following, and general tasks."}

To better understand how lexical ambiguity can be resolved through the visual domain, we develop an interpretable Visual Word Sense Disambiguation (VWSD) framework. The model leverages CLIP to project ambiguous language and candidate images into a shared multimodal space. We enrich textual embeddings using a dual-channel ensemble of semantic and photo-based prompts with WordNet synonyms, while image embeddings are refined through robust test-time augmentations. We then use cosine similarity to determine the image that best aligns with the ambiguous text. When evaluated on the SemEval-2023 VWSD dataset, enriching the embeddings raises the MRR from 0.7227 to 0.7590 and the Hit Rate from 0.5810 to 0.6220. Ablation studies reveal that dual-channel prompting provides strong, low-latency performance, whereas aggressive image augmentation yields only marginal gains. Additional experiments with WordNet definitions and multilingual prompt ensembles further suggest that noisy external signals tend to dilute semantic specificity, reinforcing the effectiveness of precise, CLIP-aligned prompts for visual word sense disambiguation."}

Halluverse-M^3 covers four languages, English, Arabic, Hindi, and Turkish, and supports two generation tasks: question answering and dialogue summarization. The dataset explicitly distinguishes between entity-level, relation-level, and sentence-level hallucinations. Hallucinated outputs are constructed through a controlled editing process and validated by human annotators, ensuring clear alignment between original content and hallucinated generations.

Our results show that question answering is consistently easier than dialogue summarization, while sentence-level hallucinations remain challenging even for the strongest models. Performance is highest in English and degrades in lower-resource languages, with Hindi exhibiting the lowest detection accuracy.

Yet existing approaches break under exploration complexity and intent drift. We propose SEMA, a simple yet effective framework that trains a multi-turn attacker without relying on any existing strategies or external data. SEMA comprises two stages. Prefilling self-tuning enables usable rollouts by fine-tuning on non-refusal, well-structured, multi-turn adversarial prompts that are self-generated with a minimal prefix, thereby stabilizing subsequent learning. Reinforcement learning with intent-drift-aware reward trains the attacker to elicit valid multi-turn adversarial prompts while maintaining the same harmful objective. We anchor harmful intent in multi-turn jailbreaks via an intent-drift-aware reward that combines intent alignment, compliance risk, and level of detail. Our open-loop attack regime avoids dependence on victim feedback, unifies single- and multi-turn settings, and reduces exploration complexity. Across multiple datasets, victim models, and jailbreak judges, our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) attack success rates (ASR), outperforming all single-turn baselines, manually scripted and template-driven multi-turn baselines, as well as our SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) and DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) variants.

Prior studies have explored tokenizer families and vocabulary sizes but typically (i) vary vocabulary without systematically controlling the tokenizer's training corpus, (ii) provide limited intrinsic diagnostics, and (iii) evaluate a narrow slice of downstream tasks. We present the first comprehensive, principled study of Turkish subword tokenization; a \"subwords manifest\", that jointly varies vocabulary size and tokenizer training corpus size (data and vocabulary coupling), compares multiple tokenizer families under matched parameter budgets (WordPiece, morphology level, and character baselines), and evaluates across semantic (NLI, STS, sentiment analysis, NER), syntactic (POS, dependency parsing), and morphology-sensitive probes. To explain why tokenizers succeed or fail, we introduce a morphology-aware diagnostic toolkit that goes beyond coarse aggregates to boundary-level micro/macro F1, decoupled lemma atomicity vs. surface boundary hits, over/under-segmentation indices, character/word edit distances (CER/WER), continuation rates, and affix-type coverage and token-level atomicity. Our contributions are fourfold: (i) a systematic investigation of the vocabulary-corpus-success triad; (ii) a unified, morphology-aware evaluation framework linking intrinsic diagnostics to extrinsic outcomes; (iii) controlled comparisons identifying when character-level and morphology-level tokenization pay off; and (iv) an open-source release of evaluation code, tokenizer pipelines, and models.

While recent models show strong performance on English-centric benchmarks, their behavior across languages, tasks, and hallucination types is not yet well understood. In this work, we introduce Halluverse-M^3, a dataset designed to enable systematic analysis of hallucinations across multiple languages, multiple generation tasks, and multiple hallucination categories. Halluverse-M^3 covers four languages, English, Arabic, Hindi, and Turkish, and supports two generation tasks: question answering and dialogue summarization. The dataset explicitly distinguishes between entity-level, relation-level, and sentence-level hallucinations. Hallucinated outputs are constructed through a controlled editing process and validated by human annotators, ensuring clear alignment between original content and hallucinated generations. Using this dataset, we evaluate a diverse set of contemporary open-source and proprietary language models on fine-grained hallucination detection. Our results show that question answering is consistently easier than dialogue summarization, while sentence-level hallucinations remain challenging even for the strongest models. Performance is highest in English and degrades in lower-resource languages, with Hindi exhibiting the lowest detection accuracy. Overall, Halluverse-M^3 provides a realistic and challenging benchmark for studying hallucinations in multilingual, multi-task settings. We release the dataset to support future research on hallucination detection and mitigation\\footnote{https://huggingface.co/datasets/sabdalja/HalluVerse-M3}."}

Prior studies have explored tokenizer families and vocabulary sizes but typically (i) vary vocabulary without systematically controlling the tokenizer's training corpus, (ii) provide limited intrinsic diagnostics, and (iii) evaluate a narrow slice of downstream tasks. We present the first comprehensive, principled study of Turkish subword tokenization; a \"subwords manifest\", that jointly varies vocabulary size and tokenizer training corpus size (data and vocabulary coupling), compares multiple tokenizer families under matched parameter budgets (WordPiece, morphology level, and character baselines), and evaluates across semantic (NLI, STS, sentiment analysis, NER), syntactic (POS, dependency parsing), and morphology-sensitive probes. To explain why tokenizers succeed or fail, we introduce a morphology-aware diagnostic toolkit that goes beyond coarse aggregates to boundary-level micro/macro F1, decoupled lemma atomicity vs. surface boundary hits, over/under-segmentation indices, character/word edit distances (CER/WER), continuation rates, and affix-type coverage and token-level atomicity. Our contributions are fourfold: (i) a systematic investigation of the vocabulary-corpus-success triad; (ii) a unified, morphology-aware evaluation framework linking intrinsic diagnostics to extrinsic outcomes; (iii) controlled comparisons identifying when character-level and morphology-level tokenization pay off; and (iv) an open-source release of evaluation code, tokenizer pipelines, and models. As the first work of its kind, this \"subwords manifest\" delivers actionable guidance for building effective tokenizers in MRLs and establishes a reproducible foundation for future research."}

However, constrained by the quality--speed trade-off, existing inference solutions adopt conservative parallel strategies, leaving substantial efficiency potential underexplored. A core challenge is that parallel decoding assumes each position can be filled independently, but tokens are often semantically coupled. Thus, the correct choice at one position constrains valid choices at others. Without modeling these inter-token dependencies, parallel strategies produce deteriorated outputs. Motivated by this insight, we propose DAWN, a training-free, dependency-aware decoding method for fast dLLM inference. DAWN extracts token dependencies and leverages two key motivations: (1) positions dependent on unmasked certain positions become more reliable, (2) simultaneously unmasking strongly coupled uncertain positions induces errors. Given those findings, DAWN leverages a dependency graph to select more reliable unmasking positions at each iteration, achieving high parallelism with negligible loss in generation quality. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that DAWN speedups the inference by 1.80-8.06x over baselines while preserving the generation quality.

Published at TMLR 2026 with Survey Certification", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable reasoning capabilities, achieving impressive results across a wide range of tasks. Despite these advances, significant reasoning failures persist, occurring even in seemingly simple scenarios. To systematically understand and address these shortcomings, we present the first comprehensive survey dedicated to reasoning failures in LLMs. We introduce a novel categorization framework that distinguishes reasoning into embodied and non-embodied types, with the latter further subdivided into informal (intuitive) and formal (logical) reasoning. In parallel, we classify reasoning failures along a complementary axis into three types: fundamental failures intrinsic to LLM architectures that broadly affect downstream tasks; application-specific limitations that manifest in particular domains; and robustness issues characterized by inconsistent performance across minor variations. For each reasoning failure, we provide a clear definition, analyze existing studies, explore root causes, and present mitigation strategies. By unifying fragmented research efforts, our survey provides a structured perspective on systemic weaknesses in LLM reasoning, offering valuable insights and guiding future research towards building stronger, more reliable, and robust reasoning capabilities. We additionally release a comprehensive collection of research works on LLM reasoning failures, as a GitHub repository at https://github.com/Peiyang-Song/Awesome-LLM-Reasoning-Failures, to provide an easy entry point to this area."}

However, it remains unclear which core logical skills they truly master. To address this, we introduce LogicSkills, a unified benchmark designed to isolate three fundamental skills in formal reasoning: (i) $\\textit{formal symbolization}\\unicode{x2014}$translating premises into first-order logic; (ii) $\\textit{countermodel construction}\\unicode{x2014}$formulating a finite structure in which all premises are true while the conclusion is false; and (iii) $\\textit{validity assessment}\\unicode{x2014}$deciding whether a conclusion follows from a given set of premises. Items are drawn from the two-variable fragment of first-order logic (without identity) and are presented in both natural English and a Carroll-style language with nonce words. All examples are verified for correctness and non-triviality using the SMT solver Z3. Across leading models, performance is high on validity but substantially lower on symbolization and countermodel construction, suggesting reliance on surface-level patterns rather than genuine symbolic or rule-based reasoning."}

Most existing approaches follow a plan-then-write paradigm, whose performance heavily depends on the quality of the initial outline. However, constructing a comprehensive outline itself demands strong reasoning ability, causing current deep research systems to rely almost exclusively on closed-source or online large models. This reliance raises practical barriers to deployment and introduces safety and privacy concerns for user-authored data. In this work, we present AgentCPM-Report, a lightweight yet high-performing local solution composed of a framework that mirrors the human writing process and an 8B-parameter deep research agent. Our framework uses a Writing As Reasoning Policy (WARP), which enables models to dynamically revise outlines during report generation. Under this policy, the agent alternates between Evidence-Based Drafting and Reasoning-Driven Deepening, jointly supporting information acquisition, knowledge refinement, and iterative outline evolution. To effectively equip small models with this capability, we introduce a Multi-Stage Agentic Training strategy, consisting of cold-start, atomic skill RL, and holistic pipeline RL. Experiments on DeepResearch Bench, DeepConsult, and DeepResearch Gym demonstrate that AgentCPM-Report outperforms leading closed-source systems, with substantial gains in Insight."}
