A central\nquestion is whether undesirable behaviors like deception are localized\nfunctions that can be removed, or if they are deeply intertwined with a model's\ncore cognitive abilities. We introduce \"cyclic ablation,\" an iterative method\nto test this. By combining sparse autoencoders, targeted ablation, and\nadversarial training on DistilGPT-2, we attempted to eliminate the concept of\ndeception. We found that, contrary to the localization hypothesis, deception\nwas highly resilient. The model consistently recovered its deceptive behavior\nafter each ablation cycle via adversarial training, a process we term\nfunctional regeneration. Crucially, every attempt at this \"neurosurgery\" caused\na gradual but measurable decay in general linguistic performance, reflected by\na consistent rise in perplexity. These findings are consistent with the view\nthat complex concepts are distributed and entangled, underscoring the\nlimitations of direct model editing through mechanistic interpretability."}

Recent work has primarily focused on\nimproving faithfulness, defined as semantic alignment with supporting\ndocuments, which can cause models to rely excessively on external sources and\ndiminish their capacity for critical assessment. To address this, we propose\nthe Thinking-supervised Reward Model (TRM), which incorporates sentence-level\nthinking supervision to endow reward models with critical thinking abilities.\nGiven a query, answer, and supporting documents, TRM first assesses the\nfaithfulness of each answer sentence to the supporting documents, and then\napplies a reasoning step to evaluate sentence-level correctness.

However, naively\napplying those MLLMs for detection often leads to suboptimal performance. We\nargue that the root of this failure lies in a fundamental mismatch: MLLMs are\nasked to reason about fakes before they can truly see them. First, they do not\nreally see: existing MLLMs' vision encoders are primarily optimized for\nsemantic-oriented recognition rather than the perception of low-level signals,\nleaving them insensitive to subtle forgery traces. Without access to reliable\nperceptual evidence, the model grounds its judgment on incomplete and limited\nvisual observations. Second, existing finetuning data for detection typically\nuses narrow, instruction-style formats, which diverge sharply from the diverse,\nheterogeneous distributions seen in pretraining. In the absence of meaningful\nvisual cues, the model therefore exploits these linguistic shortcuts, resulting\nin catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge (even the basic dialogue\ncapabilities). In response, we advocate for a new paradigm: seeing before\nreasoning. We propose that MLLMs should first be trained to perceive\nartifacts-strengthening their artifact-aware visual perception-so that\nsubsequent reasoning is grounded in actual observations. We therefore propose\nForensic-Chat, a generalizable, explainable, and still-conversational (for\nmulti-round dialogue) assistant for fake image detection.

CVP allows users to\ndefine a simple \"world model\" for workflow modules through an intuitive\nlow-code interface, effectively creating a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that\nexplicitly defines the causal relationships between modules. This causal graph\nacts as a crucial constraint during the agent's reasoning process, anchoring\nits decisions to a user-defined causal structure and significantly reducing\nlogical errors and hallucinations by preventing reliance on spurious\ncorrelations. To validate the effectiveness of CVP, we designed a synthetic\nexperiment that simulates a common real-world problem: a distribution shift\nbetween the training and test environments.

Finding steering methods that\ntransfer across multiple VLMs is still an open area of research.

We thus present TDHook, an open-source,\nlightweight, generic interpretability framework based on $\\texttt{tensordict}$\nand applicable to any $\\texttt{torch}$ model. It focuses on handling complex\ncomposed models which can be trained for Computer Vision, Natural Language\nProcessing, Reinforcement Learning or any other domain. This library features\nready-to-use methods for attribution, probing and a flexible get-set API for\ninterventions, and is aiming to bridge the gap between these method classes to\nmake modern interpretability pipelines more accessible. TDHook is designed with\nminimal dependencies, requiring roughly half as much disk space as\n$\\texttt{transformer_lens}$, and, in our controlled benchmark, achieves up to a\n$\\times$2 speed-up over $\\texttt{captum}$ when running integrated gradients for\nmulti-target pipelines on both CPU and GPU.

Specifically: (i)\nmemorization cannot be explained by overfitting alone, as training loss is\nlarger under memorization due to classifier-free guidance amplifying\npredictions and inducing overestimation; (ii) memorized prompts inject training\nimages into noise predictions, forcing latent trajectories to converge and\nsteering denoising toward their paired samples; and (iii) a decomposition of\nintermediate latents reveals how initial randomness is quickly suppressed and\nreplaced by memorized content, with deviations from the theoretical denoising\nschedule correlating almost perfectly with memorization severity.

One popular modern approach is to use semantic IDs (SIDs),\nwhich are discrete codes quantized from the embeddings of modality encoders\n(e.g., large language or vision models), to represent items in an\nautoregressive user interaction sequence modeling setup (henceforth, SID-based\nGR). While generative models in other domains exhibit well-established scaling\nlaws, our work reveals that SID-based GR shows significant bottlenecks while\nscaling up the model. In particular, the performance of SID-based GR quickly\nsaturates as we enlarge each component: the modality encoder, the quantization\ntokenizer, and the RS itself. In this work, we identify the limited capacity of\nSIDs to encode item semantic information as one of the fundamental bottlenecks.\nMotivated by this observation, as an initial effort to obtain GR models with\nbetter scaling behaviors, we revisit another GR paradigm that directly uses\nlarge language models (LLMs) as recommenders (henceforth, LLM-as-RS). Our\nexperiments show that the LLM-as-RS paradigm has superior model scaling\nproperties and achieves up to 20 percent improvement over the best achievable\nperformance of SID-based GR through scaling. We also challenge the prevailing\nbelief that LLMs struggle to capture collaborative filtering information,\nshowing that their ability to model user-item interactions improves as LLMs\nscale up. Our analyses on both SID-based GR and LLMs across model sizes from\n44M to 14B parameters underscore the intrinsic scaling limits of SID-based GR\nand position LLM-as-RS as a promising path toward foundation models for GR."}

Emergent research shows that ECGs can\nhelp make predictions on key outcomes traditionally derived from more complex\nmodalities such as echocardiograms (ECHO), enabling the use of ECGs as a more\naccessible method to predict broader measurements of cardiac function. ECHO, in\nparticular, are of great importance because they require considerable hospital\nresources while playing a key role in clinical cardiac assessment. To aid this\nuse case, we introduce EchoingECG, a probabilistic student-teacher model that\nleverages uncertainty-aware ECG embeddings and ECHO supervision to improve\nECG-based cardiac function prediction.

Building on this hypothesis, we\nintroduce one-token rollout (OTR), a novel fine-tuning algorithm that guides\nSFT with the policy gradient method.

We\nshow that latent thoughts leading to correct versus incorrect answers exhibit\nhighly distinguishable patterns, and that a latent classifier can reliably\npredict answer correctness directly from latent thoughts. Leveraging these\ninsights, we propose Latent Thinking Optimization (LTO), a probabilistic\nalgorithm that employs the latent classifier as a Latent Reward Model (LRM) to\noptimize the latent thinking processes. Extensive experiments across diverse\nreasoning tasks demonstrate that LRM is highly effective in detecting incorrect\nlatent thinking patterns, and LTO can significantly improve the latent thinking\nprocesses. Furthermore, we show that LRM can generalize across diverse domains,\nand LTO can be seamlessly applied to general LLMs to improve their thinking\nprocesses. In contrast to verbal thinking, our method demonstrates that reward\nmodeling and scaling test-time thinking with supervision can be performed\ndirectly in the latent space, highlighting its potential as a general,\nefficient, and domain-agnostic approach to improving the thinking processes of\nLLMs."}

Our\nevaluation reveals that zero-shot LLM judges benefit significantly from\npairwise evaluation and our structured annotation rubrics, yet they still\nunderperform human annotators on our dataset. We demonstrate substantial\nimprovements through fine-tuning with reinforcement learning, reward shaping,\nand multi-task learning approaches. Additionally, we show that RL-trained\njudges can serve as generative reward models to enhance LLMs' multilingual\nproficiency, though discrepancies with human judgment remain. Our findings\nsuggest promising directions for scalable multilingual evaluation and\npreference alignment. We release our dataset and evaluation framework to\nsupport further research in multilingual LLM evaluation."}

Progressive and diverse evaluation dimensions, evaluating the human-based\nactivities progressively from the human-oriented granular perception to the\nhigher-dimensional reasoning, consisting of eight dimensions with 19,945\nreal-world image question pairs and an evaluation suite. 3.

We address\nthese questions by analyzing the hidden states at the core of transformer\ncomputations, which capture intermediate results and act as carriers of\ninformation.

Since large\nlanguage models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood\nor identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and\nin turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies\nand ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used\nLLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive\nattributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their\ncompetitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this\nself-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models\noften lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature\nserendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between\nself-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,\nexplicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing\nLLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,\nnot true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential\nsettings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates,\nsecurity software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human\nbias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result\nraises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced\nby self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation\nand even their own existence. We call on corporate creators of these models to\ncontend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in\njudgment and decision-making."}

Currently, when introducing new models, LLM providers like OpenAI\nand Anthropic often publish benchmark scores to demonstrate their models'\ncoding proficiency, but keep their proprietary evaluation frameworks\nconfidential. To address these limitations, we introduce Lita (Lite Agent),\nwhich operationalizes liteness, a principle of minimizing manual design while\nretaining the essential elements of a fully autonomous agent. Lita enables a\nmore faithful and unified evaluation without elaborate scaffolding. Experiments\non the Aider Polyglot and SWE-Bench with frontier models demonstrate that Lita\nachieves competitive or superior performance compared to workflow-based and\nagentic baselines. Crucially, Lita also consumes fewer tokens and requires\nsignificantly less design effort. Our results suggest that Lita is sufficient\nto reveal the underlying coding competence of modern LLMs. Finally, we propose\nthe Agent Complexity Law: the performance gap between agents of varying\ncomplexity, from simple to sophisticated designs, will shrink as the core model\nimproves, ultimately converging to a negligible difference."}

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a\nstrategy to mitigate hallucinations by combining external retrieval with text\ngeneration. However, its adoption raises new fairness concerns, as the\nretrieved content itself may surface or amplify bias. This study conducts\nfairness testing through metamorphic testing (MT), introducing controlled\ndemographic perturbations in prompts to assess fairness in sentiment analysis\nperformed by three Small Language Models (SLMs) hosted on HuggingFace\n(Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and Llama-3.1-Nemotron-8B),\neach integrated into a RAG pipeline. Results show that minor demographic\nvariations can break up to one third of metamorphic relations (MRs). A detailed\nanalysis of these failures reveals a consistent bias hierarchy, with\nperturbations involving racial cues being the predominant cause of the\nviolations. In addition to offering a comparative evaluation, this work\nreinforces that the retrieval component in RAG must be carefully curated to\nprevent bias amplification. The findings serve as a practical alert for\ndevelopers, testers and small organizations aiming to adopt accessible SLMs\nwithout compromising fairness or reliability."}

Since large\nlanguage models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood\nor identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and\nin turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies\nand ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used\nLLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive\nattributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their\ncompetitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this\nself-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models\noften lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature\nserendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between\nself-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,\nexplicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing\nLLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,\nnot true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential\nsettings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates,\nsecurity software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human\nbias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result\nraises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced\nby self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation\nand even their own existence. We call on corporate creators of these models to\ncontend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in\njudgment and decision-making."}

The perceptual losses operate in a latent feature space defined by a\npretrained encoder and aim to preserve semantic content by comparing high-level\nfeatures rather than raw pixel values. However, the design of perceptual losses\ninvolves critical yet underexplored decisions, including the feature\nrepresentation level, the dataset used to pretrain the encoder, and the\nrelative importance assigned to the perceptual component during optimization.\nIn this work, we introduce the concept of perceptual influence (a metric that\nquantifies the relative contribution of the perceptual loss term to the total\nloss) and propose a principled framework to assess the impact of the loss\ndesign choices on the model training performance. Through systematic\nexperimentation, we show that the widely used configurations in the literature\nto set up a perceptual loss underperform compared to better-designed\nalternatives. Our findings show that better perceptual loss designs lead to\nsignificant improvements in noise reduction and structural fidelity of\nreconstructed CT images, without requiring any changes to the network\narchitecture.

This becomes problematic when the applied blur is\nundesirable~(e.g., the subject is out of focus). To address this, we propose\nDiffCamera, a model that enables flexible refocusing of a created image\nconditioned on an arbitrary new focus point and a blur level. Specifically, we\ndesign a diffusion transformer framework for refocusing learning. However, the\ntraining requires pairs of data with different focus planes and bokeh levels in\nthe same scene, which are hard to acquire. To overcome this limitation, we\ndevelop a simulation-based pipeline to generate large-scale image pairs with\nvarying focus planes and bokeh levels. With the simulated data, we find that\ntraining with only a vanilla diffusion objective often leads to incorrect DoF\nbehaviors due to the complexity of the task.

Inspired by the photographic principle that photos\nof different focus planes can be linearly blended into a multi-focus image, we\npropose a stacking constraint during training to enforce precise DoF\nmanipulation.

Unfortunately, malicious actors\nhave started to use this new technology to perform real-time phishing attacks\nduring video meetings. The nature of a video call allows access to what the\ndeepfake is ``seeing,'' that is, the screen displayed to the malicious actor.\nUsing this with the estimated gaze from the malicious actors streamed video\nenables us to estimate where the deepfake is looking on screen, the point of\ngaze. Because the point of gaze during conversations is not random and is\ninstead used as a subtle nonverbal communicator, it can be used to detect\ndeepfakes, which are not capable of mimicking this subtle nonverbal\ncommunication.

The problem is\nparticularly challenging due to the intricate relationships between objects and\ncomplex spatial layouts. In this work, we propose the Attention over Scene\nGraphs for Sensitive Content Analysis (ASGRA), a novel framework that operates\non structured graph representations instead of raw pixels. By first converting\nimages into Scene Graphs and then employing a Graph Attention Network for\ninference, ASGRA directly models the interactions between a scene's components.\nThis approach offers two key benefits: (i) inherent explainability via object\nand relationship identification, and (ii) privacy preservation, enabling model\ntraining without direct access to sensitive images. On Places8, we achieve\n81.27% balanced accuracy, surpassing image-based methods. Real-world CSAI\nevaluation with law enforcement yields 74.27% balanced accuracy.

Drawing from daily applications in food delivery, in-store\nconsumption, and online travel services, VitaBench presents agents with the\nmost complex life-serving simulation environment to date, comprising 66 tools.\nThrough a framework that eliminates domain-specific policies, we enable\nflexible composition of these scenarios and tools, yielding 100 cross-scenario\ntasks (main results) and 300 single-scenario tasks. Each task is derived from\nmultiple real user requests and requires agents to reason across temporal and\nspatial dimensions, utilize complex tool sets, proactively clarify ambiguous\ninstructions, and track shifting user intent throughout multi-turn\nconversations. Moreover, we propose a rubric-based sliding window evaluator,\nenabling robust assessment of diverse solution pathways in complex environments\nand stochastic interactions. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that even the\nmost advanced models achieve only 30% success rate on cross-scenario tasks, and\nless than 50% success rate on others.

LLM generated benchmarks systematically favor the model that created the\nbenchmark, they exhibit self bias on low resource languages to English\ntranslation tasks. We show three key findings on automatic benchmarking of LLMs\nfor translation: First, this bias originates from two sources: the generated\ntest data (LLM as a testset) and the evaluation method (LLM as an evaluator),\nwith their combination amplifying the effect. Second, self bias in LLM as a\nbenchmark is heavily influenced by the model's generation capabilities in the\nsource language.

The\ndifficulty of an example is linked to the topic it originates from (''seed\ntopic'').

At the scale of the Internet, there are tens\nof thousands of potential topics, and finding the most difficult one by drawing\nand evaluating a large number of examples across all topics is computationally\ninfeasible. We formalize this task and treat it as a multi-armed bandit\nproblem. In this framework, each topic is an ''arm,'' and pulling an arm (at a\ncost) involves drawing a single example, evaluating it, and measuring its\ndifficulty. The goal is to efficiently identify the most difficult topics\nwithin a fixed computational budget.

Following this\nprinciple, we introduce the first SIM(3)-equivariant shape completion network,\nwhose modular layers successively canonicalize features, reason over\nsimilarity-invariant geometry, and restore the original frame.

Stitch produces images that are both\nspatially accurate and visually appealing by generating individual objects\nwithin designated bounding boxes and seamlessly stitching them together. We\nfind that targeted attention heads capture the information necessary to isolate\nand cut out individual objects mid-generation, without needing to fully\ncomplete the image.

Featuring five new tasks that extend the concept\nof Position beyond the basic GenEval task, PosEval demonstrates that even top\nmodels still have significant room for improvement in position-based\ngeneration. Tested on Qwen-Image, FLUX, and SD3.5, Stitch consistently enhances\nbase models, even improving FLUX by 218% on GenEval's Position task and by 206%\non PosEval.
