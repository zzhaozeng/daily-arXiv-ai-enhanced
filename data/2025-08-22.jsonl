However, most existing 3D-native generative architectures either\noperate predominantly within single-modality paradigms-thus overlooking the\ncomplementary benefits of multi-modality data-or restrict themselves to 3D\nstructures, thereby limiting the scope of available training datasets. To\nholistically harness multi-modalities for 3D modeling, we present TriMM, the\nfirst feed-forward 3D-native generative model that learns from basic\nmulti-modalities (e.g., RGB, RGBD, and point cloud). Specifically, 1) TriMM\nfirst introduces collaborative multi-modal coding, which integrates\nmodality-specific features while preserving their unique representational\nstrengths. 2) Furthermore, auxiliary 2D and 3D supervision are introduced to\nraise the robustness and performance of multi-modal coding. 3) Based on the\nembedded multi-modal code, TriMM employs a triplane latent diffusion model to\ngenerate 3D assets of superior quality, enhancing both the texture and the\ngeometric detail. Extensive experiments on multiple well-known datasets\ndemonstrate that TriMM, by effectively leveraging multi-modality, achieves\ncompetitive performance with models trained on large-scale datasets, despite\nutilizing a small amount of training data. Furthermore, we conduct additional\nexperiments on recent RGB-D datasets, verifying the feasibility of\nincorporating other multi-modal datasets into 3D generation."}

To interpret\nexisting VideoLLMs, we adopt attention knockouts as our primary analytical tool\nand design three variants: Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, and\nLanguage-to-Video Knockout.

We address this challenge by introducing a simple response evaluation\nframework, created by repurposing a state-of-the-art language model, that\nevaluates ongoing conversations for parasocial cues in real time. To test the\nfeasibility of this approach, we constructed a small synthetic dataset of\nthirty dialogues spanning parasocial, sycophantic, and neutral conversations.\nIterative evaluation with five stage testing successfully identified all\nparasocial conversations while avoiding false positives under a tolerant\nunanimity rule, with detection typically occurring within the first few\nexchanges. These findings provide preliminary evidence that evaluation agents\ncan provide a viable solution for the prevention of parasocial relations."}

This model facilitates nuclei segmentation through two primary methods:\nprompt-based zero-shot segmentation and the use of cell-specific SAM models for\ndirect segmentation. These approaches enable effective segmentation across a\nrange of nuclei and cells. However, general vision foundation models often face\nchallenges with fine-grained semantic segmentation, such as identifying\nspecific nuclei subtypes or particular cells. Approach: In this paper, we\npropose the molecular-empowered All-in-SAM Model to advance computational\npathology by leveraging the capabilities of vision foundation models. This\nmodel incorporates a full-stack approach, focusing on: (1) annotation-engaging\nlay annotators through molecular-empowered learning to reduce the need for\ndetailed pixel-level annotations, (2) learning-adapting the SAM model to\nemphasize specific semantics, which utilizes its strong generalizability with\nSAM adapter, and (3) refinement-enhancing segmentation accuracy by integrating\nMolecular-Oriented Corrective Learning (MOCL).

However, this raises an important question:\ndo these images always enhance product understanding, or can they sometimes\nintroduce redundancy or degrade performance? Existing datasets are limited in\nboth scale and design, making it difficult to systematically examine this\nquestion. To this end, we introduce EcomMMMU, an e-commerce multimodal\nmultitask understanding dataset with 406,190 samples and 8,989,510 images.\nEcomMMMU is comprised of multi-image visual-language data designed with 8\nessential tasks and a specialized VSS subset to benchmark the capability of\nmultimodal large language models (MLLMs) to effectively utilize visual content.\nAnalysis on EcomMMMU reveals that product images do not consistently improve\nperformance and can, in some cases, degrade it. This indicates that MLLMs may\nstruggle to effectively leverage rich visual content for e-commerce tasks.\nBuilding on these insights, we propose SUMEI, a data-driven method that\nstrategically utilizes multiple images via predicting visual utilities before\nusing them for downstream tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness and robustness of SUMEI. The data and code are available through\nhttps://anonymous.4open.science/r/submission25."}

However, they often fall\nshort in tasks requiring precise computations. Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR)\nhas emerged as a solution by incorporating external tools into the reasoning\nprocess. Nevertheless, the generalization of TIR in improving the reasoning\nability of LLM is still unclear. Additionally, whether TIR has improved the\nmodel's reasoning behavior and helped the model think remains to be studied. We\nintroduce ReasonZoo, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing nine diverse\nreasoning categories, to evaluate the effectiveness of TIR across various\ndomains. Additionally, we propose two novel metrics, Performance-Aware Cost\n(PAC) and Area Under the Performance-Cost Curve (AUC-PCC), to assess reasoning\nefficiency. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that TIR-enabled models\nconsistently outperform their non-TIR counterparts in both mathematical and\nnon-mathematical tasks. Furthermore, TIR enhances reasoning efficiency, as\nevidenced by improved PAC and AUC-PCC, indicating reduced overthinking and more\nstreamlined reasoning. These findings underscore the domain-general benefits of\nTIR and its potential to advance LLM capabilities in complex reasoning tasks."}

In\nthis work, we present LiveMCP-101, a benchmark of 101 carefully curated\nreal-world queries, refined through iterative LLM rewriting and manual review,\nthat require coordinated use of multiple MCP tools including web search, file\noperations, mathematical reasoning, and data analysis.

In this work, we address the\nchallenging task of synthesizing multiple 3D assets within a single scene\nimage. Concretely, our contributions are fourfold: (i) we present SceneGen, a\nnovel framework that takes a scene image and corresponding object masks as\ninput, simultaneously producing multiple 3D assets with geometry and texture.\nNotably, SceneGen operates with no need for optimization or asset retrieval;\n(ii) we introduce a novel feature aggregation module that integrates local and\nglobal scene information from visual and geometric encoders within the feature\nextraction module. Coupled with a position head, this enables the generation of\n3D assets and their relative spatial positions in a single feedforward pass;\n(iii) we demonstrate SceneGen's direct extensibility to multi-image input\nscenarios. Despite being trained solely on single-image inputs, our\narchitectural design enables improved generation performance with multi-image\ninputs; and (iv) extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the\nefficiency and robust generation abilities of our approach. We believe this\nparadigm offers a novel solution for high-quality 3D content generation,\npotentially advancing its practical applications in downstream tasks.
