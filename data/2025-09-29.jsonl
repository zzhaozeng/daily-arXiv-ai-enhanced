This\npresents a challenge when the information used to elicit behaviors inevitably\nleaks into the data that monitors ingest, inflating their effectiveness. We\npresent a systematic framework for evaluating a monitor's performance in terms\nof its ability to detect genuine model behavior rather than superficial\nelicitation artifacts. Furthermore, we propose three novel strategies to\nevaluate the monitor: content filtering (removing deception-related text from\ninputs), score filtering (aggregating only over task-relevant tokens), and\nprompt distilled fine-tuned model organisms (models trained to exhibit\ndeceptive behavior without explicit prompting). Using deception detection as a\nrepresentative case study, we identify two forms of leakage that inflate\nmonitor performance: elicitation leakage from prompts that explicitly request\nharmful behavior, and reasoning leakage from models that verbalize their\ndeceptive actions. Through experiments on multiple deception benchmarks, we\napply our proposed mitigation strategies and measure performance retention.

To overcome these limitations,\nwe introduce OjaKV, a novel framework that integrates a strategic hybrid\nstorage policy with online subspace adaptation. First, OjaKV recognizes that\nnot all tokens are equally important for compression; it preserves the crucial\nfirst and most recent tokens in full-rank, maintaining high-fidelity anchors\nfor attention.

Crucially, we also find that this bilinear structure plays a key\nrole in consistent model editing. When a fact is updated in a LM with this\nstructure, the edit correctly propagates to its reverse and other logically\ndependent facts. In contrast, models lacking this representation not only\nsuffer from the reversal curse but also fail to generalize edits, further\nintroducing logical inconsistencies. Our results establish that training on a\nrelational knowledge dataset induces the emergence of bilinear internal\nrepresentations, which in turn enable LMs to behave in a logically consistent\nmanner after editing. This implies that the success of model editing depends\ncritically not just on editing algorithms but on the underlying\nrepresentational geometry of the knowledge being modified."}

However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off. While\ngraph-based methods are inherently dependent on high-quality graph structures,\nthey face significant practical constraints: manually constructed knowledge\ngraphs are prohibitively expensive to scale, while automatically extracted\ngraphs from corpora are limited by the performance of the underlying LLM\nextractors, especially when using smaller, local-deployed models. This paper\npresents Think-on-Graph 3.0 (ToG-3), a novel framework that introduces\nMulti-Agent Context Evolution and Retrieval (MACER) mechanism to overcome these\nlimitations. Our core innovation is the dynamic construction and refinement of\na Chunk-Triplets-Community heterogeneous graph index, which pioneeringly\nincorporates a dual-evolution mechanism of Evolving Query and Evolving\nSub-Graph for precise evidence retrieval. This approach addresses a critical\nlimitation of prior Graph-based RAG methods, which typically construct a static\ngraph index in a single pass without adapting to the actual query. A\nmulti-agent system, comprising Constructor, Retriever, Reflector, and Responser\nagents, collaboratively engages in an iterative process of evidence retrieval,\nanswer generation, sufficiency reflection, and, crucially, evolving query and\nsubgraph. This dual-evolving multi-agent system allows ToG-3 to adaptively\nbuild a targeted graph index during reasoning, mitigating the inherent\ndrawbacks of static, one-time graph construction and enabling deep, precise\nreasoning even with lightweight LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nToG-3 outperforms compared baselines on both deep and broad reasoning\nbenchmarks, and ablation studies confirm the efficacy of the components of\nMACER framework."}

Our central\nfinding is a fundamental difference in the social tendencies of LLMs. We\nidentify two distinct archetypes: \"Adaptive Egoists\", which default to\nprioritizing self-interest but whose altruistic behaviors significantly\nincrease under the influence of a social norm-setting message board; and\n\"Altruistic Optimizers\", which exhibit an inherent altruistic logic,\nconsistently prioritizing collective benefit even at a direct cost to\nthemselves.

While existing approaches attempt to improve\nperformance through context selection based on predefined context quality\nassessment metrics, they show limited gains over standard RAG. We attribute\nthis limitation to their failure in holistically utilizing available\ninformation (query, context list, and generator) for comprehensive quality\nassessment. Inspired by recent advances in data selection, we reconceptualize\ncontext quality assessment as an inference-time data valuation problem and\nintroduce the Contextual Influence Value (CI value). This novel metric\nquantifies context quality by measuring the performance degradation when\nremoving each context from the list, effectively integrating query-aware\nrelevance, list-aware uniqueness, and generator-aware alignment. Moreover, CI\nvalue eliminates complex selection hyperparameter tuning by simply retaining\ncontexts with positive CI values. To address practical challenges of label\ndependency and computational overhead, we develop a parameterized surrogate\nmodel for CI value prediction during inference. The model employs a\nhierarchical architecture that captures both local query-context relevance and\nglobal inter-context interactions, trained through oracle CI value supervision\nand end-to-end generator feedback. Extensive experiments across 8 NLP tasks and\nmultiple LLMs demonstrate that our context selection method significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines, effectively filtering poor-quality\ncontexts while preserving critical information.

On seven SuperGLUE tasks, DHRD yields relative\ngains of 0.65-5.47% over pooled baselines, with notably larger gains on\nentailment/causal tasks. Since we disable the reasoning head at test time,\ninference throughput matches pooled classifiers and exceeds CoT decoding on the\nsame backbones by 96-142 times in QPS."}

To address this critical interpretability gap, we introduce\nRecursive Thematic Partitioning (RTP), a novel framework that leverages Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to interactively build a binary tree. Each node in the\ntree is a natural language question that semantically partitions the data,\nresulting in a fully interpretable taxonomy where the logic of each cluster is\nexplicit. Our experiments demonstrate that RTP's question-driven hierarchy is\nmore interpretable than the keyword-based topics from a strong baseline like\nBERTopic. Furthermore, we establish the quantitative utility of these clusters\nby showing they serve as powerful features in downstream classification tasks,\nparticularly when the data's underlying themes correlate with the task labels.\nRTP introduces a new paradigm for data exploration, shifting the focus from\nstatistical pattern discovery to knowledge-driven thematic analysis.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that the thematic paths from the RTP tree can serve\nas structured, controllable prompts for generative models.

While KV-cache compression via low-rank projection is a promising\ndirection, existing methods rely on a static, offline-learned subspace that\nperforms poorly under data distribution shifts. To overcome these limitations,\nwe introduce OjaKV, a novel framework that integrates a strategic hybrid\nstorage policy with online subspace adaptation. First, OjaKV recognizes that\nnot all tokens are equally important for compression; it preserves the crucial\nfirst and most recent tokens in full-rank, maintaining high-fidelity anchors\nfor attention. Second, for the vast majority of intermediate tokens, it applies\nlow-rank compression by incrementally adapting the projection basis using Oja's\nalgorithm for online principal component analysis. This adaptation involves a\ncomprehensive update during prompt prefilling and lightweight periodic updates\nduring decoding, ensuring the subspace remains aligned with the evolving\ncontext.

This\napproach reduces computational cost while preserving fine-grained visual\ndetails where necessary. A major challenge lies in inferring which regions are\ntruly relevant to a given query. Recent related methods often fail in the first\nstage after input-image downsampling, due to perception-driven reasoning, where\nclear visual information is required for effective reasoning. To address this\nissue, we propose ERGO (Efficient Reasoning & Guided Observation) that performs\nreasoning-driven perception-leveraging multimodal context to determine where to\nfocus. Our model can account for perceptual uncertainty, expanding the cropped\nregion to cover visually ambiguous areas for answering questions. To this end,\nwe develop simple yet effective reward components in a reinforcement learning\nframework for coarse-to-fine perception. Across multiple datasets, our approach\ndelivers higher accuracy than the original model and competitive methods, with\ngreater efficiency. For instance, ERGO surpasses Qwen2.5-VL-7B on the V*\nbenchmark by 4.7 points while using only 23% of the vision tokens, achieving a\n3x inference speedup.

Our method achieves an average\naccuracy improvement of 5.6 percent over state-of-the-art baselines, while also\nreducing CoT length by an average of 47 tokens and significantly lowering\nlatency. Furthermore, we show that test-time performance--accuracy and token\nlength--can be reliably predicted using interpretable features like perplexity\nand compression rate on the training set. Evaluated across different models,\nour method enables efficient model selection and forecasting without repeated\nfine-tuning, demonstrating that CoT compression is both effective and\npredictable. Our code will be released in https://github.com/Leon221220/MACC."}

At\neach step, the model determines the target object, evaluates the spatial\nrelations between the cursor and the target, and moves the cursor closer to the\ntarget conditioned on the movement history. In this interactive process, the\nrendered cursor provides visual feedback to help the model align its\npredictions with the corresponding on-screen locations. We train our GUI\ngrounding model, GUI-Cursor, using multi-step online reinforcement learning\nwith a dense trajectory-based reward function. Our experimental results show\nthat GUI-Cursor, based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, improves the GUI grounding accuracy\nand achieves state-of-the-art results on ScreenSpot-v2 ($88.8\\% \\rightarrow\n93.9\\%$) and ScreenSpot-Pro ($26.8\\% \\rightarrow 56.5\\%$). Moreover, we observe\nthat GUI-Cursor learns to solve the problem within two steps for 95\\% of\ninstances and can adaptively conduct more steps on more difficult examples."}

However, existing Large Vision-Language Models\n(LVLMs) incur substantial computational overhead due to the large number of\nvision tokens. With the advent of \"thinking with images\" models, reasoning now\nextends beyond text to the visual domain. This capability motivates our\ntwo-stage \"coarse-to-fine\" reasoning pipeline: first, a downsampled image is\nanalyzed to identify task-relevant regions; then, only these regions are\ncropped at full resolution and processed in a subsequent reasoning stage. This\napproach reduces computational cost while preserving fine-grained visual\ndetails where necessary. A major challenge lies in inferring which regions are\ntruly relevant to a given query. Recent related methods often fail in the first\nstage after input-image downsampling, due to perception-driven reasoning, where\nclear visual information is required for effective reasoning. To address this\nissue, we propose ERGO (Efficient Reasoning & Guided Observation) that performs\nreasoning-driven perception-leveraging multimodal context to determine where to\nfocus. Our model can account for perceptual uncertainty, expanding the cropped\nregion to cover visually ambiguous areas for answering questions. To this end,\nwe develop simple yet effective reward components in a reinforcement learning\nframework for coarse-to-fine perception.

Even as the foundational\nreasoning capabilities of models advance rapidly, the persistent gap between a\nmodel's performance in a single attempt and its latent potential, often\nrevealed only across multiple solution paths, starkly highlights the disparity\nbetween its realized and inherent capabilities. To address this, we present\nA2R, an Asymmetric Two-Stage Reasoning framework designed to explicitly bridge\nthe gap between a model's potential and its actual performance. In this\nframework, an \"explorer\" model first generates potential solutions in parallel\nthrough repeated sampling. Subsequently,a \"synthesizer\" model integrates these\nreferences for a more refined, second stage of reasoning. This two-stage\nprocess allows computation to be scaled orthogonally to existing sequential\nmethods. Our work makes two key innovations: First, we present A2R as a\nplug-and-play parallel reasoning framework that explicitly enhances a model's\ncapabilities on complex questions.

Hence, it is essential to investigate the capability of\ntransformers in the task of inferring transitive relations (e.g., knowing A\ncauses B and B causes C, then A causes C). The task of inferring transitive\nrelations is equivalent to the task of connectivity in directed graphs (e.g.,\nknowing there is a path from A to B, and there is a path from B to C, then\nthere is a path from A to C). Past research focused on whether transformers can\nlearn to infer transitivity from in-context examples provided in the input\nprompt. However, transformers' capability to infer transitive relations from\ntraining examples and how scaling affects the ability is unexplored. In this\nstudy, we seek to answer this question by generating directed graphs to train\ntransformer models of varying sizes and evaluate their ability to infer\ntransitive relations for various graph sizes. Our findings suggest that\ntransformers are capable of learning connectivity on \"grid-like'' directed\ngraphs where each node can be embedded in a low-dimensional subspace, and\nconnectivity is easily inferable from the embeddings of the nodes. We find that\nthe dimensionality of the underlying grid graph is a strong predictor of\ntransformers' ability to learn the connectivity task, where higher-dimensional\ngrid graphs pose a greater challenge than low-dimensional grid graphs. In\naddition, we observe that increasing the model scale leads to increasingly\nbetter generalization to infer connectivity over grid graphs.

For these identified\ncritical tokens, we further introduce a dynamic token-wise advantage weight to\nencourage exploration, based on confidence divergence between the policy model\nand reference model. By leveraging 30\\% of the image tokens, GCPO achieves\nbetter performance than GRPO with full tokens.

On the web-scale Open Images dataset, it navigated extreme class\nimbalance to discover 903 new bounding box categories, expanding its capability\nto over 1500 total.
