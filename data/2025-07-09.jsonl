While\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have excelled in structured data like\nimages, extending them to irregular 3D meshes is challenging due to the\nnon-Euclidean nature of the data. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) offer a\nsolution by applying convolutions to graph-structured data, but many existing\nmethods rely on isotropic filters or spectral decomposition, limiting their\nability to capture both local and global mesh features. In this paper, we\nintroduce 3D Geometric Mesh Network (3DGeoMeshNet), a novel GCN-based framework\nthat uses anisotropic convolution layers to effectively learn both global and\nlocal features directly in the spatial domain. Unlike previous approaches that\nconvert meshes into intermediate representations like voxel grids or point\nclouds, our method preserves the original polygonal mesh format throughout the\nreconstruction process, enabling more accurate shape reconstruction. Our\narchitecture features a multi-scale encoder-decoder structure, where separate\nglobal and local pathways capture both large-scale geometric structures and\nfine-grained local details. Extensive experiments on the COMA dataset\ncontaining human faces demonstrate the efficiency of 3DGeoMeshNet in terms of\nreconstruction accuracy."}

To validate the effectiveness of\nTLJD, we design cross-city and cross-time tasks for city-level FDI predictions.\nExtensive experiments on both tasks demonstrate the superiority of TLJD (reach\nto at least 0.92 R2) over the other ten state-of-the-art baselines in different\nevaluation metrics."}

To address this limitation, iterative revision methods have\nbeen introduced.

As a\nresource-efficient alternative, methods have been proposed that leverage\nhigh-performance evaluation tools to compensate for the limited self-evaluation\ncapabilities of open-source LLMs. However, these approaches often lead to a\ndegradation in output quality due to excessive revision. To overcome these\nchallenges, we propose Re5, a self-evaluation and revision framework designed\nto enhance instruction-following performance while preserving the quality of\nthe generated content. Re5 extracts task and constraint components from user\ninstructions, performs structural evaluations to prevent error accumulation,\nand applies fine-grained constraint-specific content evaluations followed by\nselective revisions.

To leverage both the specialized strengths of small models and the\nrich semantic understanding of LLMs, we introduce a flipped knowledge\ndistillation paradigm, where LLM learns from SLM. Specifically, we address the\narchitectural gap between decoder-only LLMs and smaller encoder-based models by\nreinterpreting LLMs in an encoder-decoder manner using LoRA. The encoder\ngenerates compressed representations, while the decoder maps them to the output\nspace. During training, the encoder produces representations and their\nsimilarities, which are then aligned with the similarity scores produced by the\nteacher, using our proposed Margin-aware Contrastive Learning (MCL) approach.\nThe MCL ensures accurate similarity for both positive and negative pairs, and\nadaptively handles the internal differences within positive and negative\nsamples.

Vision-based pose\nestimation methods, which typically employ RGB imaging sensors, is a compelling\nsolution for spacecraft pose estimation, but are challenged by harsh lighting\nconditions, which produce imaging artifacts such as glare, over-exposure,\nblooming and lens flare. Due to their much higher dynamic range, neuromorphic\nor event sensors are more resilient to extreme lighting conditions. However,\nevent sensors generally have lower spatial resolution and suffer from reduced\nsignal-to-noise ratio during periods of low relative motion. This work\naddresses these individual sensor limitations by introducing a sensor fusion\napproach combining RGB and event sensors. A beam-splitter prism was employed to\nachieve precise optical and temporal alignment. Then, a RANSAC-based technique\nwas developed to fuse the information from the RGB and event channels to\nachieve pose estimation that leveraged the strengths of the two modalities. The\npipeline was complemented by dropout uncertainty estimation to detect extreme\nconditions that affect either channel. To benchmark the performance of the\nproposed event-RGB fusion method, we collected a comprehensive real dataset of\nRGB and event data for satellite pose estimation in a laboratory setting under\na variety of challenging illumination conditions.

There is a lack of standardized benchmarks and relative performance\nanalysis of deep learning and non-deep learning methods. We address this\nthrough an open and thorough study of this problem using four publicly\navailable dialog datasets: two human-human (DailyDialog and DSTC7-Ubuntu) and\ntwo human-bot (Open Assistant and ShareGPT). We experiment with various\nexisting query auto-completion methods (using tries), n-gram methods and deep\nlearning methods, with and without dialog context. We also propose a novel\nentropy-based dynamic early stopping strategy. Our analysis finds that\nstatistical n-gram models and tries outperform deep learning based models in\nterms of both model performance and inference efficiency for seen prefixes. For\nunseen queries, neural models like T5 and Phi-2 lead to better results. Adding\nconversational context leads to significant improvements in ghosting quality,\nespecially for Open-Assistant and ShareGPT. We make code and data publicly\navailable"}

However, existing RS-VLMs are\nmostly limited to image-level and region-level tasks, lacking the capability to\nhandle pixel-level tasks and performing poorly in small-object recognition\nscenarios. Moreover, RS-VLMs consume significant computational resources when\nprocessing high-resolution RS images, further restricting their practical\napplicability. In this context, we propose GeoMag (Geographical Magnifier), an\nend-to-end general-purpose large model framework for RS. GeoMag dynamically\nfocuses the attention scope based on prompt semantics to effectively perform\nremote sensing image parsing across multiple levels of granularity. This method\nintroduces Task-driven Multi-granularity Resolution Adjustment (TMRA) and\nPrompt-guided Semantic-aware Cropping (PSC), which adaptively reduce the\nspatial resolution of task-irrelevant regions while enhancing the visual\nrepresentation of task-relevant areas. This approach improves the model's\nperception of critical target regions, suppresses background redundancy, and\nreduces the computational cost of interpreting high-resolution RS imagery.\nExtensive comparative experiments on 10 benchmarks demonstrate that GeoMag not\nonly excels in handling pixel-level tasks but also maintains competitive\nperformance across tasks of other granularities compared to existing RS-VLMs."}

In detail, we methodologically and\nexperimentally analyze ten explanation metrics spanning five categories\n(faithfulness, robustness, localization, complexity, randomization), applied to\nfive established feature attribution methods (Occlusion, LIME, GradCAM, LRP,\nand DeepLIFT) across three RS datasets. Our methodological analysis identifies\nkey limitations in both explanation methods and metrics. The performance of\nperturbation-based methods, such as Occlusion and LIME, heavily depends on\nperturbation baselines and spatial characteristics of RS scenes.

Analogously, we\nfind limitations in evaluation metrics. Faithfulness metrics share the same\nproblems as perturbation-based methods.

Building on this, we design a gated self-attention mechanism to\nintegrate trajectory, textual description, and visual information for each\nentity. This innovation significantly reduces misalignment in multimodal\nconditioning during training. Moreover, we introduce a contrastive loss that\njointly optimizes trajectory dynamics and entity consistency through explicit\nmapping between motion and personalization embeddings. Tora2 is, to our best\nknowledge, the first method to achieve simultaneous multi-entity customization\nof appearance and motion for video generation. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat Tora2 achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art customization\nmethods while providing advanced motion control capabilities, which marks a\ncritical advancement in multi-condition video generation.

In recent times,\ncognitive decline, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive\nimpairment (MCI), is often underdiagnosed due to the time-consuming and costly\nnature of current diagnostic methods. By analyzing real-world driving behavior\ncaptured through in-vehicle systems, this research aims to extract \"digital\nfingerprints\" that correlate with functional decline and clinical features of\nMCI and AD. Moreover, modern large vision models can draw meaningful insights\nfrom everyday driving patterns of older patients to early detect cognitive\ndecline. We propose a framework that uses large vision models and naturalistic\ndriving videos to analyze driver behavior, classify cognitive status and\npredict disease progression. We leverage the strong relationship between\nreal-world driving behavior as an observation of the current cognitive status\nof the drivers where the vehicle can be utilized as a \"diagnostic tool\".

Second, an attention mechanism that is aware of\nthe character is proposed with a new attention segregation loss that aims to\nlimit the attention distribution of each character independently in order to\navoid distortion artifacts. Lastly, GCDA has an OCR-in-the-loop fine-tuning\nphase, where a full text perceptual loss, directly optimises models to be\nlegible and accurately spell. Large scale experiments to benchmark datasets,\nsuch as MARIO-10M and T2I-CompBench, reveal that GCDA sets a new\nstate-of-the-art on all metrics, with better character based metrics on text\nrendering (Character Error Rate: 0.08 vs 0.21 for the previous best; Word Error\nRate: 0.15 vs 0.25), human perception, and comparable image synthesis quality\non high-fidelity (FID: 14.3)."}

Most xAI methods and the related evaluation metrics in RS are initially\ndeveloped for natural images considered in computer vision (CV), and their\ndirect usage in RS may not be suitable. To address this issue, in this paper,\nwe investigate the effectiveness of explanation methods and metrics in the\ncontext of RS image scene classification. In detail, we methodologically and\nexperimentally analyze ten explanation metrics spanning five categories\n(faithfulness, robustness, localization, complexity, randomization), applied to\nfive established feature attribution methods (Occlusion, LIME, GradCAM, LRP,\nand DeepLIFT) across three RS datasets. Our methodological analysis identifies\nkey limitations in both explanation methods and metrics. The performance of\nperturbation-based methods, such as Occlusion and LIME, heavily depends on\nperturbation baselines and spatial characteristics of RS scenes. Gradient-based\napproaches like GradCAM struggle when multiple labels are present in the same\nimage, while some relevance propagation methods (LRP) can distribute relevance\ndisproportionately relative to the spatial extent of classes. Analogously, we\nfind limitations in evaluation metrics. Faithfulness metrics share the same\nproblems as perturbation-based methods. Localization metrics and complexity\nmetrics are unreliable for classes with a large spatial extent. In contrast,\nrobustness metrics and randomization metrics consistently exhibit greater\nstability.

While\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have excelled in structured data like\nimages, extending them to irregular 3D meshes is challenging due to the\nnon-Euclidean nature of the data. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) offer a\nsolution by applying convolutions to graph-structured data, but many existing\nmethods rely on isotropic filters or spectral decomposition, limiting their\nability to capture both local and global mesh features. In this paper, we\nintroduce 3D Geometric Mesh Network (3DGeoMeshNet), a novel GCN-based framework\nthat uses anisotropic convolution layers to effectively learn both global and\nlocal features directly in the spatial domain. Unlike previous approaches that\nconvert meshes into intermediate representations like voxel grids or point\nclouds, our method preserves the original polygonal mesh format throughout the\nreconstruction process, enabling more accurate shape reconstruction. Our\narchitecture features a multi-scale encoder-decoder structure, where separate\nglobal and local pathways capture both large-scale geometric structures and\nfine-grained local details.
