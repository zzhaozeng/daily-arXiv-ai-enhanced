### [1] [Med-GRIM: Enhanced Zero-Shot Medical VQA using prompt-embedded Multimodal Graph RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06496)
*Rakesh Raj Madavan,Akshat Kaimal,Hashim Faisal,Chandrakala S*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BIND和Med-GRIM通过密集编码和模块化工作流程提升医疗VQA任务的精确性和效率，同时引入DermaGraph数据集支持零样本研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA模型在复杂领域（如医疗）中缺乏详细精确性，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: BIND通过密集编码优化联合嵌入空间，Med-GRIM结合图检索和提示工程，使用小语言模型实现低计算成本。

Result: Med-GRIM以低计算成本实现高性能，并发布DermaGraph数据集支持研究。

Conclusion: BIND和Med-GRIM为医疗VQA提供了高效精确的解决方案，推动了零样本多模态研究。

Abstract: An ensemble of trained multimodal encoders and vision-language models (VLMs)
has become a standard approach for visual question answering (VQA) tasks.
However, such models often fail to produce responses with the detailed
precision necessary for complex, domain-specific applications such as medical
VQA. Our representation model, BIND: BLIVA Integrated with Dense Encoding,
extends prior multimodal work by refining the joint embedding space through
dense, query-token-based encodings inspired by contrastive pretraining
techniques. This refined encoder powers Med-GRIM, a model designed for medical
VQA tasks that leverages graph-based retrieval and prompt engineering to
integrate domain-specific knowledge. Rather than relying on compute-heavy
fine-tuning of vision and language models on specific datasets, Med-GRIM
applies a low-compute, modular workflow with small language models (SLMs) for
efficiency. Med-GRIM employs prompt-based retrieval to dynamically inject
relevant knowledge, ensuring both accuracy and robustness in its responses. By
assigning distinct roles to each agent within the VQA system, Med-GRIM achieves
large language model performance at a fraction of the computational cost.
Additionally, to support scalable research in zero-shot multimodal medical
applications, we introduce DermaGraph, a novel Graph-RAG dataset comprising
diverse dermatological conditions. This dataset facilitates both multimodal and
unimodal querying. The code and dataset are available at:

### [2] [DiTalker: A Unified DiT-based Framework for High-Quality and Speaking Styles Controllable Portrait Animation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06511)
*He Feng,Yongjia Ma,Donglin Di,Lei Fan,Tonghua Su,Xiangqian Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiTalker是一种基于DiT的统一框架，用于可控说话风格的人像动画，通过分离音频和风格特征，优化唇同步和细节保留。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注唇同步或静态情感转换，忽视了动态风格（如头部运动），且双U-Net架构计算开销大。

Method: 设计Style-Emotion Encoding Module分离风格和情感特征，Audio-Style Fusion Module通过交叉注意力层解耦音频和风格，并采用优化约束提升结果质量。

Result: 实验表明DiTalker在唇同步和说话风格可控性上表现优越。

Conclusion: DiTalker提供了一种高效且可控的人像动画解决方案。

Abstract: Portrait animation aims to synthesize talking videos from a static reference
face, conditioned on audio and style frame cues (e.g., emotion and head poses),
while ensuring precise lip synchronization and faithful reproduction of
speaking styles. Existing diffusion-based portrait animation methods primarily
focus on lip synchronization or static emotion transformation, often
overlooking dynamic styles such as head movements. Moreover, most of these
methods rely on a dual U-Net architecture, which preserves identity consistency
but incurs additional computational overhead. To this end, we propose DiTalker,
a unified DiT-based framework for speaking style-controllable portrait
animation. We design a Style-Emotion Encoding Module that employs two separate
branches: a style branch extracting identity-specific style information (e.g.,
head poses and movements), and an emotion branch extracting identity-agnostic
emotion features. We further introduce an Audio-Style Fusion Module that
decouples audio and speaking styles via two parallel cross-attention layers,
using these features to guide the animation process. To enhance the quality of
results, we adopt and modify two optimization constraints: one to improve lip
synchronization and the other to preserve fine-grained identity and background
details. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DiTalker in terms
of lip synchronization and speaking style controllability. Project Page:

### [3] [BigTokDetect: A Clinically-Informed Vision-Language Model Framework for Detecting Pro-Bigorexia Videos on TikTok](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06515)
*Minh Duc Chu,Kshitij Pawar,Zihao He,Roxanna Sharifi,Ross Sonnenblick,Magdalayna Curry,Laura D'Adamo,Lindsay Young,Stuart B Murray,Kristina Lerman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出BigTokDetect框架，用于检测TikTok上促进肌肉畸形的有害内容，通过多模态方法显著提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上伪装成健身内容的肌肉畸形行为（pro-bigorexia）对青少年男性影响严重，传统基于文本的检测方法难以识别。

Method: 开发BigTokDetect框架，利用专家标注的多模态数据集（BigTok），结合视觉语言模型进行检测。

Result: 多模态融合比纯文本方法性能提升5-10%，视频特征最具区分性，分类准确率达0.829%。

Conclusion: 研究为心理健康领域的有害内容检测提供了新工具和方法框架。

Abstract: Social media platforms increasingly struggle to detect harmful content that
promotes muscle dysmorphic behaviors, particularly pro-bigorexia content that
disproportionately affects adolescent males. Unlike traditional eating disorder
detection focused on the "thin ideal," pro-bigorexia material masquerades as
legitimate fitness content through complex multimodal combinations of visual
displays, coded language, and motivational messaging that evade text-based
detection systems. We address this challenge by developing BigTokDetect, a
clinically-informed detection framework for identifying pro-bigorexia content
on TikTok. We introduce BigTok, the first expert-annotated multimodal dataset
of over 2,200 TikTok videos labeled by clinical psychologists and psychiatrists
across five primary categories spanning body image, nutrition, exercise,
supplements, and masculinity. Through a comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art vision language models, we achieve 0.829% accuracy on primary
category classification and 0.690% on subcategory detection via domain-specific
finetuning. Our ablation studies demonstrate that multimodal fusion improves
performance by 5-10% over text-only approaches, with video features providing
the most discriminative signals. These findings establish new benchmarks for
multimodal harmful content detection and provide both the computational tools
and methodological framework needed for scalable content moderation in
specialized mental health domains.

### [4] [Frequency Prior Guided Matching: A Data Augmentation Approach for Generalizable Semi-Supervised Polyp Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06517)
*Haoran Xi,Chen Liu,Xiaolin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FPGM是一种基于频率先验的半监督学习方法，通过利用息肉边缘的频率特征，显著提升了跨域泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决息肉分割中标注数据不足和域偏移导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 提出FPGM框架，通过两阶段学习域不变频率先验并对未标注图像进行频谱扰动。

Result: 在六个公开数据集上表现最优，零样本泛化能力显著提升。

Conclusion: FPGM为临床部署提供了强大的低监督息肉分割解决方案。

Abstract: Automated polyp segmentation is essential for early diagnosis of colorectal
cancer, yet developing robust models remains challenging due to limited
annotated data and significant performance degradation under domain shift.
Although semi-supervised learning (SSL) reduces annotation requirements,
existing methods rely on generic augmentations that ignore polyp-specific
structural properties, resulting in poor generalization to new imaging centers
and devices. To address this, we introduce Frequency Prior Guided Matching
(FPGM), a novel augmentation framework built on a key discovery: polyp edges
exhibit a remarkably consistent frequency signature across diverse datasets.
FPGM leverages this intrinsic regularity in a two-stage process. It first
learns a domain-invariant frequency prior from the edge regions of labeled
polyps. Then, it performs principled spectral perturbations on unlabeled
images, aligning their amplitude spectra with this learned prior while
preserving phase information to maintain structural integrity. This targeted
alignment normalizes domain-specific textural variations, thereby compelling
the model to learn the underlying, generalizable anatomical structure.
Validated on six public datasets, FPGM establishes a new state-of-the-art
against ten competing methods. It demonstrates exceptional zero-shot
generalization capabilities, achieving over 10% absolute gain in Dice score in
data-scarce scenarios. By significantly enhancing cross-domain robustness, FPGM
presents a powerful solution for clinically deployable polyp segmentation under
limited supervision.

### [5] [Large Language Models Facilitate Vision Reflection in Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06525)
*Guoyuan An,JaeYoon Kim,SungEui Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型多模态模型（LMMs）中视觉反射的可解释性，发现通过提示LMM验证专用视觉模型的预测可提高识别准确率，并分析了视觉反射的内部行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LMMs在视觉任务中的表现及其可解释性，探索如何通过视觉反射提升模型性能。

Method: 通过提示LMM验证视觉模型预测，分析视觉-语言连接器行为，并测试训练无关的连接器在细粒度识别任务中的效果。

Result: LMMs通过文本概念映射视觉特征，依赖少量文本表示而非原始视觉特征；训练无关连接器可提升细粒度识别性能。

Conclusion: 视觉反射是实现稳健且可解释视觉识别的有效策略，为视觉-语言模型的可解释性提供了新见解。

Abstract: This paper presents several novel findings on the explainability of vision
reflection in large multimodal models (LMMs). First, we show that prompting an
LMM to verify the prediction of a specialized vision model can improve
recognition accuracy, even on benchmarks like ImageNet, despite prior evidence
that LMMs typically underperform dedicated vision encoders. Second, we analyze
the internal behavior of vision reflection and find that the vision-language
connector maps visual features into explicit textual concepts, allowing the
language model to reason about prediction plausibility using commonsense
knowledge. We further observe that replacing a large number of vision tokens
with only a few text tokens still enables LLaVA to generate similar answers,
suggesting that LMMs may rely primarily on a compact set of distilled textual
representations rather than raw vision features. Third, we show that a
training-free connector can enhance LMM performance in fine-grained recognition
tasks, without extensive feature-alignment training. Together, these findings
offer new insights into the explainability of vision-language models and
suggest that vision reflection is a promising strategy for achieving robust and
interpretable visual recognition.

### [6] [A Framework Combining 3D CNN and Transformer for Video-Based Behavior Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06528)
*Xiuliang Zhang,Tadiwa Elisha Nyamasvisva,Chuntao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合3D CNN和Transformer的混合框架，用于视频行为识别，解决了传统方法在长程依赖和高计算成本上的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频行为识别在公共安全、智能监控和人机交互中很重要，但传统3D CNN难以建模长程依赖，而Transformer计算成本高。

Method: 混合框架中，3D CNN提取低层次时空特征，Transformer捕捉长程时间依赖，并通过融合机制整合两者。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优于传统3D CNN和独立Transformer，识别精度更高且复杂度可控。

Conclusion: 该混合框架为视频行为识别提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Video-based behavior recognition is essential in fields such as public
safety, intelligent surveillance, and human-computer interaction. Traditional
3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D CNN) effectively capture local
spatiotemporal features but struggle with modeling long-range dependencies.
Conversely, Transformers excel at learning global contextual information but
face challenges with high computational costs. To address these limitations, we
propose a hybrid framework combining 3D CNN and Transformer architectures. The
3D CNN module extracts low-level spatiotemporal features, while the Transformer
module captures long-range temporal dependencies, with a fusion mechanism
integrating both representations. Evaluated on benchmark datasets, the proposed
model outperforms traditional 3D CNN and standalone Transformers, achieving
higher recognition accuracy with manageable complexity. Ablation studies
further validate the complementary strengths of the two modules. This hybrid
framework offers an effective and scalable solution for video-based behavior
recognition.

### [7] [VOccl3D: A Video Benchmark Dataset for 3D Human Pose and Shape Estimation under real Occlusions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06757)
*Yash Garg,Saketh Bachu,Arindam Dutta,Rohit Lal,Sarosij Bose,Calvin-Khang Ta,M. Salman Asif,Amit Roy-Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为VOccl3D的视频遮挡数据集，用于改进3D人体姿态和形状估计方法在真实遮挡场景下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人体姿态和形状估计方法在复杂姿态或严重遮挡情况下表现不佳，且现有遮挡数据集缺乏真实性。

Method: 通过计算机图形渲染技术构建VOccl3D数据集，并结合多样化的真实遮挡场景、服装纹理和人体动作。对CLIFF和BEDLAM-CLIFF方法进行微调，并改进YOLO11检测器。

Result: 微调后的方法在多个公共数据集及VOccl3D测试集上表现显著提升，且改进了遮挡下的人体检测性能。

Conclusion: VOccl3D为未来研究提供了更真实的遮挡基准，推动了遮挡场景下人体姿态和形状估计的发展。

Abstract: Human pose and shape (HPS) estimation methods have been extensively studied,
with many demonstrating high zero-shot performance on in-the-wild images and
videos. However, these methods often struggle in challenging scenarios
involving complex human poses or significant occlusions. Although some studies
address 3D human pose estimation under occlusion, they typically evaluate
performance on datasets that lack realistic or substantial occlusions, e.g.,
most existing datasets introduce occlusions with random patches over the human
or clipart-style overlays, which may not reflect real-world challenges. To
bridge this gap in realistic occlusion datasets, we introduce a novel benchmark
dataset, VOccl3D, a Video-based human Occlusion dataset with 3D body pose and
shape annotations. Inspired by works such as AGORA and BEDLAM, we constructed
this dataset using advanced computer graphics rendering techniques,
incorporating diverse real-world occlusion scenarios, clothing textures, and
human motions. Additionally, we fine-tuned recent HPS methods, CLIFF and
BEDLAM-CLIFF, on our dataset, demonstrating significant qualitative and
quantitative improvements across multiple public datasets, as well as on the
test split of our dataset, while comparing its performance with other
state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we leveraged our dataset to enhance
human detection performance under occlusion by fine-tuning an existing object
detector, YOLO11, thus leading to a robust end-to-end HPS estimation system
under occlusions. Overall, this dataset serves as a valuable resource for
future research aimed at benchmarking methods designed to handle occlusions,
offering a more realistic alternative to existing occlusion datasets. See the

*Jiayuan Wang,Q. M. Jonathan Wu,Katsuya Suto,Ning Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RMT-PPAD是一种基于Transformer的实时多任务模型，用于自动驾驶感知，联合完成目标检测、可行驶区域分割和车道线分割，通过轻量级模块和自适应解码器优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统需要高精度和实时性的全景驾驶感知，现有方法在任务间负迁移和多尺度特征融合方面存在不足。

Method: 提出轻量级门控适配器模块自适应融合共享和任务特定特征，设计自适应分割解码器自动学习多尺度特征权重，解决训练与测试标签不一致问题。

Result: 在BDD100K数据集上，目标检测mAP50达84.9%，可行驶区域分割mIoU达92.6%，车道线分割IoU达56.8%，推理速度32.6 FPS。

Conclusion: RMT-PPAD在性能和实时性上均达到最优，实际场景中表现稳定，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems rely on panoptic driving perception that requires
both precision and real-time performance. In this work, we propose RMT-PPAD, a
real-time, transformer-based multi-task model that jointly performs object
detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line segmentation. We introduce
a lightweight module, a gate control with an adapter to adaptively fuse shared
and task-specific features, effectively alleviating negative transfer between
tasks. Additionally, we design an adaptive segmentation decoder to learn the
weights over multi-scale features automatically during the training stage. This
avoids the manual design of task-specific structures for different segmentation
tasks. We also identify and resolve the inconsistency between training and
testing labels in lane line segmentation. This allows fairer evaluation.
Experiments on the BDD100K dataset demonstrate that RMT-PPAD achieves
state-of-the-art results with mAP50 of 84.9% and Recall of 95.4% for object
detection, mIoU of 92.6% for drivable area segmentation, and IoU of 56.8% and
accuracy of 84.7% for lane line segmentation. The inference speed reaches 32.6
FPS. Moreover, we introduce real-world scenarios to evaluate RMT-PPAD
performance in practice. The results show that RMT-PPAD consistently delivers
stable performance. The source codes and pre-trained models are released at
https://github.com/JiayuanWang-JW/RMT-PPAD.

### [9] [DiffUS: Differentiable Ultrasound Rendering from Volumetric Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06768)
*Noe Bertramo,Gabriel Duguey,Vivek Gopalakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffUS是一种基于物理的可微分超声渲染器，通过模拟超声波的传播和反射，从MRI数据生成逼真的B模式图像，用于术中引导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 术中超声成像的噪声、伪影以及与术前MRI/CT的对齐问题限制了其应用，DiffUS旨在弥合术前计划和术中引导之间的差距。

Method: DiffUS将MRI 3D扫描转换为声阻抗体积，通过射线追踪和反射-透射方程模拟超声波传播，构建稀疏线性系统，并生成包含噪声和伪影的B模式图像。

Result: 在ReMIND数据集上的评估表明，DiffUS能够从脑部MRI数据生成解剖学上准确的超声图像。

Conclusion: DiffUS作为一种可微分渲染器，为术中超声成像提供了高质量的模拟工具，支持下游优化任务。

Abstract: Intraoperative ultrasound imaging provides real-time guidance during numerous
surgical procedures, but its interpretation is complicated by noise, artifacts,
and poor alignment with high-resolution preoperative MRI/CT scans. To bridge
the gap between reoperative planning and intraoperative guidance, we present
DiffUS, a physics-based, differentiable ultrasound renderer that synthesizes
realistic B-mode images from volumetric imaging. DiffUS first converts MRI 3D
scans into acoustic impedance volumes using a machine learning approach. Next,
we simulate ultrasound beam propagation using ray tracing with coupled
reflection-transmission equations. DiffUS formulates wave propagation as a
sparse linear system that captures multiple internal reflections. Finally, we
reconstruct B-mode images via depth-resolved echo extraction across fan-shaped
acquisition geometry, incorporating realistic artifacts including speckle noise
and depth-dependent degradation. DiffUS is entirely implemented as
differentiable tensor operations in PyTorch, enabling gradient-based
optimization for downstream applications such as slice-to-volume registration
and volumetric reconstruction. Evaluation on the ReMIND dataset demonstrates
DiffUS's ability to generate anatomically accurate ultrasound images from brain
MRI data.

### [10] [What Makes "Good" Distractors for Object Hallucination Evaluation in Large Vision-Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06530)
*Ming-Kun Xie,Jia-Hao Xiao,Gang Niu,Lei Feng,Zhiqiang Kou,Min-Ling Zhang,Masashi Sugiyama*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOPE基准通过生成更具误导性的干扰项，更严格评估大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）的幻觉问题，显著优于POPE基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有POPE基准在评估LVLM的幻觉问题时效果逐渐减弱，因其采样策略简单且忽略图像特定信息。

Method: HOPE利用CLIP选择高预测似然的负对象作为干扰项，并通过配对真实对象与错误描述构建误导性干扰项。

Result: HOPE使多种LVLM的精度下降9%至23%，显著暴露其幻觉漏洞。

Conclusion: HOPE为LVLM的幻觉评估提供了更严格的基准，未来可进一步优化其应用。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), empowered by the success of Large
Language Models (LLMs), have achieved impressive performance across domains.
Despite the great advances in LVLMs, they still suffer from the unavailable
object hallucination issue, which tends to generate objects inconsistent with
the image content. The most commonly used Polling-based Object Probing
Evaluation (POPE) benchmark evaluates this issue by sampling negative
categories according to category-level statistics, \textit{e.g.}, category
frequencies and co-occurrence. However, with the continuous advancement of
LVLMs, the POPE benchmark has shown diminishing effectiveness in assessing
object hallucination, as it employs a simplistic sampling strategy that
overlooks image-specific information and restricts distractors to negative
object categories only. In this paper, we introduce the Hallucination
searching-based Object Probing Evaluation (HOPE) benchmark, aiming to generate
the most misleading distractors (\textit{i.e.}, non-existent objects or
incorrect image descriptions) that can trigger hallucination in LVLMs, which
serves as a means to more rigorously assess their immunity to hallucination. To
explore the image-specific information, the content-aware hallucination
searching leverages Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) to
approximate the predictive behavior of LVLMs by selecting negative objects with
the highest predicted likelihood as distractors. To expand the scope of
hallucination assessment, the description-based hallucination searching
constructs highly misleading distractors by pairing true objects with false
descriptions. Experimental results show that HOPE leads to a precision drop of
at least 9\% and up to 23\% across various state-of-the-art LVLMs,
significantly outperforming POPE in exposing hallucination vulnerabilities. The
code is available at https://github.com/xiemk/HOPE.

### [11] [Evaluating Fisheye-Compatible 3D Gaussian Splatting Methods on Real Images Beyond 180 Degree Field of View](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06968)
*Ulas Gunes,Matias Turkulainen,Juho Kannala,Esa Rahtu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 评估了Fisheye-GS和3DGUT两种基于鱼眼镜头的3D高斯散射方法在超过180度视场的真实图像上的表现，分析了它们在极端失真下的处理能力，并提出了一种基于深度的初始化策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究鱼眼镜头在极端视场下的3D重建性能，解决传统SfM初始化在强失真场景下的局限性。

Method: 通过不同视场（200度、160度、120度）评估Fisheye-GS和3DGUT的性能，并提出基于UniK3D预测的深度初始化策略。

Result: Fisheye-GS在160度视场下表现最佳，而3DGUT在全200度视场下保持稳定；UniK3D策略在困难场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: 鱼眼3D高斯散射方法在稀疏且失真严重的图像输入下具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We present the first evaluation of fisheye-based 3D Gaussian Splatting
methods, Fisheye-GS and 3DGUT, on real images with fields of view exceeding 180
degree. Our study covers both indoor and outdoor scenes captured with 200
degree fisheye cameras and analyzes how each method handles extreme distortion
in real world settings. We evaluate performance under varying fields of view
(200 degree, 160 degree, and 120 degree) to study the tradeoff between
peripheral distortion and spatial coverage. Fisheye-GS benefits from field of
view (FoV) reduction, particularly at 160 degree, while 3DGUT remains stable
across all settings and maintains high perceptual quality at the full 200
degree view. To address the limitations of SfM-based initialization, which
often fails under strong distortion, we also propose a depth-based strategy
using UniK3D predictions from only 2-3 fisheye images per scene. Although
UniK3D is not trained on real fisheye data, it produces dense point clouds that
enable reconstruction quality on par with SfM, even in difficult scenes with
fog, glare, or sky. Our results highlight the practical viability of
fisheye-based 3DGS methods for wide-angle 3D reconstruction from sparse and
distortion-heavy image inputs.

### [12] [HiMat: DiT-based Ultra-High Resolution SVBRDF Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07011)
*Zixiong Wang,Jian Yang,Yiwei Hu,Milos Hasan,Beibei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiMat是一个基于扩散的高效框架，用于生成4K分辨率的SVBRDF贴图，通过轻量级CrossStitch模块保持贴图间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率文本到图像生成模型的兴起为SVBRDF生成提供了机会，但如何高效生成多贴图并保持一致性仍具挑战性。

Method: 引入HiMat框架和CrossStitch模块，通过轻量级卷积操作捕获贴图间依赖关系，不显著改变DiT主干。

Result: 实验证明HiMat能生成结构一致且高频细节丰富的4K SVBRDF贴图，并可推广至本征分解等任务。

Conclusion: HiMat为高效生成高质量SVBRDF提供了一种轻量级解决方案。

Abstract: Creating highly detailed SVBRDFs is essential for 3D content creation. The
rise of high-resolution text-to-image generative models, based on diffusion
transformers (DiT), suggests an opportunity to finetune them for this task.
However, retargeting the models to produce multiple aligned SVBRDF maps instead
of just RGB images, while achieving high efficiency and ensuring consistency
across different maps, remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce HiMat:
a memory- and computation-efficient diffusion-based framework capable of
generating native 4K-resolution SVBRDFs. A key challenge we address is
maintaining consistency across different maps in a lightweight manner, without
relying on training new VAEs or significantly altering the DiT backbone (which
would damage its prior capabilities). To tackle this, we introduce the
CrossStitch module, a lightweight convolutional module that captures inter-map
dependencies through localized operations. Its weights are initialized such
that the DiT backbone operation is unchanged before finetuning starts. HiMat
enables generation with strong structural coherence and high-frequency details.
Results with a large set of text prompts demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach for 4K SVBRDF generation. Further experiments suggest generalization
to tasks such as intrinsic decomposition.

Abstract: Object detection models are typically trained on datasets like ImageNet,
COCO, and PASCAL VOC, which focus on everyday objects. However, these lack
signal sparsity found in non-commercial domains. MobilTelesco, a
smartphone-based astrophotography dataset, addresses this by providing sparse
night-sky images. We benchmark several detection models on it, highlighting
challenges under feature-deficient conditions.

TL;DR: Matrix-3D提出了一种利用全景表示生成可探索3D世界的框架，结合了条件视频生成和全景3D重建，解决了现有方法生成场景范围有限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成3D世界时存在场景范围有限的问题，需要一种更广泛覆盖且高质量的解决方案。

Method: 1. 训练轨迹引导的全景视频扩散模型；2. 提出两种3D重建方法：前馈式大范围重建和基于优化的详细重建；3. 引入Matrix-Pano数据集支持训练。

Result: 实验表明，Matrix-3D在全景视频生成和3D世界生成中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: Matrix-3D框架通过全景表示和多种重建方法，实现了高质量、广泛覆盖的3D世界生成。

Abstract: Explorable 3D world generation from a single image or text prompt forms a
cornerstone of spatial intelligence. Recent works utilize video model to
achieve wide-scope and generalizable 3D world generation. However, existing
approaches often suffer from a limited scope in the generated scenes. In this
work, we propose Matrix-3D, a framework that utilize panoramic representation
for wide-coverage omnidirectional explorable 3D world generation that combines
conditional video generation and panoramic 3D reconstruction. We first train a
trajectory-guided panoramic video diffusion model that employs scene mesh
renders as condition, to enable high-quality and geometrically consistent scene
video generation. To lift the panorama scene video to 3D world, we propose two
separate methods: (1) a feed-forward large panorama reconstruction model for
rapid 3D scene reconstruction and (2) an optimization-based pipeline for
accurate and detailed 3D scene reconstruction. To facilitate effective
training, we also introduce the Matrix-Pano dataset, the first large-scale
synthetic collection comprising 116K high-quality static panoramic video
sequences with depth and trajectory annotations. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance
in panoramic video generation and 3D world generation. See more in

*Jinghan Yu,Zhiyuan Ma,Yue Ma,Kaiqi Liu,Yuhan Wang,Jianjun Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MILD的新方法，用于解决复杂多实例场景下的人像擦除问题，通过分层扩散和人类形态引导显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂多实例场景（如人-人遮挡、人-物体纠缠和背景干扰）中表现不佳，主要由于数据集限制和缺乏空间解耦能力。

Method: 提出Multi-Layer Diffusion (MILD)策略，将生成过程分解为语义分离的路径，并引入人类形态引导和空间调制注意力机制。

Result: MILD在挑战性的人像擦除基准测试中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MILD通过分层扩散和人类形态引导有效解决了复杂场景下的人像擦除问题。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the success of diffusion models in
image-customized tasks. Prior works have achieved notable progress on
human-oriented erasing using explicit mask guidance and semantic-aware
inpainting. However, they struggle under complex multi-IP scenarios involving
human-human occlusions, human-object entanglements, and background
interferences. These challenges are mainly due to: 1) Dataset limitations, as
existing datasets rarely cover dense occlusions, camouflaged backgrounds, and
diverse interactions; 2) Lack of spatial decoupling, where foreground instances
cannot be effectively disentangled, limiting clean background restoration. In
this work, we introduce a high-quality multi-IP human erasing dataset with
diverse pose variations and complex backgrounds. We then propose Multi-Layer
Diffusion (MILD), a novel strategy that decomposes generation into semantically
separated pathways for each instance and the background. To enhance
human-centric understanding, we introduce Human Morphology Guidance,
integrating pose, parsing, and spatial relations. We further present
Spatially-Modulated Attention to better guide attention flow. Extensive
experiments show that MILD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on challenging
human erasing benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种仅使用多视角RGB图像进行3D语义场景图估计的方法，克服了伪点几何和背景噪声问题，通过语义掩码和邻域信息提升特征鲁棒性，实验表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在缺乏3D真实标注的情况下，探索仅依赖多视角RGB图像完成3D语义场景图估计任务，解决伪点几何和背景噪声的挑战。

Method: 利用语义掩码引导特征聚合以过滤背景噪声，设计新方法结合邻域节点信息提升鲁棒性，并利用统计先验优化节点和边预测。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在仅使用多视角图像作为输入的情况下，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过语义和空间信息增强节点与边特征，结合邻域关系和统计先验，实现了高效的3D语义场景图估计。

Abstract: Modern 3D semantic scene graph estimation methods utilize ground truth 3D
annotations to accurately predict target objects, predicates, and
relationships. In the absence of given 3D ground truth representations, we
explore leveraging only multi-view RGB images to tackle this task. To attain
robust features for accurate scene graph estimation, we must overcome the noisy
reconstructed pseudo point-based geometry from predicted depth maps and reduce
the amount of background noise present in multi-view image features. The key is
to enrich node and edge features with accurate semantic and spatial information
and through neighboring relations. We obtain semantic masks to guide feature
aggregation to filter background features and design a novel method to
incorporate neighboring node information to aid robustness of our scene graph
estimates. Furthermore, we leverage on explicit statistical priors calculated
from the training summary statistics to refine node and edge predictions based
on their one-hop neighborhood. Our experiments show that our method outperforms
current methods purely using multi-view images as the initial input. Our

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NNObfuscator是一种新型实用控制机制，允许AI模型根据预设条件动态调整性能，避免了传统多模型方法的低效问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度神经网络训练资源密集、定制化需求高以及单一模型难以满足多样化性能要求的问题。

Method: 提出NNObfuscator机制，通过实时调整模型性能，实现单一模型的多层次性能输出。

Result: 实验验证了NNObfuscator在图像分类、语义分割和文本生成图像等任务中的有效性，提高了模型的适应性和资源利用率。

Conclusion: NNObfuscator为AI模型部署提供了更高效、可持续的解决方案，支持分层性能输出和资源优化。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) has become an increasingly
resource-intensive task, requiring large volumes of labeled data, substantial
computational power, and considerable fine-tuning efforts to achieve optimal
performance across diverse use cases. Although pre-trained models offer a
useful starting point, adapting them to meet specific user needs often demands
extensive customization, and infrastructure overhead. This challenge grows when
a single model must support diverse appli-cations with differing requirements
for performance. Traditional solutions often involve training multiple model
versions to meet varying requirements, which can be inefficient and difficult
to maintain. In order to overcome this challenge, we propose NNObfuscator, a
novel utility control mechanism that enables AI models to dynamically modify
their performance according to predefined conditions. It is different from
traditional methods that need separate models for each user. Instead,
NNObfuscator allows a single model to be adapted in real time, giving you
controlled access to multiple levels of performance. This mechanism enables
model owners set up tiered access, ensuring that free-tier users receive a
baseline level of performance while premium users benefit from enhanced
capabilities. The approach improves resource allocation, reduces unnecessary
computation, and supports sustainable business models in AI deployment. To
validate our approach, we conducted experiments on multiple tasks, including
image classification, semantic segmentation, and text to image generation,
using well-established models such as ResNet, DeepLab, VGG16, FCN and Stable
Diffusion. Experimental results show that NNObfuscator successfully makes model
more adaptable, so that a single trained model can handle a broad range of
tasks without requiring a lot of changes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度伪造数据集存在年龄偏见，影响检测模型的公平性。

Method: 通过整合现有数据集和生成合成数据构建年龄多样化数据集，并用三种检测模型评估其效果。

Result: 实验表明，使用该数据集的模型在年龄组间表现更公平，整体准确率和泛化能力提升。

Conclusion: 研究提供了一个可复现的公平数据集和模型流程，为未来公平深度伪造检测研究奠定基础。

Abstract: The challenges associated with deepfake detection are increasing
significantly with the latest advancements in technology and the growing
popularity of deepfake videos and images. Despite the presence of numerous
detection models, demographic bias in the deepfake dataset remains largely
unaddressed. This paper focuses on the mitigation of age-specific bias in the
deepfake dataset by introducing an age-diverse deepfake dataset that will
improve fairness across age groups. The dataset is constructed through a
modular pipeline incorporating the existing deepfake datasets Celeb-DF,
FaceForensics++, and UTKFace datasets, and the creation of synthetic data to
fill the age distribution gaps. The effectiveness and generalizability of this
dataset are evaluated using three deepfake detection models: XceptionNet,
EfficientNet, and LipForensics. Evaluation metrics, including AUC, pAUC, and
EER, revealed that models trained on the age-diverse dataset demonstrated
fairer performance across age groups, improved overall accuracy, and higher
generalization across datasets. This study contributes a reproducible,
fairness-aware deepfake dataset and model pipeline that can serve as a
foundation for future research in fairer deepfake detection. The complete
dataset and implementation code are available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种半自动化的标签错误修正框架REC$\checkmark$D，通过结合现有检测器和众包微任务，显著提升了数据集标签质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标检测数据集中的标签错误（如缺失标签、分类错误或定位不准确）会影响训练和评估效果，但目前缺乏系统性的大规模修正方法。

Method: REC$\checkmark$D框架结合现有错误检测器和众包微任务，通过多标注者独立验证候选边界框，聚合响应以提升标签质量。

Result: 在KITTI数据集的“行人”类中，修正后的标签显示原始标注中至少24%存在错误，验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 当前标签错误检测方法结合REC$\checkmark$D可高效修正错误，但仍需进一步研究以提升检测覆盖率，新发布的基准数据集将推动相关研究。

Abstract: Object detection has advanced rapidly in recent years, driven by increasingly
large and diverse datasets. However, label errors, defined as missing labels,
incorrect classification or inaccurate localization, often compromise the
quality of these datasets. This can have a significant impact on the outcomes
of training and benchmark evaluations. Although several methods now exist for
detecting label errors in object detection datasets, they are typically
validated only on synthetic benchmarks or limited manual inspection. How to
correct such errors systemically and at scale therefore remains an open
problem. We introduce a semi-automated framework for label-error correction
called REC$\checkmark$D (Rechecked). Building on existing detectors, the
framework pairs their error proposals with lightweight, crowd-sourced
microtasks. These tasks enable multiple annotators to independently verify each
candidate bounding box, and their responses are aggregated to estimate
ambiguity and improve label quality. To demonstrate the effectiveness of
REC$\checkmark$D, we apply it to the class pedestrian in the KITTI dataset. Our
crowdsourced review yields high-quality corrected annotations, which indicate a
rate of at least 24% of missing and inaccurate annotations in original
annotations. This validated set will be released as a new real-world benchmark
for label error detection and correction. We show that current label error
detection methods, when combined with our correction framework, can recover
hundreds of errors in the time it would take a human to annotate bounding boxes
from scratch. However, even the best methods still miss up to 66% of the true
errors and with low quality labels introduce more errors than they find. This
highlights the urgent need for further research, now enabled by our released
benchmark.

### [22] [On the effectiveness of multimodal privileged knowledge distillation in two vision transformer based diagnostic applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06558)
*Simon Baur,Alexandra Benova,Emilio Dolgener Cantú,Jackie Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态特权知识蒸馏（MMPKD）方法，利用训练时额外的模态数据指导单模态视觉模型，提升了注意力图的零样本能力，但效果不跨域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在临床实践中部署深度学习模型时，常需结合多种数据模态（如图像、文本、结构化数据）以做出可靠决策，但推理时并非所有模态都可用。

Method: 提出MMPKD训练策略，利用仅在训练时可用的额外模态（如文本或表格数据）指导单模态视觉模型。具体使用基于文本的教师模型（MIMIC-CXR）和基于表格元数据的教师模型（CBIS-DDSM）向视觉Transformer学生模型蒸馏知识。

Result: MMPKD提升了注意力图在输入图像中定位感兴趣区域（ROI）的零样本能力，但效果不跨域。

Conclusion: MMPKD能有效利用训练时的多模态数据提升单模态模型的性能，但跨域泛化能力有限。

Abstract: Deploying deep learning models in clinical practice often requires leveraging
multiple data modalities, such as images, text, and structured data, to achieve
robust and trustworthy decisions. However, not all modalities are always
available at inference time. In this work, we propose multimodal privileged
knowledge distillation (MMPKD), a training strategy that utilizes additional
modalities available solely during training to guide a unimodal vision model.
Specifically, we used a text-based teacher model for chest radiographs
(MIMIC-CXR) and a tabular metadata-based teacher model for mammography
(CBIS-DDSM) to distill knowledge into a vision transformer student model. We
show that MMPKD can improve the resulting attention maps' zero-shot
capabilities of localizing ROI in input images, while this effect does not
generalize across domains, as contrarily suggested by prior research.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新颖的视觉情感引导锚定（VEGA）机制，利用CLIP的图像编码器构建情感特定的视觉锚点，提升多模态情感识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态情感识别任务因文本、声学和视觉信号的复杂交互而具挑战性，现有模型缺乏心理学有意义的先验指导多模态对齐。

Method: 提出VEGA机制，利用CLIP的图像编码器构建情感特定的视觉锚点，结合随机锚点采样策略和自蒸馏的双分支架构。

Result: 在IEMOCAP和MELD数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: VEGA机制通过心理学对齐的视觉锚点，显著提升了多模态情感识别的效果。

Abstract: Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversations remains a challenging task
due to the complex interplay of textual, acoustic and visual signals. While
recent models have improved performance via advanced fusion strategies, they
often lack psychologically meaningful priors to guide multimodal alignment. In
this paper, we revisit the use of CLIP and propose a novel Visual Emotion
Guided Anchoring (VEGA) mechanism that introduces class-level visual semantics
into the fusion and classification process. Distinct from prior work that
primarily utilizes CLIP's textual encoder, our approach leverages its image
encoder to construct emotion-specific visual anchors based on facial exemplars.
These anchors guide unimodal and multimodal features toward a perceptually
grounded and psychologically aligned representation space, drawing inspiration
from cognitive theories (prototypical emotion categories and multisensory
integration). A stochastic anchor sampling strategy further enhances robustness
by balancing semantic stability and intra-class diversity. Integrated into a
dual-branch architecture with self-distillation, our VEGA-augmented model
achieves sota performance on IEMOCAP and MELD. Code is available at:

Abstract: Integrating brain imaging data with clinical reports offers a valuable
opportunity to leverage complementary multimodal information for more effective
and timely diagnosis in practical clinical settings. This approach has gained
significant attention in brain disorder research, yet a key challenge remains:
how to effectively link objective imaging data with subjective text-based
reports, such as doctors' notes. In this work, we propose a novel framework
that aligns brain connectomes with clinical reports in a shared cross-modal
latent space at both the subject and connectome levels, thereby enhancing
representation learning. The key innovation of our approach is that we treat
brain subnetworks as tokens of imaging data, rather than raw image patches, to
align with word tokens in clinical reports. This enables a more efficient
identification of system-level associations between neuroimaging findings and
clinical observations, which is critical since brain disorders often manifest
as network-level abnormalities rather than isolated regional alterations. We
applied our method to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using the ADNI dataset.
Our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance but also
identifies clinically meaningful connectome-text pairs, offering new insights
into the early mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease and supporting the development
of clinically useful multimodal biomarkers.

TL;DR: Surformer v1是一种基于Transformer的架构，结合触觉和视觉输入进行表面材料分类，在准确性和计算效率之间取得了良好平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表面材料识别是机器人感知和物理交互的关键，尤其是结合触觉和视觉输入时。

Method: 提出Surformer v1，结合触觉特征和视觉嵌入，使用模态特定编码器和跨模态注意力层。

Result: Surformer v1在触觉分类中表现最佳，多模态融合下达到99.4%准确率，推理时间0.77毫秒。

Conclusion: Surformer v1在准确性、效率和计算成本之间提供了优越的平衡。

Abstract: Surface material recognition is a key component in robotic perception and
physical interaction, particularly when leveraging both tactile and visual
sensory inputs. In this work, we propose Surformer v1, a transformer-based
architecture designed for surface classification using structured tactile
features and PCA-reduced visual embeddings extracted via ResNet-50. The model
integrates modality-specific encoders with cross-modal attention layers,
enabling rich interactions between vision and touch. Currently,
state-of-the-art deep learning models for vision tasks have achieved remarkable
performance. With this in mind, our first set of experiments focused
exclusively on tactile-only surface classification. Using feature engineering,
we trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models, assessing their
accuracy and inference time. We then implemented an encoder-only Transformer
model tailored for tactile features. This model not only achieved the highest
accuracy but also demonstrated significantly faster inference time compared to
other evaluated models, highlighting its potential for real-time applications.
To extend this investigation, we introduced a multimodal fusion setup by
combining vision and tactile inputs. We trained both Surformer v1 (using
structured features) and Multimodal CNN (using raw images) to examine the
impact of feature-based versus image-based multimodal learning on
classification accuracy and computational efficiency. The results showed that
Surformer v1 achieved 99.4% accuracy with an inference time of 0.77 ms, while
the Multimodal CNN achieved slightly higher accuracy but required significantly
more inference time. These findings suggest Surformer v1 offers a compelling
balance between accuracy, efficiency, and computational cost for surface
material recognition.

Conclusion: 论文填补了视频隐性仇恨言论检测的空白，提出的数据集和方法为未来研究提供了重要基础。

Abstract: The existing research has primarily focused on text and image-based hate
speech detection, video-based approaches remain underexplored. In this work, we
introduce a novel dataset, ImpliHateVid, specifically curated for implicit hate
speech detection in videos. ImpliHateVid consists of 2,009 videos comprising
509 implicit hate videos, 500 explicit hate videos, and 1,000 non-hate videos,
making it one of the first large-scale video datasets dedicated to implicit
hate detection. We also propose a novel two-stage contrastive learning
framework for hate speech detection in videos. In the first stage, we train
modality-specific encoders for audio, text, and image using contrastive loss by
concatenating features from the three encoders. In the second stage, we train
cross-encoders using contrastive learning to refine multimodal representations.
Additionally, we incorporate sentiment, emotion, and caption-based features to
enhance implicit hate detection. We evaluate our method on two datasets,
ImpliHateVid for implicit hate speech detection and another dataset for general
hate speech detection in videos, HateMM dataset, demonstrating the
effectiveness of the proposed multimodal contrastive learning for hateful
content detection in videos and the significance of our dataset.

TL;DR: 论文提出ContextGuard-LVLM框架，通过多阶段上下文推理机制增强视觉-语言大模型，解决细粒度跨模态上下文一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字新闻媒体的普及需要验证内容真实性，传统方法难以解决细粒度跨模态上下文一致性（FCCC）问题。

Method: 基于视觉-语言大模型（LVLMs），结合多阶段上下文推理机制，并通过强化或对抗学习增强模型。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著优于现有零样本基线模型，尤其在复杂逻辑推理和上下文理解方面表现突出。

Conclusion: ContextGuard-LVLM在检测上下文不一致性方面高效且鲁棒，与人类专家判断一致。

Abstract: The proliferation of digital news media necessitates robust methods for
verifying content veracity, particularly regarding the consistency between
visual and textual information. Traditional approaches often fall short in
addressing the fine-grained cross-modal contextual consistency (FCCC) problem,
which encompasses deeper alignment of visual narrative, emotional tone, and
background information with text, beyond mere entity matching. To address this,
we propose ContextGuard-LVLM, a novel framework built upon advanced
Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) and integrating a multi-stage contextual
reasoning mechanism. Our model is uniquely enhanced through reinforced or
adversarial learning paradigms, enabling it to detect subtle contextual
misalignments that evade zero-shot baselines. We extend and augment three
established datasets (TamperedNews-Ent, News400-Ent, MMG-Ent) with new
fine-grained contextual annotations, including "contextual sentiment," "visual
narrative theme," and "scene-event logical coherence," and introduce a
comprehensive CTXT (Contextual Coherence) entity type. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that ContextGuard-LVLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
zero-shot LVLM baselines (InstructBLIP and LLaVA 1.5) across nearly all
fine-grained consistency tasks, showing significant improvements in complex
logical reasoning and nuanced contextual understanding. Furthermore, our model
exhibits superior robustness to subtle perturbations and a higher agreement
rate with human expert judgments on challenging samples, affirming its efficacy
in discerning sophisticated forms of context detachment.

Result: 在Derm7pt数据集上，VL-MedGuide在疾病诊断和概念检测上均达到最优性能（83.55% BACC，80.12% F1）。

Conclusion: VL-MedGuide通过提供可解释的诊断结果，弥合了AI性能与临床实用性之间的差距。

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of skin diseases remains a significant challenge due to
the complex and diverse visual features present in dermatoscopic images, often
compounded by a lack of interpretability in existing purely visual diagnostic
models. To address these limitations, this study introduces VL-MedGuide
(Visual-Linguistic Medical Guide), a novel framework leveraging the powerful
multi-modal understanding and reasoning capabilities of Visual-Language Large
Models (LVLMs) for intelligent and inherently interpretable auxiliary diagnosis
of skin conditions. VL-MedGuide operates in two interconnected stages: a
Multi-modal Concept Perception Module, which identifies and linguistically
describes dermatologically relevant visual features through sophisticated
prompt engineering, and an Explainable Disease Reasoning Module, which
integrates these concepts with raw visual information via Chain-of-Thought
prompting to provide precise disease diagnoses alongside transparent
rationales. Comprehensive experiments on the Derm7pt dataset demonstrate that
VL-MedGuide achieves state-of-the-art performance in both disease diagnosis
(83.55% BACC, 80.12% F1) and concept detection (76.10% BACC, 67.45% F1),
surpassing existing baselines. Furthermore, human evaluations confirm the high
clarity, completeness, and trustworthiness of its generated explanations,
bridging the gap between AI performance and clinical utility by offering
actionable, explainable insights for dermatological practice.

diffusion models to learn the image translation process, allowing for more
coverable modeling of the data distribution and performance improvement of the
cross-domain translation. However, incorporating the translation process within
the diffusion process is still challenging since the two processes are not
aligned exactly, i.e., the diffusion process is applied to the noisy signal
while the translation process is conducted on the clean signal. As a result,
recent diffusion-based studies employ separate training or shallow integration
to learn the two processes, yet this may cause the local minimal of the
translation optimization, constraining the effectiveness of diffusion models.
To address the problem, we propose a novel joint learning framework that aligns
the diffusion and the translation process, thereby improving the global
optimality. Specifically, we propose to extract the image components with
diffusion models to represent the clean signal and employ the translation
process with the image components, enabling an end-to-end joint learning
manner. On the other hand, we introduce a time-dependent translation network to
learn the complex translation mapping, resulting in effective translation
learning and significant performance improvement. Benefiting from the design of
joint learning, our method enables global optimization of both processes,
enhancing the optimality and achieving improved fidelity and structural
consistency. We have conducted extensive experiments on RGB$\leftrightarrow$RGB
and diverse cross-modality translation tasks including
RGB$\leftrightarrow$Edge, RGB$\leftrightarrow$Semantics and
RGB$\leftrightarrow$Depth, showcasing better generative performances than the
state of the arts.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown impressive performance in novel view
synthesis, but challenges remain in rendering scenes with complex specular
reflections and highlights. Existing approaches may produce blurry reflections
due to entanglement between lighting and material properties, or encounter
optimization instability when relying on physically-based inverse rendering. In
this work, we present a neural rendering framework based on dynamic coefficient
decomposition, aiming to improve the modeling of view-dependent appearance. Our
approach decomposes complex appearance into a shared, static neural basis that
encodes intrinsic material properties, and a set of dynamic coefficients
generated by a Coefficient Network conditioned on view and illumination. A
Dynamic Radiance Integrator then combines these components to synthesize the
final radiance. Experimental results on several challenging benchmarks suggest
that our method can produce sharper and more realistic specular highlights
compared to existing techniques. We hope that this decomposition paradigm can
provide a flexible and effective direction for modeling complex appearance in
neural scene representations.

Conclusion: CausalNet解决了关键帧索引误差问题，提升了微表情识别的实用性和准确性。

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) is a highly challenging task in affective
computing. With the reduced-sized micro-expression (ME) input that contains key
information based on key-frame indexes, key-frame-based methods have
significantly improved the performance of MER. However, most of these methods
focus on improving the performance with relatively accurate key-frame indexes,
while ignoring the difficulty of obtaining accurate key-frame indexes and the
objective existence of key-frame index errors, which impedes them from moving
towards practical applications. In this paper, we propose CausalNet, a novel
framework to achieve robust MER facing key-frame index errors while maintaining
accurate recognition. To enhance robustness, CausalNet takes the representation
of the entire ME sequence as the input. To address the information redundancy
brought by the complete ME range input and maintain accurate recognition,
first, the Causal Motion Position Learning Module (CMPLM) is proposed to help
the model locate the muscle movement areas related to Action Units (AUs),
thereby reducing the attention to other redundant areas. Second, the Causal
Attention Block (CAB) is proposed to deeply learn the causal relationships
between the muscle contraction and relaxation movements in MEs. Empirical
experiments have demonstrated that on popular ME benchmarks, the CausalNet has
achieved robust MER under different levels of key-frame index noise. Meanwhile,
it has surpassed state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on several standard MER
benchmarks when using the provided annotated key-frames. Code is available at

Conclusion: 提出的方法在鲁棒性和检测速度上优于基线方法，适用于快速验证场景。

Abstract: In-generation watermarking for detecting and attributing generated content
has recently been explored for latent diffusion models (LDMs), demonstrating
high robustness. However, the use of in-generation watermarks in autoregressive
(AR) image models has not been explored yet. AR models generate images by
autoregressively predicting a sequence of visual tokens that are then decoded
into pixels using a vector-quantized decoder. Inspired by red-green watermarks
for large language models, we examine token-level watermarking schemes that
bias the next-token prediction based on prior tokens. We find that a direct
transfer of these schemes works in principle, but the detectability of the
watermarks decreases considerably under common image perturbations. As a
remedy, we propose two novel watermarking methods that rely on visual token
clustering to assign similar tokens to the same set. Firstly, we investigate a
training-free approach that relies on a cluster lookup table, and secondly, we
finetune VAE encoders to predict token clusters directly from perturbed images.
Overall, our experiments show that cluster-level watermarks improve robustness
against perturbations and regeneration attacks while preserving image quality.
Cluster classification further boosts watermark detectability, outperforming a
set of baselines. Moreover, our methods offer fast verification runtime,
comparable to lightweight post-hoc watermarking methods.

Conclusion: 结构优先的视觉学习能提升效率、泛化能力和人类对齐的归纳偏差，为构建更鲁棒的视觉系统提供策略。

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in computer vision, modern recognition systems
remain limited by their dependence on rich, redundant visual inputs. In
contrast, humans can effortlessly understand sparse, minimal representations
like line drawings - suggesting that structure, rather than appearance,
underlies efficient visual understanding. In this work, we propose using line
drawings as a structure-first pretraining modality to induce more compact and
generalizable visual representations. We show that models pretrained on line
drawings develop stronger shape bias, more focused attention, and greater data
efficiency across classification, detection, and segmentation tasks. Notably,
these models also exhibit lower intrinsic dimensionality, requiring
significantly fewer principal components to capture representational variance -
echoing the similar observation in low dimensional efficient representation in
the brain. Beyond performance improvements, line drawing pretraining produces
more compressible representations, enabling better distillation into
lightweight student models. Students distilled from line-pretrained teachers
consistently outperform those trained from color-supervised teachers,
highlighting the benefits of structurally compact knowledge. Finally, we
demonstrate that the pretraining with line-drawing can also be extended to
unsupervised setting via our proposed method "learning to draw". Together, our
results support the view that structure-first visual learning fosters
efficiency, generalization, and human-aligned inductive biases - offering a
simple yet powerful strategy for building more robust and adaptable vision
systems.

Abstract: Depression is a serious mental health illness that significantly affects an
individual's well-being and quality of life, making early detection crucial for
adequate care and treatment. Detecting depression is often difficult, as it is
based primarily on subjective evaluations during clinical interviews. Hence,
the early diagnosis of depression, thanks to the content of social networks,
has become a prominent research area. The extensive and diverse nature of
user-generated information poses a significant challenge, limiting the accurate
extraction of relevant temporal information and the effective fusion of data
across multiple modalities. This paper introduces MMFformer, a multimodal
depression detection network designed to retrieve depressive spatio-temporal
high-level patterns from multimodal social media information. The transformer
network with residual connections captures spatial features from videos, and a
transformer encoder is exploited to design important temporal dynamics in
audio. Moreover, the fusion architecture fused the extracted features through
late and intermediate fusion strategies to find out the most relevant
intermodal correlations among them. Finally, the proposed network is assessed
on two large-scale depression detection datasets, and the results clearly
reveal that it surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches, improving the
F1-Score by 13.92% for D-Vlog dataset and 7.74% for LMVD dataset. The code is

This input data is reconstructed into volumetric objects that are then input
into non-convex Fourier optics optimization algorithms for phase-only hologram

and quasi-Netwton methods. Comparison of reconstruction performance of these
algorithms as measured by MSE, RMSE, and PSNR is analyzed as well as to HoloNet

Conclusion: Restage4D不仅保留可变形结构，还能自动纠正生成模型的错误，展示了视频先验在4D重演任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Creating deformable 3D content has gained increasing attention with the rise
of text-to-image and image-to-video generative models. While these models
provide rich semantic priors for appearance, they struggle to capture the
physical realism and motion dynamics needed for authentic 4D scene synthesis.
In contrast, real-world videos can provide physically grounded geometry and
articulation cues that are difficult to hallucinate. One question is raised:
\textit{Can we generate physically consistent 4D content by leveraging the
motion priors of the real-world video}? In this work, we explore the task of
reanimating deformable 3D scenes from a single video, using the original
sequence as a supervisory signal to correct artifacts from synthetic motion. We
introduce \textbf{Restage4D}, a geometry-preserving pipeline for
video-conditioned 4D restaging. Our approach uses a video-rewinding training
strategy to temporally bridge a real base video and a synthetic driving video
via a shared motion representation. We further incorporate an occlusion-aware
rigidity loss and a disocclusion backtracing mechanism to improve structural
and geometry consistency under challenging motion. We validate Restage4D on
DAVIS and PointOdyssey, demonstrating improved geometry consistency, motion
quality, and 3D tracking performance. Our method not only preserves deformable
structure under novel motion, but also automatically corrects errors introduced
by generative models, revealing the potential of video prior in 4D restaging
task. Source code and trained models will be released.

Conclusion: FoundBioNet通过大规模预训练和任务微调，提高了诊断准确性和可解释性，有望实现个性化治疗。

Abstract: Accurate, noninvasive detection of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation is
essential for effective glioma management. Traditional methods rely on invasive
tissue sampling, which may fail to capture a tumor's spatial heterogeneity.
While deep learning models have shown promise in molecular profiling, their
performance is often limited by scarce annotated data. In contrast, foundation
deep learning models offer a more generalizable approach for glioma imaging
biomarkers. We propose a Foundation-based Biomarker Network (FoundBioNet) that
utilizes a SWIN-UNETR-based architecture to noninvasively predict IDH mutation
status from multi-parametric MRI. Two key modules are incorporated: Tumor-Aware
Feature Encoding (TAFE) for extracting multi-scale, tumor-focused features, and
Cross-Modality Differential (CMD) for highlighting subtle T2-FLAIR mismatch
signals associated with IDH mutation. The model was trained and validated on a
diverse, multi-center cohort of 1705 glioma patients from six public datasets.
Our model achieved AUCs of 90.58%, 88.08%, 65.41%, and 80.31% on independent
test sets from EGD, TCGA, Ivy GAP, RHUH, and UPenn, consistently outperforming
baseline approaches (p <= 0.05). Ablation studies confirmed that both the TAFE
and CMD modules are essential for improving predictive accuracy. By integrating
large-scale pretraining and task-specific fine-tuning, FoundBioNet enables
generalizable glioma characterization. This approach enhances diagnostic
accuracy and interpretability, with the potential to enable more personalized
patient care.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress
across a range of vision-language tasks and demonstrate strong potential for
traffic accident understanding. However, existing MLLMs in this domain
primarily focus on coarse-grained image-level or video-level comprehension and
often struggle to handle fine-grained visual details or localized scene
components, limiting their applicability in complex accident scenarios. To
address these limitations, we propose SafePLUG, a novel framework that empowers
MLLMs with both Pixel-Level Understanding and temporal Grounding for
comprehensive traffic accident analysis. SafePLUG supports both
arbitrary-shaped visual prompts for region-aware question answering and
pixel-level segmentation based on language instructions, while also enabling
the recognition of temporally anchored events in traffic accident scenarios. To
advance the development of MLLMs for traffic accident understanding, we curate
a new dataset containing multimodal question-answer pairs centered on diverse
accident scenarios, with detailed pixel-level annotations and temporal event
boundaries. Experimental results show that SafePLUG achieves strong performance
on multiple tasks, including region-based question answering, pixel-level
segmentation, temporal event localization, and accident event understanding.
These capabilities lay a foundation for fine-grained understanding of complex
traffic scenes, with the potential to improve driving safety and enhance
situational awareness in smart transportation systems. The code, dataset, and
model checkpoints will be made publicly available at:

Abstract: Accurate localization of organ boundaries is critical in medical imaging for
segmentation, registration, surgical planning, and radiotherapy. While deep
convolutional networks (ConvNets) have advanced general-purpose edge detection
to near-human performance on natural images, their outputs often lack precise
localization, a limitation that is particularly harmful in medical applications
where millimeter-level accuracy is required. Building on a systematic analysis
of ConvNet edge outputs, we propose a medically focused crisp edge detector
that adapts a novel top-down backward refinement architecture to medical images
(2D and volumetric). Our method progressively upsamples and fuses high-level
semantic features with fine-grained low-level cues through a backward
refinement pathway, producing high-resolution, well-localized organ boundaries.
We further extend the design to handle anisotropic volumes by combining 2D
slice-wise refinement with light 3D context aggregation to retain computational
efficiency. Evaluations on several CT and MRI organ datasets demonstrate
substantially improved boundary localization under strict criteria (boundary
F-measure, Hausdorff distance) compared to baseline ConvNet detectors and
contemporary medical edge/contour methods. Importantly, integrating our crisp
edge maps into downstream pipelines yields consistent gains in organ
segmentation (higher Dice scores, lower boundary errors), more accurate image
registration, and improved delineation of lesions near organ interfaces. The
proposed approach produces clinically valuable, crisp organ edges that
materially enhance common medical-imaging tasks.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of melanocytic tumors in dermoscopic images is a
critical step for automated skin cancer screening and clinical decision
support. Unlike natural scene segmentation, lesion delineation must reconcile
subtle texture and color variations, frequent artifacts (hairs, rulers,
bubbles), and a strong need for precise boundary localization to support
downstream diagnosis. In this paper we introduce Our method, a novel ResNet
inspired dual resolution architecture specifically designed for melanocytic
tumor segmentation. Our method maintains a full resolution stream that
preserves fine grained boundary information while a complementary pooled stream
aggregates multi scale contextual cues for robust lesion recognition. The
streams are tightly coupled by boundary aware residual connections that inject
high frequency edge information into deep feature maps, and by a channel
attention module that adapts color and texture sensitivity to dermoscopic
appearance. To further address common imaging artifacts and the limited size of
clinical datasets, we propose a lightweight artifact suppression block and a
multi task training objective that combines a Dice Tversky segmentation loss
with an explicit boundary loss and a contrastive regularizer for feature
stability. The combined design yields pixel accurate masks without requiring
heavy post processing or complex pre training protocols. Extensive experiments
on public dermoscopic benchmarks demonstrate that Our method significantly
improves boundary adherence and clinically relevant segmentation metrics
compared to standard encoder decoder baselines, making it a practical building
block for automated melanoma assessment systems.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of subcutaneous vessels from clinical images is
hampered by scarce, expensive ground truth and by low contrast, noisy
appearance of vessels across patients and modalities. We present a novel weakly
supervised training framework tailored for subcutaneous vessel segmentation
that leverages inexpensive sparse annotations (e.g., centerline traces, dot
markers, or short scribbles). Sparse labels are expanded into dense,
probabilistic supervision via a differentiable random walk label propagation
model whose transition weights incorporate image driven vesselness cues and
tubular continuity priors. The propagation yields per-pixel hitting
probabilities together with calibrated uncertainty estimates; these are
incorporated into an uncertainty weighted loss to avoid over fitting to
ambiguous regions. Crucially, the label-propagator is learned jointly with a
CNN based segmentation predictor, enabling the system to discover vessel edges
and continuity constraints without explicit edge supervision. We further
introduce a topology aware regularizer that encourages centerline connectivity
and penalizes spurious branches, improving clinical usability. In experiments
on clinical subcutaneous imaging datasets, our method consistently outperforms
naive training on sparse labels and conventional dense pseudo-labeling,
producing more complete vascular maps and better calibrated uncertainty for
downstream decision making. The approach substantially reduces annotation
burden while preserving clinically relevant vessel topology.

Conclusion: SAGE-reID是一种高效、低成本的MSDA方法，适用于跨域行人重识别任务。

Abstract: Adapting person re-identification (reID) models to new target environments
remains a challenging problem that is typically addressed using unsupervised
domain adaptation (UDA) methods. Recent works show that when labeled data
originates from several distinct sources (e.g., datasets and cameras),
considering each source separately and applying multi-source domain adaptation
(MSDA) typically yields higher accuracy and robustness compared to blending the
sources and performing conventional UDA. However, state-of-the-art MSDA methods
learn domain-specific backbone models or require access to source domain data
during adaptation, resulting in significant growth in training parameters and
computational cost. In this paper, a Source-free Adaptive Gated Experts
(SAGE-reID) method is introduced for person reID. Our SAGE-reID is a
cost-effective, source-free MSDA method that first trains individual
source-specific low-rank adapters (LoRA) through source-free UDA. Next, a
lightweight gating network is introduced and trained to dynamically assign
optimal merging weights for fusion of LoRA experts, enabling effective
cross-domain knowledge transfer. While the number of backbone parameters
remains constant across source domains, LoRA experts scale linearly but remain
negligible in size (<= 2% of the backbone), reducing both the memory
consumption and risk of overfitting. Extensive experiments conducted on three
challenging benchmarks: Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, and MSMT17 indicate that
SAGE-reID outperforms state-of-the-art methods while being computationally
efficient.

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of accurately forecasting geometric
deviations in manufactured components using advanced 3D surface analysis.
Despite progress in modern manufacturing, maintaining dimensional precision
remains difficult, particularly for complex geometries. We present a
methodology that employs a high-resolution 3D scanner to acquire multi-angle
surface data from 237 components produced across different batches. The data
were processed through precise alignment, noise reduction, and merging
techniques to generate accurate 3D representations. A hybrid machine learning
framework was developed, combining convolutional neural networks for feature
extraction with gradient-boosted decision trees for predictive modeling. The
proposed system achieved a prediction accuracy of 0.012 mm at a 95% confidence
level, representing a 73% improvement over conventional statistical process
control methods. In addition to improved accuracy, the model revealed hidden
correlations between manufacturing parameters and geometric deviations. This
approach offers significant potential for automated quality control, predictive
maintenance, and design optimization in precision manufacturing, and the
resulting dataset provides a strong foundation for future predictive modeling
research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的联合稀疏自表示学习模型，用于多视图聚类，通过引入基数约束提取局部信息，并开发了全局收敛的交替二次惩罚方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视图聚类（MC）旨在利用不同视图的一致性和互补信息进行样本分组，子空间聚类作为MC的基础技术备受关注。

Method: 提出了一种联合稀疏自表示学习模型，使用基数约束提取局部信息，低秩约束揭示全局结构，并开发了交替二次惩罚（AQP）方法解决非凸非光滑模型的收敛问题。

Result: 在六个标准数据集上的实验表明，该模型和AQP方法优于八种最先进的算法。

Conclusion: 该模型通过基数约束和低秩约束有效提取了局部和全局信息，AQP方法解决了收敛问题，表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Multiview clustering (MC) aims to group samples using consistent and
complementary information across various views. The subspace clustering, as a
fundamental technique of MC, has attracted significant attention. In this
paper, we propose a novel joint sparse self-representation learning model for
MC, where a featured difference is the extraction of view-specific local
information by introducing cardinality (i.e., $\ell_0$-norm) constraints
instead of Graph-Laplacian regularization. Specifically, under each view,
cardinality constraints directly restrict the samples used in the
self-representation stage to extract reliable local and global structure
information, while the low-rank constraint aids in revealing a global coherent
structure in the consensus affinity matrix during merging. The attendant
challenge is that Augmented Lagrange Method (ALM)-based alternating
minimization algorithms cannot guarantee convergence when applied directly to
our nonconvex, nonsmooth model, thus resulting in poor generalization ability.
To address it, we develop an alternating quadratic penalty (AQP) method with
global convergence, where two subproblems are iteratively solved by closed-form
solutions. Empirical results on six standard datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our model and AQP method, compared to eight state-of-the-art
algorithms.

TL;DR: VSI是一种多模态关键帧搜索方法，通过整合字幕、时间戳和场景边界，显著提升了长视频理解任务中的关键帧定位和视频问答准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频理解因数据规模庞大而具有挑战性，现有方法因文本查询与视觉内容的多模态对齐不足而效果受限。

Method: 提出VSI方法，通过双流搜索机制（视频搜索流和字幕匹配流）整合视觉和文本信息。

Result: 在LongVideoBench上，VSI的关键帧定位准确率达40.00%，视频问答任务准确率达68.48%，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: VSI在中等至长视频问答任务中达到SOTA，证明了其鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Long video understanding presents a significant challenge to multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) primarily due to the immense data scale. A critical and
widely adopted strategy for making this task computationally tractable is
keyframe retrieval, which seeks to identify a sparse set of video frames that
are most salient to a given textual query. However, the efficacy of this
approach is hindered by weak multimodal alignment between textual queries and
visual content and fails to capture the complex temporal semantic information
required for precise reasoning. To address this, we propose Visual-Subtitle
Integeration(VSI), a multimodal keyframe search method that integrates
subtitles, timestamps, and scene boundaries into a unified multimodal search
process. The proposed method captures the visual information of video frames as
well as the complementary textual information through a dual-stream search
mechanism by Video Search Stream as well as Subtitle Match Stream,
respectively, and improves the keyframe search accuracy through the interaction
of the two search streams. Experimental results show that VSI achieve 40.00%
key frame localization accuracy on the text-relevant subset of LongVideoBench
and 68.48% accuracy on downstream long Video-QA tasks, surpassing competitive
baselines by 20.35% and 15.79%, respectively. Furthermore, on the
LongVideoBench, VSI achieved state-of-the-art(SOTA) in medium-to-long video-QA
tasks, demonstrating the robustness and generalizability of the proposed
multimodal search strategy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的噪声抑制特征金字塔网络（NS-FPN），通过低频引导特征净化（LFP）模块和螺旋感知特征采样（SFS）模块，显著降低了红外小目标检测中的误报率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外小目标检测因目标暗淡、形状模糊及背景干扰而极具挑战性，现有CNN方法虽有效但易增加误报。

Method: 结合LFP模块（抑制噪声）和SFS模块（螺旋采样融合目标特征），构建轻量级NS-FPN。

Result: 在公开数据集上显著减少误报，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NS-FPN为红外小目标检测提供了一种高效且易集成的解决方案。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection and segmentation (IRSTDS) is a critical yet
challenging task in defense and civilian applications, owing to the dim,
shapeless appearance of targets and severe background clutter. Recent CNN-based
methods have achieved promising target perception results, but they only focus
on enhancing feature representation to offset the impact of noise, which
results in the increased false alarms problem. In this paper, through analyzing
the problem from the frequency domain, we pioneer in improving performance from
noise suppression perspective and propose a novel noise-suppression feature
pyramid network (NS-FPN), which integrates a low-frequency guided feature
purification (LFP) module and a spiral-aware feature sampling (SFS) module into
the original FPN structure. The LFP module suppresses the noise features by
purifying high-frequency components to achieve feature enhancement devoid of
noise interference, while the SFS module further adopts spiral sampling to fuse
target-relevant features in feature fusion process. Our NS-FPN is designed to
be lightweight yet effective and can be easily plugged into existing IRSTDS
frameworks. Extensive experiments on the public IRSTDS datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly reduces false alarms and achieves superior
performance on IRSTDS tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为BASIC的方法，通过直接监督视觉嵌入来改进多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的多模态大语言模型在视觉理解上存在视觉嵌入与文本模态之间的差距，缺乏直接的视觉监督，限制了视觉嵌入的精细对齐。

Method: BASIC方法利用LLM浅层中优化的视觉嵌入作为监督，从两个角度指导视觉投影器生成初始嵌入：优化嵌入方向和改善语义匹配。

Result: BASIC显著提升了MLLMs在多个基准测试中的性能，无需额外的监督模型或人工标注。

Conclusion: 直接视觉监督是提升MLLMs视觉理解能力的有效方法。

Abstract: Mainstream Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve visual
understanding by using a vision projector to bridge well-pretrained vision
encoders and large language models (LLMs). The inherent gap between visual and
textual modalities makes the embeddings from the vision projector critical for
visual comprehension. However, current alignment approaches treat visual
embeddings as contextual cues and merely apply auto-regressive supervision to
textual outputs, neglecting the necessity of introducing equivalent direct
visual supervision, which hinders the potential finer alignment of visual
embeddings. In this paper, based on our analysis of the refinement process of
visual embeddings in the LLM's shallow layers, we propose BASIC, a method that
utilizes refined visual embeddings within the LLM as supervision to directly
guide the projector in generating initial visual embeddings. Specifically, the
guidance is conducted from two perspectives: (i) optimizing embedding
directions by reducing angles between initial and supervisory embeddings in
semantic space; (ii) improving semantic matching by minimizing disparities
between the logit distributions of both visual embeddings. Without additional
supervisory models or artificial annotations, BASIC significantly improves the
performance of MLLMs across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our introduced direct visual supervision.

Abstract: Chinese font generation aims to create a new Chinese font library based on
some reference samples. It is a topic of great concern to many font designers
and typographers. Over the past years, with the rapid development of deep
learning algorithms, various new techniques have achieved flourishing and
thriving progress. Nevertheless, how to improve the overall quality of
generated Chinese character images remains a tough issue. In this paper, we
conduct a holistic survey of the recent Chinese font generation approaches
based on deep learning. To be specific, we first illustrate the research
background of the task. Then, we outline our literature selection and analysis
methodology, and review a series of related fundamentals, including classical
deep learning architectures, font representation formats, public datasets, and
frequently-used evaluation metrics. After that, relying on the number of
reference samples required to generate a new font, we categorize the existing
methods into two major groups: many-shot font generation and few-shot font
generation methods. Within each category, representative approaches are
summarized, and their strengths and limitations are also discussed in detail.
Finally, we conclude our paper with the challenges and future directions, with
the expectation to provide some valuable illuminations for the researchers in
this field.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了eMotions数据集和AV-CANet网络，用于短视频情感分析，解决了多模态复杂性和数据不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 短视频情感分析面临多模态复杂性和数据稀缺的挑战，需要新的数据集和方法。

Method: 提出eMotions数据集和多阶段标注流程，设计AV-CANet网络，结合视频Transformer和局部-全局融合模块。

Result: AV-CANet在多个数据集上表现优异，并通过消融实验验证了关键组件。

Conclusion: AV-CANet为短视频情感分析提供了有效解决方案，数据集和代码将开源。

Abstract: Short-form videos (SVs) have become a vital part of our online routine for
acquiring and sharing information. Their multimodal complexity poses new
challenges for video analysis, highlighting the need for video emotion analysis
(VEA) within the community. Given the limited availability of SVs emotion data,
we introduce eMotions, a large-scale dataset consisting of 27,996 videos with
full-scale annotations. To ensure quality and reduce subjective bias, we
emphasize better personnel allocation and propose a multi-stage annotation
procedure. Additionally, we provide the category-balanced and test-oriented
variants through targeted sampling to meet diverse needs. While there have been
significant studies on videos with clear emotional cues (e.g., facial
expressions), analyzing emotions in SVs remains a challenging task. The
challenge arises from the broader content diversity, which introduces more
distinct semantic gaps and complicates the representations learning of
emotion-related features. Furthermore, the prevalence of audio-visual
co-expressions in SVs leads to the local biases and collective information gaps
caused by the inconsistencies in emotional expressions. To tackle this, we
propose AV-CANet, an end-to-end audio-visual fusion network that leverages
video transformer to capture semantically relevant representations. We further
introduce the Local-Global Fusion Module designed to progressively capture the
correlations of audio-visual features. Besides, EP-CE Loss is constructed to
globally steer optimizations with tripolar penalties. Extensive experiments
across three eMotions-related datasets and four public VEA datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed AV-CANet, while providing broad insights for
future research. Moreover, we conduct ablation studies to examine the critical
components of our method. Dataset and code will be made available at Github.

*Chao Yin,Jide Li,Xiaoqiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的实例感知提示框架（IAPF），通过多模态大语言模型和Grounding DINO生成精细实例掩码，显著提升了伪装目标分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练免费方法仅生成语义级提示，导致SAM输出粗糙掩码，无法有效处理多离散伪装实例场景。

Method: IAPF包括文本提示生成器、实例掩码生成器和自一致性投票三步，结合MLLM和Grounding DINO生成精细实例掩码。

Result: 在标准COS基准测试中，IAPF显著优于现有训练免费方法。

Conclusion: IAPF为训练免费COS提供了高效解决方案，解决了多实例场景下的分割问题。

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS) remains highly challenging due to the
intrinsic visual similarity between target objects and their surroundings.
While training-based COS methods achieve good performance, their performance
degrades rapidly with increased annotation sparsity. To circumvent this
limitation, recent studies have explored training-free COS methods, leveraging
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) by automatically generating visual prompts
from a single task-generic prompt (\textit{e.g.}, "\textit{camouflaged
animal}") uniformly applied across all test images. However, these methods
typically produce only semantic-level visual prompts, causing SAM to output
coarse semantic masks and thus failing to handle scenarios with multiple
discrete camouflaged instances effectively. To address this critical
limitation, we propose a simple yet powerful \textbf{I}nstance-\textbf{A}ware
\textbf{P}rompting \textbf{F}ramework (IAPF), the first training-free COS
pipeline that explicitly converts a task-generic prompt into fine-grained
instance masks. Specifically, the IAPF comprises three steps: (1) Text Prompt
Generator, utilizing task-generic queries to prompt a Multimodal Large Language
Model (MLLM) for generating image-specific foreground and background tags; (2)
\textbf{Instance Mask Generator}, leveraging Grounding DINO to produce precise
instance-level bounding box prompts, alongside the proposed Single-Foreground
Multi-Background Prompting strategy to sample region-constrained point prompts
within each box, enabling SAM to yield a candidate instance mask; (3)
Self-consistency Instance Mask Voting, which selects the final COS prediction
by identifying the candidate mask most consistent across multiple candidate
instance masks. Extensive evaluations on standard COS benchmarks demonstrate
that the proposed IAPF significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art
training-free COS methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出MultiRef-bench评估框架，用于多视觉参考图像生成任务，发现现有模型在多参考条件下表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像生成框架主要依赖单源输入，无法满足设计师从多视觉参考中获取灵感的需求。

Method: 引入MultiRef-bench评估框架，包含合成和真实样本，并通过RefBlend生成合成数据。

Result: 实验表明，即使是先进模型（如OmniGen）在多参考条件下表现有限，最高准确率仅66.6%（合成）和79.0%（真实）。

Conclusion: 研究为开发更灵活、类人的创意工具提供了方向，数据集已公开。

Abstract: Visual designers naturally draw inspiration from multiple visual references,
combining diverse elements and aesthetic principles to create artwork. However,
current image generative frameworks predominantly rely on single-source inputs
-- either text prompts or individual reference images. In this paper, we focus
on the task of controllable image generation using multiple visual references.
We introduce MultiRef-bench, a rigorous evaluation framework comprising 990
synthetic and 1,000 real-world samples that require incorporating visual
content from multiple reference images. The synthetic samples are synthetically
generated through our data engine RefBlend, with 10 reference types and 33
reference combinations. Based on RefBlend, we further construct a dataset
MultiRef containing 38k high-quality images to facilitate further research. Our
experiments across three interleaved image-text models (i.e., OmniGen, ACE, and
Show-o) and six agentic frameworks (e.g., ChatDiT and LLM + SD) reveal that
even state-of-the-art systems struggle with multi-reference conditioning, with
the best model OmniGen achieving only 66.6% in synthetic samples and 79.0% in
real-world cases on average compared to the golden answer. These findings
provide valuable directions for developing more flexible and human-like
creative tools that can effectively integrate multiple sources of visual
inspiration. The dataset is publicly available at: https://multiref.github.io/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统行人重识别模型在多模态数据（如RGB、热成像、红外、草图、文本等）上泛化能力差，而现有方法未充分利用MLLMs的推理和跨模态理解能力。

Method: 引入MMReID-Bench基准，包含20,710个多模态查询和库图像，覆盖10种行人重识别任务，全面评估MLLMs的能力。

Result: 实验证明MLLMs在行人重识别中表现优异，但在处理热成像和红外数据时仍有局限。

Conclusion: MMReID-Bench有望推动开发更鲁棒、通用的多模态基础模型。

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) aims to retrieve the images of an interested
person in the gallery images, with wide applications in medical rehabilitation,
abnormal behavior detection, and public security. However, traditional person
ReID models suffer from uni-modal capability, leading to poor generalization
ability in multi-modal data, such as RGB, thermal, infrared, sketch images,
textual descriptions, etc. Recently, the emergence of multi-modal large
language models (MLLMs) shows a promising avenue for addressing this problem.
Despite this potential, existing methods merely regard MLLMs as feature
extractors or caption generators, which do not fully unleash their reasoning,
instruction-following, and cross-modal understanding capabilities. To bridge
this gap, we introduce MMReID-Bench, the first multi-task multi-modal benchmark
specifically designed for person ReID. The MMReID-Bench includes 20,710
multi-modal queries and gallery images covering 10 different person ReID tasks.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the remarkable capabilities of MLLMs in
delivering effective and versatile person ReID. Nevertheless, they also have
limitations in handling a few modalities, particularly thermal and infrared
data. We hope MMReID-Bench can facilitate the community to develop more robust
and generalizable multimodal foundation models for person ReID.

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成任务多关注单轮场景，难以处理多轮创意任务，且单代理系统容易导致意图漂移和编辑不连贯。

Method: Talk2Image通过意图解析、任务分解与协作执行、多视图反馈驱动优化三个关键组件实现多轮对话中的图像生成与编辑。

Result: 实验表明，Talk2Image在可控性、连贯性和用户满意度上优于现有基线。

Conclusion: Talk2Image在多轮图像生成和编辑任务中表现出色，解决了意图漂移和编辑不连贯的问题。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation tasks have driven remarkable advances in diverse
media applications, yet most focus on single-turn scenarios and struggle with
iterative, multi-turn creative tasks. Recent dialogue-based systems attempt to
bridge this gap, but their single-agent, sequential paradigm often causes
intention drift and incoherent edits. To address these limitations, we present
Talk2Image, a novel multi-agent system for interactive image generation and
editing in multi-turn dialogue scenarios. Our approach integrates three key
components: intention parsing from dialogue history, task decomposition and
collaborative execution across specialized agents, and feedback-driven
refinement based on a multi-view evaluation mechanism. Talk2Image enables
step-by-step alignment with user intention and consistent image editing.
Experiments demonstrate that Talk2Image outperforms existing baselines in
controllability, coherence, and user satisfaction across iterative image
generation and editing tasks.

Abstract: Inspired by the success of reinforcement learning (RL) in refining large

training into autoregressive (AR) image generation models. We adapt the Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to refine the vanilla
autoregressive models' outputs by carefully designed reward functions that
evaluate generated images across multiple quality dimensions, including
perceptual quality, realism, and semantic fidelity. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on both class-conditional (i.e., class-to-image) and
text-conditional (i.e., text-to-image) image generation tasks, demonstrating
that our RL-enhanced framework significantly improves both the image quality
and human preference of generated images compared to the standard AR baselines.
Our results show consistent improvements across various evaluation metrics,
establishing the viability of RL-based optimization for AR image generation and
opening new avenues for controllable and high-quality image synthesis. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在文本依从性、上下文保真度和编辑无缝性上存在不足，CannyEdit旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用选择性Canny控制（保留未编辑区域的细节）和双提示引导（结合局部和全局提示），实现精确且连贯的编辑。

Result: 在真实图像编辑任务中，CannyEdit在文本依从性和上下文保真度的平衡上优于现有方法，用户研究显示其编辑结果更不易被识别为AI生成。

Conclusion: CannyEdit通过创新方法显著提升了图像编辑的质量和自然度。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models have enabled training-free
regional image editing by leveraging the generative priors of foundation
models. However, existing methods struggle to balance text adherence in edited
regions, context fidelity in unedited areas, and seamless integration of edits.
We introduce CannyEdit, a novel training-free framework that addresses these
challenges through two key innovations: (1) Selective Canny Control, which
masks the structural guidance of Canny ControlNet in user-specified editable
regions while strictly preserving details of the source images in unedited
areas via inversion-phase ControlNet information retention. This enables
precise, text-driven edits without compromising contextual integrity. (2)
Dual-Prompt Guidance, which combines local prompts for object-specific edits
with a global target prompt to maintain coherent scene interactions. On
real-world image editing tasks (addition, replacement, removal), CannyEdit
outperforms prior methods like KV-Edit, achieving a 2.93 to 10.49 percent
improvement in the balance of text adherence and context fidelity. In terms of
editing seamlessness, user studies reveal only 49.2 percent of general users
and 42.0 percent of AIGC experts identified CannyEdit's results as AI-edited
when paired with real images without edits, versus 76.08 to 89.09 percent for
competitor methods.

approaches hampers meaningful comparisons across different systems. To address
this, we introduce the first Sign Language Production Challenge, held as part
of the third SLRTP Workshop at CVPR 2025. The competition's aims are to
evaluate architectures that translate from spoken language sentences to a
sequence of skeleton poses, known as Text-to-Pose (T2P) translation, over a
range of metrics. For our evaluation data, we use the
RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T dataset, a German Sign Language - Deutsche
Gebardensprache (DGS) weather broadcast dataset. In addition, we curate a
custom hidden test set from a similar domain of discourse. This paper presents
the challenge design and the winning methodologies. The challenge attracted 33
participants who submitted 231 solutions, with the top-performing team
achieving BLEU-1 scores of 31.40 and DTW-MJE of 0.0574. The winning approach
utilized a retrieval-based framework and a pre-trained language model. As part
of the workshop, we release a standardized evaluation network, including
high-quality skeleton extraction-based keypoints establishing a consistent
baseline for the SLP field, which will enable future researchers to compare
their work against a broader range of methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SCOPE的新方法，通过动态增强空间域中的细节和语义来解决细粒度视觉分类问题，超越了固定频率域方法的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决细粒度视觉分类中固定频率域方法缺乏适应性和动态调整能力的问题。

Method: 提出SCOPE方法，包含动态增强细节的SDE模块和学习语义的SSR模块，逐步结合局部细节与全局语义。

Result: 在四个细粒度图像分类基准测试中达到最新最优性能。

Conclusion: SCOPE通过动态增强空间域特征，显著提升了细粒度分类的灵活性和性能。

Abstract: The crux of resolving fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) lies in
capturing discriminative and class-specific cues that correspond to subtle
visual characteristics. Recently, frequency decomposition/transform based
approaches have attracted considerable interests since its appearing
discriminative cue mining ability. However, the frequency-domain methods are
based on fixed basis functions, lacking adaptability to image content and
unable to dynamically adjust feature extraction according to the discriminative
requirements of different images. To address this, we propose a novel method
for FGVC, named Subtle-Cue Oriented Perception Engine (SCOPE), which adaptively
enhances the representational capability of low-level details and high-level
semantics in the spatial domain, breaking through the limitations of fixed
scales in the frequency domain and improving the flexibility of multi-scale
fusion. The core of SCOPE lies in two modules: the Subtle Detail Extractor
(SDE), which dynamically enhances subtle details such as edges and textures
from shallow features, and the Salient Semantic Refiner (SSR), which learns
semantically coherent and structure-aware refinement features from the
high-level features guided by the enhanced shallow features. The SDE and SSR
are cascaded stage-by-stage to progressively combine local details with global
semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves new
state-of-the-art on four popular fine-grained image classification benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2VR攻击仅关注降低视频排名，而提升视频排名的攻击尚未被充分研究，这种攻击可能带来更大的经济或信息传播影响。

Method: 提出ViPro攻击方法，通过模态细化（MoRe）捕捉视觉与文本模态的细粒度交互，增强黑盒可迁移性。

Result: ViPro在白盒、灰盒和黑盒设置下分别平均超越基线30%、10%和4%。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了T2VR的潜在漏洞，提供了攻击的上下界分析，并为防御提供了见解。

Abstract: Thanks to the development of cross-modal models, text-to-video retrieval
(T2VR) is advancing rapidly, but its robustness remains largely unexamined.
Existing attacks against T2VR are designed to push videos away from queries,
i.e., suppressing the ranks of videos, while the attacks that pull videos
towards selected queries, i.e., promoting the ranks of videos, remain largely
unexplored. These attacks can be more impactful as attackers may gain more
views/clicks for financial benefits and widespread (mis)information. To this
end, we pioneer the first attack against T2VR to promote videos adversarially,
dubbed the Video Promotion attack (ViPro). We further propose Modal Refinement
(MoRe) to capture the finer-grained, intricate interaction between visual and
textual modalities to enhance black-box transferability. Comprehensive
experiments cover 2 existing baselines, 3 leading T2VR models, 3 prevailing
datasets with over 10k videos, evaluated under 3 scenarios. All experiments are
conducted in a multi-target setting to reflect realistic scenarios where
attackers seek to promote the video regarding multiple queries simultaneously.
We also evaluated our attacks for defences and imperceptibility. Overall, ViPro
surpasses other baselines by over $30/10/4\%$ for white/grey/black-box settings
on average. Our work highlights an overlooked vulnerability, provides a
qualitative analysis on the upper/lower bound of our attacks, and offers
insights into potential counterplays. Code will be publicly available at

Method: 提出WeatherDiffusion框架，结合文本引导的预测本征图和MAA机制，实现高质量逆向渲染，并构建合成和真实数据集。

Result: 在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，并在下游任务（如目标检测和图像分割）中显著提升鲁棒性。

Conclusion: WeatherDiffusion为自动驾驶场景中的天气和光照编辑提供了有效解决方案，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Forward and inverse rendering have emerged as key techniques for enabling
understanding and reconstruction in the context of autonomous driving (AD).
However, complex weather and illumination pose great challenges to this task.
The emergence of large diffusion models has shown promise in achieving
reasonable results through learning from 2D priors, but these models are
difficult to control and lack robustness. In this paper, we introduce
WeatherDiffusion, a diffusion-based framework for forward and inverse rendering
on AD scenes with various weather and lighting conditions. Our method enables
authentic estimation of material properties, scene geometry, and lighting, and
further supports controllable weather and illumination editing through the use
of predicted intrinsic maps guided by text descriptions. We observe that
different intrinsic maps should correspond to different regions of the original
image. Based on this observation, we propose Intrinsic map-aware attention
(MAA) to enable high-quality inverse rendering. Additionally, we introduce a
synthetic dataset (\ie WeatherSynthetic) and a real-world dataset (\ie
WeatherReal) for forward and inverse rendering on AD scenes with diverse
weather and lighting. Extensive experiments show that our WeatherDiffusion
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks. Moreover, our
method demonstrates significant value in downstream tasks for AD, enhancing the
robustness of object detection and image segmentation in challenging weather
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理复杂文档结构和高度变形时效果不佳，作者认为去扭曲是一个渐进过程而非一步变换。

Method: 将任务重新建模为动态过程，设计TADoc框架，并提出DLS评估指标。

Result: 实验表明TADoc在多种文档类型和变形程度下表现优越。

Conclusion: 动态建模和TADoc框架显著提升了文档去扭曲的效果，DLS指标弥补了现有评估不足。

Abstract: Flattening curved, wrinkled, and rotated document images captured by portable
photographing devices, termed document image dewarping, has become an
increasingly important task with the rise of digital economy and online
working. Although many methods have been proposed recently, they often struggle
to achieve satisfactory results when confronted with intricate document
structures and higher degrees of deformation in real-world scenarios. Our main
insight is that, unlike other document restoration tasks (e.g., deblurring),
dewarping in real physical scenes is a progressive motion rather than a
one-step transformation. Based on this, we have undertaken two key initiatives.
Firstly, we reformulate this task, modeling it for the first time as a dynamic
process that encompasses a series of intermediate states. Secondly, we design a
lightweight framework called TADoc (Time-Aware Document Dewarping Network) to
address the geometric distortion of document images. In addition, due to the
inadequacy of OCR metrics for document images containing sparse text, the
comprehensiveness of evaluation is insufficient. To address this shortcoming,
we propose a new metric -- DLS (Document Layout Similarity) -- to evaluate the
effectiveness of document dewarping in downstream tasks. Extensive experiments
and in-depth evaluations have been conducted and the results indicate that our
model possesses strong robustness, achieving superiority on several benchmarks
with different document types and degrees of distortion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OctreeNCA提出了一种基于八叉树数据结构的轻量级神经细胞自动机模型，用于高效分割高分辨率医学图像和视频，显著降低VRAM消耗并提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像和视频分割需要处理大尺寸输入，传统模型如UNet或Vision Transformers因VRAM消耗大而无法高效处理，导致全局一致性和推理速度受限。

Method: 通过八叉树数据结构扩展神经细胞自动机（NCA）的邻域定义，实现全局知识的高效传递，并开发了CUDA实现的NCA推理函数以减少VRAM需求。

Result: OctreeNCA在评估时比UNet减少90%的VRAM占用，能够一次性分割184兆像素的病理切片或1分钟的手术视频。

Conclusion: OctreeNCA为高分辨率医学图像和视频分割提供了一种高效、低资源消耗的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical applications demand segmentation of large inputs, like prostate MRIs,
pathology slices, or videos of surgery. These inputs should ideally be inferred
at once to provide the model with proper spatial or temporal context. When
segmenting large inputs, the VRAM consumption of the GPU becomes the
bottleneck. Architectures like UNets or Vision Transformers scale very poorly
in VRAM consumption, resulting in patch- or frame-wise approaches that
compromise global consistency and inference speed. The lightweight Neural
Cellular Automaton (NCA) is a bio-inspired model that is by construction
size-invariant. However, due to its local-only communication rules, it lacks
global knowledge. We propose OctreeNCA by generalizing the neighborhood
definition using an octree data structure. Our generalized neighborhood
definition enables the efficient traversal of global knowledge. Since deep
learning frameworks are mainly developed for large multi-layer networks, their
implementation does not fully leverage the advantages of NCAs. We implement an
NCA inference function in CUDA that further reduces VRAM demands and increases
inference speed. Our OctreeNCA segments high-resolution images and videos
quickly while occupying 90% less VRAM than a UNet during evaluation. This
allows us to segment 184 Megapixel pathology slices or 1-minute surgical videos
at once.

Motivation: 现有自监督图像分割模型的多阶段预训练耗时且难以扩展，导致次优解。

Method: 提出快速伪掩码算法UniAP和自监督模型S2-UniSeg，结合QuerySD任务进行连续预训练。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法，如COCO上AP+6.9，UVO上AR+11.1。

Conclusion: S2-UniSeg通过高效伪掩码生成和连续优化，实现了高性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: Recent self-supervised image segmentation models have achieved promising
performance on semantic segmentation and class-agnostic instance segmentation.
However, their pretraining schedule is multi-stage, requiring a time-consuming
pseudo-masks generation process between each training epoch. This
time-consuming offline process not only makes it difficult to scale with
training dataset size, but also leads to sub-optimal solutions due to its
discontinuous optimization routine. To solve these, we first present a novel
pseudo-mask algorithm, Fast Universal Agglomerative Pooling (UniAP). Each layer
of UniAP can identify groups of similar nodes in parallel, allowing to generate
both semantic-level and instance-level and multi-granular pseudo-masks within
ens of milliseconds for one image. Based on the fast UniAP, we propose the
Scalable Self-Supervised Universal Segmentation (S2-UniSeg), which employs a
student and a momentum teacher for continuous pretraining. A novel
segmentation-oriented pretext task, Query-wise Self-Distillation (QuerySD), is
proposed to pretrain S2-UniSeg to learn the local-to-global correspondences.
Under the same setting, S2-UniSeg outperforms the SOTA UnSAM model, achieving
notable improvements of AP+6.9 on COCO, AR+11.1 on UVO, PixelAcc+4.5 on
COCOStuff-27, RQ+8.0 on Cityscapes. After scaling up to a larger 2M-image
subset of SA-1B, S2-UniSeg further achieves performance gains on all four
benchmarks. Our code and pretrained models are available at

Motivation: 高光谱卫星图像具有丰富的空间-光谱信息，但现有自监督方法难以有效利用200+波段的高光谱数据。

Method: 提出TerraMAE框架，采用自适应通道分组策略和增强重建损失函数，优化空间-光谱嵌入学习。

Result: TerraMAE在图像重建和下游任务（作物识别、土地覆盖分类、土壤纹理预测）中表现优异。

Conclusion: TerraMAE为高光谱图像分析提供了高效的空间-光谱表征学习方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral satellite imagery offers sub-30 m views of Earth in hundreds of
contiguous spectral bands, enabling fine-grained mapping of soils, crops, and
land cover. While self-supervised Masked Autoencoders excel on RGB and low-band
multispectral data, they struggle to exploit the intricate spatial-spectral
correlations in 200+ band hyperspectral images. We introduce TerraMAE, a novel
HSI encoding framework specifically designed to learn highly representative
spatial-spectral embeddings for diverse geospatial analyses. TerraMAE features
an adaptive channel grouping strategy, based on statistical reflectance
properties to capture spectral similarities, and an enhanced reconstruction
loss function that incorporates spatial and spectral quality metrics. We
demonstrate TerraMAE's effectiveness through superior spatial-spectral
information preservation in high-fidelity image reconstruction. Furthermore, we
validate its practical utility and the quality of its learned representations
through strong performance on three key downstream geospatial tasks: crop
identification, land cover classification, and soil texture prediction.

Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific literature in PDF format necessitates
advanced tools for efficient and accurate document understanding,

handling complex layouts and multimodal content, while direct application of
Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) lacks
precision and control for intricate editing tasks. This paper introduces
DocRefine, an innovative framework designed for intelligent understanding,
content refinement, and automated summarization of scientific PDF documents,
driven by natural language instructions. DocRefine leverages the power of
advanced LVLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) by orchestrating a sophisticated multi-agent
system comprising six specialized and collaborative agents: Layout & Structure
Analysis, Multimodal Content Understanding, Instruction Decomposition, Content
Refinement, Summarization & Generation, and Fidelity & Consistency
Verification. This closed-loop feedback architecture ensures high semantic
accuracy and visual fidelity. Evaluated on the comprehensive DocEditBench
dataset, DocRefine consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across
various tasks, achieving overall scores of 86.7% for Semantic Consistency Score
(SCS), 93.9% for Layout Fidelity Index (LFI), and 85.0% for Instruction

Abstract: Complex Visual Question Answering (Complex VQA) tasks, which demand
sophisticated multi-modal reasoning and external knowledge integration, present
significant challenges for existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) often
limited by their reliance on high-level global features. To address this, we
propose MV-CoRe (Multimodal Visual-Conceptual Reasoning), a novel model
designed to enhance Complex VQA performance through the deep fusion of diverse

object detection characteristics and scene graph representations. An innovative
Multimodal Fusion Transformer then processes and deeply integrates these
diverse feature sets, enabling rich cross-modal attention and facilitating
complex reasoning. We evaluate MV-CoRe on challenging Complex VQA benchmarks,
including GQA, A-OKVQA, and OKVQA, after training on VQAv2. Our experimental
results demonstrate that MV-CoRe consistently outperforms established LVLM
baselines, achieving an overall accuracy of 77.5% on GQA. Ablation studies
confirm the critical contribution of both object and scene graph features, and
human evaluations further validate MV-CoRe's superior factual correctness and

Abstract: Accurate endoscopic image segmentation on the polyps is critical for early
colorectal cancer detection. However, this task remains challenging due to low
contrast with surrounding mucosa, specular highlights, and indistinct
boundaries. To address these challenges, we propose FOCUS-Med, which stands for
Fusion of spatial and structural graph with attentional context-aware polyp
segmentation in endoscopic medical imaging. FOCUS-Med integrates a Dual Graph
Convolutional Network (Dual-GCN) module to capture contextual spatial and
topological structural dependencies. This graph-based representation enables
the model to better distinguish polyps from background tissues by leveraging
topological cues and spatial connectivity, which are often obscured in raw
image intensities. It enhances the model's ability to preserve boundaries and
delineate complex shapes typical of polyps. In addition, a location-fused
stand-alone self-attention is employed to strengthen global context
integration. To bridge the semantic gap between encoder-decoder layers, we
incorporate a trainable weighted fast normalized fusion strategy for efficient
multi-scale aggregation. Notably, we are the first to introduce the use of a
Large Language Model (LLM) to provide detailed qualitative evaluations of
segmentation quality. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate
that FOCUS-Med achieves state-of-the-art performance across five key metrics,
underscoring its effectiveness and clinical potential for AI-assisted
colonoscopy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D表示（如点云、网格和3D高斯）在渲染质量、表面定义和压缩性方面存在不足，需要一种更高效的3D表示方法。

Method: TeSO将3D场景表示为八叉树组织的立方体边界surfel，每个surfel关联一个纹理贴图，并通过压缩方案高效编码几何和纹理。

Result: TeSO在较低比特率下实现了比点云和3D高斯基线更高的渲染质量。

Conclusion: TeSO是一种高效的3D表示方法，适用于3D流媒体应用。

Abstract: 3D visual content streaming is a key technology for emerging 3D telepresence
and AR/VR applications. One fundamental element underlying the technology is a
versatile 3D representation that is capable of producing high-quality renders
and can be efficiently compressed at the same time. Existing 3D representations
like point clouds, meshes and 3D Gaussians each have limitations in terms of
rendering quality, surface definition, and compressibility. In this paper, we
present the Textured Surfel Octree (TeSO), a novel 3D representation that is
built from point clouds but addresses the aforementioned limitations. It
represents a 3D scene as cube-bounded surfels organized on an octree, where
each surfel is further associated with a texture patch. By approximating a
smooth surface with a large surfel at a coarser level of the octree, it reduces
the number of primitives required to represent the 3D scene, and yet retains
the high-frequency texture details through the texture map attached to each
surfel. We further propose a compression scheme to encode the geometry and
texture efficiently, leveraging the octree structure. The proposed textured
surfel octree combined with the compression scheme achieves higher rendering
quality at lower bit-rates compared to multiple point cloud and 3D
Gaussian-based baselines.

Conclusion: ForeSight通过联合检测与预测，显著提升了自动驾驶车辆的3D感知能力。

Abstract: We introduce ForeSight, a novel joint detection and forecasting framework for
vision-based 3D perception in autonomous vehicles. Traditional approaches treat
detection and forecasting as separate sequential tasks, limiting their ability
to leverage temporal cues. ForeSight addresses this limitation with a
multi-task streaming and bidirectional learning approach, allowing detection
and forecasting to share query memory and propagate information seamlessly. The
forecast-aware detection transformer enhances spatial reasoning by integrating
trajectory predictions from a multiple hypothesis forecast memory queue, while
the streaming forecast transformer improves temporal consistency using past
forecasts and refined detections. Unlike tracking-based methods, ForeSight
eliminates the need for explicit object association, reducing error propagation
with a tracking-free model that efficiently scales across multi-frame
sequences. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that ForeSight achieves
state-of-the-art performance, achieving an EPA of 54.9%, surpassing previous
methods by 9.3%, while also attaining the best mAP and minADE among multi-view
detection and forecasting models.

Conclusion: HyComm在性能和带宽效率上均优于现有方法，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Collaborative 3D detection can substantially boost detection performance by
allowing agents to exchange complementary information. It inherently results in
a fundamental trade-off between detection performance and communication
bandwidth. To tackle this bottleneck issue, we propose a novel hybrid
collaboration that adaptively integrates two types of communication messages:
perceptual outputs, which are compact, and raw observations, which offer richer
information. This approach focuses on two key aspects: i) integrating
complementary information from two message types and ii) prioritizing the most
critical data within each type. By adaptively selecting the most critical set
of messages, it ensures optimal perceptual information and adaptability,
effectively meeting the demands of diverse communication scenarios.Building on
this hybrid collaboration, we present \texttt{HyComm}, a
communication-efficient LiDAR-based collaborative 3D detection system.
\texttt{HyComm} boasts two main benefits: i) it facilitates adaptable
compression rates for messages, addressing various communication requirements,
and ii) it uses standardized data formats for messages. This ensures they are
independent of specific detection models, fostering adaptability across
different agent configurations. To evaluate HyComm, we conduct experiments on
both real-world and simulation datasets: DAIR-V2X and OPV2V. HyComm
consistently outperforms previous methods and achieves a superior
performance-bandwidth trade-off regardless of whether agents use the same or
varied detection models. It achieves a lower communication volume of more than
2,006$\times$ and still outperforms Where2comm on DAIR-V2X in terms of AP50.
The related code will be released.

poses from detected 2D keypoints, often generalize poorly to new datasets and
real-world settings. To address this, we propose \emph{AugLift}, a simple yet
effective reformulation of the standard lifting pipeline that significantly
improves generalization performance without requiring additional data
collection or sensors. AugLift sparsely enriches the standard input -- the 2D
keypoint coordinates $(x, y)$ -- by augmenting it with a keypoint detection
confidence score $c$ and a corresponding depth estimate $d$. These additional
signals are computed from the image using off-the-shelf, pre-trained models
(e.g., for monocular depth estimation), thereby inheriting their strong
generalization capabilities. Importantly, AugLift serves as a modular add-on
and can be readily integrated into existing lifting architectures.
  Our extensive experiments across four datasets demonstrate that AugLift
boosts cross-dataset performance on unseen datasets by an average of $10.1\%$,
while also improving in-distribution performance by $4.0\%$. These gains are
consistent across various lifting architectures, highlighting the robustness of
our method. Our analysis suggests that these sparse, keypoint-aligned cues
provide robust frame-level context, offering a practical way to significantly
improve the generalization of any lifting-based pose estimation model. Code
will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 生成图像模型在医学影像中潜力巨大，但合成图像的真实性和临床实用性仍需验证。本研究评估了GANs和DMs在生成胸片X光图像中的表现，发现两者各有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学影像数据稀缺问题，尤其是低发病率异常，提升AI诊断工具的性能。

Method: 使用GANs和DMs生成胸片X光图像，基于MIMIC-CXR数据集进行真实与合成图像的对比研究，邀请三位放射科医生参与评估。

Result: DMs生成的图像整体更真实，但GANs在某些特定条件下（如ECS缺失）表现更优。

Conclusion: GANs和DMs各有优势，需进一步优化以可靠增强AI诊断系统的训练数据。

Abstract: Generative image models have achieved remarkable progress in both natural and
medical imaging. In the medical context, these techniques offer a potential
solution to data scarcity-especially for low-prevalence anomalies that impair
the performance of AI-driven diagnostic and segmentation tools. However,
questions remain regarding the fidelity and clinical utility of synthetic
images, since poor generation quality can undermine model generalizability and
trust. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of state-of-the-art
generative models-Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models
(DMs)-for synthesizing chest X-rays conditioned on four abnormalities:
Atelectasis (AT), Lung Opacity (LO), Pleural Effusion (PE), and Enlarged
Cardiac Silhouette (ECS). Using a benchmark composed of real images from the
MIMIC-CXR dataset and synthetic images from both GANs and DMs, we conducted a
reader study with three radiologists of varied experience. Participants were
asked to distinguish real from synthetic images and assess the consistency
between visual features and the target abnormality. Our results show that while
DMs generate more visually realistic images overall, GANs can report better
accuracy for specific conditions, such as absence of ECS. We further identify
visual cues radiologists use to detect synthetic images, offering insights into
the perceptual gaps in current models. These findings underscore the
complementary strengths of GANs and DMs and point to the need for further
refinement to ensure generative models can reliably augment training datasets
for AI diagnostic systems.

Conclusion: CMAMRNet为壁画修复提供了高效解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Murals, as invaluable cultural artifacts, face continuous deterioration from
environmental factors and human activities. Digital restoration of murals faces
unique challenges due to their complex degradation patterns and the critical
need to preserve artistic authenticity. Existing learning-based methods
struggle with maintaining consistent mask guidance throughout their networks,
leading to insufficient focus on damaged regions and compromised restoration
quality. We propose CMAMRNet, a Contextual Mask-Aware Mural Restoration Network
that addresses these limitations through comprehensive mask guidance and
multi-scale feature extraction. Our framework introduces two key components:
(1) the Mask-Aware Up/Down-Sampler (MAUDS), which ensures consistent mask
sensitivity across resolution scales through dedicated channel-wise feature
selection and mask-guided feature fusion; and (2) the Co-Feature Aggregator
(CFA), operating at both the highest and lowest resolutions to extract
complementary features for capturing fine textures and global structures in
degraded regions. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
CMAMRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods, effectively preserving both
structural integrity and artistic details in restored murals. The code is

Result: 在15个数据集上的实验表明，DPAL显著提升了轻量级HVMs的泛化性能，甚至接近大型HVMs。

Conclusion: DPAL通过动态模式对齐学习，为轻量级HVMs提供了一种高效的预训练方法，适用于多种人本视觉任务。

Abstract: Human-centric vision models (HVMs) have achieved remarkable generalization
due to large-scale pretraining on massive person images. However, their
dependence on large neural architectures and the restricted accessibility of
pretraining data significantly limits their practicality in real-world
applications. To address this limitation, we propose Dynamic Pattern Alignment
Learning (DPAL), a novel distillation-based pretraining framework that
efficiently trains lightweight HVMs to acquire strong generalization from large
HVMs. In particular, human-centric visual perception are highly dependent on
three typical visual patterns, including global identity pattern, local shape
pattern and multi-person interaction pattern. To achieve generalizable
lightweight HVMs, we firstly design a dynamic pattern decoder (D-PaDe), acting
as a dynamic Mixture of Expert (MoE) model. It incorporates three specialized
experts dedicated to adaptively extract typical visual patterns, conditioned on
both input image and pattern queries. And then, we present three levels of
alignment objectives, which aims to minimize generalization gap between
lightweight HVMs and large HVMs at global image level, local pixel level, and
instance relation level. With these two deliberate designs, the DPAL
effectively guides lightweight model to learn all typical human visual patterns
from large HVMs, which can generalize to various human-centric vision tasks.
Extensive experiments conducted on 15 challenging datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the DPAL. Remarkably, when employing PATH-B as the teacher,
DPAL-ViT/Ti (5M parameters) achieves surprising generalizability similar to
existing large HVMs such as PATH-B (84M) and Sapiens-L (307M), and outperforms
previous distillation-based pretraining methods including Proteus-ViT/Ti (5M)
and TinyMiM-ViT/Ti (5M) by a large margin.

Abstract: Predicting pedestrian motion trajectories is critical for the path planning
and motion control of autonomous vehicles. Recent diffusion-based models have
shown promising results in capturing the inherent stochasticity of pedestrian
behavior for trajectory prediction. However, the absence of explicit semantic
modelling of pedestrian intent in many diffusion-based methods may result in
misinterpreted behaviors and reduced prediction accuracy. To address the above
challenges, we propose a diffusion-based pedestrian trajectory prediction
framework that incorporates both short-term and long-term motion intentions.
Short-term intent is modelled using a residual polar representation, which
decouples direction and magnitude to capture fine-grained local motion
patterns. Long-term intent is estimated through a learnable, token-based
endpoint predictor that generates multiple candidate goals with associated
probabilities, enabling multimodal and context-aware intention modelling.
Furthermore, we enhance the diffusion process by incorporating adaptive
guidance and a residual noise predictor that dynamically refines denoising
accuracy. The proposed framework is evaluated on the widely used ETH, UCY, and
SDD benchmarks, demonstrating competitive results against state-of-the-art
methods.

Motivation: 草图动画通常需要专业技能和时间，对业余用户不友好。本文旨在简化这一过程，使非专业人士也能轻松为草图添加动态效果。

Method: 分为三个阶段：1）外观学习，利用LoRA整合草图外观信息；2）运动学习，从参考视频中提取运动动态；3）视频先验蒸馏，通过SDS更新Bezier曲线参数。

Result: 模型生成的草图视频既保留了原始外观，又复现了参考视频的动态效果，在单次运动定制任务中表现优于其他方法。

Conclusion: SketchAnimator为草图动画提供了一种高效且用户友好的解决方案，适用于非专业人士。

Abstract: Sketching is a uniquely human tool for expressing ideas and creativity. The
animation of sketches infuses life into these static drawings, opening a new
dimension for designers. Animating sketches is a time-consuming process that
demands professional skills and extensive experience, often proving daunting
for amateurs. In this paper, we propose a novel sketch animation model
SketchAnimator, which enables adding creative motion to a given sketch, like "a
jumping car''. Namely, given an input sketch and a reference video, we divide
the sketch animation into three stages: Appearance Learning, Motion Learning
and Video Prior Distillation. In stages 1 and 2, we utilize LoRA to integrate
sketch appearance information and motion dynamics from the reference video into
the pre-trained T2V model. In the third stage, we utilize Score Distillation
Sampling (SDS) to update the parameters of the Bezier curves in each sketch
frame according to the acquired motion information. Consequently, our model
produces a sketch video that not only retains the original appearance of the
sketch but also mirrors the dynamic movements of the reference video. We
compare our method with alternative approaches and demonstrate that it
generates the desired sketch video under the challenge of one-shot motion
customization.

Result: 在BEHAVE和Human-object Interaction数据集上，CoopDiff优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 解耦建模和一致性约束能有效提升人-物交互预测的准确性和一致性。

Abstract: 3D human-object interaction (HOI) anticipation aims to predict the future
motion of humans and their manipulated objects, conditioned on the historical
context. Generally, the articulated humans and rigid objects exhibit different
motion patterns, due to their distinct intrinsic physical properties. However,
this distinction is ignored by most of the existing works, which intend to
capture the dynamics of both humans and objects within a single prediction
model. In this work, we propose a novel contact-consistent decoupled diffusion
framework CoopDiff, which employs two distinct branches to decouple human and
object motion modeling, with the human-object contact points as shared anchors
to bridge the motion generation across branches. The human dynamics branch is
aimed to predict highly structured human motion, while the object dynamics
branch focuses on the object motion with rigid translations and rotations.
These two branches are bridged by a series of shared contact points with
consistency constraint for coherent human-object motion prediction. To further
enhance human-object consistency and prediction reliability, we propose a
human-driven interaction module to guide object motion modeling. Extensive
experiments on the BEHAVE and Human-object Interaction datasets demonstrate
that our CoopDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: In the domain of computer vision, multi-scale feature extraction is vital for
tasks such as salient object detection. However, achieving this capability in
lightweight networks remains challenging due to the trade-off between
efficiency and performance. This paper proposes a novel lightweight multi-scale
feature extraction layer, termed the LMF layer, which employs depthwise
separable dilated convolutions in a fully connected structure. By integrating
multiple LMF layers, we develop LMFNet, a lightweight network tailored for
salient object detection. Our approach significantly reduces the number of
parameters while maintaining competitive performance. Here, we show that LMFNet
achieves state-of-the-art or comparable results on five benchmark datasets with
only 0.81M parameters, outperforming several traditional and lightweight models
in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. Our work not only addresses the
challenge of multi-scale learning in lightweight networks but also demonstrates
the potential for broader applications in image processing tasks. The related

<details>

Motivation: 现有RVOS方法忽视表达式的语义结构，而视频引用表达式比图像更复杂，包含事件属性和时间关系，传统方法难以处理。

Method: EventRR分为对象总结和引用推理两部分：总结阶段通过瓶颈令牌聚合全局跨模态时间上下文；推理阶段通过REG和TCRR进行语义推理。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，EventRR在定量和定性上均优于现有RVOS方法。

Conclusion: EventRR通过结构化语义推理有效解决了视频引用分割的复杂性，为RVOS提供了新思路。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment out the object in
a video referred by an expression. Current RVOS methods view referring
expressions as unstructured sequences, neglecting their crucial semantic
structure essential for referent reasoning. Besides, in contrast to
image-referring expressions whose semantics focus only on object attributes and
object-object relations, video-referring expressions also encompass event
attributes and event-event temporal relations. This complexity challenges
traditional structured reasoning image approaches. In this paper, we propose
the Event Referential Reasoning (EventRR) framework. EventRR decouples RVOS
into object summarization part and referent reasoning part. The summarization
phase begins by summarizing each frame into a set of bottleneck tokens, which
are then efficiently aggregated in the video-level summarization step to
exchange the global cross-modal temporal context. For reasoning part, EventRR
extracts semantic eventful structure of a video-referring expression into
highly expressive Referential Event Graph (REG), which is a single-rooted
directed acyclic graph. Guided by topological traversal of REG, we propose
Temporal Concept-Role Reasoning (TCRR) to accumulate the referring score of
each temporal query from REG leaf nodes to root node. Each reasoning step can
be interpreted as a question-answer pair derived from the concept-role
relations in REG. Extensive experiments across four widely recognized benchmark
datasets, show that EventRR quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms
state-of-the-art RVOS methods. Code is available at

Conclusion: DGN通过深度引导和联合训练显著提升了图像修复效果，具有高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Image restoration has seen substantial progress in recent years. However,
existing methods often neglect depth information, which hurts similarity
matching, results in attention distractions in shallow depth-of-field (DoF)
scenarios, and excessive enhancement of background content in deep DoF
settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Depth-Guided
Network (DGN) for image restoration, together with a novel large-scale
high-resolution dataset. Specifically, the network consists of two interactive
branches: a depth estimation branch that provides structural guidance, and an
image restoration branch that performs the core restoration task. In addition,
the image restoration branch exploits intra-object similarity through
progressive window-based self-attention and captures inter-object similarity
via sparse non-local attention. Through joint training, depth features
contribute to improved restoration quality, while the enhanced visual features
from the restoration branch in turn help refine depth estimation. Notably, we
also introduce a new dataset for training and evaluation, consisting of 9,205
high-resolution images from 403 plant species, with diverse depth and texture
variations. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on several standard benchmarks and generalizes
well to unseen plant images, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.

Abstract: Unsupervised real-world super-resolution (SR) faces critical challenges due
to the complex, unknown degradation distributions in practical scenarios.
Existing methods struggle to generalize from synthetic low-resolution (LR) and
high-resolution (HR) image pairs to real-world data due to a significant domain
gap. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised real-world SR method based on
rectified flow to effectively capture and model real-world degradation,
synthesizing LR-HR training pairs with realistic degradation. Specifically,
given unpaired LR and HR images, we propose a novel Rectified Flow Degradation
Module (RFDM) that introduces degradation-transformed LR (DT-LR) images as
intermediaries. By modeling the degradation trajectory in a continuous and
invertible manner, RFDM better captures real-world degradation and enhances the
realism of generated LR images. Additionally, we propose a Fourier Prior Guided
Degradation Module (FGDM) that leverages structural information embedded in
Fourier phase components to ensure more precise modeling of real-world
degradation. Finally, the LR images are processed by both FGDM and RFDM,
producing final synthetic LR images with real-world degradation. The synthetic
LR images are paired with the given HR images to train the off-the-shelf SR
networks. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method significantly enhances the performance of existing SR approaches in
real-world scenarios.

Method: 1. 利用LLMs分析篡改区域并生成提示文本；2. 提出图像-文本中心模糊模块（ITCAM）量化文本与图像特征的模糊性；3. 提出图像-文本交互模块（ITIM）对齐视觉和文本特征；4. 基于可逆神经网络的恢复边缘解码器（RED）保留边界信息。

Result: 实验表明CMB-Net优于大多数现有IML模型。

Conclusion: CMB-Net通过结合语义和视觉信息，显著提升了图像篡改定位的准确性。

Abstract: The existing image manipulation localization (IML) models mainly relies on
visual cues, but ignores the semantic logical relationships between content
features. In fact, the content semantics conveyed by real images often conform
to human cognitive laws. However, image manipulation technology usually
destroys the internal relationship between content features, thus leaving
semantic clues for IML. In this paper, we propose a cognition-inspired
multimodal boundary-preserving network (CMB-Net). Specifically, CMB-Net
utilizes large language models (LLMs) to analyze manipulated regions within
images and generate prompt-based textual information to compensate for the lack
of semantic relationships in the visual information. Considering that the
erroneous texts induced by hallucination from LLMs will damage the accuracy of
IML, we propose an image-text central ambiguity module (ITCAM). It assigns
weights to the text features by quantifying the ambiguity between text and
image features, thereby ensuring the beneficial impact of textual information.
We also propose an image-text interaction module (ITIM) that aligns visual and
text features using a correlation matrix for fine-grained interaction. Finally,
inspired by invertible neural networks, we propose a restoration edge decoder
(RED) that mutually generates input and output features to preserve boundary
information in manipulated regions without loss. Extensive experiments show
that CMB-Net outperforms most existing IML models.

Abstract: Offline camera calibration techniques typically employ parametric or generic
camera models. Selecting parametric models relies heavily on user experience,
and an inappropriate camera model can significantly affect calibration
accuracy. Meanwhile, generic calibration methods involve complex procedures and
cannot provide traditional intrinsic parameters. This paper reveals a pose
ambiguity in the pose solutions of generic calibration methods that
irreversibly impacts subsequent pose estimation. A linear solver and a
nonlinear optimization are proposed to address this ambiguity issue. Then a
global optimization hybrid calibration method is introduced to integrate
generic and parametric models together, which improves extrinsic parameter
accuracy of generic calibration and mitigates overfitting and numerical
instability in parametric calibration. Simulation and real-world experimental
results demonstrate that the generic-parametric hybrid calibration method
consistently excels across various lens types and noise contamination,
hopefully serving as a reliable and accurate solution for camera calibration in
complex scenarios.

Abstract: Visual speech recognition is a technique to identify spoken content in silent
speech videos, which has raised significant attention in recent years.
Advancements in data-driven deep learning methods have significantly improved
both the speed and accuracy of recognition. However, these deep learning
methods can be effected by visual disturbances, such as lightning conditions,
skin texture and other user-specific features. Data-driven approaches could
reduce the performance degradation caused by these visual disturbances using
models pretrained on large-scale datasets. But these methods often require
large amounts of training data and computational resources, making them costly.
To reduce the influence of user-specific features and enhance performance with
limited data, this paper proposed a landmark guided visual feature extractor.
Facial landmarks are used as auxiliary information to aid in training the
visual feature extractor. A spatio-temporal multi-graph convolutional network
is designed to fully exploit the spatial locations and spatio-temporal features
of facial landmarks. Additionally, a multi-level lip dynamic fusion framework
is introduced to combine the spatio-temporal features of the landmarks with the
visual features extracted from the raw video frames. Experimental results show
that this approach performs well with limited data and also improves the
model's accuracy on unseen speakers.

Abstract: Precise lesion resection depends on accurately identifying fine-grained
anatomical structures. While many coarse-grained segmentation (CGS) methods
have been successful in large-scale segmentation (e.g., organs), they fall
short in clinical scenarios requiring fine-grained segmentation (FGS), which
remains challenging due to frequent individual variations in small-scale
anatomical structures. Although recent Mamba-based models have advanced medical
image segmentation, they often rely on fixed manually-defined scanning orders,
which limit their adaptability to individual variations in FGS. To address
this, we propose ASM-UNet, a novel Mamba-based architecture for FGS. It
introduces adaptive scan scores to dynamically guide the scanning order,
generated by combining group-level commonalities and individual-level
variations. Experiments on two public datasets (ACDC and Synapse) and a newly
proposed challenging biliary tract FGS dataset, namely BTMS, demonstrate that
ASM-UNet achieves superior performance in both CGS and FGS tasks. Our code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/YqunYang/ASM-UNet.

*Xin Ma,Yaohui Wang,Genyun Jia,Xinyuan Chen,Tien-Tsin Wong,Cunjian Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MiraMo框架通过高效线性注意力、运动残差学习和DCT噪声优化，提升图像动画的效率和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图像动画中外观一致性和运动平滑性的挑战，并提升计算效率。

Method: 1. 使用高效线性注意力替代传统自注意力；2. 运动残差学习建模动态；3. DCT噪声优化和动态控制模块。

Result: 实验证明MiraMo在生成一致性、平滑性和可控性动画方面优于现有方法，且推理速度更快。

Conclusion: MiraMo为图像动画提供了高效、一致且平滑的解决方案，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Image animation has seen significant progress, driven by the powerful
generative capabilities of diffusion models. However, maintaining appearance
consistency with static input images and mitigating abrupt motion transitions
in generated animations remain persistent challenges. While text-to-video (T2V)
generation has demonstrated impressive performance with diffusion transformer
models, the image animation field still largely relies on U-Net-based diffusion
models, which lag behind the latest T2V approaches. Moreover, the quadratic
complexity of vanilla self-attention mechanisms in Transformers imposes heavy
computational demands, making image animation particularly resource-intensive.
To address these issues, we propose MiraMo, a framework designed to enhance
efficiency, appearance consistency, and motion smoothness in image animation.
Specifically, MiraMo introduces three key elements: (1) A foundational
text-to-video architecture replacing vanilla self-attention with efficient
linear attention to reduce computational overhead while preserving generation
quality; (2) A novel motion residual learning paradigm that focuses on modeling
motion dynamics rather than directly predicting frames, improving temporal
consistency; and (3) A DCT-based noise refinement strategy during inference to
suppress sudden motion artifacts, complemented by a dynamics control module to
balance motion smoothness and expressiveness. Extensive experiments against
state-of-the-art methods validate the superiority of MiraMo in generating
consistent, smooth, and controllable animations with accelerated inference
speed. Additionally, we demonstrate the versatility of MiraMo through
applications in motion transfer and video editing tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用Transformer和集合论原理的HSV跟踪方法，通过建模光谱和空间交互，提升了跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注空间交互，忽略了光谱交互，导致性能不佳。

Method: 在架构层面，使用Transformer建立波段间空间关系，并基于集合论建模光谱交互；在训练层面，引入光谱损失以增强鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法实现了最先进的跟踪性能。

Conclusion: 通过光谱和空间交互的有效整合，显著提升了HSV跟踪的准确性。

Abstract: Hyperspectral videos (HSVs), with their inherent spatial-spectral-temporal
structure, offer distinct advantages in challenging tracking scenarios such as
cluttered backgrounds and small objects. However, existing methods primarily
focus on spatial interactions between the template and search regions, often
overlooking spectral interactions, leading to suboptimal performance. To
address this issue, this paper investigates spectral interactions from both the
architectural and training perspectives. At the architectural level, we first
establish band-wise long-range spatial relationships between the template and
search regions using Transformers. We then model spectral interactions using
the inclusion-exclusion principle from set theory, treating them as the union
of spatial interactions across all bands. This enables the effective
integration of both shared and band-specific spatial cues. At the training
level, we introduce a spectral loss to enforce material distribution alignment
between the template and predicted regions, enhancing robustness to shape
deformation and appearance variations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our tracker achieves state-of-the-art tracking performance. The source code,
trained models and results will be publicly available via

Motivation: 现有数据集缺乏统一的4D标注和任务驱动的评估协议，无法支持细粒度的时空推理，尤其是对象和人的运动及其交互。

Method: 提出了EgoDynamic4D基准，包含RGB-D视频、相机位姿、实例掩码和4D边界框，并设计了12种动态问答任务。提出了一种端到端的时空推理框架，结合动态和静态场景信息。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在EgoDynamic4D上优于基线，验证了多模态时序建模的有效性。

Conclusion: EgoDynamic4D和提出的框架为动态场景理解提供了新的基准和方法，推动了相关领域的发展。

Abstract: Understanding dynamic 4D scenes from an egocentric perspective-modeling
changes in 3D spatial structure over time-is crucial for human-machine
interaction, autonomous navigation, and embodied intelligence. While existing
egocentric datasets contain dynamic scenes, they lack unified 4D annotations
and task-driven evaluation protocols for fine-grained spatio-temporal
reasoning, especially on motion of objects and human, together with their
interactions. To address this gap, we introduce EgoDynamic4D, a novel QA
benchmark on highly dynamic scenes, comprising RGB-D video, camera poses,
globally unique instance masks, and 4D bounding boxes. We construct 927K QA
pairs accompanied by explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT), enabling verifiable,
step-by-step spatio-temporal reasoning. We design 12 dynamic QA tasks covering
agent motion, human-object interaction, trajectory prediction, relation
understanding, and temporal-causal reasoning, with fine-grained,
multidimensional metrics. To tackle these tasks, we propose an end-to-end
spatio-temporal reasoning framework that unifies dynamic and static scene
information, using instance-aware feature encoding, time and camera encoding,
and spatially adaptive down-sampling to compress large 4D scenes into token
sequences manageable by LLMs. Experiments on EgoDynamic4D show that our method
consistently outperforms baselines, validating the effectiveness of multimodal
temporal modeling for egocentric dynamic scene understanding.

Result: 实验证明SLC框架在多种基准和大型VLM中有效，支持开源和闭源模型。

Conclusion: SLC是首个训练高效且支持广泛个性化应用的框架，代码将开源。

Abstract: Personalizing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to transform them into daily
assistants has emerged as a trending research direction. However, leading
companies like OpenAI continue to increase model size and develop complex
designs such as the chain of thought (CoT). While large VLMs are proficient in
complex multi-modal understanding, their high training costs and limited access
via paid APIs restrict direct personalization. Conversely, small VLMs are
easily personalized and freely available, but they lack sufficient reasoning
capabilities. Inspired by this, we propose a novel collaborative framework
named Small-Large Collaboration (SLC) for large VLM personalization, where the
small VLM is responsible for generating personalized information, while the
large model integrates this personalized information to deliver accurate
responses. To effectively incorporate personalized information, we develop a
test-time reflection strategy, preventing the potential hallucination of the
small VLM. Since SLC only needs to train a meta personalized small VLM for the
large VLMs, the overall process is training-efficient. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first training-efficient framework that supports both
open-source and closed-source large VLMs, enabling broader real-world
personalized applications. We conduct thorough experiments across various
benchmarks and large VLMs to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SLC
framework. The code will be released at https://github.com/Hhankyangg/SLC.

Motivation: 开放世界识别中，现有方法如OOD检测和增量学习存在局限性，无法满足模型自主知识更新的需求。

Method: 提出OpenHAIV框架，结合OOD检测、新类发现和增量持续微调，实现模型在开放世界中的自主知识获取与更新。

Result: OpenHAIV框架能够有效支持模型在开放世界环境中的知识更新和扩展。

Conclusion: OpenHAIV为开放世界识别提供了一种统一的解决方案，解决了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: Substantial progress has been made in various techniques for open-world
recognition. Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods can effectively
distinguish between known and unknown classes in the data, while incremental
learning enables continuous model knowledge updates. However, in open-world
scenarios, these approaches still face limitations. Relying solely on OOD
detection does not facilitate knowledge updates in the model, and incremental
fine-tuning typically requires supervised conditions, which significantly
deviate from open-world settings. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes OpenHAIV, a novel framework that integrates OOD detection, new class
discovery, and incremental continual fine-tuning into a unified pipeline. This
framework allows models to autonomously acquire and update knowledge in
open-world environments. The proposed framework is available at

Abstract: Understanding internal feature representations of deep neural networks (DNNs)
is a fundamental step toward model interpretability. Inspired by neuroscience
methods that probe biological neurons using visual stimuli, recent deep
learning studies have employed Activation Maximization (AM) to synthesize
inputs that elicit strong responses from artificial neurons. In this work, we
propose a unified feature visualization framework applicable to both
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). Unlike
prior efforts that predominantly focus on the last output-layer neurons in
CNNs, we extend feature visualization to intermediate layers as well, offering
deeper insights into the hierarchical structure of learned feature
representations. Furthermore, we investigate how activation maximization can be
leveraged to generate adversarial examples, revealing potential vulnerabilities
and decision boundaries of DNNs. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach in both traditional CNNs and modern ViT, highlighting its
generalizability and interpretive value.

Motivation: 医学图像分割中标签稀缺，现有强-弱伪监督方法因伪标签与图像不一致而性能受限。

Method: SynMatch从生成伪标签的分割模型中提取纹理和形状特征，合成与伪标签高度一致的图像。

Result: 在多种医学图像分割任务中表现优异，尤其在BSL设置下，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SynMatch为标签稀缺问题提供了高效解决方案，尤其在低标注场景下表现突出。

Abstract: Label scarcity remains a major challenge in deep learning-based medical image
segmentation. Recent studies use strong-weak pseudo supervision to leverage
unlabeled data. However, performance is often hindered by inconsistencies
between pseudo labels and their corresponding unlabeled images. In this work,
we propose \textbf{SynMatch}, a novel framework that sidesteps the need for
improving pseudo labels by synthesizing images to match them instead.
Specifically, SynMatch synthesizes images using texture and shape features
extracted from the same segmentation model that generates the corresponding
pseudo labels for unlabeled images. This design enables the generation of
highly consistent synthesized-image-pseudo-label pairs without requiring any
training parameters for image synthesis. We extensively evaluate SynMatch
across diverse medical image segmentation tasks under semi-supervised learning
(SSL), weakly-supervised learning (WSL), and barely-supervised learning (BSL)
settings with increasingly limited annotations. The results demonstrate that
SynMatch achieves superior performance, especially in the most challenging BSL
setting. For example, it outperforms the recent strong-weak pseudo
supervision-based method by 29.71\% and 10.05\% on the polyp segmentation task
with 5\% and 10\% scribble annotations, respectively. The code will be released

Abstract: Real-time semantic segmentation presents the dual challenge of designing
efficient architectures that capture large receptive fields for semantic
understanding while also refining detailed contours. Vision transformers model
long-range dependencies effectively but incur high computational cost. To
address these challenges, we introduce the Large Kernel Attention (LKA)
mechanism. Our proposed Bilateral Efficient Visual Attention Network (BEVANet)
expands the receptive field to capture contextual information and extracts
visual and structural features using Sparse Decomposed Large Separable Kernel
Attentions (SDLSKA). The Comprehensive Kernel Selection (CKS) mechanism
dynamically adapts the receptive field to further enhance performance.
Furthermore, the Deep Large Kernel Pyramid Pooling Module (DLKPPM) enriches
contextual features by synergistically combining dilated convolutions and large
kernel attention. The bilateral architecture facilitates frequent branch
communication, and the Boundary Guided Adaptive Fusion (BGAF) module enhances
boundary delineation by integrating spatial and semantic features under
boundary guidance. BEVANet achieves real-time segmentation at 33 FPS, yielding
79.3% mIoU without pretraining and 81.0% mIoU on Cityscapes after ImageNet
pretraining, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance. The code and model is

Abstract: Fine-grained multimodal capability in Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) has emerged as a critical research direction, particularly for tackling
the visual grounding (VG) problem. Despite the strong performance achieved by
existing approaches, they often employ disparate design choices when
fine-tuning MLLMs for VG, lacking systematic verification to support these
designs. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive study of
various design choices that impact the VG performance of MLLMs. We conduct our
analysis using LLaVA-1.5, which has been widely adopted in prior empirical
studies of MLLMs. While more recent models exist, we follow this convention to
ensure our findings remain broadly applicable and extendable to other
architectures. We cover two key aspects: (1) exploring different visual
grounding paradigms in MLLMs, identifying the most effective design, and
providing our insights; and (2) conducting ablation studies on the design of
grounding data to optimize MLLMs' fine-tuning for the VG task. Finally, our
findings contribute to a stronger MLLM for VG, achieving improvements of +5.6%
/ +6.9% / +7.0% on RefCOCO/+/g over the LLaVA-1.5.

Abstract: Efficient lightweight neural networks are with increasing attention due to
their faster reasoning speed and easier deployment on mobile devices. However,
existing video pre-trained models still focus on the common ViT architecture
with high latency, and few works attempt to build efficient architecture on

video-text model that can run on mobile devices with strong zero-shot
classification and retrieval capabilities, termed as MobileViCLIP. In
particular, in terms of inference speed on mobile devices, our
MobileViCLIP-Small is 55.4x times faster than InternVideo2-L14 and 6.7x faster

Result: DocR1在多页任务中达到最优性能，同时在单页任务中保持稳定表现。

Conclusion: EviGRPO框架有效提升多页文档理解能力，DocR1模型在有限监督下实现高性能。

Abstract: Understanding multi-page documents poses a significant challenge for
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), as it requires fine-grained visual
comprehension and multi-hop reasoning across pages. While prior work has
explored reinforcement learning (RL) for enhancing advanced reasoning in MLLMs,
its application to multi-page document understanding remains underexplored. In
this paper, we introduce DocR1, an MLLM trained with a novel RL framework,
Evidence Page-Guided GRPO (EviGRPO). EviGRPO incorporates an evidence-aware
reward mechanism that promotes a coarse-to-fine reasoning strategy, guiding the
model to first retrieve relevant pages before generating answers. This training
paradigm enables us to build high-quality models with limited supervision. To
support this, we design a two-stage annotation pipeline and a curriculum
learning strategy, based on which we construct two datasets: EviBench, a
high-quality training set with 4.8k examples, and ArxivFullQA, an evaluation
benchmark with 8.6k QA pairs based on scientific papers. Extensive experiments
across a wide range of benchmarks demonstrate that DocR1 achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multi-page tasks, while consistently
maintaining strong results on single-page benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有图像描述生成方法依赖对象检测器或结合GCN，但存在冗余信息、构建复杂和高成本的问题。

Method: RORPCap通过对象和关系提取模型获取语义信息，结合预定义提示模板和Mamba映射网络，生成文本增强特征嵌入，最终用GPT-2生成描述。

Conclusion: RORPCap在训练时间和性能上表现优异，有望成为图像描述生成的替代方案。

Abstract: Image captioning aims to generate natural language descriptions for input
images in an open-form manner. To accurately generate descriptions related to
the image, a critical step in image captioning is to identify objects and
understand their relations within the image. Modern approaches typically
capitalize on object detectors or combine detectors with Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN). However, these models suffer from redundant detection
information, difficulty in GCN construction, and high training costs. To
address these issues, a Retrieval-based Objects and Relations Prompt for Image
Captioning (RORPCap) is proposed, inspired by the fact that image-text
retrieval can provide rich semantic information for input images. RORPCap
employs an Objects and relations Extraction Model to extract object and
relation words from the image. These words are then incorporate into predefined
prompt templates and encoded as prompt embeddings. Next, a Mamba-based mapping
network is designed to quickly map image embeddings extracted by CLIP to
visual-text embeddings. Finally, the resulting prompt embeddings and
visual-text embeddings are concatenated to form textual-enriched feature
embeddings, which are fed into a GPT-2 model for caption generation. Extensive
experiments conducted on the widely used MS-COCO dataset show that the RORPCap
requires only 2.6 hours under cross-entropy loss training, achieving 120.5%
CIDEr score and 22.0% SPICE score on the "Karpathy" test split. RORPCap
achieves comparable performance metrics to detector-based and GCN-based models
with the shortest training time and demonstrates its potential as an
alternative for image captioning.

Result: 在Referring Video Object Segmentation和Temporal Grounding任务中表现优于现有方法，尤其在复杂提示下效果显著。

Conclusion: Planner-Refiner框架在视频-语言对齐任务中具有潜力，特别是在处理复杂语言提示时表现突出。

Abstract: Vision-language alignment in video must address the complexity of language,
evolving interacting entities, their action chains, and semantic gaps between
language and vision. This work introduces Planner-Refiner, a framework to
overcome these challenges. Planner-Refiner bridges the semantic gap by
iteratively refining visual elements' space-time representation, guided by
language until semantic gaps are minimal. A Planner module schedules language
guidance by decomposing complex linguistic prompts into short sentence chains.
The Refiner processes each short sentence, a noun-phrase and verb-phrase pair,
to direct visual tokens' self-attention across space then time, achieving
efficient single-step refinement. A recurrent system chains these steps,
maintaining refined visual token representations. The final representation
feeds into task-specific heads for alignment generation. We demonstrate
Planner-Refiner's effectiveness on two video-language alignment tasks:
Referring Video Object Segmentation and Temporal Grounding with varying
language complexity. We further introduce a new MeViS-X benchmark to assess
models' capability with long queries. Superior performance versus
state-of-the-art methods on these benchmarks shows the approach's potential,
especially for complex prompts.

TL;DR: CoAR是一种新颖的框架，通过冻结预训练参数，注入主题概念到统一自回归模型中，显著提升计算和内存效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有定制生成方法依赖全微调或适配器，成本高且易过拟合或灾难性遗忘，需更高效解决方案。

Method: 采用层间多模态上下文学习策略，仅用极少参数学习主题表示，并引入正则化防止过拟合和语言漂移。

Result: CoAR在主题和风格个性化任务中表现优异，参数调整量不到0.05%，计算效率显著提升。

Conclusion: CoAR为定制图像生成提供高效解决方案，同时保持预训练模型的性能。

Abstract: The unified autoregressive (AR) model excels at multimodal understanding and
generation, but its potential for customized image generation remains
underexplored. Existing customized generation methods rely on full fine-tuning
or adapters, making them costly and prone to overfitting or catastrophic
forgetting. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CoAR}, a novel framework for
injecting subject concepts into the unified AR models while keeping all
pre-trained parameters completely frozen. CoAR learns effective, specific
subject representations with only a minimal number of parameters using a
Layerwise Multimodal Context Learning strategy. To address overfitting and
language drift, we further introduce regularization that preserves the
pre-trained distribution and anchors context tokens to improve subject fidelity
and re-contextualization. Additionally, CoAR supports training-free subject
customization in a user-provided style. Experiments demonstrate that CoAR
achieves superior performance on both subject-driven personalization and style
personalization, while delivering significant gains in computational and memory
efficiency. Notably, CoAR tunes less than \textbf{0.05\%} of the parameters
while achieving competitive performance compared to recent Proxy-Tuning. Code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: JPEG高压缩比会引入严重的视觉伪影，现有深度学习方法难以恢复复杂纹理细节，导致输出过度平滑。

Method: 提出SODiff模型，结合语义对齐图像提示提取器（SAIPE）和质量因子感知时间预测器，优化扩散过程。

Result: 实验表明，SODiff在视觉质量和定量指标上均优于现有领先方法。

Conclusion: SODiff通过语义导向和自适应时间预测，有效解决了JPEG伪影去除问题。

Abstract: JPEG, as a widely used image compression standard, often introduces severe
visual artifacts when achieving high compression ratios. Although existing deep
learning-based restoration methods have made considerable progress, they often
struggle to recover complex texture details, resulting in over-smoothed
outputs. To overcome these limitations, we propose SODiff, a novel and
efficient semantic-oriented one-step diffusion model for JPEG artifacts
removal. Our core idea is that effective restoration hinges on providing
semantic-oriented guidance to the pre-trained diffusion model, thereby fully
leveraging its powerful generative prior. To this end, SODiff incorporates a
semantic-aligned image prompt extractor (SAIPE). SAIPE extracts rich features
from low-quality (LQ) images and projects them into an embedding space
semantically aligned with that of the text encoder. Simultaneously, it
preserves crucial information for faithful reconstruction. Furthermore, we
propose a quality factor-aware time predictor that implicitly learns the
compression quality factor (QF) of the LQ image and adaptively selects the
optimal denoising start timestep for the diffusion process. Extensive
experimental results show that our SODiff outperforms recent leading methods in
both visual quality and quantitative metrics. Code is available at:

Motivation: 传统2DGS在大规模复杂城市场景中表现不佳，导致建筑重建不完整。

Method: GS4Buildings直接从低细节语义3D建筑模型初始化高斯，并利用先验深度和法线图优化重建过程。

Result: 实验显示，GS4Buildings重建完整性提升20.5%，几何精度提升32.8%，高斯基元减少71.8%。

Conclusion: 语义建筑模型集成有助于推动高斯泼溅技术在智慧城市等实际应用中的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting (GS) have demonstrated its
effectiveness in photo-realistic rendering and 3D reconstruction. Among these,
2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) is particularly suitable for surface
reconstruction due to its flattened Gaussian representation and integrated
normal regularization. However, its performance often degrades in large-scale
and complex urban scenes with frequent occlusions, leading to incomplete
building reconstructions. We propose GS4Buildings, a novel prior-guided
Gaussian Splatting method leveraging the ubiquity of semantic 3D building
models for robust and scalable building surface reconstruction. Instead of
relying on traditional Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines, GS4Buildings
initializes Gaussians directly from low-level Level of Detail (LoD)2 semantic
3D building models. Moreover, we generate prior depth and normal maps from the
planar building geometry and incorporate them into the optimization process,
providing strong geometric guidance for surface consistency and structural
accuracy. We also introduce an optional building-focused mode that limits
reconstruction to building regions, achieving a 71.8% reduction in Gaussian
primitives and enabling a more efficient and compact representation.
Experiments on urban datasets demonstrate that GS4Buildings improves
reconstruction completeness by 20.5% and geometric accuracy by 32.8%. These
results highlight the potential of semantic building model integration to
advance GS-based reconstruction toward real-world urban applications such as
smart cities and digital twins. Our project is available:

Motivation: 现有深度学习全色锐化模型在跨传感器数据上泛化能力差，传统方法耗时或需额外数据。

Method: 通过模块化分解模型，在关键接口引入特征裁剪器，利用物理感知无监督损失高效训练，并采用分块并行推理。

Result: 实验表明，方法在跨传感器数据上达到最优质量和效率，训练和推理时间大幅缩短。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了跨传感器泛化能力，同时实现了高效训练和推理。

Abstract: Deep learning methods for pansharpening have advanced rapidly, yet models
pretrained on data from a specific sensor often generalize poorly to data from
other sensors. Existing methods to tackle such cross-sensor degradation include
retraining model or zero-shot methods, but they are highly time-consuming or
even need extra training data. To address these challenges, our method first
performs modular decomposition on deep learning-based pansharpening models,
revealing a general yet critical interface where high-dimensional fused
features begin mapping to the channel space of the final image. % may need
revisement A Feature Tailor is then integrated at this interface to address
cross-sensor degradation at the feature level, and is trained efficiently with
physics-aware unsupervised losses. Moreover, our method operates in a
patch-wise manner, training on partial patches and performing parallel
inference on all patches to boost efficiency. Our method offers two key
advantages: (1) $\textit{Improved Generalization Ability}$: it significantly
enhance performance in cross-sensor cases. (2) $\textit{Low Generalization
Cost}$: it achieves sub-second training and inference, requiring only partial
test inputs and no external data, whereas prior methods often take minutes or
even hours. Experiments on the real-world data from multiple datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art quality and efficiency in
tackling cross-sensor degradation. For example, training and inference of
$512\times512\times8$ image within $\textit{0.2 seconds}$ and
$4000\times4000\times8$ image within $\textit{3 seconds}$ at the fastest
setting on a commonly used RTX 3090 GPU, which is over 100 times faster than
zero-shot methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）在多视图重建中表现优异，但在稀疏视图下效果不佳。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出DIP-GS，利用Deep Image Prior的内部结构和模式，以粗到细的方式优化3DGS。

Result: DIP-GS在稀疏视图重建任务中达到SOTA水平。

Conclusion: DIP-GS无需预训练模型，仅依赖输入帧即可实现高质量稀疏视图重建。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a leading 3D scene reconstruction method,
obtaining high-quality reconstruction with real-time rendering runtime
performance. The main idea behind 3DGS is to represent the scene as a
collection of 3D gaussians, while learning their parameters to fit the given
views of the scene. While achieving superior performance in the presence of
many views, 3DGS struggles with sparse view reconstruction, where the input
views are sparse and do not fully cover the scene and have low overlaps. In
this paper, we propose DIP-GS, a Deep Image Prior (DIP) 3DGS representation. By
using the DIP prior, which utilizes internal structure and patterns, with
coarse-to-fine manner, DIP-based 3DGS can operate in scenarios where vanilla
3DGS fails, such as sparse view recovery. Note that our approach does not use
any pre-trained models such as generative models and depth estimation, but
rather relies only on the input frames. Among such methods, DIP-GS obtains
state-of-the-art (SOTA) competitive results on various sparse-view
reconstruction tasks, demonstrating its capabilities.

TL;DR: LET-US是一个用于长事件流-文本理解的框架，通过自适应压缩机制减少输入事件量，同时保留关键视觉细节，实现了跨模态推理理解的新突破。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在RGB视频内容分析上成功，但无法有效解释事件流或仅能处理短序列。事件流具有稀疏、异步和高动态范围特性，需要新的方法。

Method: 采用两阶段优化范式，逐步提升模型对事件场景的理解能力；利用文本引导的跨模态查询进行特征降维，结合分层聚类和相似性计算提取代表性事件特征；构建大规模事件-文本对齐数据集。

Result: 实验表明，LET-US在长事件流的描述准确性和语义理解上优于现有MLLMs。

Conclusion: LET-US为长事件流与文本的跨模态理解提供了有效解决方案，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Event cameras output event streams as sparse, asynchronous data with
microsecond-level temporal resolution, enabling visual perception with low
latency and a high dynamic range. While existing Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) have achieved significant success in understanding and analyzing
RGB video content, they either fail to interpret event streams effectively or
remain constrained to very short sequences. In this paper, we introduce LET-US,
a framework for long event-stream--text comprehension that employs an adaptive
compression mechanism to reduce the volume of input events while preserving
critical visual details. LET-US thus establishes a new frontier in cross-modal
inferential understanding over extended event sequences. To bridge the
substantial modality gap between event streams and textual representations, we
adopt a two-stage optimization paradigm that progressively equips our model
with the capacity to interpret event-based scenes. To handle the voluminous
temporal information inherent in long event streams, we leverage text-guided
cross-modal queries for feature reduction, augmented by hierarchical clustering
and similarity computation to distill the most representative event features.
Moreover, we curate and construct a large-scale event-text aligned dataset to
train our model, achieving tighter alignment of event features within the LLM
embedding space. We also develop a comprehensive benchmark covering a diverse
set of tasks -- reasoning, captioning, classification, temporal localization
and moment retrieval. Experimental results demonstrate that LET-US outperforms
prior state-of-the-art MLLMs in both descriptive accuracy and semantic
comprehension on long-duration event streams. All datasets, codes, and models
will be publicly available.

Result: 实验表明ForensicsSAM在对抗攻击下表现优越，同时在伪造检测和定位任务中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: ForensicsSAM有效解决了PEFT方法的对抗脆弱性问题，为IFDL任务提供了鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a popular strategy for
adapting large vision foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model
(SAM) and LLaVA, to downstream tasks like image forgery detection and
localization (IFDL). However, existing PEFT-based approaches overlook their
vulnerability to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we show that highly
transferable adversarial images can be crafted solely via the upstream model,
without accessing the downstream model or training data, significantly
degrading the IFDL performance. To address this, we propose ForensicsSAM, a
unified IFDL framework with built-in adversarial robustness. Our design is
guided by three key ideas: (1) To compensate for the lack of forgery-relevant
knowledge in the frozen image encoder, we inject forgery experts into each
transformer block to enhance its ability to capture forgery artifacts. These
forgery experts are always activated and shared across any input images. (2) To
detect adversarial images, we design an light-weight adversary detector that
learns to capture structured, task-specific artifact in RGB domain, enabling
reliable discrimination across various attack methods. (3) To resist
adversarial attacks, we inject adversary experts into the global attention
layers and MLP modules to progressively correct feature shifts induced by
adversarial noise. These adversary experts are adaptively activated by the
adversary detector, thereby avoiding unnecessary interference with clean
images. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
ForensicsSAM achieves superior resistance to various adversarial attack
methods, while also delivering state-of-the-art performance in image-level
forgery detection and pixel-level forgery localization. The resource is

Abstract: In this paper, we propose \textbf{CharacterShot}, a controllable and
consistent 4D character animation framework that enables any individual
designer to create dynamic 3D characters (i.e., 4D character animation) from a
single reference character image and a 2D pose sequence. We begin by
pretraining a powerful 2D character animation model based on a cutting-edge
DiT-based image-to-video model, which allows for any 2D pose sequnce as
controllable signal. We then lift the animation model from 2D to 3D through
introducing dual-attention module together with camera prior to generate
multi-view videos with spatial-temporal and spatial-view consistency. Finally,
we employ a novel neighbor-constrained 4D gaussian splatting optimization on
these multi-view videos, resulting in continuous and stable 4D character
representations. Moreover, to improve character-centric performance, we
construct a large-scale dataset Character4D, containing 13,115 unique
characters with diverse appearances and motions, rendered from multiple
viewpoints. Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark,
CharacterBench, demonstrate that our approach outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods. Code, models, and datasets will be publicly available

Conclusion: CLUE为伪造图像定位提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: The increasing accessibility of image editing tools and generative AI has led
to a proliferation of visually convincing forgeries, compromising the
authenticity of digital media. In this paper, in addition to leveraging
distortions from conventional forgeries, we repurpose the mechanism of a
state-of-the-art (SOTA) text-to-image synthesis model by exploiting its
internal generative process, turning it into a high-fidelity forgery
localization tool. To this end, we propose CLUE (Capture Latent Uncovered
Evidence), a framework that employs Low- Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to
parameter-efficiently reconfigure Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3) as a forensic
feature extractor. Our approach begins with the strategic use of SD3's
Rectified Flow (RF) mechanism to inject noise at varying intensities into the
latent representation, thereby steering the LoRAtuned denoising process to
amplify subtle statistical inconsistencies indicative of a forgery. To
complement the latent analysis with high-level semantic context and precise
spatial details, our method incorporates contextual features from the image
encoder of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), which is parameter-efficiently
adapted to better trace the boundaries of forged regions. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate CLUE's SOTA generalization performance, significantly outperforming
prior methods. Furthermore, CLUE shows superior robustness against common
post-processing attacks and Online Social Networks (OSNs). Code is publicly

Result: CDA减少性别差距6%，DAUDoS减少3%但仅用三分之一数据；两种方法均提升性别识别准确率3%。视觉编码器（CLIP）和文本编码器（PaliGemma2）的偏见来源不同。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了多模态系统中偏见的来源，为未来针对性去偏策略提供了依据。

Abstract: Vision Language Models achieve impressive multi-modal performance but often
inherit gender biases from their training data. This bias might be coming from
both the vision and text modalities. In this work, we dissect the contributions
of vision and text backbones to these biases by applying targeted debiasing
using Counterfactual Data Augmentation and Task Vector methods. Inspired by
data-efficient approaches in hate-speech classification, we introduce a novel
metric, Degree of Stereotypicality and a corresponding debiasing method, Data
Augmentation Using Degree of Stereotypicality - DAUDoS, to reduce bias with
minimal computational cost. We curate a gender annotated dataset and evaluate
all methods on VisoGender benchmark to quantify improvements and identify
dominant source of bias. Our results show that CDA reduces the gender gap by 6%
and DAUDoS by 3% but using only one-third of the data. Both methods also
improve the model's ability to correctly identify gender in images by 3%, with
DAUDoS achieving this improvement using only almost one-third of training data.
From our experiment's, we observed that CLIP's vision encoder is more biased
whereas PaliGemma2's text encoder is more biased. By identifying whether bias
stems more from vision or text encoders, our work enables more targeted and
effective bias mitigation strategies in future multi-modal systems.

Motivation: 传统方法假设训练数据无异常，但实际数据可能被污染，导致模型将异常误认为正常，影响检测性能。

Conclusion: 该框架具有模型无关性，适用于实际场景中不完美的训练数据，并通过消融研究验证了其对污染的鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of fully unsupervised image anomaly
detection (FUIAD), where training data may contain unlabeled anomalies.
Conventional methods assume anomaly-free training data, but real-world
contamination leads models to absorb anomalies as normal, degrading detection
performance. To mitigate this, we propose a two-stage framework that
systematically exploits inherent learning bias in models. The learning bias
stems from: (1) the statistical dominance of normal samples, driving models to
prioritize learning stable normal patterns over sparse anomalies, and (2)
feature-space divergence, where normal data exhibit high intra-class
consistency while anomalies display high diversity, leading to unstable model
responses. Leveraging the learning bias, stage 1 partitions the training set
into subsets, trains sub-models, and aggregates cross-model anomaly scores to
filter a purified dataset. Stage 2 trains the final detector on this dataset.
Experiments on the Real-IAD benchmark demonstrate superior anomaly detection
and localization performance under different noise conditions. Ablation studies
further validate the framework's contamination resilience, emphasizing the
critical role of learning bias exploitation. The model-agnostic design ensures
compatibility with diverse unsupervised backbones, offering a practical
solution for real-world scenarios with imperfect training data. Code is

Abstract: Field trials are vital in herbicide research and development to assess
effects on crops and weeds under varied conditions. Traditionally, evaluations
rely on manual visual assessments, which are time-consuming, labor-intensive,
and subjective. Automating species and damage identification is challenging due
to subtle visual differences, but it can greatly enhance efficiency and
consistency.
  We present an improved segmentation model combining a general-purpose
self-supervised visual model with hierarchical inference based on botanical
taxonomy. Trained on a multi-year dataset (2018-2020) from Germany and Spain
using digital and mobile cameras, the model was tested on digital camera data
(year 2023) and drone imagery from the United States, Germany, and Spain (year
2024) to evaluate robustness under domain shift. This cross-device evaluation
marks a key step in assessing generalization across platforms of the model.
  Our model significantly improved species identification (F1-score: 0.52 to
0.85, R-squared: 0.75 to 0.98) and damage classification (F1-score: 0.28 to
0.44, R-squared: 0.71 to 0.87) over prior methods. Under domain shift (drone
images), it maintained strong performance with moderate degradation (species:
F1-score 0.60, R-squared 0.80; damage: F1-score 0.41, R-squared 0.62), where
earlier models failed.
  These results confirm the model's robustness and real-world applicability. It
is now deployed in BASF's phenotyping pipeline, enabling large-scale, automated
crop and weed monitoring across diverse geographies.

on combined HCW data, and found that the YOLOv5-s achieved higher of 95.06%
accuracy but fell short few milliseconds in inference speed with YOLOv8-n
model. The EfficientNet-B0 showed promising results of 93.22% accuracy but took
the highest inference time. A repetitive ANOVA was performed to see statistical
significance and the best performing model (YOLOv5-s) was deployed to the web
with mapped bin color using Nepal's HCW management standards for public usage.
Further work on the data was suggested along with localized context.

*Siminfar Samakoush Galougah,Rishie Raj,Sanjoy Chowdhury,Sayan Nag,Ramani Duraiswami*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AURA是一个新的音频-视觉基准测试，旨在评估跨模态推理能力，避免单模态捷径，并引入AuraScore衡量推理的真实性和逻辑性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频-视觉基准测试仅关注最终答案准确性，忽略了推理过程，无法区分真实理解与错误推理或幻觉导致的正确答案。

Method: 提出AURA基准测试，涵盖六个认知领域的问题，要求模型基于音频和视频构建逻辑路径，并提出AuraScore评估推理的真实性和逻辑性。

Result: 评估显示，尽管模型在某些任务上准确率高达92%，但推理的真实性和逻辑性得分低于45%，表明模型常通过错误逻辑得出正确答案。

Conclusion: AURA揭示了现有模型的推理缺陷，为更稳健的多模态评估提供了方向。

Abstract: Current audio-visual (AV) benchmarks focus on final answer accuracy,
overlooking the underlying reasoning process. This makes it difficult to
distinguish genuine comprehension from correct answers derived through flawed
reasoning or hallucinations. To address this, we introduce AURA (Audio-visual
Understanding and Reasoning Assessment), a benchmark for evaluating the
cross-modal reasoning capabilities of Audio-Visual Large Language Models
(AV-LLMs) and Omni-modal Language Models (OLMs). AURA includes questions across
six challenging cognitive domains, such as causality, timbre and pitch, tempo
and AV synchronization, unanswerability, implicit distractions, and skill
profiling, explicitly designed to be unanswerable from a single modality. This
forces models to construct a valid logical path grounded in both audio and
video, setting AURA apart from AV datasets that allow uni-modal shortcuts. To
assess reasoning traces, we propose a novel metric, AuraScore, which addresses
the lack of robust tools for evaluating reasoning fidelity. It decomposes
reasoning into two aspects: (i) Factual Consistency - whether reasoning is
grounded in perceptual evidence, and (ii) Core Inference - the logical validity
of each reasoning step. Evaluations of SOTA models on AURA reveal a critical
reasoning gap: although models achieve high accuracy (up to 92% on some tasks),
their Factual Consistency and Core Inference scores fall below 45%. This
discrepancy highlights that models often arrive at correct answers through
flawed logic, underscoring the need for our benchmark and paving the way for
more robust multimodal evaluation.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了医学图像去标识化的重要性，总结了MIDI-B挑战赛的结果，并探讨了当前方法的局限性和未来改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像去标识化对于保护患者隐私至关重要，同时需确保数据在研究和诊疗中的可用性。

Method: 采用了像素掩码、日期偏移、哈希、文本识别、替换和移除等方法，严格遵守相关标准。

Result: 算法在MIDI-B挑战赛中正确执行了99.92%的操作，排名第二。

Conclusion: 当前方法仍有局限性，未来需进一步优化以提升去标识化效果。

Abstract: Image de-identification is essential for the public sharing of medical
images, particularly in the widely used Digital Imaging and Communications in
Medicine (DICOM) format as required by various regulations and standards,
including Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy
rules, the DICOM PS3.15 standard, and best practices recommended by the Cancer
Imaging Archive (TCIA). The Medical Image De-Identification Benchmark (MIDI-B)
Challenge at the 27th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and
Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI 2024) was organized to evaluate
rule-based DICOM image de-identification algorithms with a large dataset of
clinical DICOM images. In this report, we explore the critical challenges of
de-identifying DICOM images, emphasize the importance of removing personally
identifiable information (PII) to protect patient privacy while ensuring the
continued utility of medical data for research, diagnostics, and treatment, and
provide a comprehensive overview of the standards and regulations that govern
this process. Additionally, we detail the de-identification methods we applied
- such as pixel masking, date shifting, date hashing, text recognition, text
replacement, and text removal - to process datasets during the test phase in
strict compliance with these standards. According to the final leaderboard of
the MIDI-B challenge, the latest version of our solution algorithm correctly
executed 99.92% of the required actions and ranked 2nd out of 10 teams that
completed the challenge (from a total of 22 registered teams). Finally, we
conducted a thorough analysis of the resulting statistics and discussed the
limitations of current approaches and potential avenues for future improvement.

Motivation: 研究动机在于比较两种3D重建技术的性能，并探索高斯泼溅技术在生成新视图和提升摄影测量模型质量方面的潜力。

Method: 通过创建真实场景的图像数据集，使用摄影测量和高斯泼溅技术构建3D模型，并利用SSIM、PSNR、LPIPS和分辨率指标进行评估。改进高斯泼溅方法以支持Blender环境中的新视图渲染。

Result: 结果表明，高斯泼溅能生成高质量新视图，并可能提升摄影测量模型的3D重建效果。两种方法各有优劣。

Conclusion: 高斯泼溅技术在视图合成和3D重建中具有潜力，为扩展现实（XR）、摄影测量和自动驾驶模拟提供了有价值的信息。

Abstract: In this paper, I present a comprehensive study comparing Photogrammetry and
Gaussian Splatting techniques for 3D model reconstruction and view synthesis. I
created a dataset of images from a real-world scene and constructed 3D models
using both methods. To evaluate the performance, I compared the models using
structural similarity index (SSIM), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), learned
perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS), and lp/mm resolution based on the
USAF resolution chart. A significant contribution of this work is the
development of a modified Gaussian Splatting repository, which I forked and
enhanced to enable rendering images from novel camera poses generated in the
Blender environment. This innovation allows for the synthesis of high-quality
novel views, showcasing the flexibility and potential of Gaussian Splatting. My
investigation extends to an augmented dataset that includes both original
ground images and novel views synthesized via Gaussian Splatting. This
augmented dataset was employed to generate a new photogrammetry model, which
was then compared against the original photogrammetry model created using only
the original images. The results demonstrate the efficacy of using Gaussian
Splatting to generate novel high-quality views and its potential to improve
photogrammetry-based 3D reconstructions. The comparative analysis highlights
the strengths and limitations of both approaches, providing valuable
information for applications in extended reality (XR), photogrammetry, and
autonomous vehicle simulations. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要针对英文文档检索或单页图像的多语言问答，缺乏对长文档多模态检索的支持。

Method: 引入VisR-Bench，包含35K QA对和1.2K文档，支持细粒度评估，涵盖多种语言和问题类型。

Result: MLLMs表现优于文本和多模态编码器模型，但在结构化表格和低资源语言上仍有挑战。

Conclusion: VisR-Bench为多语言视觉检索提供了新基准，揭示了模型的局限性，尤其是对复杂内容和低资源语言的处理。

Abstract: Most organizational data in this world are stored as documents, and visual
retrieval plays a crucial role in unlocking the collective intelligence from
all these documents. However, existing benchmarks focus on English-only
document retrieval or only consider multilingual question-answering on a
single-page image. To bridge this gap, we introduce VisR-Bench, a multilingual
benchmark designed for question-driven multimodal retrieval in long documents.
Our benchmark comprises over 35K high-quality QA pairs across 1.2K documents,
enabling fine-grained evaluation of multimodal retrieval. VisR-Bench spans
sixteen languages with three question types (figures, text, and tables),
offering diverse linguistic and question coverage. Unlike prior datasets, we
include queries without explicit answers, preventing models from relying on
superficial keyword matching. We evaluate various retrieval models, including
text-based methods, multimodal encoders, and MLLMs, providing insights into
their strengths and limitations. Our results show that while MLLMs
significantly outperform text-based and multimodal encoder models, they still
struggle with structured tables and low-resource languages, highlighting key
challenges in multilingual visual retrieval.

Motivation: 对话视频在影视和广告中具有重要情感连接作用，但现有研究对其生成技术探索不足。

Method: 结合双镜头生成与循环视频技术，实现角色一致性和空间连续性。

Result: 在镜头切换布局、空间连续性和对话长度灵活性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ShoulderShot为实用对话视频生成提供了新可能性。

Abstract: Over-the-shoulder dialogue videos are essential in films, short dramas, and
advertisements, providing visual variety and enhancing viewers' emotional
connection. Despite their importance, such dialogue scenes remain largely
underexplored in video generation research. The main challenges include
maintaining character consistency across different shots, creating a sense of
spatial continuity, and generating long, multi-turn dialogues within limited
computational budgets. Here, we present ShoulderShot, a framework that combines
dual-shot generation with looping video, enabling extended dialogues while
preserving character consistency. Our results demonstrate capabilities that
surpass existing methods in terms of shot-reverse-shot layout, spatial
continuity, and flexibility in dialogue length, thereby opening up new
possibilities for practical dialogue video generation. Videos and comparisons

state-of-the-art VLMs on a dataset of 1,700 expert-annotated user-reference
video pairs spanning 22 strength and mobility exercises. To accelerate research
in AI-driven coaching, we release both the dataset and an automated,

models. Our benchmarks reveal substantial gaps compared to human-level
coaching, underscoring both the challenges and opportunities in integrating
nuanced, context-aware movement analysis into interactive AI systems. By
framing form correction as a collaborative and creative process between humans
and machines, FormCoach opens a new frontier in embodied AI.

TL;DR: SOFA是一个深度学习框架，通过模拟消融手术效果和优化参数，预测房颤复发风险并降低22.18%的复发率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 房颤消融手术效果差异大，现有方法难以评估和优化手术参数对复发的影响。

Method: 提出SOFA框架，结合患者术前LGE-MRI和手术参数，模拟消融后瘢痕形成并预测复发风险，进一步优化手术参数。

Result: SOFA能准确合成消融后图像，优化方案使模型预测的复发风险降低22.18%。

Conclusion: SOFA首次整合手术效果模拟、复发预测和参数优化，为个性化房颤消融提供新工具。

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a prevalent cardiac arrhythmia often treated with
catheter ablation procedures, but procedural outcomes are highly variable.
Evaluating and improving ablation efficacy is challenging due to the complex
interaction between patient-specific tissue and procedural factors. This paper
asks two questions: Can AF recurrence be predicted by simulating the effects of
procedural parameters? How should we ablate to reduce AF recurrence? We propose
SOFA (Simulating and Optimizing Atrial Fibrillation Ablation), a novel
deep-learning framework that addresses these questions. SOFA first simulates
the outcome of an ablation strategy by generating a post-ablation image
depicting scar formation, conditioned on a patient's pre-ablation LGE-MRI and
the specific procedural parameters used (e.g., ablation locations, duration,
temperature, power, and force). During this simulation, it predicts AF
recurrence risk. Critically, SOFA then introduces an optimization scheme that
refines these procedural parameters to minimize the predicted risk. Our method
leverages a multi-modal, multi-view generator that processes 2.5D
representations of the atrium. Quantitative evaluations show that SOFA
accurately synthesizes post-ablation images and that our optimization scheme
leads to a 22.18\% reduction in the model-predicted recurrence risk. To the
best of our knowledge, SOFA is the first framework to integrate the simulation
of procedural effects, recurrence prediction, and parameter optimization,
offering a novel tool for personalizing AF ablation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统U-Net架构已被基于Transformer的扩散模型取代，MM-DiT成为主流，但其双向注意力机制对现有编辑技术提出了挑战。

Method: 通过分解注意力矩阵为四个块，分析其特性，并提出一种适用于MM-DiT的提示编辑方法。

Result: 提出了一种支持全局到局部编辑的鲁棒方法，适用于多种MM-DiT变体。

Conclusion: 研究填补了U-Net方法与新兴架构之间的空白，提供了对MM-DiT行为模式的深入理解。

Abstract: Transformer-based diffusion models have recently superseded traditional U-Net
architectures, with multimodal diffusion transformers (MM-DiT) emerging as the
dominant approach in state-of-the-art models like Stable Diffusion 3 and
Flux.1. Previous approaches have relied on unidirectional cross-attention
mechanisms, with information flowing from text embeddings to image latents. In
contrast, MMDiT introduces a unified attention mechanism that concatenates
input projections from both modalities and performs a single full attention
operation, allowing bidirectional information flow between text and image
branches. This architectural shift presents significant challenges for existing
editing techniques. In this paper, we systematically analyze MM-DiT's attention
mechanism by decomposing attention matrices into four distinct blocks,
revealing their inherent characteristics. Through these analyses, we propose a
robust, prompt-based image editing method for MM-DiT that supports global to
local edits across various MM-DiT variants, including few-step models. We
believe our findings bridge the gap between existing U-Net-based methods and
emerging architectures, offering deeper insights into MMDiT's behavioral
patterns.

TL;DR: TAR-TVG框架通过引入时间戳锚点约束推理过程，提升视频时序定位的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法未能显式约束推理过程，影响最终时序预测质量。

Method: 提出TAR-TVG框架，利用时间戳锚点作为中间验证点，并通过自蒸馏训练策略优化模型。

Result: 模型在实验中达到最优性能，生成可验证且逐步优化的推理链。

Conclusion: TAR-TVG通过显式监督和渐进优化，显著提升了视频时序定位的效果。

Abstract: Temporal Video Grounding (TVG) aims to precisely localize video segments
corresponding to natural language queries, which is a critical capability for
long-form video understanding. Although existing reinforcement learning
approaches encourage models to generate reasoning chains before predictions,
they fail to explicitly constrain the reasoning process to ensure the quality
of the final temporal predictions. To address this limitation, we propose
Timestamp Anchor-constrained Reasoning for Temporal Video Grounding (TAR-TVG),
a novel framework that introduces timestamp anchors within the reasoning
process to enforce explicit supervision to the thought content. These anchors
serve as intermediate verification points. More importantly, we require each
reasoning step to produce increasingly accurate temporal estimations, thereby
ensuring that the reasoning process contributes meaningfully to the final
prediction. To address the challenge of low-probability anchor generation in
models (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-3B), we develop an efficient self-distillation
training strategy: (1) initial GRPO training to collect 30K high-quality
reasoning traces containing multiple timestamp anchors, (2) supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on distilled data, and (3) final GRPO optimization on the
SFT-enhanced model. This three-stage training strategy enables robust anchor
generation while maintaining reasoning quality. Experiments show that our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance while producing interpretable, verifiable
reasoning chains with progressively refined temporal estimations.

Result: 在医学数据集上的实验验证表明，该方法能有效检测和减少异常值，提高诊断的可靠性。

Conclusion: 结合拒绝模块的top-rank学习方法显著提升了医学图像诊断的准确性。

Abstract: In medical image processing, accurate diagnosis is of paramount importance.
Leveraging machine learning techniques, particularly top-rank learning, shows
significant promise by focusing on the most crucial instances. However,
challenges arise from noisy labels and class-ambiguous instances, which can
severely hinder the top-rank objective, as they may be erroneously placed among
the top-ranked instances. To address these, we propose a novel approach that
enhances toprank learning by integrating a rejection module. Cooptimized with
the top-rank loss, this module identifies and mitigates the impact of outliers
that hinder training effectiveness. The rejection module functions as an
additional branch, assessing instances based on a rejection function that
measures their deviation from the norm. Through experimental validation on a
medical dataset, our methodology demonstrates its efficacy in detecting and
mitigating outliers, improving the reliability and accuracy of medical image
diagnoses.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注英文文本，对复杂脚本（如中文）的研究较少，因此需要一种能够恢复中文字符精确笔画的超分辨率方法。

Method: 提出了一种结构先验，结合StyleGAN模型和基于码本的机制，生成高分辨率结构先验以指导字符恢复。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能够准确恢复低分辨率中文字符的清晰笔画，适用于不规则布局的真实场景。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结构先验和StyleGAN的协同作用，有效提升了中文文本图像的超分辨率质量。

Abstract: Faithful text image super-resolution (SR) is challenging because each
character has a unique structure and usually exhibits diverse font styles and
layouts. While existing methods primarily focus on English text, less attention
has been paid to more complex scripts like Chinese. In this paper, we introduce
a high-quality text image SR framework designed to restore the precise strokes
of low-resolution (LR) Chinese characters. Unlike methods that rely on
character recognition priors to regularize the SR task, we propose a novel
structure prior that offers structure-level guidance to enhance visual quality.
Our framework incorporates this structure prior within a StyleGAN model,
leveraging its generative capabilities for restoration. To maintain the
integrity of character structures while accommodating various font styles and
layouts, we implement a codebook-based mechanism that restricts the generative
space of StyleGAN. Each code in the codebook represents the structure of a
specific character, while the vector $w$ in StyleGAN controls the character's
style, including typeface, orientation, and location. Through the collaborative
interaction between the codebook and style, we generate a high-resolution
structure prior that aligns with LR characters both spatially and structurally.
Experiments demonstrate that this structure prior provides robust,
character-specific guidance, enabling the accurate restoration of clear strokes
in degraded characters, even for real-world LR Chinese text with irregular
layouts. Our code and pre-trained models will be available at

Abstract: Accurate detection and classification of diverse door types in floor plans
drawings is critical for multiple applications, such as building compliance
checking, and indoor scene understanding. Despite their importance, publicly
available datasets specifically designed for fine-grained multi-class door
detection remain scarce. In this work, we present a semi-automated pipeline
that leverages a state-of-the-art object detector and a large language model
(LLM) to construct a multi-class door detection dataset with minimal manual
effort. Doors are first detected as a unified category using a deep object
detection model. Next, an LLM classifies each detected instance based on its
visual and contextual features. Finally, a human-in-the-loop stage ensures
high-quality labels and bounding boxes. Our method significantly reduces
annotation cost while producing a dataset suitable for benchmarking neural
models in floor plan analysis. This work demonstrates the potential of
combining deep learning and multimodal reasoning for efficient dataset
construction in complex real-world domains.

Result: 使用该数据集训练的开源MLLM在SVG U&G任务上表现优异，超越GPT-4V等闭源模型。

Conclusion: UniSVG数据集为SVG U&G任务提供了统一解决方案，推动了多模态模型在该领域的发展。

Abstract: Unlike bitmap images, scalable vector graphics (SVG) maintain quality when
scaled, frequently employed in computer vision and artistic design in the
representation of SVG code. In this era of proliferating AI-powered systems,
enabling AI to understand and generate SVG has become increasingly urgent.
However, AI-driven SVG understanding and generation (U&G) remain significant
challenges. SVG code, equivalent to a set of curves and lines controlled by
floating-point parameters, demands high precision in SVG U&G. Besides, SVG
generation operates under diverse conditional constraints, including textual
prompts and visual references, which requires powerful multi-modal processing
for condition-to-SVG transformation. Recently, the rapid growth of Multi-modal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated capabilities to process
multi-modal inputs and generate complex vector controlling parameters,
suggesting the potential to address SVG U&G tasks within a unified model. To
unlock MLLM's capabilities in the SVG area, we propose an SVG-centric dataset
called UniSVG, comprising 525k data items, tailored for MLLM training and
evaluation. To our best knowledge, it is the first comprehensive dataset
designed for unified SVG generation (from textual prompts and images) and SVG
understanding (color, category, usage, etc.). As expected, learning on the
proposed dataset boosts open-source MLLMs' performance on various SVG U&G
tasks, surpassing SOTA close-source MLLMs like GPT-4V. We release dataset,

Motivation: 传统方法依赖多医院数据，但数据收集困难，因此关注医院内域偏移。

Method: 通过聚类非肿瘤区域的WSI级特征作为域，并采用两阶段对比学习（WSI级和patch级）减少特征差距。

Result: 有效减少了域偏移，提升了模型泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为病理图像域偏移问题提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we address domain shifts in pathological images by focusing on
shifts within whole slide images~(WSIs), such as patient characteristics and
tissue thickness, rather than shifts between hospitals. Traditional approaches
rely on multi-hospital data, but data collection challenges often make this
impractical. Therefore, the proposed domain generalization method captures and
leverages intra-hospital domain shifts by clustering WSI-level features from
non-tumor regions and treating these clusters as domains. To mitigate domain
shift, we apply contrastive learning to reduce feature gaps between WSI pairs
from different clusters. The proposed method introduces a two-stage contrastive
learning approach WSI-level and patch-level contrastive learning to minimize
these gaps effectively.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face a significant adaptation gap
when applied to Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD), stemming from their lack of
local inductive biases for dense prediction and their reliance on inflexible

*Junuk Cha,Jihyeon Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合链式思维（CoT）推理的3D人体姿态生成框架，解决了现有模型依赖低层次提示的问题，通过抽象提示生成语义对齐的3D姿态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到姿态生成模型依赖低层次提示，与人类使用抽象语言描述动作的习惯不匹配，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出CoT-Pose框架，将CoT推理引入姿态生成过程，并设计数据合成管道生成抽象提示、详细提示和对应3D姿态的三元组。

Result: 实验表明，CoT-Pose能从抽象文本输入生成语义对齐且合理的3D姿态。

Conclusion: 该工作强调了高层次理解在姿态生成中的重要性，为推理增强的姿态生成方法开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have led to significant progress in image and
text generation tasks. However, the field of 3D human pose generation still
faces critical limitations. Most existing text-to-pose models rely heavily on
detailed (low-level) prompts that explicitly describe joint configurations. In
contrast, humans tend to communicate actions and intentions using abstract
(high-level) language. This mismatch results in a practical challenge for
deploying pose generation systems in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap,
we introduce a novel framework that incorporates CoT reasoning into the pose
generation process, enabling the interpretation of abstract prompts into
accurate 3D human poses. We further propose a data synthesis pipeline that
automatically generates triplets of abstract prompts, detailed prompts, and
corresponding 3D poses for training process. Experimental results demonstrate
that our reasoning-enhanced model, CoT-Pose, can effectively generate plausible
and semantically aligned poses from abstract textual inputs. This work
highlights the importance of high-level understanding in pose generation and
opens new directions for reasoning-enhanced approach for human pose generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以从太阳图像中学习表示或建模长程时空依赖关系，亟需更可靠的预测方法以减少对基础设施的潜在影响。

Method: 采用多深度状态空间模型处理十通道太阳图像及长程时空依赖，结合两阶段掩码策略的稀疏自编码器进行预训练。

Result: 在FlareBench基准测试中，Deep SWM性能超越基线方法及人类专家，表现出更高的可靠性。

Conclusion: Deep SWM为太阳耀斑预测提供了高效解决方案，其公开基准FlareBench将推动领域研究。

Abstract: Accurate, reliable solar flare prediction is crucial for mitigating potential
disruptions to critical infrastructure, while predicting solar flares remains a
significant challenge. Existing methods based on heuristic physical features
often lack representation learning from solar images. On the other hand,
end-to-end learning approaches struggle to model long-range temporal
dependencies in solar images. In this study, we propose Deep Space Weather
Model (Deep SWM), which is based on multiple deep state space models for
handling both ten-channel solar images and long-range spatio-temporal
dependencies. Deep SWM also features a sparse masked autoencoder, a novel
pretraining strategy that employs a two-phase masking approach to preserve
crucial regions such as sunspots while compressing spatial information.
Furthermore, we built FlareBench, a new public benchmark for solar flare
prediction covering a full 11-year solar activity cycle, to validate our
method. Our method outperformed baseline methods and even human expert
performance on standard metrics in terms of performance and reliability. The

Method: 扩展MatchVoice模型，使用GOAL数据集进行实验，评估不同训练配置和硬件限制的影响，并探讨窗口大小对零样本性能的影响。

Result: MatchVoice展现了良好的泛化能力，但需要整合更广泛的视频-语言领域技术以进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 研究强调了进一步整合视频-语言领域技术的必要性，以优化足球集锦的实时解说生成。

Abstract: Automated soccer commentary generation has evolved from template-based
systems to advanced neural architectures, aiming to produce real-time
descriptions of sports events. While frameworks like SoccerNet-Caption laid
foundational work, their inability to achieve fine-grained alignment between
video content and commentary remains a significant challenge. Recent efforts
such as MatchTime, with its MatchVoice model, address this issue through coarse
and fine-grained alignment techniques, achieving improved temporal
synchronization. In this paper, we extend MatchVoice to commentary generation
for soccer highlights using the GOAL dataset, which emphasizes short clips over
entire games. We conduct extensive experiments to reproduce the original
MatchTime results and evaluate our setup, highlighting the impact of different
training configurations and hardware limitations. Furthermore, we explore the
effect of varying window sizes on zero-shot performance. While MatchVoice
exhibits promising generalization capabilities, our findings suggest the need
for integrating techniques from broader video-language domains to further
enhance performance. Our code is available at

makes us easy to select pseudo-labels for various background regions. The

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于特征图收敛分数（FMCS）的独立评估方法，用于评估自动驾驶感知和规划中端到端模型的中间功能模块特征图质量。通过双粒度动态加权评分系统（DG-DWSS）和CLIP-FMQE-Net网络，实现了实时质量分析，并在NuScenes数据集上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端模型在自动驾驶中缺乏对中间功能模块的显式监督信号，导致机制不透明且可解释性差，传统方法难以独立评估和训练这些模块。

Method: 提出FMCS评估框架，构建DG-DWSS评分系统，开发CLIP-FMQE-Net网络，结合特征-真值编码器和质量评分预测头，实现实时特征图质量分析。

Result: 在NuScenes数据集上，集成该评估模块后，3D目标检测性能提升3.89%（NDS指标）。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了特征表示质量和整体模型性能，验证了其在自动驾驶领域的实用性。

Abstract: End-to-end models are emerging as the mainstream in autonomous driving
perception and planning. However, the lack of explicit supervision signals for
intermediate functional modules leads to opaque operational mechanisms and
limited interpretability, making it challenging for traditional methods to
independently evaluate and train these modules. Pioneering in the issue, this
study builds upon the feature map-truth representation similarity-based
evaluation framework and proposes an independent evaluation method based on
Feature Map Convergence Score (FMCS). A Dual-Granularity Dynamic Weighted
Scoring System (DG-DWSS) is constructed, formulating a unified quantitative
metric - Feature Map Quality Score - to enable comprehensive evaluation of the
quality of feature maps generated by functional modules. A CLIP-based Feature
Map Quality Evaluation Network (CLIP-FMQE-Net) is further developed, combining
feature-truth encoders and quality score prediction heads to enable real-time
quality analysis of feature maps generated by functional modules. Experimental
results on the NuScenes dataset demonstrate that integrating our evaluation
module into the training improves 3D object detection performance, achieving a
3.89 percent gain in NDS. These results verify the effectiveness of our method
in enhancing feature representation quality and overall model performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有WSAG方法主要依赖分类器，容易关注与功能无关的常见模式，无法准确区分功能相关部分。

Method: 结合CLIP模型，通过交叉参考不同视角（第一人称和第三人称）的对象，挖掘功能线索，并使用选择性原型和像素对比目标学习。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效将激活从无关区域转移到功能相关线索上。

Conclusion: 该方法在弱监督功能接地任务中表现出色，代码已开源。

Abstract: Facilitating an entity's interaction with objects requires accurately
identifying parts that afford specific actions. Weakly supervised affordance
grounding (WSAG) seeks to imitate human learning from third-person
demonstrations, where humans intuitively grasp functional parts without needing
pixel-level annotations. To achieve this, grounding is typically learned using
a shared classifier across images from different perspectives, along with
distillation strategies incorporating part discovery process. However, since
affordance-relevant parts are not always easily distinguishable, models
primarily rely on classification, often focusing on common class-specific
patterns that are unrelated to affordance. To address this limitation, we move
beyond isolated part-level learning by introducing selective prototypical and
pixel contrastive objectives that adaptively learn affordance-relevant cues at
both the part and object levels, depending on the granularity of the available
information. Initially, we find the action-associated objects in both
egocentric (object-focused) and exocentric (third-person example) images by
leveraging CLIP. Then, by cross-referencing the discovered objects of
complementary views, we excavate the precise part-level affordance clues in
each perspective. By consistently learning to distinguish affordance-relevant
regions from affordance-irrelevant background context, our approach effectively
shifts activation from irrelevant areas toward meaningful affordance cues.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Codes are

Abstract: Computer vision-based technologies significantly enhance surgical automation
by advancing tool tracking, detection, and localization. However, Current
data-driven approaches are data-voracious, requiring large, high-quality
labeled image datasets, which limits their application in surgical data
science. Our Work introduces a novel dynamic Gaussian Splatting technique to
address the data scarcity in surgical image datasets. We propose a dynamic
Gaussian model to represent dynamic surgical scenes, enabling the rendering of
surgical instruments from unseen viewpoints and deformations with real tissue
backgrounds. We utilize a dynamic training adjustment strategy to address
challenges posed by poorly calibrated camera poses from real-world scenarios.
Additionally, we propose a method based on dynamic Gaussians for automatically
generating annotations for our synthetic data. For evaluation, we constructed a
new dataset featuring seven scenes with 14,000 frames of tool and camera motion
and tool jaw articulation, with a background of an ex-vivo porcine model. Using
this dataset, we synthetically replicate the scene deformation from the ground
truth data, allowing direct comparisons of synthetic image quality.
Experimental results illustrate that our method generates photo-realistic
labeled image datasets with the highest values in Peak-Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(29.87). We further evaluate the performance of medical-specific neural
networks trained on real and synthetic images using an unseen real-world image
dataset. Our results show that the performance of models trained on synthetic
images generated by the proposed method outperforms those trained with
state-of-the-art standard data augmentation by 10%, leading to an overall
improvement in model performances by nearly 15%.

TL;DR: 论文提出了Adaptive Cache Enhancement (ACE)框架，通过动态缓存高置信度或低熵图像嵌入，解决了现有测试时适应方法在分布偏移下的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在零样本泛化中表现优异，但在下游任务中面临分布偏移导致的性能下降问题，尤其是在缺乏标注数据时。

Method: ACE框架通过动态、类别特定的阈值选择性地存储高置信度或低熵图像嵌入，并使用指数移动平均和探索增强更新迭代优化决策边界。

Result: 在15个基准数据集上的实验表明，ACE在分布偏移场景下实现了最先进的性能，表现出更强的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: ACE通过自适应缓存和动态决策边界，显著提升了视觉语言模型在测试时适应中的性能，尤其在分布偏移情况下表现优异。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable zero-shot generalization but
suffer performance degradation under distribution shifts in downstream tasks,
particularly in the absence of labeled data. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA)
addresses this challenge by enabling online optimization of VLMs during
inference, eliminating the need for annotated data. Cache-based TTA methods
exploit historical knowledge by maintaining a dynamic memory cache of
low-entropy or high-confidence samples, promoting efficient adaptation to
out-of-distribution data. Nevertheless, these methods face two critical
challenges: (1) unreliable confidence metrics under significant distribution
shifts, resulting in error accumulation within the cache and degraded
adaptation performance; and (2) rigid decision boundaries that fail to
accommodate substantial distributional variations, leading to suboptimal
predictions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Adaptive Cache
Enhancement (ACE) framework, which constructs a robust cache by selectively
storing high-confidence or low-entropy image embeddings per class, guided by
dynamic, class-specific thresholds initialized from zero-shot statistics and
iteratively refined using an exponential moving average and
exploration-augmented updates. This approach enables adaptive, class-wise
decision boundaries, ensuring robust and accurate predictions across diverse
visual distributions. Extensive experiments on 15 diverse benchmark datasets
demonstrate that ACE achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior
robustness and generalization compared to existing TTA methods in challenging
out-of-distribution scenarios.

Method: 提出FSR量化目标域代表性，设计标量λ负相关于FSR，结合循环框架优化LayerNorm微调。

Result: 实验验证了框架的有效性，OOD任务下FSR较低且λ较高，病理数据表现类似ID。

Conclusion: 揭示了LayerNorm在迁移学习中的动态特性，提供了实用的微调策略。

Abstract: LayerNorm is pivotal in Vision Transformers (ViTs), yet its fine-tuning
dynamics under data scarcity and domain shifts remain underexplored. This paper
shows that shifts in LayerNorm parameters after fine-tuning (LayerNorm shifts)
are indicative of the transitions between source and target domains; its
efficacy is contingent upon the degree to which the target training samples
accurately represent the target domain, as quantified by our proposed
Fine-tuning Shift Ratio ($FSR$). Building on this, we propose a simple yet
effective rescaling mechanism using a scalar $\lambda$ that is negatively
correlated to $FSR$ to align learned LayerNorm shifts with those ideal shifts
achieved under fully representative data, combined with a cyclic framework that
further enhances the LayerNorm fine-tuning. Extensive experiments across
natural and pathological images, in both in-distribution (ID) and
out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, and various target training sample regimes
validate our framework. Notably, OOD tasks tend to yield lower $FSR$ and higher
$\lambda$ in comparison to ID cases, especially with scarce data, indicating
under-represented target training samples. Moreover, ViTFs fine-tuned on
pathological data behave more like ID settings, favoring conservative LayerNorm
updates. Our findings illuminate the underexplored dynamics of LayerNorm in
transfer learning and provide practical strategies for LayerNorm fine-tuning.

Conclusion: GAPNet通过高效的特征融合和监督策略，显著提升了轻量级SOD模型的性能。

Abstract: Recent salient object detection (SOD) models predominantly rely on
heavyweight backbones, incurring substantial computational cost and hindering
their practical application in various real-world settings, particularly on
edge devices. This paper presents GAPNet, a lightweight network built on the
granularity-aware paradigm for both image and video SOD. We assign saliency
maps of different granularities to supervise the multi-scale decoder
side-outputs: coarse object locations for high-level outputs and fine-grained
object boundaries for low-level outputs. Specifically, our decoder is built
with granularity-aware connections which fuse high-level features of low
granularity and low-level features of high granularity, respectively. To
support these connections, we design granular pyramid convolution (GPC) and
cross-scale attention (CSA) modules for efficient fusion of low-scale and
high-scale features, respectively. On top of the encoder, a self-attention
module is built to learn global information, enabling accurate object
localization with negligible computational cost. Unlike traditional U-Net-based
approaches, our proposed method optimizes feature utilization and semantic
interpretation while applying appropriate supervision at each processing stage.
Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves a new
state-of-the-art performance among lightweight image and video SOD models. Code

Motivation: 当前视频生成模型在视觉特效（VFX）生产中受限于单特效训练，无法实现多特效的空间可控复合生成。

Method: 提出了LoRA-MoE（基于LoRA的专家混合）和SAP（空间感知提示）两项关键技术，并结合独立信息流模块（IIF）防止信号混合。

Result: 实验表明，Omni-Effects能够实现精确的空间控制和多样化的特效生成。

Conclusion: Omni-Effects为多特效的空间可控生成提供了有效解决方案，推动了VFX生产的发展。

Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) are essential visual enhancements fundamental to modern
cinematic production. Although video generation models offer cost-efficient
solutions for VFX production, current methods are constrained by per-effect
LoRA training, which limits generation to single effects. This fundamental
limitation impedes applications that require spatially controllable composite
effects, i.e., the concurrent generation of multiple effects at designated
locations. However, integrating diverse effects into a unified framework faces
major challenges: interference from effect variations and spatial
uncontrollability during multi-VFX joint training. To tackle these challenges,
we propose Omni-Effects, a first unified framework capable of generating
prompt-guided effects and spatially controllable composite effects. The core of
our framework comprises two key innovations: (1) LoRA-based Mixture of Experts
(LoRA-MoE), which employs a group of expert LoRAs, integrating diverse effects
within a unified model while effectively mitigating cross-task interference.
(2) Spatial-Aware Prompt (SAP) incorporates spatial mask information into the
text token, enabling precise spatial control. Furthermore, we introduce an
Independent-Information Flow (IIF) module integrated within the SAP, isolating
the control signals corresponding to individual effects to prevent any unwanted
blending. To facilitate this research, we construct a comprehensive VFX dataset
Omni-VFX via a novel data collection pipeline combining image editing and
First-Last Frame-to-Video (FLF2V) synthesis, and introduce a dedicated VFX
evaluation framework for validating model performance. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Omni-Effects achieves precise spatial control and diverse
effect generation, enabling users to specify both the category and location of
desired effects.

Abstract: Voice disorders significantly affect communication and quality of life,
requiring an early and accurate diagnosis. Traditional methods like
laryngoscopy are invasive, subjective, and often inaccessible. This research
proposes a noninvasive, machine learning-based framework for detecting voice
pathologies using phonation data.
  Phonation data from the Saarbr\"ucken Voice Database are analyzed using
acoustic features such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), chroma
features, and Mel spectrograms. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), including
LSTM and attention mechanisms, classify samples into normal and pathological
categories. Data augmentation techniques, including pitch shifting and Gaussian
noise addition, enhance model generalizability, while preprocessing ensures
signal quality. Scale-based features, such as H\"older and Hurst exponents,
further capture signal irregularities and long-term dependencies.
  The proposed framework offers a noninvasive, automated diagnostic tool for
early detection of voice pathologies, supporting AI-driven healthcare, and
improving patient outcomes.

Abstract: The proliferation of deepfake technologies poses urgent challenges and
serious risks to digital integrity, particularly within critical sectors such
as forensics, journalism, and the legal system. While existing detection
systems have made significant progress in classification accuracy, they
typically function as black-box models, offering limited transparency and
minimal support for human reasoning. This lack of interpretability hinders
their usability in real-world decision-making contexts, especially for
non-expert users. In this paper, we present DF-P2E (Deepfake: Prediction to
Explanation), a novel multimodal framework that integrates visual, semantic,
and narrative layers of explanation to make deepfake detection interpretable
and accessible. The framework consists of three modular components: (1) a
deepfake classifier with Grad-CAM-based saliency visualisation, (2) a visual
captioning module that generates natural language summaries of manipulated
regions, and (3) a narrative refinement module that uses a fine-tuned Large
Language Model (LLM) to produce context-aware, user-sensitive explanations. We
instantiate and evaluate the framework on the DF40 benchmark, the most diverse
deepfake dataset to date. Experiments demonstrate that our system achieves
competitive detection performance while providing high-quality explanations
aligned with Grad-CAM activations. By unifying prediction and explanation in a
coherent, human-aligned pipeline, this work offers a scalable approach to
interpretable deepfake detection, advancing the broader vision of trustworthy
and transparent AI systems in adversarial media environments.

and highlight classical and modern analysis methods, including dimensionality
reduction, classification, spectral unmixing, and AI-driven techniques such as
deep learning. Representative applications across Earth observation, precision
agriculture, biomedicine, industrial inspection, cultural heritage, and
security are also discussed, emphasizing HSI's ability to uncover sub-visual
features for advanced monitoring, diagnostics, and decision-making. Persistent
challenges, such as hardware trade-offs, acquisition variability, and the
complexity of high-dimensional data, are examined alongside emerging solutions,
including computational imaging, physics-informed modeling, cross-modal fusion,
and self-supervised learning. Best practices for dataset sharing,
reproducibility, and metadata documentation are further highlighted to support
transparency and reuse. Looking ahead, we explore future directions toward
scalable, real-time, and embedded HSI systems, driven by sensor
miniaturization, self-supervised learning, and foundation models. As HSI
evolves into a general-purpose, cross-disciplinary platform, it holds promise
for transformative applications in science, technology, and society.

TL;DR: LaVieID是一种新颖的局部自回归视频扩散框架，旨在解决身份保持的文本到视频任务，通过空间和时间视角优化身份信息保留。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散变换器（DiTs）在全局生成过程中身份信息丢失的问题。

Method: 引入局部路由器明确表示潜在状态，并通过时间自回归模块增强帧间身份一致性。

Result: 生成高保真个性化视频，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: LaVieID通过局部和时序优化，显著提升了身份保持视频生成的效果。

Abstract: In this paper, we present LaVieID, a novel \underline{l}ocal
\underline{a}utoregressive \underline{vi}d\underline{e}o diffusion framework
designed to tackle the challenging \underline{id}entity-preserving
text-to-video task. The key idea of LaVieID is to mitigate the loss of identity
information inherent in the stochastic global generation process of diffusion
transformers (DiTs) from both spatial and temporal perspectives. Specifically,
unlike the global and unstructured modeling of facial latent states in existing
DiTs, LaVieID introduces a local router to explicitly represent latent states
by weighted combinations of fine-grained local facial structures. This
alleviates undesirable feature interference and encourages DiTs to capture
distinctive facial characteristics. Furthermore, a temporal autoregressive
module is integrated into LaVieID to refine denoised latent tokens before video
decoding. This module divides latent tokens temporally into chunks, exploiting
their long-range temporal dependencies to predict biases for rectifying tokens,
thereby significantly enhancing inter-frame identity consistency. Consequently,
LaVieID can generate high-fidelity personalized videos and achieve
state-of-the-art performance. Our code and models are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRASPTrack是一种新颖的深度感知多目标跟踪框架，通过结合单目深度估计和实例分割，解决了传统跟踪方法因缺乏几何感知而难以处理的遮挡和深度模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于检测的跟踪方法（TBD）因缺乏几何感知，难以解决遮挡和深度模糊问题，限制了多目标跟踪的性能。

Method: GRASPTrack将单目深度估计和实例分割整合到TBD流程中，生成高保真3D点云，并采用基于体素的3D IoU进行空间关联。此外，通过深度感知自适应噪声补偿和深度增强的观测中心动量，提升跟踪鲁棒性。

Result: 在MOT17、MOT20和DanceTrack基准测试中，GRASPTrack表现出色，显著提升了复杂场景下的跟踪鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GRASPTrack通过引入深度感知和3D几何推理，有效解决了遮挡和深度模糊问题，为多目标跟踪提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in monocular videos is fundamentally challenged
by occlusions and depth ambiguity, issues that conventional
tracking-by-detection (TBD) methods struggle to resolve owing to a lack of
geometric awareness. To address these limitations, we introduce GRASPTrack, a
novel depth-aware MOT framework that integrates monocular depth estimation and
instance segmentation into a standard TBD pipeline to generate high-fidelity 3D
point clouds from 2D detections, thereby enabling explicit 3D geometric
reasoning. These 3D point clouds are then voxelized to enable a precise and
robust Voxel-Based 3D Intersection-over-Union (IoU) for spatial association. To
further enhance tracking robustness, our approach incorporates Depth-aware
Adaptive Noise Compensation, which dynamically adjusts the Kalman filter
process noise based on occlusion severity for more reliable state estimation.
Additionally, we propose a Depth-enhanced Observation-Centric Momentum, which
extends the motion direction consistency from the image plane into 3D space to
improve motion-based association cues, particularly for objects with complex
trajectories. Extensive experiments on the MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance,
significantly improving tracking robustness in complex scenes with frequent
occlusions and intricate motion patterns.

Result: 模型性能优异，数据集优于现有开源数据。

Conclusion: X2Edit为图像编辑任务提供了高质量数据和高效方法。

Abstract: Existing open-source datasets for arbitrary-instruction image editing remain
suboptimal, while a plug-and-play editing module compatible with
community-prevalent generative models is notably absent. In this paper, we
first introduce the X2Edit Dataset, a comprehensive dataset covering 14 diverse
editing tasks, including subject-driven generation. We utilize the
industry-leading unified image generation models and expert models to construct
the data. Meanwhile, we design reasonable editing instructions with the VLM and
implement various scoring mechanisms to filter the data. As a result, we
construct 3.7 million high-quality data with balanced categories. Second, to
better integrate seamlessly with community image generation models, we design
task-aware MoE-LoRA training based on FLUX.1, with only 8\% of the parameters
of the full model. To further improve the final performance, we utilize the
internal representations of the diffusion model and define positive/negative
samples based on image editing types to introduce contrastive learning.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the model's editing performance is
competitive among many excellent models. Additionally, the constructed dataset
exhibits substantial advantages over existing open-source datasets. The
open-source code, checkpoints, and datasets for X2Edit can be found at the

*Hyoung Suk Park,Kiwan Jeon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种两阶段方法，通过隐式神经表示（INR）生成先验图像并校正投影数据，以减少牙科CBCT中的截断伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型探测器导致视野截断，传统迭代重建方法因截断误差累积而降低图像质量。

Method: 第一阶段用INR生成扩展区域的先验图像，第二阶段用校正后的投影数据进行迭代重建。

Result: 数值结果表明该方法有效抑制截断伪影，提升CBCT图像质量。

Conclusion: 两阶段方法显著改善牙科CBCT的截断问题。

Abstract: In dental cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), compact and cost-effective
system designs often use small detectors, resulting in a truncated field of
view (FOV) that does not fully encompass the patient's head. In iterative
reconstruction approaches, the discrepancy between the actual projection and
the forward projection within the truncated FOV accumulates over iterations,
leading to significant degradation in the reconstructed image quality. In this
study, we propose a two-stage approach to mitigate truncation artifacts in
dental CBCT. In the first stage, we employ Implicit Neural Representation
(INR), leveraging its superior representation power, to generate a prior image
over an extended region so that its forward projection fully covers the
patient's head. To reduce computational and memory burdens, INR reconstruction
is performed with a coarse voxel size. The forward projection of this prior
image is then used to estimate the discrepancy due to truncated FOV in the
measured projection data. In the second stage, the discrepancy-corrected
projection data is utilized in a conventional iterative reconstruction process
within the truncated region. Our numerical results demonstrate that the
proposed two-grid approach effectively suppresses truncation artifacts, leading
to improved CBCT image quality.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图神经网络的后期处理流程，通过建模物体间的空间关系来纠正检测异常，显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有物体检测模型未能充分利用静态环境中的空间先验，导致预测不一致或错误。

Method: 使用图神经网络（GNN）建模物体间的空间关系，纠正异常检测结果。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了检测性能，mAP@50最高提升4%。

Conclusion: 利用环境空间结构可以显著提高物体检测系统的可靠性。

Abstract: In many real-world applications involving static environments, the spatial
layout of objects remains consistent across instances. However,
state-of-the-art object detection models often fail to leverage this spatial
prior, resulting in inconsistent predictions, missed detections, or
misclassifications, particularly in cluttered or occluded scenes. In this work,
we propose a graph-based post-processing pipeline that explicitly models the
spatial relationships between objects to correct detection anomalies in
egocentric frames. Using a graph neural network (GNN) trained on manually
annotated data, our model identifies invalid object class labels and predicts
corrected class labels based on their neighbourhood context. We evaluate our
approach both as a standalone anomaly detection and correction framework and as
a post-processing module for standard object detectors such as YOLOv7 and
RT-DETR. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating this spatial reasoning
significantly improves detection performance, with mAP@50 gains of up to 4%.
This method highlights the potential of leveraging the environment's spatial
structure to improve reliability in object detection systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学图像定位方法依赖显式空间提示，无法处理临床实践中的隐含查询，亟需一种结合临床推理和像素级定位的新方法。

Method: 提出UMRG任务和U-MRG-14K数据集；设计MedReasoner框架，分离推理与分割，通过强化学习优化MLLM推理器，利用冻结分割专家生成掩码。

Result: MedReasoner在U-MRG-14K上达到SOTA性能，并对未见临床查询表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 强化学习在可解释医学定位中具有显著潜力，MedReasoner为临床实践提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Accurately grounding regions of interest (ROIs) is critical for diagnosis and
treatment planning in medical imaging. While multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) combine visual perception with natural language, current
medical-grounding pipelines still rely on supervised fine-tuning with explicit
spatial hints, making them ill-equipped to handle the implicit queries common
in clinical practice. This work makes three core contributions. We first define
Unified Medical Reasoning Grounding (UMRG), a novel vision-language task that
demands clinical reasoning and pixel-level grounding. Second, we release
U-MRG-14K, a dataset of 14K samples featuring pixel-level masks alongside
implicit clinical queries and reasoning traces, spanning 10 modalities, 15
super-categories, and 108 specific categories. Finally, we introduce
MedReasoner, a modular framework that distinctly separates reasoning from
segmentation: an MLLM reasoner is optimized with reinforcement learning, while
a frozen segmentation expert converts spatial prompts into masks, with
alignment achieved through format and accuracy rewards. MedReasoner achieves
state-of-the-art performance on U-MRG-14K and demonstrates strong
generalization to unseen clinical queries, underscoring the significant promise
of reinforcement learning for interpretable medical grounding.

Method: TER利用不确定性估计计算预测置信度，结合多模态结果输出可信预测，并引入信任精度和信任召回等新评估指标。

Result: TER在Music-video数据集上达到82.40%准确率，在IEMOCAP和Music-video上的信任F1分数分别为0.7511和0.9035。

Conclusion: TER通过置信度模块增强了模型的可靠性和鲁棒性，实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Existing emotion recognition methods mainly focus on enhancing performance by
employing complex deep models, typically resulting in significantly higher
model complexity. Although effective, it is also crucial to ensure the
reliability of the final decision, especially for noisy, corrupted and
out-of-distribution data. To this end, we propose a novel emotion recognition
method called trusted emotion recognition (TER), which utilizes uncertainty
estimation to calculate the confidence value of predictions. TER combines the
results from multiple modalities based on their confidence values to output the
trusted predictions. We also provide a new evaluation criterion to assess the
reliability of predictions. Specifically, we incorporate trusted precision and
trusted recall to determine the trusted threshold and formulate the trusted
Acc. and trusted F1 score to evaluate the model's trusted performance. The
proposed framework combines the confidence module that accordingly endows the
model with reliability and robustness against possible noise or corruption. The
extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed
model. The TER achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Music-video,
achieving 82.40% Acc. In terms of trusted performance, TER outperforms other
methods on the IEMOCAP and Music-video, achieving trusted F1 scores of 0.7511
and 0.9035, respectively.

Result: 在CALVIN基准测试和真实实验中表现领先，少样本场景下显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 显式模仿人类动作在数据稀缺时更有效，为视觉机器人操作提供了新思路。

Abstract: Visual Robot Manipulation (VRM) aims to enable a robot to follow natural
language instructions based on robot states and visual observations, and
therefore requires costly multi-modal data. To compensate for the deficiency of
robot data, existing approaches have employed vision-language pretraining with
large-scale data. However, they either utilize web data that differs from
robotic tasks, or train the model in an implicit way (e.g., predicting future
frames at the pixel level), thus showing limited generalization ability under
insufficient robot data. In this paper, we propose to learn from large-scale
human action video datasets in an explicit way (i.e., imitating human actions
from hand keypoints), introducing Visual Robot Manipulation with Analogical
Reasoning (AR-VRM). To acquire action knowledge explicitly from human action
videos, we propose a keypoint Vision-Language Model (VLM) pretraining scheme,
enabling the VLM to learn human action knowledge and directly predict human
hand keypoints. During fine-tuning on robot data, to facilitate the robotic arm
in imitating the action patterns of human motions, we first retrieve human
action videos that perform similar manipulation tasks and have similar
historical observations , and then learn the Analogical Reasoning (AR) map
between human hand keypoints and robot components. Taking advantage of focusing
on action keypoints instead of irrelevant visual cues, our method achieves
leading performance on the CALVIN benchmark {and real-world experiments}. In
few-shot scenarios, our AR-VRM outperforms previous methods by large margins ,
underscoring the effectiveness of explicitly imitating human actions under data
scarcity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖提示或布局控制遮挡，但缺乏精确性。

Method: 利用预训练扩散模型和体积渲染原理，在潜在空间中根据遮挡关系和透射率渲染场景。

Result: 在遮挡准确性上显著优于现有方法，并能调整物体透明度、密度等效果。

Conclusion: 该方法无需重新训练模型，实现了物理基础的精确遮挡控制。

Abstract: We propose a novel training-free image generation algorithm that precisely
controls the occlusion relationships between objects in an image. Existing
image generation methods typically rely on prompts to influence occlusion,
which often lack precision. While layout-to-image methods provide control over
object locations, they fail to address occlusion relationships explicitly.
Given a pre-trained image diffusion model, our method leverages volume
rendering principles to "render" the scene in latent space, guided by occlusion
relationships and the estimated transmittance of objects. This approach does
not require retraining or fine-tuning the image diffusion model, yet it enables
accurate occlusion control due to its physics-grounded foundation. In extensive
experiments, our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms
of occlusion accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by adjusting the
opacities of objects or concepts during rendering, our method can achieve a
variety of effects, such as altering the transparency of objects, the density
of mass (e.g., forests), the concentration of particles (e.g., rain, fog), the
intensity of light, and the strength of lens effects, etc.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR数据的高质量标注困难且噪声标签不可避免，现有方法主要针对图像数据，对SAR数据的非直观视觉特性效果不佳。

Method: 设计多模型特征融合框架，将散射特征与深度特征结合；通过GMM建模损失分布区分干净与噪声标签样本；采用半监督学习和联合分布对齐策略。

Result: 在MSTAR数据集上的实验表明，该方法在不同噪声条件下均能达到最优性能。

Conclusion: CLSDF方法有效解决了SAR ATR中的噪声标签问题，显著提升了识别性能。

Abstract: The acquisition of high-quality labeled synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data
is challenging due to the demanding requirement for expert knowledge.
Consequently, the presence of unreliable noisy labels is unavoidable, which
results in performance degradation of SAR automatic target recognition (ATR).
Existing research on learning with noisy labels mainly focuses on image data.
However, the non-intuitive visual characteristics of SAR data are insufficient
to achieve noise-robust learning. To address this problem, we propose
collaborative learning of scattering and deep features (CLSDF) for SAR ATR with
noisy labels. Specifically, a multi-model feature fusion framework is designed
to integrate scattering and deep features. The attributed scattering centers
(ASCs) are treated as dynamic graph structure data, and the extracted physical
characteristics effectively enrich the representation of deep image features.
Then, the samples with clean and noisy labels are divided by modeling the loss
distribution with multiple class-wise Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs).
Afterward, the semi-supervised learning of two divergent branches is conducted
based on the data divided by each other. Moreover, a joint distribution
alignment strategy is introduced to enhance the reliability of co-guessed
labels. Extensive experiments have been done on the Moving and Stationary
Target Acquisition and Recognition (MSTAR) dataset, and the results show that
the proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art performance under different
operating conditions with various label noises.

Result: 实验表明UR-VTON在细节保留和图像质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UR-VTON为虚拟试衣提供了一种高效且无需训练的解决方案，显著提升长袖转短袖场景的效果。

Abstract: Virtual try-on (VTON) is a crucial task for enhancing user experience in
online shopping by generating realistic garment previews on personal photos.
Although existing methods have achieved impressive results, they struggle with
long-sleeve-to-short-sleeve conversions-a common and practical scenario-often
producing unrealistic outputs when exposed skin is underrepresented in the
original image. We argue that this challenge arises from the ''majority''
completion rule in current VTON models, which leads to inaccurate skin
restoration in such cases. To address this, we propose UR-VTON (Undress-Redress
Virtual Try-ON), a novel, training-free framework that can be seamlessly
integrated with any existing VTON method. UR-VTON introduces an
''undress-to-redress'' mechanism: it first reveals the user's torso by
virtually ''undressing,'' then applies the target short-sleeve garment,
effectively decomposing the conversion into two more manageable steps.
Additionally, we incorporate Dynamic Classifier-Free Guidance scheduling to
balance diversity and image quality during DDPM sampling, and employ Structural
Refiner to enhance detail fidelity using high-frequency cues. Finally, we
present LS-TON, a new benchmark for long-sleeve-to-short-sleeve try-on.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that UR-VTON outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in both detail preservation and image quality. Code will be released
upon acceptance.

Conclusion: OMGSR框架有效提升了一步式真实图像超分辨率的性能，尤其在细节生成方面表现突出。

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and Flow Matching (FM)
generative models show promising potential for one-step Real-World Image
Super-Resolution (Real-ISR). Recent one-step Real-ISR models typically inject a
Low-Quality (LQ) image latent distribution at the initial timestep. However, a
fundamental gap exists between the LQ image latent distribution and the
Gaussian noisy latent distribution, limiting the effective utilization of
generative priors. We observe that the noisy latent distribution at DDPM/FM
mid-timesteps aligns more closely with the LQ image latent distribution. Based
on this insight, we present One Mid-timestep Guidance Real-ISR (OMGSR), a
universal framework applicable to DDPM/FM-based generative models. OMGSR
injects the LQ image latent distribution at a pre-computed mid-timestep,
incorporating the proposed Latent Distribution Refinement loss to alleviate the
latent distribution gap. We also design the Overlap-Chunked LPIPS/GAN loss to
eliminate checkerboard artifacts in image generation. Within this framework, we
instantiate OMGSR for DDPM/FM-based generative models with two variants:
OMGSR-S (SD-Turbo) and OMGSR-F (FLUX.1-dev). Experimental results demonstrate
that OMGSR-S/F achieves balanced/excellent performance across quantitative and
qualitative metrics at 512-resolution. Notably, OMGSR-F establishes
overwhelming dominance in all reference metrics. We further train a
1k-resolution OMGSR-F to match the default resolution of FLUX.1-dev, which
yields excellent results, especially in the details of the image generation. We
also generate 2k-resolution images by the 1k-resolution OMGSR-F using our
two-stage Tiled VAE & Diffusion.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Next Shot Generation (NSG)的方法，通过Cut2Next框架生成符合专业编辑模式和电影连续性的高质量镜头。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅注重视觉一致性，忽略了推动叙事的编辑模式（如正反打镜头、插入镜头），导致输出缺乏叙事复杂性和电影完整性。

Method: Cut2Next框架基于Diffusion Transformer (DiT)，采用Hierarchical Multi-Prompting策略，结合Relational Prompts和Individual Prompts，并通过Context-Aware Condition Injection (CACI)和Hierarchical Attention Mask (HAM)整合信号。

Result: 实验表明Cut2Next在视觉一致性和文本保真度上表现优异，用户研究显示其更符合编辑模式和电影连续性。

Conclusion: Cut2Next能够生成高质量、叙事表达丰富且电影连贯的后续镜头。

Abstract: Effective multi-shot generation demands purposeful, film-like transitions and
strict cinematic continuity. Current methods, however, often prioritize basic
visual consistency, neglecting crucial editing patterns (e.g., shot/reverse
shot, cutaways) that drive narrative flow for compelling storytelling. This
yields outputs that may be visually coherent but lack narrative sophistication
and true cinematic integrity. To bridge this, we introduce Next Shot Generation
(NSG): synthesizing a subsequent, high-quality shot that critically conforms to
professional editing patterns while upholding rigorous cinematic continuity.
Our framework, Cut2Next, leverages a Diffusion Transformer (DiT). It employs
in-context tuning guided by a novel Hierarchical Multi-Prompting strategy. This
strategy uses Relational Prompts to define overall context and inter-shot
editing styles. Individual Prompts then specify per-shot content and
cinematographic attributes. Together, these guide Cut2Next to generate
cinematically appropriate next shots. Architectural innovations, Context-Aware
Condition Injection (CACI) and Hierarchical Attention Mask (HAM), further
integrate these diverse signals without introducing new parameters. We
construct RawCuts (large-scale) and CuratedCuts (refined) datasets, both with
hierarchical prompts, and introduce CutBench for evaluation. Experiments show
Cut2Next excels in visual consistency and text fidelity. Crucially, user
studies reveal a strong preference for Cut2Next, particularly for its adherence
to intended editing patterns and overall cinematic continuity, validating its
ability to generate high-quality, narratively expressive, and cinematically
coherent subsequent shots.

Abstract: As 3D generation techniques continue to flourish, the demand for generating
personalized content is rapidly rising. Users increasingly seek to apply
various editing methods to polish generated 3D content, aiming to enhance its
color, style, and lighting without compromising the underlying geometry.
However, most existing editing tools focus on the 2D domain, and directly
feeding their results into 3D generation methods (like multi-view diffusion
models) will introduce information loss, degrading the quality of the final 3D
assets. In this paper, we propose a tuning-free, plug-and-play scheme that
aligns edited assets with their original geometry in a single inference run.
Central to our approach is a geometry preservation module that guides the
edited multi-view generation with original input normal latents. Besides, an
injection switcher is proposed to deliberately control the supervision extent
of the original normals, ensuring the alignment between the edited color and
normal views. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently improves
both the multi-view consistency and mesh quality of edited 3D assets, across
multiple combinations of multi-view diffusion models and editing methods.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves remarkable results in the field of
surface reconstruction. However, when Gaussian normal vectors are aligned
within the single-view projection plane, while the geometry appears reasonable
in the current view, biases may emerge upon switching to nearby views. To
address the distance and global matching challenges in multi-view scenes, we
design multi-view normal and distance-guided Gaussian splatting. This method
achieves geometric depth unification and high-accuracy reconstruction by
constraining nearby depth maps and aligning 3D normals. Specifically, for the
reconstruction of small indoor and outdoor scenes, we propose a multi-view
distance reprojection regularization module that achieves multi-view Gaussian
alignment by computing the distance loss between two nearby views and the same
Gaussian surface. Additionally, we develop a multi-view normal enhancement
module, which ensures consistency across views by matching the normals of pixel
points in nearby views and calculating the loss. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline in both quantitative and
qualitative evaluations, significantly enhancing the surface reconstruction
capability of 3DGS.

Conclusion: 所提出的模型能够灵活处理星形分割问题，并在实验中表现出良好的性能。

Abstract: Image segmentation plays a crucial role in extracting objects of interest and
identifying their boundaries within an image. However, accurate segmentation
becomes challenging when dealing with occlusions, obscurities, or noise in
corrupted images. To tackle this challenge, prior information is often
utilized, with recent attention on star-shape priors. In this paper, we propose
a star-shape segmentation model based on the registration framework. By
combining the level set representation with the registration framework and
imposing constraints on the deformed level set function, our model enables both
full and partial star-shape segmentation, accommodating single or multiple
centers. Additionally, our approach allows for the enforcement of identified
boundaries to pass through specified landmark locations. We tackle the proposed
models using the alternating direction method of multipliers. Through numerical
experiments conducted on synthetic and real images, we demonstrate the efficacy
of our approach in achieving accurate star-shape segmentation.

Method: 提出TriReWeight，基于三重连接的样本重加权方法，理论分析三种生成图像监督方式。

Result: 在六种自然图像数据集上平均提升7.9%，三种医学数据集上平均提升3.4%。

Conclusion: TriReWeight可有效提升生成数据增强性能，且兼容多种生成方法。

Abstract: The performance of computer vision models in certain real-world applications,
such as medical diagnosis, is often limited by the scarcity of available
images. Expanding datasets using pre-trained generative models is an effective
solution. However, due to the uncontrollable generation process and the
ambiguity of natural language, noisy images may be generated. Re-weighting is
an effective way to address this issue by assigning low weights to such noisy
images. We first theoretically analyze three types of supervision for the
generated images. Based on the theoretical analysis, we develop TriReWeight, a
triplet-connection-based sample re-weighting method to enhance generative data
augmentation. Theoretically, TriReWeight can be integrated with any generative
data augmentation methods and never downgrade their performance. Moreover, its
generalization approaches the optimal in the order $O(\sqrt{d\ln (n)/n})$. Our
experiments validate the correctness of the theoretical analysis and
demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing SOTA methods by $7.9\%$ on
average over six natural image datasets and by $3.4\%$ on average over three
medical datasets. We also experimentally validate that our method can enhance
the performance of different generative data augmentation methods.

Motivation: 自回归图像模型生成能力出色，但顺序性导致推理时间长，限制了实际应用。

Result: GSD平均加速3.7倍，且无需额外训练。

Conclusion: GSD是一种高效且无需训练的加速方法，适用于自回归图像模型。

Abstract: Recently, autoregressive (AR) image models have demonstrated remarkable
generative capabilities, positioning themselves as a compelling alternative to
diffusion models. However, their sequential nature leads to long inference
times, limiting their practical scalability. In this work, we introduce Grouped
Speculative Decoding (GSD), a novel, training-free acceleration method for AR
image models. While recent studies have explored Speculative Decoding (SD) as a
means to speed up AR image generation, existing approaches either provide only
modest acceleration or require additional training. Our in-depth analysis
reveals a fundamental difference between language and image tokens: image
tokens exhibit inherent redundancy and diversity, meaning multiple tokens can
convey valid semantics. However, traditional SD methods are designed to accept
only a single most-likely token, which fails to leverage this difference,
leading to excessive false-negative rejections. To address this, we propose a
new SD strategy that evaluates clusters of visually valid tokens rather than
relying on a single target token. Additionally, we observe that static
clustering based on embedding distance is ineffective, which motivates our
dynamic GSD approach. Extensive experiments show that GSD accelerates AR image
models by an average of 3.7x while preserving image quality-all without
requiring any additional training. The source code is available at

Result: 实验表明，该方法在概念表示和编辑方面均表现优异。

Conclusion: 对比反转方法在无需额外信息的情况下，实现了高质量的共同概念提取和编辑。

Abstract: The recent demand for customized image generation raises a need for
techniques that effectively extract the common concept from small sets of
images. Existing methods typically rely on additional guidance, such as text
prompts or spatial masks, to capture the common target concept. Unfortunately,
relying on manually provided guidance can lead to incomplete separation of
auxiliary features, which degrades generation quality.In this paper, we propose
Contrastive Inversion, a novel approach that identifies the common concept by
comparing the input images without relying on additional information. We train
the target token along with the image-wise auxiliary text tokens via
contrastive learning, which extracts the well-disentangled true semantics of
the target. Then we apply disentangled cross-attention fine-tuning to improve
concept fidelity without overfitting. Experimental results and analysis
demonstrate that our method achieves a balanced, high-level performance in both
concept representation and editing, outperforming existing techniques.

Result: 在多个数据集上，CAV-SAM的分割性能比现有最优方法提升了5%以上。

Conclusion: CAV-SAM通过轻量级方法显著提升了分割性能，为视觉模型适应下游任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large vision models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibit significant
limitations when applied to downstream tasks in the wild. Consequently,
reference segmentation, which leverages reference images and their
corresponding masks to impart novel knowledge to the model, emerges as a
promising new direction for adapting vision models. However, existing reference
segmentation approaches predominantly rely on meta-learning, which still
necessitates an extensive meta-training process and brings massive data and
computational cost. In this study, we propose a novel approach by representing
the inherent correspondence between reference-target image pairs as a pseudo
video. This perspective allows the latest version of SAM, known as SAM2, which
is equipped with interactive video object segmentation (iVOS) capabilities, to
be adapted to downstream tasks in a lightweight manner. We term this approach
Correspondence As Video for SAM (CAV-SAM). CAV-SAM comprises two key modules:
the Diffusion-Based Semantic Transition (DBST) module employs a diffusion model
to construct a semantic transformation sequence, while the Test-Time Geometric
Alignment (TTGA) module aligns the geometric changes within this sequence
through test-time fine-tuning. We evaluated CAVSAM on widely-used datasets,
achieving segmentation performance improvements exceeding 5% over SOTA methods.
Implementation is provided in the supplementary materials.

Motivation: 当前方法在保持视角一致性和处理复杂场景动态方面存在困难，特别是在大规模多元素交互环境中。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：先通过少样本学习从单图像预测最佳相机轨迹，再通过姿态条件扩散过程生成几何一致的多视角序列，最终转换为持久4D表示。

Result: 首次结合视频扩散模型的时间先验和重建模型的几何感知，显著提升4D生成质量（如mPSNR、mSSIM）。

Conclusion: Dream4D框架在4D内容合成中表现出色，为复杂动态场景的建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: The synthesis of spatiotemporally coherent 4D content presents fundamental
challenges in computer vision, requiring simultaneous modeling of high-fidelity
spatial representations and physically plausible temporal dynamics. Current
approaches often struggle to maintain view consistency while handling complex
scene dynamics, particularly in large-scale environments with multiple
interacting elements. This work introduces Dream4D, a novel framework that
bridges this gap through a synergy of controllable video generation and neural
4D reconstruction. Our approach seamlessly combines a two-stage architecture:
it first predicts optimal camera trajectories from a single image using
few-shot learning, then generates geometrically consistent multi-view sequences
via a specialized pose-conditioned diffusion process, which are finally
converted into a persistent 4D representation. This framework is the first to
leverage both rich temporal priors from video diffusion models and geometric
awareness of the reconstruction models, which significantly facilitates 4D
generation and shows higher quality (e.g., mPSNR, mSSIM) over existing methods.

Method: 提出CLZSL框架，包含PCL模块（基于余弦相似度逐步学习样本）和PUP模块（动态更新语义原型）。

Result: 在AWA2、SUN和CUB数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: CLZSL通过减少噪声监督，显著提升了零样本学习的性能。

Abstract: In Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL), embedding-based methods enable knowledge
transfer from seen to unseen classes by learning a visual-semantic mapping from
seen-class images to class-level semantic prototypes (e.g., attributes).
However, these semantic prototypes are manually defined and may introduce noisy
supervision for two main reasons: (i) instance-level mismatch: variations in
perspective, occlusion, and annotation bias will cause discrepancies between
individual sample and the class-level semantic prototypes; and (ii) class-level
imprecision: the manually defined semantic prototypes may not accurately
reflect the true semantics of the class. Consequently, the visual-semantic
mapping will be misled, reducing the effectiveness of knowledge transfer to
unseen classes. In this work, we propose a prototype-guided curriculum learning
framework (dubbed as CLZSL), which mitigates instance-level mismatches through
a Prototype-Guided Curriculum Learning (PCL) module and addresses class-level
imprecision via a Prototype Update (PUP) module. Specifically, the PCL module
prioritizes samples with high cosine similarity between their visual mappings
and the class-level semantic prototypes, and progressively advances to
less-aligned samples, thereby reducing the interference of instance-level
mismatches to achieve accurate visual-semantic mapping. Besides, the PUP module
dynamically updates the class-level semantic prototypes by leveraging the
visual mappings learned from instances, thereby reducing class-level
imprecision and further improving the visual-semantic mapping. Experiments were
conducted on standard benchmark datasets-AWA2, SUN, and CUB-to verify the
effectiveness of our method.

Result: 模型在仿真和实际场景中表现出鲁棒的外推能力，适用于复杂非惯性系统。

Conclusion: 该方法为SO(3)外推提供了一种物理和几何意义明确且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling the rotation of moving objects is a fundamental task in computer
vision, yet $SO(3)$ extrapolation still presents numerous challenges: (1)
unknown quantities such as the moment of inertia complicate dynamics, (2) the
presence of external forces and torques can lead to non-conservative
kinematics, and (3) estimating evolving state trajectories under sparse, noisy
observations requires robustness. We propose modeling trajectories of noisy
pose estimates on the manifold of 3D rotations in a physically and
geometrically meaningful way by leveraging Neural Controlled Differential
Equations guided with $SO(3)$ Savitzky-Golay paths. Existing extrapolation
methods often rely on energy conservation or constant velocity assumptions,
limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios involving non-conservative
forces. In contrast, our approach is agnostic to energy and momentum
conservation while being robust to input noise, making it applicable to
complex, non-inertial systems. Our approach is easily integrated as a module in
existing pipelines and generalizes well to trajectories with unknown physical
parameters. By learning to approximate object dynamics from noisy states during
training, our model attains robust extrapolation capabilities in simulation and
various real-world settings. Code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法通过snippet捕捉多尺度时间上下文，显著提升了步态识别性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in gait recognition have significantly enhanced
performance by treating silhouettes as either an unordered set or an ordered
sequence. However, both set-based and sequence-based approaches exhibit notable
limitations. Specifically, set-based methods tend to overlook short-range
temporal context for individual frames, while sequence-based methods struggle
to capture long-range temporal dependencies effectively. To address these
challenges, we draw inspiration from human identification and propose a new
perspective that conceptualizes human gait as a composition of individualized
actions. Each action is represented by a series of frames, randomly selected
from a continuous segment of the sequence, which we term a snippet.
Fundamentally, the collection of snippets for a given sequence enables the
incorporation of multi-scale temporal context, facilitating more comprehensive
gait feature learning. Moreover, we introduce a non-trivial solution for
snippet-based gait recognition, focusing on Snippet Sampling and Snippet
Modeling as key components. Extensive experiments on four widely-used gait
datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach and, more
importantly, highlight the potential of gait snippets. For instance, our method
achieves the rank-1 accuracy of 77.5% on Gait3D and 81.7% on GREW using a 2D
convolution-based backbone.

Conclusion: TSDF通过双功能对抗扰动实现了长期有效的防御，解决了传统防御方法的持久性问题。

Abstract: Active defense strategies have been developed to counter the threat of
deepfake technology. However, a primary challenge is their lack of persistence,
as their effectiveness is often short-lived. Attackers can bypass these
defenses by simply collecting protected samples and retraining their models.
This means that static defenses inevitably fail when attackers retrain their
models, which severely limits practical use. We argue that an effective defense
not only distorts forged content but also blocks the model's ability to adapt,
which occurs when attackers retrain their models on protected images. To
achieve this, we propose an innovative Two-Stage Defense Framework (TSDF).
Benefiting from the intensity separation mechanism designed in this paper, the
framework uses dual-function adversarial perturbations to perform two roles.
First, it can directly distort the forged results. Second, it acts as a
poisoning vehicle that disrupts the data preparation process essential for an
attacker's retraining pipeline. By poisoning the data source, TSDF aims to
prevent the attacker's model from adapting to the defensive perturbations, thus
ensuring the defense remains effective long-term. Comprehensive experiments
show that the performance of traditional interruption methods degrades sharply
when it is subjected to adversarial retraining. However, our framework shows a
strong dual defense capability, which can improve the persistence of active
defense. Our code will be available at https://github.com/vpsg-research/TSDF.

Abstract: Power batteries are essential components in electric vehicles, where internal
structural defects can pose serious safety risks. We conduct a comprehensive
study on a new task, power battery detection (PBD), which aims to localize the
dense endpoints of cathode and anode plates from industrial X-ray images for
quality inspection. Manual inspection is inefficient and error-prone, while
traditional vision algorithms struggle with densely packed plates, low
contrast, scale variation, and imaging artifacts. To address this issue and
drive more attention into this meaningful task, we present PBD5K, the first
large-scale benchmark for this task, consisting of 5,000 X-ray images from nine
battery types with fine-grained annotations and eight types of real-world
visual interference. To support scalable and consistent labeling, we develop an
intelligent annotation pipeline that combines image filtering, model-assisted
pre-labeling, cross-verification, and layered quality evaluation. We formulate
PBD as a point-level segmentation problem and propose MDCNeXt, a model designed
to extract and integrate multi-dimensional structure clues including point,
line, and count information from the plate itself. To improve discrimination
between plates and suppress visual interference, MDCNeXt incorporates two state
space modules. The first is a prompt-filtered module that learns contrastive
relationships guided by task-specific prompts. The second is a density-aware
reordering module that refines segmentation in regions with high plate density.
In addition, we propose a distance-adaptive mask generation strategy to provide
robust supervision under varying spatial distributions of anode and cathode
positions. The source code and datasets will be publicly available at

Conclusion: MambaTrans无需调整预训练模型参数，即可有效适应多模态融合图像，提升下游任务表现。

Abstract: The goal of multimodal image fusion is to integrate complementary information
from infrared and visible images, generating multimodal fused images for
downstream tasks. Existing downstream pre-training models are typically trained
on visible images. However, the significant pixel distribution differences
between visible and multimodal fusion images can degrade downstream task
performance, sometimes even below that of using only visible images. This paper
explores adapting multimodal fused images with significant modality differences
to object detection and semantic segmentation models trained on visible images.
To address this, we propose MambaTrans, a novel multimodal fusion image
modality translator. MambaTrans uses descriptions from a multimodal large
language model and masks from semantic segmentation models as input. Its core
component, the Multi-Model State Space Block, combines mask-image-text
cross-attention and a 3D-Selective Scan Module, enhancing pure visual
capabilities. By leveraging object detection prior knowledge, MambaTrans
minimizes detection loss during training and captures long-term dependencies
among text, masks, and images. This enables favorable results in pre-trained
models without adjusting their parameters. Experiments on public datasets show
that MambaTrans effectively improves multimodal image performance in downstream
tasks.

Method: 提出Pose-RFT框架，采用混合动作强化学习算法HyGRPO，结合任务特定奖励函数优化离散和连续动作。

Result: 在多个姿态生成基准测试中，Pose-RFT显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 混合动作强化微调对3D姿态生成任务有效。

Abstract: Generating 3D human poses from multimodal inputs such as images or text
requires models to capture both rich spatial and semantic correspondences.
While pose-specific multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise
in this task, they are typically trained with supervised objectives such as
SMPL parameter regression or token-level prediction, which struggle to model
the inherent ambiguity and achieve task-specific alignment required for
accurate 3D pose generation. To address these limitations, we propose Pose-RFT,
a reinforcement fine-tuning framework tailored for 3D human pose generation in
MLLMs. We formulate the task as a hybrid action reinforcement learning problem
that jointly optimizes discrete language prediction and continuous pose
generation. To this end, we introduce HyGRPO, a hybrid reinforcement learning
algorithm that performs group-wise reward normalization over sampled responses
to guide joint optimization of discrete and continuous actions. Pose-RFT
further incorporates task-specific reward functions to guide optimization
towards spatial alignment in image-to-pose generation and semantic consistency
in text-to-pose generation. Extensive experiments on multiple pose generation
benchmarks demonstrate that Pose-RFT significantly improves performance over
existing pose-specific MLLMs, validating the effectiveness of hybrid action
reinforcement fine-tuning for 3D pose generation.

Result: 在视频修复基准测试中表现最优，时间一致性和细节保留更佳，对光流噪声和遮挡鲁棒。

Conclusion: DiTVR为零样本视频修复提供了高效且一致的新方法。

Abstract: Video restoration aims to reconstruct high quality video sequences from low
quality inputs, addressing tasks such as super resolution, denoising, and
deblurring. Traditional regression based methods often produce unrealistic
details and require extensive paired datasets, while recent generative
diffusion models face challenges in ensuring temporal consistency. We introduce
DiTVR, a zero shot video restoration framework that couples a diffusion
transformer with trajectory aware attention and a wavelet guided, flow
consistent sampler. Unlike prior 3D convolutional or frame wise diffusion
approaches, our attention mechanism aligns tokens along optical flow
trajectories, with particular emphasis on vital layers that exhibit the highest
sensitivity to temporal dynamics. A spatiotemporal neighbour cache dynamically
selects relevant tokens based on motion correspondences across frames. The flow
guided sampler injects data consistency only into low-frequency bands,
preserving high frequency priors while accelerating convergence. DiTVR
establishes a new zero shot state of the art on video restoration benchmarks,
demonstrating superior temporal consistency and detail preservation while
remaining robust to flow noise and occlusions.

*Jingze Gai,Changchun Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种半监督的SAR-光学图像匹配方法S2M2-SAR，结合伪标签和无监督特征增强，显著减少对标注数据的依赖，性能优于现有半监督方法，接近全监督SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SAR-光学图像匹配方法依赖像素级标注数据，标注成本高且难以获取足够数据。

Method: 设计半监督匹配流程，利用伪标签相似性热图训练模型，并引入无监督跨模态特征增强模块。

Result: S2M2-SAR在基准数据集上性能优于半监督方法，接近全监督SOTA。

Conclusion: S2M2-SAR高效实用，减少了对标注数据的依赖，提升了匹配性能。

Abstract: Driven by the complementary nature of optical and synthetic aperture radar
(SAR) images, SAR-optical image matching has garnered significant interest.
Most existing SAR-optical image matching methods aim to capture effective
matching features by employing the supervision of pixel-level matched
correspondences within SAR-optical image pairs, which, however, suffers from
time-consuming and complex manual annotation, making it difficult to collect
sufficient labeled SAR-optical image pairs. To handle this, we design a
semi-supervised SAR-optical image matching pipeline that leverages both scarce
labeled and abundant unlabeled image pairs and propose a semi-supervised
multiscale matching for SAR-optical image matching (S2M2-SAR). Specifically, we
pseudo-label those unlabeled SAR-optical image pairs with pseudo ground-truth
similarity heatmaps by combining both deep and shallow level matching results,
and train the matching model by employing labeled and pseudo-labeled similarity
heatmaps. In addition, we introduce a cross-modal feature enhancement module
trained using a cross-modality mutual independence loss, which requires no
ground-truth labels. This unsupervised objective promotes the separation of
modality-shared and modality-specific features by encouraging statistical
independence between them, enabling effective feature disentanglement across
optical and SAR modalities. To evaluate the effectiveness of S2M2-SAR, we
compare it with existing competitors on benchmark datasets. Experimental
results demonstrate that S2M2-SAR not only surpasses existing semi-supervised
methods but also achieves performance competitive with fully supervised SOTA
methods, demonstrating its efficiency and practical potential.

TL;DR: RSFIQA是一种细粒度无参考图像质量评估模型，通过动态分割语义区域并结合多模态大语言模型提取局部特征，提升对局部质量变化的感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NR-IQA方法要么关注全局表征，要么对区域特征采用统一权重，导致对语义显著区域或局部质量变化的敏感性不足。

Method: 利用Segment Anything Model动态分割图像为语义区域，结合多模态大语言模型提取局部特征，并引入区域感知语义注意力机制。

Result: 实验表明RSFIQA在多个基准数据集上具有竞争性的质量预测性能。

Conclusion: RSFIQA通过细粒度区域感知和多维质量差异建模，显著提升了无参考图像质量评估的效果。

Abstract: No-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) aims to simulate the process
of perceiving image quality aligned with subjective human perception. However,
existing NR-IQA methods either focus on global representations that leads to
limited insights into the semantically salient regions or employ a uniform
weighting for region features that weakens the sensitivity to local quality
variations. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained image quality assessment
model, named RSFIQA, which integrates region-level distortion information to
perceive multi-dimensional quality discrepancies. To enhance regional quality
awareness, we first utilize the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to dynamically
partition the input image into non-overlapping semantic regions. For each
region, we teach a powerful Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to extract
descriptive content and perceive multi-dimensional distortions, enabling a
comprehensive understanding of both local semantics and quality degradations.
To effectively leverage this information, we introduce Region-Aware Semantic
Attention (RSA) mechanism, which generates a global attention map by
aggregating fine-grained representations from local regions. In addition,
RSFIQA is backbone-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into various deep
neural network architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness
and effectiveness of the proposed method, which achieves competitive quality
prediction performance across multiple benchmark datasets.

Motivation: VLMs的复杂架构难以解释，限制了透明度和信任。

Method: MIMIC结合VLM反演和特征对齐目标，并引入三种正则化器（空间对齐、图像平滑、语义真实）。

Result: 通过定量和定性评估，MIMIC在自由文本输出上实现了视觉概念的反演。

Conclusion: MIMIC是首个针对VLM视觉概念解释的反演方法。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) encode multimodal inputs over large, complex,
and difficult-to-interpret architectures, which limit transparency and trust.
We propose a Multimodal Inversion for Model Interpretation and
Conceptualization (MIMIC) framework to visualize the internal representations
of VLMs by synthesizing visual concepts corresponding to internal encodings.
MIMIC uses a joint VLM-based inversion and a feature alignment objective to
account for VLM's autoregressive processing. It additionally includes a triplet
of regularizers for spatial alignment, natural image smoothness, and semantic
realism. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate MIMIC by inverting visual
concepts over a range of varying-length free-form VLM output texts. Reported
results include both standard visual quality metrics as well as semantic
text-based metrics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model
inversion approach addressing visual interpretations of VLM concepts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管通用视觉语言模型在组织病理学中表现出色，但其在特定任务中可能表现不佳，且监督微调需要人工标注数据。

Method: 通过从现有数据库中提取领域和任务相关的图像-文本对，对VLMs进行无标注的继续预训练。

Result: 实验表明，这种方法显著提升了零样本和小样本性能，且在更大训练规模下可媲美小样本方法。

Conclusion: 无标注的继续预训练是一种高效、任务无关且无需人工标注的VLM适应方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in histopathology, such as
CONCH and QuiltNet, have demonstrated impressive zero-shot classification
capabilities across various tasks. However, their general-purpose design may
lead to suboptimal performance in specific downstream applications. While
supervised fine-tuning methods address this issue, they require manually
labeled samples for adaptation. This paper investigates annotation-free
adaptation of VLMs through continued pretraining on domain- and task-relevant
image-caption pairs extracted from existing databases. Our experiments on two
VLMs, CONCH and QuiltNet, across three downstream tasks reveal that these pairs
substantially enhance both zero-shot and few-shot performance. Notably, with
larger training sizes, continued pretraining matches the performance of
few-shot methods while eliminating manual labeling. Its effectiveness,
task-agnostic design, and annotation-free workflow make it a promising pathway
for adapting VLMs to new histopathology tasks. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有BEV多模态方法存在输入适应性有限、建模能力受限和泛化性能不足的问题。

Method: 采用分层解耦的混合专家架构（CBDES MoE），结合轻量级自注意力路由机制（SAR），实现动态专家路径选择和高效推理。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，CBDES MoE在3D目标检测中表现优于单专家模型，mAP提升1.6点，NDS提升4.1点。

Conclusion: CBDES MoE通过模块化混合专家框架，显著提升了BEV感知系统的性能，具有实际应用优势。

Abstract: Bird's Eye View (BEV) perception systems based on multi-sensor feature fusion
have become a fundamental cornerstone for end-to-end autonomous driving.
However, existing multi-modal BEV methods commonly suffer from limited input
adaptability, constrained modeling capacity, and suboptimal generalization. To
address these challenges, we propose a hierarchically decoupled
Mixture-of-Experts architecture at the functional module level, termed
Computing Brain DEvelopment System Mixture-of-Experts (CBDES MoE). CBDES MoE
integrates multiple structurally heterogeneous expert networks with a
lightweight Self-Attention Router (SAR) gating mechanism, enabling dynamic
expert path selection and sparse, input-aware efficient inference. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first modular Mixture-of-Experts framework
constructed at the functional module granularity within the autonomous driving
domain. Extensive evaluations on the real-world nuScenes dataset demonstrate
that CBDES MoE consistently outperforms fixed single-expert baselines in 3D
object detection. Compared to the strongest single-expert model, CBDES MoE
achieves a 1.6-point increase in mAP and a 4.1-point improvement in NDS,
demonstrating the effectiveness and practical advantages of the proposed
approach.

Method: 使用电子显微镜图像提取拓扑特征为骨架图，通过图卷积网络嵌入，再用主成分分析和Davies-Bouldin指数评估聚类分离性。

Result: 辐照角度比辐照通量对Ge表面形态的影响更显著。

Conclusion: 辐照角度是影响Ge表面微观结构形态的关键因素。

Abstract: In this paper, electron microscopy images of microstructures formed on Ge

as skeleton graphs, which were then embedded using a graph convolutional
network. The resulting embeddings were analyzed using principal component
analysis, and cluster separability in the resulting PCA space was evaluated
using the Davies-Bouldin index. The results indicate that variations in

properties of Ge surfaces than variations in irradiation fluence.

Conclusion: 基于TAP的模型在复杂手术场景中具有高精度无标记3D追踪潜力。

Abstract: Minimally invasive surgery presents challenges such as dynamic tissue motion
and a limited field of view. Accurate tissue tracking has the potential to
support surgical guidance, improve safety by helping avoid damage to sensitive
structures, and enable context-aware robotic assistance during complex
procedures. In this work, we propose a novel method for markerless 3D tissue
tracking by leveraging 2D Tracking Any Point (TAP) networks. Our method
combines two CoTracker models, one for temporal tracking and one for stereo
matching, to estimate 3D motion from stereo endoscopic images. We evaluate the
system using a clinical laparoscopic setup and a robotic arm simulating tissue
motion, with experiments conducted on a synthetic 3D-printed phantom and a
chicken tissue phantom. Tracking on the chicken tissue phantom yielded more
reliable results, with Euclidean distance errors as low as 1.1 mm at a velocity
of 10 mm/s. These findings highlight the potential of TAP-based models for
accurate, markerless 3D tracking in challenging surgical scenarios.

Result: Being-M0.5在多个运动生成任务中表现最优，并通过效率分析证实了其实时能力。

Conclusion: HuMo100M和Being-M0.5代表了运动生成技术的重大进步，将加速其在实际应用中的推广。

Abstract: Human motion generation has emerged as a critical technology with
transformative potential for real-world applications. However, existing
vision-language-motion models (VLMMs) face significant limitations that hinder
their practical deployment. We identify controllability as a main bottleneck,
manifesting in five key aspects: inadequate response to diverse human commands,
limited pose initialization capabilities, poor performance on long-term
sequences, insufficient handling of unseen scenarios, and lack of fine-grained
control over individual body parts. To overcome these limitations, we present
Being-M0.5, the first real-time, controllable VLMM that achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple motion generation tasks. Our
approach is built upon HuMo100M, the largest and most comprehensive human
motion dataset to date, comprising over 5 million self-collected motion
sequences, 100 million multi-task instructional instances, and detailed
part-level annotations that address a critical gap in existing datasets. We
introduce a novel part-aware residual quantization technique for motion
tokenization that enables precise, granular control over individual body parts
during generation. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates Being-M0.5's
superior performance across diverse motion benchmarks, while comprehensive
efficiency analysis confirms its real-time capabilities. Our contributions
include design insights and detailed computational analysis to guide future
development of practical motion generators. We believe that HuMo100M and
Being-M0.5 represent significant advances that will accelerate the adoption of
motion generation technologies in real-world applications. The project page is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 现代大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）中图像令牌冗余严重，现有剪枝方法忽略多模态上下文学习（ICL）。提出的CATP方法通过两阶段渐进剪枝，显著提升效率且性能略有提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像令牌冗余增加推理成本，现有剪枝方法在多模态ICL中效果不佳，需新方法解决。

Method: 提出CATP，一种针对多模态ICL的无训练剪枝方法，通过两阶段渐进剪枝处理跨模态交互。

Result: 剪除77.8%图像令牌后，CATP在四个LVLMs和八个基准测试中平均性能提升0.6%，推理延迟平均降低10.78%。

Conclusion: CATP提升多模态ICL的实用价值，为未来图像-文本交织场景奠定基础。

Abstract: Modern large vision-language models (LVLMs) convert each input image into a
large set of tokens, far outnumbering the text tokens. Although this improves
visual perception, it introduces severe image token redundancy. Because image
tokens carry sparse information, many add little to reasoning, yet greatly
increase inference cost. The emerging image token pruning methods tackle this
issue by identifying the most important tokens and discarding the rest. These
methods can raise efficiency with only modest performance loss. However, most
of them only consider single-image tasks and overlook multimodal in-context
learning (ICL), where redundancy is greater and efficiency is more critical.
Redundant tokens weaken the advantage of multimodal ICL for rapid domain
adaptation and cause unstable performance. Applying existing pruning methods in
this setting leads to large accuracy drops, exposing a clear gap and the need
for new techniques. Thus, we propose Contextually Adaptive Token Pruning
(CATP), a training-free pruning method targeted at multimodal ICL. CATP
consists of two stages that perform progressive pruning to fully account for
the complex cross-modal interactions in the input sequence. After removing
77.8\% of the image tokens, CATP produces an average performance gain of 0.6\%
over the vanilla model on four LVLMs and eight benchmarks, exceeding all
baselines remarkably. Meanwhile, it effectively improves efficiency by
achieving an average reduction of 10.78\% in inference latency. CATP enhances
the practical value of multimodal ICL and lays the groundwork for future
progress in interleaved image-text scenarios.

Result: 实验表明，该方法仅用2.75M参数即可在不同修复任务中取得优异性能。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在参数效率和任务建模准确性上均有显著提升。

Abstract: Image restoration under adverse weather conditions has been extensively
explored, leading to numerous high-performance methods. In particular, recent
advances in All-in-One approaches have shown impressive results by training on
multi-task image restoration datasets. However, most of these methods rely on
dedicated network modules or parameters for each specific degradation type,
resulting in a significant parameter overhead. Moreover, the relatedness across
different restoration tasks is often overlooked. In light of these issues, we
propose a parameter-efficient All-in-One image restoration framework that
leverages task-aware enhanced prompts to tackle various adverse weather
degradations.Specifically, we adopt a two-stage training paradigm consisting of
a pretraining phase and a prompt-tuning phase to mitigate parameter conflicts
across tasks. We first employ supervised learning to acquire general
restoration knowledge, and then adapt the model to handle specific degradation
via trainable soft prompts. Crucially, we enhance these task-specific prompts
in a task-aware manner. We apply low-rank decomposition to these prompts to
capture both task-general and task-specific characteristics, and impose
contrastive constraints to better align them with the actual inter-task
relatedness. These enhanced prompts not only improve the parameter efficiency
of the restoration model but also enable more accurate task modeling, as
evidenced by t-SNE analysis. Experimental results on different restoration
tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance with
only 2.75M parameters.

Conclusion: Stand-In框架高效且灵活，适用于多种视频生成任务。

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity human videos that match user-specified identities is
important yet challenging in the field of generative AI. Existing methods often
rely on an excessive number of training parameters and lack compatibility with
other AIGC tools. In this paper, we propose Stand-In, a lightweight and
plug-and-play framework for identity preservation in video generation.
Specifically, we introduce a conditional image branch into the pre-trained
video generation model. Identity control is achieved through restricted
self-attentions with conditional position mapping, and can be learned quickly
with only 2000 pairs. Despite incorporating and training just $\sim$1\%
additional parameters, our framework achieves excellent results in video
quality and identity preservation, outperforming other full-parameter training
methods. Moreover, our framework can be seamlessly integrated for other tasks,
such as subject-driven video generation, pose-referenced video generation,
stylization, and face swapping.

Abstract: Handwritten text recognition for historical documents remains challenging due
to handwriting variability, degraded sources, and limited layout-aware
annotations. In this work, we address annotation errors - particularly
hyphenation issues - in the Bullinger correspondence, a large 16th-century
letter collection. We introduce a self-training method based on a CTC alignment
algorithm that matches full transcriptions to text line images using dynamic
programming and model output probabilities trained with the CTC loss. Our
approach improves performance (e.g., by 1.1 percentage points CER with PyLaia)
and increases alignment accuracy. Interestingly, we find that weaker models
yield more accurate alignments, enabling an iterative training strategy. We
release a new manually corrected subset of 100 pages from the Bullinger
dataset, along with our code and benchmarks. Our approach can be applied
iteratively to further improve the CER as well as the alignment quality for
text recognition pipelines. Code and data are available via

Conclusion: 该方法通过合成数据生成和视频扩散模型的结合，显著提升了视频抠图的性能和时间一致性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Video matting has traditionally been limited by the lack of high-quality
ground-truth data. Most existing video matting datasets provide only
human-annotated imperfect alpha and foreground annotations, which must be
composited to background images or videos during the training stage. Thus, the
generalization capability of previous methods in real-world scenarios is
typically poor. In this work, we propose to solve the problem from two
perspectives. First, we emphasize the importance of large-scale pre-training by
pursuing diverse synthetic and pseudo-labeled segmentation datasets. We also
develop a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline that can render diverse
human bodies and fine-grained hairs, yielding around 200 video clips with a
3-second duration for fine-tuning. Second, we introduce a novel video matting
approach that can effectively leverage the rich priors from pre-trained video
diffusion models. This architecture offers two key advantages. First, strong
priors play a critical role in bridging the domain gap between synthetic and
real-world scenes. Second, unlike most existing methods that process video
matting frame-by-frame and use an independent decoder to aggregate temporal
information, our model is inherently designed for video, ensuring strong
temporal consistency. We provide a comprehensive quantitative evaluation across
three benchmark datasets, demonstrating our approach's superior performance,
and present comprehensive qualitative results in diverse real-world scenes,
illustrating the strong generalization capability of our method. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态场景的单目视频重建面临内存需求困境，现有方法在静态结构稳定性和动态细节保留之间存在冲突。

Method: Mem4D采用双内存架构：瞬态动态内存（TDM）捕捉高频动态细节，持久结构内存（PSM）保留长期静态信息。

Result: 实验表明，Mem4D在保持高效的同时，实现了静态结构的全局一致性和动态元素的高保真重建。

Conclusion: Mem4D通过解耦静态和动态建模，显著提升了动态场景重建的性能。

Abstract: Reconstructing dense geometry for dynamic scenes from a monocular video is a
critical yet challenging task. Recent memory-based methods enable efficient
online reconstruction, but they fundamentally suffer from a Memory Demand
Dilemma: The memory representation faces an inherent conflict between the
long-term stability required for static structures and the rapid, high-fidelity
detail retention needed for dynamic motion. This conflict forces existing
methods into a compromise, leading to either geometric drift in static
structures or blurred, inaccurate reconstructions of dynamic objects. To
address this dilemma, we propose Mem4D, a novel framework that decouples the
modeling of static geometry and dynamic motion. Guided by this insight, we
design a dual-memory architecture: 1) The Transient Dynamics Memory (TDM)
focuses on capturing high-frequency motion details from recent frames, enabling
accurate and fine-grained modeling of dynamic content; 2) The Persistent
Structure Memory (PSM) compresses and preserves long-term spatial information,
ensuring global consistency and drift-free reconstruction for static elements.
By alternating queries to these specialized memories, Mem4D simultaneously
maintains static geometry with global consistency and reconstructs dynamic
elements with high fidelity. Experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance while
maintaining high efficiency. Codes will be publicly available.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遥感VQA数据集在标注丰富性、问题多样性和推理能力评估方面存在局限性，亟需一个更全面的数据集来推动研究。

Method: 通过整合多个遥感分割和检测数据集，利用GPT-4.1自动生成详细标注和复杂问答对，并开发专门的对象计数流程。

Result: RSVLM-QA包含13,820张图像和162,373个VQA对，标注丰富且问题多样，实验表明其能有效评估主流视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: RSVLM-QA将成为遥感VQA和视觉语言模型研究的重要资源，推动领域发展。

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) in remote sensing (RS) is pivotal for
interpreting Earth observation data. However, existing RS VQA datasets are
constrained by limitations in annotation richness, question diversity, and the
assessment of specific reasoning capabilities. This paper introduces RSVLM-QA
dataset, a new large-scale, content-rich VQA dataset for the RS domain.
RSVLM-QA is constructed by integrating data from several prominent RS
segmentation and detection datasets: WHU, LoveDA, INRIA, and iSAID. We employ
an innovative dual-track annotation generation pipeline. Firstly, we leverage
Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4.1, with meticulously designed
prompts to automatically generate a suite of detailed annotations including
image captions, spatial relations, and semantic tags, alongside complex
caption-based VQA pairs. Secondly, to address the challenging task of object
counting in RS imagery, we have developed a specialized automated process that
extracts object counts directly from the original segmentation data; GPT-4.1
then formulates natural language answers from these counts, which are paired
with preset question templates to create counting QA pairs. RSVLM-QA comprises
13,820 images and 162,373 VQA pairs, featuring extensive annotations and
diverse question types. We provide a detailed statistical analysis of the
dataset and a comparison with existing RS VQA benchmarks, highlighting the
superior depth and breadth of RSVLM-QA's annotations. Furthermore, we conduct
benchmark experiments on Six mainstream Vision Language Models (VLMs),
demonstrating that RSVLM-QA effectively evaluates and challenges the
understanding and reasoning abilities of current VLMs in the RS domain. We
believe RSVLM-QA will serve as a pivotal resource for the RS VQA and VLM
research communities, poised to catalyze advancements in the field.

Abstract: Generative AI holds great potentials to automate and enhance data synthesis
in nuclear medicine. However, the high-stakes nature of biomedical imaging
necessitates robust mechanisms to detect and manage unexpected or erroneous
model behavior. We introduce development and implementation of a hybrid anomaly
detection framework to safeguard GenAI models in BIOEMTECH's eyes(TM) systems.
Two applications are demonstrated: Pose2Xray, which generates synthetic X-rays
from photographic mouse images, and DosimetrEYE, which estimates 3D radiation
dose maps from 2D SPECT/CT scans. In both cases, our outlier detection (OD)
enhances reliability, reduces manual oversight, and supports real-time quality
control. This approach strengthens the industrial viability of GenAI in
preclinical settings by increasing robustness, scalability, and regulatory
compliance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本视频时间定位方法存在语义碎片化和相似性分布偏差问题，且依赖昂贵的LLMs推理。

Method: 提出TAG方法，结合时间池化、时间相干性聚类和相似性调整，无需训练即可捕获视频时间上下文。

Result: 在Charades-STA和ActivityNet Captions数据集上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: TAG是一种简单有效的零样本视频时间定位方法，解决了现有方法的局限性，且不依赖LLMs。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to extract relevant video segments based
on a given natural language query. Recently, zero-shot VTG methods have gained
attention by leveraging pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) to localize
target moments without additional training. However, existing approaches suffer
from semantic fragmentation, where temporally continuous frames sharing the
same semantics are split across multiple segments. When segments are
fragmented, it becomes difficult to predict an accurate target moment that
aligns with the text query. Also, they rely on skewed similarity distributions
for localization, making it difficult to select the optimal segment.
Furthermore, they heavily depend on the use of LLMs which require expensive
inferences. To address these limitations, we propose a \textit{TAG}, a simple
yet effective Temporal-Aware approach for zero-shot video temporal Grounding,
which incorporates temporal pooling, temporal coherence clustering, and
similarity adjustment. Our proposed method effectively captures the temporal
context of videos and addresses distorted similarity distributions without
training. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on Charades-STA and
ActivityNet Captions benchmark datasets without rely on LLMs. Our code is

Result: 在VGGFace2数据集上验证，VOIDFace实现了隐私保护、数据控制和竞争性性能。

Conclusion: VOIDFace在隐私、安全和效率方面显著改进面部识别系统，同时支持用户数据控制权。

Abstract: Advancement of machine learning techniques, combined with the availability of
large-scale datasets, has significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of
facial recognition. Modern facial recognition systems are trained using large
face datasets collected from diverse individuals or public repositories.
However, for training, these datasets are often replicated and stored in
multiple workstations, resulting in data replication, which complicates
database management and oversight. Currently, once a user submits their face
for dataset preparation, they lose control over how their data is used, raising
significant privacy and ethical concerns. This paper introduces VOIDFace, a
novel framework for facial recognition systems that addresses two major issues.
First, it eliminates the need of data replication and improves data control to
securely store training face data by using visual secret sharing. Second, it
proposes a patch-based multi-training network that uses this novel training
data storage mechanism to develop a robust, privacy-preserving facial
recognition system. By integrating these advancements, VOIDFace aims to improve
the privacy, security, and efficiency of facial recognition training, while
ensuring greater control over sensitive personal face data. VOIDFace also
enables users to exercise their Right-To-Be-Forgotten property to control their
personal data. Experimental evaluations on the VGGFace2 dataset show that
VOIDFace provides Right-To-Be-Forgotten, improved data control, security, and
privacy while maintaining competitive facial recognition performance. Code is

Result: 关联准确率提升11%，实现持久身份跟踪，支持个性化智能系统。

Conclusion: TrackOR为手术室团队效率与安全提供新分析工具，推动个性化智能支持发展。

Abstract: Providing intelligent support to surgical teams is a key frontier in
automated surgical scene understanding, with the long-term goal of improving
patient outcomes. Developing personalized intelligence for all staff members
requires maintaining a consistent state of who is located where for long
surgical procedures, which still poses numerous computational challenges. We
propose TrackOR, a framework for tackling long-term multi-person tracking and
re-identification in the operating room. TrackOR uses 3D geometric signatures
to achieve state-of-the-art online tracking performance (+11% Association
Accuracy over the strongest baseline), while also enabling an effective offline
recovery process to create analysis-ready trajectories. Our work shows that by
leveraging 3D geometric information, persistent identity tracking becomes
attainable, enabling a critical shift towards the more granular, staff-centric
analyses required for personalized intelligent systems in the operating room.
This new capability opens up various applications, including our proposed
temporal pathway imprints that translate raw tracking data into actionable
insights for improving team efficiency and safety and ultimately providing
personalized support.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在BVI社区的应用潜力巨大，但其在动态环境中的不可靠性可能损害用户信任。

Method: 通过‘电梯问题’这一典型案例，分析现有视频理解框架（基于离散帧采样）的局限性。

Result: 发现现有模型因处理连续、低信号运动的困难而无法感知动态环境中的关键信息。

Conclusion: 呼吁从语义识别转向物理感知，并开发以用户需求为中心的新基准，提升安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold immense promise as assistive
technologies for the blind and visually impaired (BVI) community. However, we
identify a critical failure mode that undermines their trustworthiness in
real-world applications. We introduce the Escalator Problem -- the inability of
state-of-the-art models to perceive an escalator's direction of travel -- as a
canonical example of a deeper limitation we term Implicit Motion Blindness.
This blindness stems from the dominant frame-sampling paradigm in video
understanding, which, by treating videos as discrete sequences of static
images, fundamentally struggles to perceive continuous, low-signal motion. As a
position paper, our contribution is not a new model but rather to: (I) formally
articulate this blind spot, (II) analyze its implications for user trust, and
(III) issue a call to action. We advocate for a paradigm shift from purely
semantic recognition towards robust physical perception and urge the
development of new, human-centered benchmarks that prioritize safety,
reliability, and the genuine needs of users in dynamic environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProGraD是一种基于提示驱动的群体活动检测方法，通过可学习的群体提示和轻量级Transformer提升Vision Foundation Models在群体动态建模中的表现，尤其在多群体场景中效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Vision Foundation Models（如DinoV2）虽具备优秀特征，但因其预训练数据以对象为中心，在群体动态建模中表现不足，需要更结构化的群体感知推理。

Method: ProGraD结合了1）可学习的群体提示以引导VFM关注社交配置，2）轻量级两层GroupContext Transformer推断参与者-群体关联和集体行为。

Result: 在Cafe和Social-CAD两个基准测试中，ProGraD均超越现有方法，多群体场景下提升6.5%（Group mAP@1.0）和8.2%（Group mAP@0.5），且仅需10M可训练参数。

Conclusion: ProGraD不仅性能优越，还能生成可解释的注意力图，为群体推理提供直观洞察。

Abstract: Group Activity Detection (GAD) involves recognizing social groups and their
collective behaviors in videos. Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), like DinoV2,
offer excellent features, but are pretrained primarily on object-centric data
and remain underexplored for modeling group dynamics. While they are a
promising alternative to highly task-specific GAD architectures that require
full fine-tuning, our initial investigation reveals that simply swapping CNN
backbones used in these methods with VFMs brings little gain, underscoring the
need for structured, group-aware reasoning on top.
  We introduce Prompt-driven Group Activity Detection (ProGraD) -- a method
that bridges this gap through 1) learnable group prompts to guide the VFM
attention toward social configurations, and 2) a lightweight two-layer
GroupContext Transformer that infers actor-group associations and collective
behavior. We evaluate our approach on two recent GAD benchmarks: Cafe, which
features multiple concurrent social groups, and Social-CAD, which focuses on
single-group interactions. While we surpass state-of-the-art in both settings,
our method is especially effective in complex multi-group scenarios, where we
yield a gain of 6.5\% (Group mAP\@1.0) and 8.2\% (Group mAP\@0.5) using only
10M trainable parameters. Furthermore, our experiments reveal that ProGraD
produces interpretable attention maps, offering insights into actor-group
reasoning. Code and models will be released.

TL;DR: SRA是一种无需搜索的自动数据增强方法，通过动态调整增强策略和不对称增强策略，显著提升了性能，并在ImageNet上达到78.31%的Top-1准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流AutoDA方法存在搜索耗时或性能不足的问题，SRA旨在解决这些问题。

Method: SRA通过启发式评分模块评估数据复杂度，并采用不对称增强策略。

Result: SRA在ImageNet上达到78.31%的Top-1准确率，并兼容现有增强流程。

Conclusion: SRA为更简单、有效和实用的AutoDA设计提供了方向。

Abstract: Automatic data augmentation (AutoDA) plays an important role in enhancing the
generalization of neural networks. However, mainstream AutoDA methods often
encounter two challenges: either the search process is excessively
time-consuming, hindering practical application, or the performance is
suboptimal due to insufficient policy adaptation during training. To address
these issues, we propose Sample-aware RandAugment (SRA), an asymmetric,
search-free AutoDA method that dynamically adjusts augmentation policies while
maintaining straightforward implementation. SRA incorporates a heuristic
scoring module that evaluates the complexity of the original training data,
enabling the application of tailored augmentations for each sample.
Additionally, an asymmetric augmentation strategy is employed to maximize the
potential of this scoring module. In multiple experimental settings, SRA
narrows the performance gap between search-based and search-free AutoDA
methods, achieving a state-of-the-art Top-1 accuracy of 78.31\% on ImageNet
with ResNet-50. Notably, SRA demonstrates good compatibility with existing
augmentation pipelines and solid generalization across new tasks, without
requiring hyperparameter tuning. The pretrained models leveraging SRA also
enhance recognition in downstream object detection tasks. SRA represents a
promising step towards simpler, more effective, and practical AutoDA designs
applicable to a variety of future tasks. Our code is available at

Method: 采用梯度显著性分析揭示CNN模型的偏差，并提出基于3D点云序列的方法，分离形状和运动特征。

Result: 实验显示，RGB模型在真实临床场景中性能下降12%，而几何方法表现更稳健。

Conclusion: 几何表示能捕捉更有意义的生物特征，为手术室中的人类建模提供了更鲁棒的方法。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are prone to learning spurious correlations, exploiting
dataset-specific artifacts rather than meaningful features for prediction. In
surgical operating rooms (OR), these manifest through the standardization of
smocks and gowns that obscure robust identifying landmarks, introducing model
bias for tasks related to modeling OR personnel. Through gradient-based
saliency analysis on two public OR datasets, we reveal that CNN models succumb
to such shortcuts, fixating on incidental visual cues such as footwear beneath
surgical gowns, distinctive eyewear, or other role-specific identifiers.
Avoiding such biases is essential for the next generation of intelligent
assistance systems in the OR, which should accurately recognize personalized
workflow traits, such as surgical skill level or coordination with other staff
members. We address this problem by encoding personnel as 3D point cloud
sequences, disentangling identity-relevant shape and motion patterns from
appearance-based confounders. Our experiments demonstrate that while RGB and
geometric methods achieve comparable performance on datasets with apparent
simulation artifacts, RGB models suffer a 12% accuracy drop in realistic
clinical settings with decreased visual diversity due to standardizations. This
performance gap confirms that geometric representations capture more meaningful
biometric features, providing an avenue to developing robust methods of
modeling humans in the OR.

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，MAE和RMSE分别提升了12.87%和9.08%。

Conclusion: TRIDE方法通过多模态融合和天气适应机制，显著提升了深度估计的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Depth estimation, essential for autonomous driving, seeks to interpret the 3D
environment surrounding vehicles. The development of radar sensors, known for
their cost-efficiency and robustness, has spurred interest in radar-camera
fusion-based solutions. However, existing algorithms fuse features from these
modalities without accounting for weather conditions, despite radars being
known to be more robust than cameras under adverse weather. Additionally, while
Vision-Language models have seen rapid advancement, utilizing language
descriptions alongside other modalities for depth estimation remains an open
challenge. This paper first introduces a text-generation strategy along with
feature extraction and fusion techniques that can assist monocular depth
estimation pipelines, leading to improved accuracy across different algorithms
on the KITTI dataset. Building on this, we propose TRIDE, a radar-camera fusion
algorithm that enhances text feature extraction by incorporating radar point
information. To address the impact of weather on sensor performance, we
introduce a weather-aware fusion block that adaptively adjusts radar weighting
based on current weather conditions. Our method, benchmarked on the nuScenes
dataset, demonstrates performance gains over the state-of-the-art, achieving a
12.87% improvement in MAE and a 9.08% improvement in RMSE. Code:

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种生成模型（如Sora、Lumiere等）上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为生成高质量3D视频提供了一种高效且无需额外训练的解决方案。

Abstract: While video generation models excel at producing high-quality monocular
videos, generating 3D stereoscopic and spatial videos for immersive
applications remains an underexplored challenge. We present a pose-free and
training-free method that leverages an off-the-shelf monocular video generation
model to produce immersive 3D videos. Our approach first warps the generated
monocular video into pre-defined camera viewpoints using estimated depth
information, then applies a novel \textit{frame matrix} inpainting framework.
This framework utilizes the original video generation model to synthesize
missing content across different viewpoints and timestamps, ensuring spatial
and temporal consistency without requiring additional model fine-tuning.
Moreover, we develop a \dualupdate~scheme that further improves the quality of
video inpainting by alleviating the negative effects propagated from
disoccluded areas in the latent space. The resulting multi-view videos are then
adapted into stereoscopic pairs or optimized into 4D Gaussians for spatial
video synthesis. We validate the efficacy of our proposed method by conducting
experiments on videos from various generative models, such as Sora, Lumiere,
WALT, and Zeroscope. The experiments demonstrate that our method has a
significant improvement over previous methods. Project page at:

Method: PrIINeR结合预训练模型的先验知识与实例优化，并强制执行双重数据一致性，以对齐k空间数据和先验重建。

Result: 在NYU fastMRI数据集上，PrIINeR优于现有INR方法和部分学习型方法，显著提升结构保留和保真度，有效消除伪影。

Conclusion: PrIINeR为高质量加速MRI重建提供了可靠解决方案，弥合了深度学习与INR技术的差距。

Abstract: Accelerating Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reduces scan time but often
degrades image quality. While Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) show
promise for MRI reconstruction, they struggle at high acceleration factors due
to weak prior constraints, leading to structural loss and aliasing artefacts.
To address this, we propose PrIINeR, an INR-based MRI reconstruction method
that integrates prior knowledge from pre-trained deep learning models into the
INR framework. By combining population-level knowledge with instance-based
optimization and enforcing dual data consistency, PrIINeR aligns both with the
acquired k-space data and the prior-informed reconstruction. Evaluated on the
NYU fastMRI dataset, our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art INR-based
approaches but also improves upon several learning-based state-of-the-art
methods, significantly improving structural preservation and fidelity while
effectively removing aliasing artefacts.PrIINeR bridges deep learning and
INR-based techniques, offering a more reliable solution for high-quality,
accelerated MRI reconstruction. The code is publicly available on

Result: 在Endo和MuReD数据集上，IBCA在多个指标上显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: IBCA通过结构因果模型有效提升了医学图像多标签分类的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Multi-label classification (MLC) of medical images aims to identify multiple
diseases and holds significant clinical potential. A critical step is to learn
class-specific features for accurate diagnosis and improved interpretability
effectively. However, current works focus primarily on causal attention to
learn class-specific features, yet they struggle to interpret the true cause
due to the inadvertent attention to class-irrelevant features. To address this
challenge, we propose a new structural causal model (SCM) that treats
class-specific attention as a mixture of causal, spurious, and noisy factors,
and a novel Information Bottleneck-based Causal Attention (IBCA) that is
capable of learning the discriminative class-specific attention for MLC of
medical images. Specifically, we propose learning Gaussian mixture multi-label
spatial attention to filter out class-irrelevant information and capture each
class-specific attention pattern. Then a contrastive enhancement-based causal
intervention is proposed to gradually mitigate the spurious attention and
reduce noise information by aligning multi-head attention with the Gaussian
mixture multi-label spatial. Quantitative and ablation results on Endo and
MuReD show that IBCA outperforms all methods. Compared to the second-best
results for each metric, IBCA achieves improvements of 6.35\% in CR, 7.72\% in
OR, and 5.02\% in mAP for MuReD, 1.47\% in CR, and 1.65\% in CF1, and 1.42\% in

Conclusion: 通过状态空间模型和多任务协同策略，显著提升了微表情分析的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are regarded as important indicators of an
individual's intrinsic emotions, preferences, and tendencies. ME analysis
requires spotting of ME intervals within long video sequences and recognition
of their corresponding emotional categories. Previous deep learning approaches
commonly employ sliding-window classification networks. However, the use of
fixed window lengths and hard classification presents notable limitations in
practice. Furthermore, these methods typically treat ME spotting and
recognition as two separate tasks, overlooking the essential relationship
between them. To address these challenges, this paper proposes two state space
model-based architectures, namely ME-TST and ME-TST+, which utilize temporal
state transition mechanisms to replace conventional window-level classification
with video-level regression. This enables a more precise characterization of
the temporal dynamics of MEs and supports the modeling of MEs with varying
durations. In ME-TST+, we further introduce multi-granularity ROI modeling and
the slowfast Mamba framework to alleviate information loss associated with
treating ME analysis as a time-series task. Additionally, we propose a synergy
strategy for spotting and recognition at both the feature and result levels,
leveraging their intrinsic connection to enhance overall analysis performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve
state-of-the-art performance. The codes are available at

Abstract: Depression is a major mental health condition that severely impacts the
emotional and physical well-being of individuals. The simple nature of data
collection from social media platforms has attracted significant interest in
properly utilizing this information for mental health research. A Multimodal
Depression Detection Network (MDD-Net), utilizing acoustic and visual data
obtained from social media networks, is proposed in this work where mutual
transformers are exploited to efficiently extract and fuse multimodal features
for efficient depression detection. The MDD-Net consists of four core modules:
an acoustic feature extraction module for retrieving relevant acoustic
attributes, a visual feature extraction module for extracting significant
high-level patterns, a mutual transformer for computing the correlations among
the generated features and fusing these features from multiple modalities, and
a detection layer for detecting depression using the fused feature
representations. The extensive experiments are performed using the multimodal
D-Vlog dataset, and the findings reveal that the developed multimodal
depression detection network surpasses the state-of-the-art by up to 17.37% for
F1-Score, demonstrating the greater performance of the proposed system. The

Conclusion: 该方法可提升育种机器人对根系表型性状的识别能力，优化育种效率，推动现代农业智能化发展。

Abstract: Plant roots typically exhibit a highly complex and dense architecture,
incorporating numerous slender lateral roots and branches, which significantly
hinders the precise capture and modeling of the entire root system.
Additionally, roots often lack sufficient texture and color information, making
it difficult to identify and track root traits using visual methods. Previous
research on roots has been largely confined to 2D studies; however, exploring
the 3D architecture of roots is crucial in botany. Since roots grow in real 3D
space, 3D phenotypic information is more critical for studying genetic traits
and their impact on root development. We have introduced a 3D root skeleton
extraction method that efficiently derives the 3D architecture of plant roots
from a few images. This method includes the detection and matching of lateral
roots, triangulation to extract the skeletal structure of lateral roots, and
the integration of lateral and primary roots. We developed a highly complex
root dataset and tested our method on it. The extracted 3D root skeletons
showed considerable similarity to the ground truth, validating the
effectiveness of the model. This method can play a significant role in
automated breeding robots. Through precise 3D root structure analysis, breeding
robots can better identify plant phenotypic traits, especially root structure
and growth patterns, helping practitioners select seeds with superior root
systems. This automated approach not only improves breeding efficiency but also
reduces manual intervention, making the breeding process more intelligent and
efficient, thus advancing modern agriculture.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TBAC-UniImage提出了一种新的多模态理解与生成统一模型，通过深度整合预训练的扩散模型和多模态大语言模型（MLLM），解决了现有方法的浅层连接和高计算成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型统一方法要么仅利用MLLM的最终隐藏状态作为生成条件（浅层连接），要么从头训练统一架构（计算成本高）。

Method: 使用MLLM多个不同层的表示作为扩散模型的生成条件，将预训练生成器视为梯子，接收MLLM多层次理解的指导。

Result: TBAC-UniImage实现了更深层次、更细粒度的理解与生成统一。

Conclusion: 该方法为多模态理解与生成提供了一种高效且深入的统一框架。

Abstract: This paper introduces TBAC-UniImage, a novel unified model for multimodal
understanding and generation. We achieve this by deeply integrating a
pre-trained Diffusion Model, acting as a generative ladder, with a Multimodal
Large Language Model (MLLM). Previous diffusion-based unified models face two
primary limitations. One approach uses only the MLLM's final hidden state as
the generative condition. This creates a shallow connection, as the generator
is isolated from the rich, hierarchical representations within the MLLM's
intermediate layers. The other approach, pretraining a unified generative
architecture from scratch, is computationally expensive and prohibitive for
many researchers. To overcome these issues, our work explores a new paradigm.
Instead of relying on a single output, we use representations from multiple,
diverse layers of the MLLM as generative conditions for the diffusion model.
This method treats the pre-trained generator as a ladder, receiving guidance
from various depths of the MLLM's understanding process. Consequently,
TBAC-UniImage achieves a much deeper and more fine-grained unification of
understanding and generation.

Motivation: 现有流式图像编辑模型在大规模形状变换任务中表现不佳，容易改变非目标区域或无法实现预期形状变化。

Method: 提出TDM定位可编辑区域，并采用Scheduled KV Injection机制确保编辑稳定性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在形状替换任务中表现出卓越的编辑能力和视觉保真度。

Conclusion: Follow-Your-Shape框架有效解决了大规模形状编辑中的挑战，提升了编辑的精确性和背景保护能力。

Abstract: While recent flow-based image editing models demonstrate general-purpose
capabilities across diverse tasks, they often struggle to specialize in
challenging scenarios -- particularly those involving large-scale shape
transformations. When performing such structural edits, these methods either
fail to achieve the intended shape change or inadvertently alter non-target
regions, resulting in degraded background quality. We propose
Follow-Your-Shape, a training-free and mask-free framework that supports
precise and controllable editing of object shapes while strictly preserving
non-target content. Motivated by the divergence between inversion and editing
trajectories, we compute a Trajectory Divergence Map (TDM) by comparing
token-wise velocity differences between the inversion and denoising paths. The
TDM enables precise localization of editable regions and guides a Scheduled KV
Injection mechanism that ensures stable and faithful editing. To facilitate a
rigorous evaluation, we introduce ReShapeBench, a new benchmark comprising 120
new images and enriched prompt pairs specifically curated for shape-aware
editing. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior editability
and visual fidelity, particularly in tasks requiring large-scale shape
replacement.

Conclusion: FantasyStyle通过创新方法有效解决了3D风格迁移的挑战。

Abstract: The success of 3DGS in generative and editing applications has sparked
growing interest in 3DGS-based style transfer. However, current methods still
face two major challenges: (1) multi-view inconsistency often leads to style
conflicts, resulting in appearance smoothing and distortion; and (2) heavy
reliance on VGG features, which struggle to disentangle style and content from
style images, often causing content leakage and excessive stylization. To
tackle these issues, we introduce \textbf{FantasyStyle}, a 3DGS-based style
transfer framework, and the first to rely entirely on diffusion model
distillation. It comprises two key components: (1) \textbf{Multi-View Frequency
Consistency}. We enhance cross-view consistency by applying a 3D filter to
multi-view noisy latent, selectively reducing low-frequency components to
mitigate stylized prior conflicts. (2) \textbf{Controllable Stylized
Distillation}. To suppress content leakage from style images, we introduce
negative guidance to exclude undesired content. In addition, we identify the
limitations of Score Distillation Sampling and Delta Denoising Score in 3D
style transfer and remove the reconstruction term accordingly. Building on
these insights, we propose a controllable stylized distillation that leverages
negative guidance to more effectively optimize the 3D Gaussians. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches, achieving higher stylization quality and visual
realism across various scenes and styles.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: TUNA方法通过结合任务特定和通用适配器，有效提升了类增量学习的性能。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) requires a learning system to continually
learn new classes without forgetting. Existing pre-trained model-based CIL
methods often freeze the pre-trained network and adapt to incremental tasks
using additional lightweight modules such as adapters. However, incorrect
module selection during inference hurts performance, and task-specific modules
often overlook shared general knowledge, leading to errors on distinguishing
between similar classes across tasks. To address the aforementioned challenges,
we propose integrating Task-Specific and Universal Adapters (TUNA) in this
paper. Specifically, we train task-specific adapters to capture the most
crucial features relevant to their respective tasks and introduce an
entropy-based selection mechanism to choose the most suitable adapter.
Furthermore, we leverage an adapter fusion strategy to construct a universal
adapter, which encodes the most discriminative features shared across tasks. We
combine task-specific and universal adapter predictions to harness both
specialized and general knowledge during inference. Extensive experiments on
various benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our
approach. Code is available at: https://github.com/LAMDA-CL/ICCV2025-TUNA

Result: 实验显示ReconDreamer-RL优于模仿学习方法，碰撞率降低5倍。

Conclusion: 该框架有效缩小仿真与现实差距，提升自动驾驶训练效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning for training end-to-end autonomous driving models in
closed-loop simulations is gaining growing attention. However, most simulation
environments differ significantly from real-world conditions, creating a
substantial simulation-to-reality (sim2real) gap. To bridge this gap, some
approaches utilize scene reconstruction techniques to create photorealistic
environments as a simulator. While this improves realistic sensor simulation,
these methods are inherently constrained by the distribution of the training
data, making it difficult to render high-quality sensor data for novel
trajectories or corner case scenarios. Therefore, we propose ReconDreamer-RL, a
framework designed to integrate video diffusion priors into scene
reconstruction to aid reinforcement learning, thereby enhancing end-to-end
autonomous driving training. Specifically, in ReconDreamer-RL, we introduce
ReconSimulator, which combines the video diffusion prior for appearance
modeling and incorporates a kinematic model for physical modeling, thereby
reconstructing driving scenarios from real-world data. This narrows the
sim2real gap for closed-loop evaluation and reinforcement learning. To cover
more corner-case scenarios, we introduce the Dynamic Adversary Agent (DAA),
which adjusts the trajectories of surrounding vehicles relative to the ego
vehicle, autonomously generating corner-case traffic scenarios (e.g., cut-in).
Finally, the Cousin Trajectory Generator (CTG) is proposed to address the issue
of training data distribution, which is often biased toward simple
straight-line movements. Experiments show that ReconDreamer-RL improves
end-to-end autonomous driving training, outperforming imitation learning
methods with a 5x reduction in the Collision Ratio.

Conclusion: CD-TVD显著提升了大规模科学模拟的数据增强能力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Large-scale scientific simulations require significant resources to generate
high-resolution time-varying data (TVD). While super-resolution is an efficient
post-processing strategy to reduce costs, existing methods rely on a large
amount of HR training data, limiting their applicability to diverse simulation
scenarios. To address this constraint, we proposed CD-TVD, a novel framework
that combines contrastive learning and an improved diffusion-based
super-resolution model to achieve accurate 3D super-resolution from limited
time-step high-resolution data. During pre-training on historical simulation
data, the contrastive encoder and diffusion superresolution modules learn
degradation patterns and detailed features of high-resolution and
low-resolution samples. In the training phase, the improved diffusion model
with a local attention mechanism is fine-tuned using only one newly generated
high-resolution timestep, leveraging the degradation knowledge learned by the
encoder. This design minimizes the reliance on large-scale high-resolution
datasets while maintaining the capability to recover fine-grained details.
Experimental results on fluid and atmospheric simulation datasets confirm that
CD-TVD delivers accurate and resource-efficient 3D super-resolution, marking a
significant advancement in data augmentation for large-scale scientific
simulations. The code is available at

Abstract: Despite significant progress in 3D human mesh estimation from RGB images;
RGBD cameras, offering additional depth data, remain underutilized. In this
paper, we present a method for accurate 3D human mesh estimation from a single
RGBD view, leveraging the affordability and widespread adoption of RGBD cameras
for real-world applications. A fully supervised approach for this problem,
requires a dataset with RGBD image and 3D mesh label pairs. However, collecting
such a dataset is costly and challenging, hence, existing datasets are small,
and limited in pose and shape diversity. To overcome this data scarcity, we
leverage existing Motion Capture (MoCap) datasets. We first obtain complete 3D
meshes from the body models found in MoCap datasets, and create partial,
single-view versions of them by projection to a virtual camera. This simulates
the depth data provided by an RGBD camera from a single viewpoint. Then, we
train a masked autoencoder to complete the partial, single-view mesh. During
inference, our method, which we name as M$^3$ for ``Masked Mesh Modeling'',
matches the depth values coming from the sensor to vertices of a template human
mesh, which creates a partial, single-view mesh. We effectively recover parts
of the 3D human body mesh model that are not visible, resulting in a full body
mesh. M$^3$ achieves 16.8 mm and 22.0 mm per-vertex-error (PVE) on the SURREAL
and CAPE datasets, respectively; outperforming existing methods that use
full-body point clouds as input. We obtain a competitive 70.9 PVE on the BEHAVE
dataset, outperforming a recently published RGB based method by 18.4 mm,
highlighting the usefulness of depth data. Code will be released.

Conclusion: PP-Motion为运动保真度评估提供了更全面、客观的解决方案。

Abstract: Human motion generation has found widespread applications in AR/VR, film,
sports, and medical rehabilitation, offering a cost-effective alternative to
traditional motion capture systems. However, evaluating the fidelity of such
generated motions is a crucial, multifaceted task. Although previous approaches
have attempted at motion fidelity evaluation using human perception or physical
constraints, there remains an inherent gap between human-perceived fidelity and
physical feasibility. Moreover, the subjective and coarse binary labeling of
human perception further undermines the development of a robust data-driven
metric. We address these issues by introducing a physical labeling method. This
method evaluates motion fidelity by calculating the minimum modifications
needed for a motion to align with physical laws. With this approach, we are
able to produce fine-grained, continuous physical alignment annotations that
serve as objective ground truth. With these annotations, we propose PP-Motion,
a novel data-driven metric to evaluate both physical and perceptual fidelity of
human motion. To effectively capture underlying physical priors, we employ
Pearson's correlation loss for the training of our metric. Additionally, by
incorporating a human-based perceptual fidelity loss, our metric can capture
fidelity that simultaneously considers both human perception and physical
alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that our metric, PP-Motion, not
only aligns with physical laws but also aligns better with human perception of
motion fidelity than previous work.

Result: 实验表明，THAT在标准基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，提升了重建质量和效率。

Conclusion: THAT通过改进高频特征表示和令牌选择，显著提升了高光谱图像融合的性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have demonstrated strong potential in hyperspectral
pansharpening by modeling long-range dependencies. However, their effectiveness
is often limited by redundant token representations and a lack of multi-scale
feature modeling. Hyperspectral images exhibit intrinsic spectral priors (e.g.,
abundance sparsity) and spatial priors (e.g., non-local similarity), which are
critical for accurate reconstruction. From a spectral-spatial perspective,
Vision Transformers (ViTs) face two major limitations: they struggle to
preserve high-frequency components--such as material edges and texture
transitions--and suffer from attention dispersion across redundant tokens.
These issues stem from the global self-attention mechanism, which tends to
dilute high-frequency signals and overlook localized details. To address these
challenges, we propose the Token-wise High-frequency Augmentation Transformer
(THAT), a novel framework designed to enhance hyperspectral pansharpening
through improved high-frequency feature representation and token selection.
Specifically, THAT introduces: (1) Pivotal Token Selective Attention (PTSA) to
prioritize informative tokens and suppress redundancy; (2) a Multi-level
Variance-aware Feed-forward Network (MVFN) to enhance high-frequency detail
learning. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that THAT achieves
state-of-the-art performance with improved reconstruction quality and
efficiency. The source code is available at https://github.com/kailuo93/THAT.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of structural defects in civil infrastructure remains
challenging due to variable defect appearances, harsh imaging conditions, and
significant class imbalance. Current deep learning methods, despite their
effectiveness, typically require millions of parameters, rendering them
impractical for real-time inspection systems. We introduce KARMA
(Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Mapping Architecture), a highly efficient
semantic segmentation framework that models complex defect patterns through
compositions of one-dimensional functions rather than conventional
convolutions. KARMA features three technical innovations: (1) a
parameter-efficient Tiny Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (TiKAN) module leveraging
low-rank factorization for KAN-based feature transformation; (2) an optimized
feature pyramid structure with separable convolutions for multi-scale defect
analysis; and (3) a static-dynamic prototype mechanism that enhances feature
representation for imbalanced classes. Extensive experiments on benchmark
infrastructure inspection datasets demonstrate that KARMA achieves competitive
or superior mean IoU performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while
using significantly fewer parameters (0.959M vs. 31.04M, a 97% reduction).
Operating at 0.264 GFLOPS, KARMA maintains inference speeds suitable for
real-time deployment, enabling practical automated infrastructure inspection
systems without compromising accuracy. The source code can be accessed at the

Abstract: Recent advances at the intersection of reinforcement learning (RL) and visual
intelligence have enabled agents that not only perceive complex visual scenes
but also reason, generate, and act within them. This survey offers a critical
and up-to-date synthesis of the field. We first formalize visual RL problems
and trace the evolution of policy-optimization strategies from RLHF to
verifiable reward paradigms, and from Proximal Policy Optimization to Group
Relative Policy Optimization. We then organize more than 200 representative
works into four thematic pillars: multi-modal large language models, visual
generation, unified model frameworks, and vision-language-action models. For
each pillar we examine algorithmic design, reward engineering, benchmark
progress, and we distill trends such as curriculum-driven training,
preference-aligned diffusion, and unified reward modeling. Finally, we review
evaluation protocols spanning set-level fidelity, sample-level preference, and
state-level stability, and we identify open challenges that include sample
efficiency, generalization, and safe deployment. Our goal is to provide
researchers and practitioners with a coherent map of the rapidly expanding
landscape of visual RL and to highlight promising directions for future

multimodal datasets for latent-space alignment to implicitly learn spatial
relationships, they overlook the 3D capabilities of MLLMs. However, this
approach raises two issues: (1) Operating rooms typically lack multiple video
and audio sensors, making multimodal 3D data difficult to obtain; (2) Training
solely on readily available 2D data fails to capture fine-grained details in
complex scenes. To address this gap, we introduce Spatial-ORMLLM, the first
large vision-language model for 3D spatial reasoning in operating rooms using
only RGB modality to infer volumetric and semantic cues, enabling downstream
medical tasks with detailed and holistic spatial context. Spatial-ORMLLM
incorporates a Spatial-Enhanced Feature Fusion Block, which integrates 2D
modality inputs with rich 3D spatial knowledge extracted by the estimation
algorithm and then feeds the combined features into the visual tower. By
employing a unified end-to-end MLLM framework, it combines powerful spatial
features with textual features to deliver robust 3D scene reasoning without any
additional expert annotations or sensor inputs. Experiments on multiple
benchmark clinical datasets demonstrate that Spatial-ORMLLM achieves
state-of-the-art performance and generalizes robustly to previously unseen
surgical scenarios and downstream tasks.

TL;DR: SAGOnline是一个轻量级、零样本的实时3D分割框架，通过结合视频基础模型和GPU加速算法，解决了3D高斯场景中的高效分割和多目标跟踪问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D高斯场景分割方法存在计算成本高、空间推理能力有限和无法同时跟踪多目标的问题，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: SAGOnline采用两种创新方法：(1) 解耦策略结合视频基础模型（如SAM2）实现视图一致的2D掩码传播；(2) GPU加速的3D掩码生成和高斯级实例标注算法。

Result: 在NVOS和Spin-NeRF基准测试中，SAGOnline分别达到92.7%和95.2%的mIoU，推理速度比现有方法快15-1500倍（27毫秒/帧）。

Conclusion: SAGOnline为3D高斯场景提供了实时分割和多目标跟踪的解决方案，推动了AR/VR和机器人应用的发展。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for explicit
3D scene representation, yet achieving efficient and consistent 3D segmentation
remains challenging. Current methods suffer from prohibitive computational
costs, limited 3D spatial reasoning, and an inability to track multiple objects
simultaneously. We present Segment Any Gaussians Online (SAGOnline), a
lightweight and zero-shot framework for real-time 3D segmentation in Gaussian
scenes that addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) a
decoupled strategy that integrates video foundation models (e.g., SAM2) for
view-consistent 2D mask propagation across synthesized views; and (2) a
GPU-accelerated 3D mask generation and Gaussian-level instance labeling
algorithm that assigns unique identifiers to 3D primitives, enabling lossless
multi-object tracking and segmentation across views. SAGOnline achieves
state-of-the-art performance on NVOS (92.7% mIoU) and Spin-NeRF (95.2% mIoU)
benchmarks, outperforming Feature3DGS, OmniSeg3D-gs, and SA3D by 15--1500 times
in inference speed (27 ms/frame). Qualitative results demonstrate robust
multi-object segmentation and tracking in complex scenes. Our contributions
include: (i) a lightweight and zero-shot framework for 3D segmentation in
Gaussian scenes, (ii) explicit labeling of Gaussian primitives enabling
simultaneous segmentation and tracking, and (iii) the effective adaptation of
2D video foundation models to the 3D domain. This work allows real-time
rendering and 3D scene understanding, paving the way for practical AR/VR and
robotic applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多模态大语言模型的方法，通过对比偏好损失和偏好标记学习个性化用户偏好，显著提升了偏好预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖通用人类偏好或静态用户画像，忽略了用户偏好的动态性和多样性。

Method: 采用多模态大语言模型，引入对比偏好损失和偏好标记，区分用户喜好并捕捉共享兴趣表征。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在偏好预测准确性上优于其他方法，并能识别相似审美倾向的用户。

Conclusion: 该方法能更精准地生成符合个人偏好的图像，为个性化推荐提供了有效工具。

Abstract: User preference prediction requires a comprehensive and accurate
understanding of individual tastes. This includes both surface-level
attributes, such as color and style, and deeper content-related aspects, such
as themes and composition. However, existing methods typically rely on general
human preferences or assume static user profiles, often neglecting individual
variability and the dynamic, multifaceted nature of personal taste. To address
these limitations, we propose an approach built upon Multimodal Large Language
Models, introducing contrastive preference loss and preference tokens to learn
personalized user preferences from historical interactions. The contrastive
preference loss is designed to effectively distinguish between user ''likes''
and ''dislikes'', while the learnable preference tokens capture shared interest
representations among existing users, enabling the model to activate
group-specific preferences and enhance consistency across similar users.
Extensive experiments demonstrate our model outperforms other methods in
preference prediction accuracy, effectively identifying users with similar
aesthetic inclinations and providing more precise guidance for generating
images that align with individual tastes. The project page is

TL;DR: StableAvatar是一种端到端的视频扩散变换器，能够生成无限长度的高质量视频，解决了现有模型在音频同步和身份一致性上的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频驱动的虚拟化身视频生成模型难以生成长视频且音频同步和身份一致性不足。

Method: StableAvatar采用时间步感知音频适配器和音频原生引导机制，结合动态加权滑动窗口策略。

Result: 实验证明StableAvatar在质量和定量上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: StableAvatar通过创新设计解决了长视频生成中的音频同步和分布漂移问题。

Abstract: Current diffusion models for audio-driven avatar video generation struggle to
synthesize long videos with natural audio synchronization and identity
consistency. This paper presents StableAvatar, the first end-to-end video
diffusion transformer that synthesizes infinite-length high-quality videos
without post-processing. Conditioned on a reference image and audio,
StableAvatar integrates tailored training and inference modules to enable
infinite-length video generation. We observe that the main reason preventing
existing models from generating long videos lies in their audio modeling. They
typically rely on third-party off-the-shelf extractors to obtain audio
embeddings, which are then directly injected into the diffusion model via
cross-attention. Since current diffusion backbones lack any audio-related
priors, this approach causes severe latent distribution error accumulation
across video clips, leading the latent distribution of subsequent segments to
drift away from the optimal distribution gradually. To address this,
StableAvatar introduces a novel Time-step-aware Audio Adapter that prevents
error accumulation via time-step-aware modulation. During inference, we propose
a novel Audio Native Guidance Mechanism to further enhance the audio
synchronization by leveraging the diffusion's own evolving joint audio-latent
prediction as a dynamic guidance signal. To enhance the smoothness of the
infinite-length videos, we introduce a Dynamic Weighted Sliding-window Strategy
that fuses latent over time. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness
of StableAvatar both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: R3DGS任务和ReferSplat框架为3D多模态理解提供了新方向，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: We introduce Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation (R3DGS), a new task
that aims to segment target objects in a 3D Gaussian scene based on natural
language descriptions, which often contain spatial relationships or object
attributes. This task requires the model to identify newly described objects
that may be occluded or not directly visible in a novel view, posing a
significant challenge for 3D multi-modal understanding. Developing this
capability is crucial for advancing embodied AI. To support research in this
area, we construct the first R3DGS dataset, Ref-LERF. Our analysis reveals that
3D multi-modal understanding and spatial relationship modeling are key
challenges for R3DGS. To address these challenges, we propose ReferSplat, a
framework that explicitly models 3D Gaussian points with natural language
expressions in a spatially aware paradigm. ReferSplat achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both the newly proposed R3DGS task and 3D open-vocabulary
segmentation benchmarks. Dataset and code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够从静态图像想象4D场景，现有方法生成的动画常违背物理规律，导致不真实。

Method: 使用物理信息神经网络预测运动，结合Navier-Stokes方程，通过3D高斯特征捕捉外观并渲染。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能生成物理合理的动画，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法成功模拟了人类对4D场景的想象能力，为流体动画提供了新思路。

Abstract: Humans possess an exceptional ability to imagine 4D scenes, encompassing both
motion and 3D geometry, from a single still image. This ability is rooted in
our accumulated observations of similar scenes and an intuitive understanding
of physics. In this paper, we aim to replicate this capacity in neural
networks, specifically focusing on natural fluid imagery. Existing methods for
this task typically employ simplistic 2D motion estimators to animate the
image, leading to motion predictions that often defy physical principles,
resulting in unrealistic animations. Our approach introduces a novel method for
generating 4D scenes with physics-consistent animation from a single image. We
propose the use of a physics-informed neural network that predicts motion for
each surface point, guided by a loss term derived from fundamental physical
principles, including the Navier-Stokes equations. To capture appearance, we
predict feature-based 3D Gaussians from the input image and its estimated
depth, which are then animated using the predicted motions and rendered from
any desired camera perspective. Experimental results highlight the
effectiveness of our method in producing physically plausible animations,
showcasing significant performance improvements over existing methods. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 葡萄牙语领域缺乏整合外部证据的公开数据集，现有资源多依赖文本内在特征分类，限制了自动事实核查系统的发展。

Method: 采用大型语言模型（Gemini 1.5 Flash）提取文本主要主张，并通过搜索引擎API（Google Search API等）检索外部证据，同时引入数据验证和预处理框架。

Result: 开发了一种方法，能够为葡萄牙语新闻语料库（如Fake.Br）添加外部证据，并提升语料库质量。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了葡萄牙语领域SAFC系统的数据空白，为未来研究提供了实用工具。

Abstract: The accelerated dissemination of disinformation often outpaces the capacity
for manual fact-checking, highlighting the urgent need for Semi-Automated
Fact-Checking (SAFC) systems. Within the Portuguese language context, there is
a noted scarcity of publicly available datasets that integrate external
evidence, an essential component for developing robust AFC systems, as many
existing resources focus solely on classification based on intrinsic text
features. This dissertation addresses this gap by developing, applying, and
analyzing a methodology to enrich Portuguese news corpora (Fake.Br, COVID19.BR,
MuMiN-PT) with external evidence. The approach simulates a user's verification
process, employing Large Language Models (LLMs, specifically Gemini 1.5 Flash)
to extract the main claim from texts and search engine APIs (Google Search API,
Google FactCheck Claims Search API) to retrieve relevant external documents
(evidence). Additionally, a data validation and preprocessing framework,
including near-duplicate detection, is introduced to enhance the quality of the

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLMs）在少样本生物医学NER任务中的性能挑战。

Method: 采用动态提示策略，基于输入文本相似性选择上下文学习示例，并在推理过程中动态更新提示。优化了静态和动态提示技术。

Result: 静态提示使F1分数提升11-12%，动态提示进一步提升了5.6-7.3%。TF-IDF和SBERT检索方法效果最佳。

Conclusion: 上下文自适应的动态提示策略通过RAG显著提升了生物医学NER的性能。

Abstract: Biomedical named entity recognition (NER) is a high-utility natural language
processing (NLP) task, and large language models (LLMs) show promise
particularly in few-shot settings (i.e., limited training data). In this
article, we address the performance challenges of LLMs for few-shot biomedical
NER by investigating a dynamic prompting strategy involving retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG). In our approach, the annotated in-context learning examples
are selected based on their similarities with the input texts, and the prompt
is dynamically updated for each instance during inference. We implemented and
optimized static and dynamic prompt engineering techniques and evaluated them
on five biomedical NER datasets. Static prompting with structured components
increased average F1-scores by 12% for GPT-4, and 11% for GPT-3.5 and LLaMA
3-70B, relative to basic static prompting. Dynamic prompting further improved
performance, with TF-IDF and SBERT retrieval methods yielding the best results,
improving average F1-scores by 7.3% and 5.6% in 5-shot and 10-shot settings,
respectively. These findings highlight the utility of contextually adaptive
prompts via RAG for biomedical NER.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经扩展定律忽略了LLM规模扩大带来的碳排放问题，需要一种方法将模型精度与碳足迹联系起来。

Method: 通过整合神经扩展模型、GPU硬件演进、并行优化和碳排放估算，构建了CarbonScaling框架。

Result: 结果显示精度与碳排放呈幂律关系，但实际效率问题显著增加了扩展因子；硬件技术进步对小中型模型有效，但对超大型LLM效果有限。

Conclusion: CarbonScaling为训练更可持续和碳高效的LLM提供了关键见解，优化策略如批量大小调整可缓解效率问题。

Abstract: Neural scaling laws have driven the development of increasingly large
language models (LLMs) by linking accuracy improvements to growth in parameter
count, dataset size, and compute. However, these laws overlook the carbon
emissions that scale exponentially with LLM size. This paper presents
\textit{CarbonScaling}, an analytical framework that extends neural scaling
laws to incorporate both operational and embodied carbon in LLM training. By
integrating models for neural scaling, GPU hardware evolution, parallelism
optimization, and carbon estimation, \textit{CarbonScaling} quantitatively
connects model accuracy to carbon footprint. Results show that while a
power-law relationship between accuracy and carbon holds, real-world
inefficiencies significantly increase the scaling factor. Hardware technology
scaling reduces carbon emissions for small to mid-sized models, but offers
diminishing returns for extremely large LLMs due to communication overhead and
underutilized GPUs. Training optimizations-especially aggressive critical batch
size scaling-help alleviate this inefficiency. \textit{CarbonScaling} offers
key insights for training more sustainable and carbon-efficient LLMs.

Motivation: 现有tokenizer在多语言环境下效率低下，尤其是在高多样性和复杂性的Indic脚本中表现不佳。

Method: 通过系统研究词汇量、预分词规则和训练语料组成，提出了一种平衡多语言数据的新算法。

Result: 新算法将平均token-to-word比率降低了约6%，并在Indic脚本中实现了40%以上的改进。

Conclusion: tokenization是构建高效、可扩展多语言LLM的关键因素之一。

Abstract: While model architecture and training objectives are well-studied,
tokenization, particularly in multilingual contexts, remains a relatively
neglected aspect of Large Language Model (LLM) development. Existing tokenizers
often exhibit high token-to-word ratios, inefficient use of context length, and
slower inference. We present a systematic study that links vocabulary size,
pre-tokenization rules, and training-corpus composition to both token-to-word
efficiency and model quality. To ground our analysis in a linguistically
diverse context, we conduct extensive experiments on Indic scripts, which
present unique challenges due to their high script diversity and orthographic
complexity. Drawing on the insights from these analyses, we propose a novel
algorithm for data composition that balances multilingual data for tokenizer
training. Our observations on pretokenization strategies significantly improve
model performance, and our data composition algorithm reduces the average
token-to-word ratio by approximately 6% with respect to the conventional data
randomization approach. Our tokenizer achieves more than 40% improvement on
average token-to-word ratio against stateof-the-art multilingual Indic models.
This improvement yields measurable gains in both model performance and
inference speed. This highlights tokenization alongside architecture and
training objectives as a critical lever for building efficient, scalable
multilingual LLMs

<details>

Motivation: 高维文本嵌入在计算效率和成本上存在问题，需要一种方法在保留语义的同时降低维度。

Method: AEALT框架首先提取文本嵌入，然后通过监督增强的自编码器学习低维任务相关潜在因子。

Result: 实验表明，AEALT在分类、异常检测和预测任务中优于传统方法和原始嵌入。

Conclusion: AEALT是一种高效且通用的降维方法，适用于多种实际任务。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate text embeddings from text data,
producing vector representations that capture the semantic meaning and
contextual relationships of words. However, the high dimensionality of these
embeddings often impedes efficiency and drives up computational cost in
downstream tasks. To address this, we propose AutoEncoder-Augmented Learning
with Text (AEALT), a supervised, factor-augmented framework that incorporates
dimension reduction directly into pre-trained LLM workflows. First, we extract
embeddings from text documents; next, we pass them through a supervised
augmented autoencoder to learn low-dimensional, task-relevant latent factors.
By modeling the nonlinear structure of complex embeddings, AEALT outperforms
conventional deep-learning approaches that rely on raw embeddings. We validate
its broad applicability with extensive experiments on classification, anomaly
detection, and prediction tasks using multiple real-world public datasets.
Numerical results demonstrate that AEALT yields substantial gains over both
vanilla embeddings and several standard dimension reduction methods.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLMs的苏格拉底式提问能力，而忽视了其根据学习者认知状态动态调整教学策略的潜力。

Method: 研究提出了GuideEval基准，基于真实教育对话，通过感知、编排和激发三阶段行为框架评估LLMs的教学指导能力，并采用行为引导的微调策略优化模型。

Result: 实验发现现有LLMs在用户困惑或需要引导时难以提供有效支持，但行为引导的微调策略显著提升了模型的指导性能。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁从孤立的内容评估转向以学习者为中心的交互范式，为苏格拉底式LLMs的评估提供了新视角。

Abstract: The conversational capabilities of large language models hold significant
promise for enabling scalable and interactive tutoring. While prior research
has primarily examined their capacity for Socratic questioning, it often
overlooks a critical dimension: adaptively guiding learners based on their
cognitive states. This study shifts focus from mere question generation to the
broader instructional guidance capability. We ask: Can LLMs emulate expert
tutors who dynamically adjust strategies in response to learners'
understanding? To investigate this, we propose GuideEval, a benchmark grounded
in authentic educational dialogues that evaluates pedagogical guidance through
a three-phase behavioral framework: (1) Perception, inferring learner states;
(2) Orchestration, adapting instructional strategies; and (3) Elicitation,
stimulating proper reflections. Empirical findings reveal that existing LLMs
frequently fail to provide effective adaptive scaffolding when learners exhibit
confusion or require redirection. Furthermore, we introduce a behavior-guided
finetuning strategy that leverages behavior-prompted instructional dialogues,
significantly enhancing guidance performance. By shifting the focus from
isolated content evaluation to learner-centered interaction, our work advocates
a more dialogic paradigm for evaluating Socratic LLMs.

Result: 实验表明，合成数据集在遗忘生物安全、网络安全和哈利波特小说等任务中优于基线方法，且与专家策划的数据集相当。

Conclusion: 合成数据集为广泛新兴领域的实用、可扩展遗忘技术提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Modern large language models often encode sensitive, harmful, or copyrighted
knowledge, raising the need for post-hoc unlearning-the ability to remove
specific domains of knowledge from a model without full retraining. A major
bottleneck in current unlearning pipelines is constructing effective forget
sets-datasets that approximate the target domain and guide the model to forget
it. In this work, we introduce a scalable, automated approach to generate
high-quality forget sets using language models themselves. Our method
synthesizes textbook-style data through a structured prompting pipeline,
requiring only a domain name as input. Through experiments on unlearning
biosecurity, cybersecurity, and Harry Potter novels, we show that our synthetic
datasets consistently outperform the baseline synthetic alternatives and are
comparable to the expert-curated ones. Additionally, ablation studies reveal
that the multi-step generation pipeline significantly boosts data diversity,
which in turn improves unlearning utility. Overall, our findings suggest that
synthetic datasets offer a promising path toward practical, scalable unlearning
for a wide range of emerging domains without the need for manual intervention.

Motivation: 现有基准测试（如BrowseComp）使用动态且不透明的网络API，导致公平性和透明度问题，无法有效评估深度研究LLM的能力。

Method: 提出BrowseComp-Plus，基于固定、精选的文档库，包含人工验证的支持文档和挑战性负面样本，支持控制实验。

Conclusion: BrowseComp-Plus为深度研究代理和检索方法的评估提供了全面且可控的实验环境，有助于分析检索效果和引用准确性。

Abstract: Deep-Research agents, which integrate large language models (LLMs) with
search tools, have shown success in improving the effectiveness of handling
complex queries that require iterative search planning and reasoning over
search results. Evaluations on current benchmarks like BrowseComp relies on
black-box live web search APIs, have notable limitations in (1) fairness:
dynamic and opaque web APIs hinder fair comparisons and reproducibility of deep
research methods; (2) transparency: lack of control over the document corpus
makes it difficult to isolate retriever contributions. In other words, the
current evaluations may compare a complete deep research system at a given
time, but they do not foster well-controlled experiments to provide insights
into the capability of underlying deep research LLMs. To address these
challenges, we introduce BrowseComp-Plus, a benchmark derived from BrowseComp,
employing a fixed, carefully curated corpus. Each query in BrowseComp-Plus
includes human-verified supporting documents and mined challenging negatives,
enabling controlled experimentation. The benchmark is shown to be effective in
distinguishing the performance of deep research systems. For instance, the
open-source model Search-R1, when paired with the BM25 retriever, achieves
3.86% accuracy, whereas the GPT-5 achieves 55.9%. Integrating the GPT-5 with
the Qwen3-Embedding-8B retriever further enhances its accuracy to 70.1% with
fewer search calls. This benchmark allows comprehensive evaluation and
disentangled analysis of deep research agents and retrieval methods, fostering
insights into retrieval effectiveness, citation accuracy, and context
engineering in Deep-Research system.

Method: 研究两类BPE推断算法：目标性偏离合并列表（如随机合并顺序或合并列表损坏）和非目标性算法（不依赖合并列表的贪婪或精确压缩）。

Result: 目标性偏离显著降低性能，而非目标性算法对性能影响极小。

Conclusion: 非目标性算法提供了一种简单且隐私保护的标记化方案，性能影响可忽略。

Abstract: Standard Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization compresses text by pairing a
learned token vocabulary with a detailed merge list. Recent work has shown that
this merge list exposes a potential attack surface for extracting information
about language model's training data. In this paper, we explore the downstream
impact of BPE inference algorithms that do not rely on this merge list at all,
and hence differ from the encoding process during BPE training. To address this
question, we investigate two broad classes of BPE inference schemes that differ
from BPE application during training: a) targeted deviation from merge-lists
including random merge orders, and various corruptions of merge list involving
deletion/truncation, and b) non-targeted BPE inference algorithms that do not
depend on the merge list but focus on compressing the text either greedily or
exactly. Extensive experiments across diverse language modeling tasks like
accuracy-based QA benchmarks, machine translation, and open-ended generation
reveal that while targeted deviation from the merge lists exhibits significant
degradation in language model performance, the non-targeted merge-list-free
inference algorithms result in minimal impact on downstream performance that is
often much smaller than expected. These findings pave way for simpler and
potentially more privacy-preserving tokenization schemes that do not
catastrophically compromise model performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在生成内容中表现出的两种偏差及其潜在风险。

Method: 通过让四种先进LLMs生成个人资料，分析其与政治、宗教等属性的关联。

Result: 所有测试的LLMs均对多群体表现出显著的刻板印象和偏离偏差。

Conclusion: 揭示了LLMs在推断用户属性时的偏差及其潜在危害。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely applied across diverse domains,
raising concerns about their limitations and potential risks. In this study, we
investigate two types of bias that LLMs may display: stereotype bias and
deviation bias. Stereotype bias refers to when LLMs consistently associate
specific traits with a particular demographic group. Deviation bias reflects
the disparity between the demographic distributions extracted from
LLM-generated content and real-world demographic distributions. By asking four
advanced LLMs to generate profiles of individuals, we examine the associations
between each demographic group and attributes such as political affiliation,
religion, and sexual orientation. Our experimental results show that all
examined LLMs exhibit both significant stereotype bias and deviation bias
towards multiple groups. Our findings uncover the biases that occur when LLMs
infer user attributes and shed light on the potential harms of LLM-generated
outputs.

*Jonathan Shaw,Dillon Mee,Timothy Khouw,Zackary Leech,Daniel Wilson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何利用语言资源（如语法、词典和平行句子）提升LLM在低资源语言（如Kanuri）中的翻译质量，发现平行句子效果最佳，而语法单独使用效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kanuri语言虽使用者众多但数字资源匮乏，研究旨在探索如何通过语言资源提升LLM在该语言中的翻译表现。

Method: 设计两个数据集（健康和通用术语），提供不同语言资源组合（语法、词典、平行句子），对比LLM翻译与人工翻译的效果。

Result: 平行句子效果最好，语法虽优于零样本翻译但单独使用不足；LLM在准确性上优于流畅性。

Conclusion: LLM翻译需多维评估，仅语法无法有效支持领域特定翻译，平行句子是关键资源。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art models demonstrate capacity to leverage in-context
learning to translate into previously unseen language contexts. Tanzer et al.
[2024] utilize language materials (e.g. a grammar) to improve translation
quality for Kalamang using large language models (LLMs). We focus on Kanuri, a
language that, despite having substantial speaker population, has minimal
digital resources. We design two datasets for evaluation: one focused on health
and humanitarian terms, and another containing generalized terminology,
investigating how domain-specific tasks impact LLM translation quality.
  By providing different combinations of language resources (grammar,
dictionary, and parallel sentences), we measure LLM translation effectiveness,
comparing results to native speaker translations and human linguist
performance. We evaluate using both automatic metrics and native speaker
assessments of fluency and accuracy.
  Results demonstrate that parallel sentences remain the most effective data
source, outperforming other methods in human evaluations and automatic metrics.
While incorporating grammar improves over zero-shot translation, it fails as an
effective standalone data source. Human evaluations reveal that LLMs achieve
accuracy (meaning) more effectively than fluency (grammaticality).
  These findings suggest LLM translation evaluation benefits from
multidimensional assessment beyond simple accuracy metrics, and that grammar
alone, without parallel sentences, does not provide sufficient context for
effective domain-specific translation.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了链式思维提示对语言模型公平性的影响，发现模型思维步骤中的偏见与输出偏见的关联性较低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型存在性别、种族等偏见，研究旨在探索模型思维步骤是否也存在偏见。

Method: 使用公平性指标对5种大型语言模型的思维步骤和输出进行偏见量化分析。

Result: 模型思维步骤中的偏见与输出偏见的关联性较低（相关性小于0.6）。

Conclusion: 与人类不同，测试模型即使输出有偏见，思维步骤也不一定存在偏见。

Abstract: The impressive performance of language models is undeniable. However, the
presence of biases based on gender, race, socio-economic status, physical
appearance, and sexual orientation makes the deployment of language models
challenging. This paper studies the effect of chain-of-thought prompting, a
recent approach that studies the steps followed by the model before it
responds, on fairness. More specifically, we ask the following question:
\textit{Do biased models have biased thoughts}? To answer our question, we
conduct experiments on $5$ popular large language models using fairness metrics
to quantify $11$ different biases in the model's thoughts and output. Our
results show that the bias in the thinking steps is not highly correlated with
the output bias (less than $0.6$ correlation with a $p$-value smaller than
$0.001$ in most cases). In other words, unlike human beings, the tested models
with biased decisions do not always possess biased thoughts.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种统计框架，用于识别和量化LLM作为评委时的自我偏见，确保真实性能差异不被误认为偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为评委时可能对自身输出评分过高（自我偏见），导致模型性能评估失真，需明确区分偏见与真实差异。

Method: 开发统计框架，建模LLM评委对自身与其他模型输出的评分分布差异，并引入第三方评委（如人类）作为参考。

Result: 实证分析显示，某些LLM（如GPT-4o和Claude 3.5 Sonnet）存在自我偏见和家族偏见。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM评委的潜在问题，并提供了减少偏见的实用建议。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can serve as judges that offer rapid and
reliable assessments of other LLM outputs. However, models may systematically
assign overly favorable ratings to their own outputs, a phenomenon known as
self-bias, which can distort evaluations of true model performance. Previous
studies often conflate genuine differences in model quality with bias or
incorrectly assume that evaluations from LLMs and humans follow the same rating
distributions. In this work, we present a statistical framework that explicitly
formalizes assumptions under which self-bias can be identified and estimated.
Our method models the difference in the scoring distribution that
LLM-as-a-judge assigns to its own completions compared to other models, while
accounting for the underlying quality of the completions provided by an
independent, third-party judge (e.g., humans). Our method reliably isolates and
quantifies self-bias, even when models vary in ability, ensuring that genuine
performance differences are not mistaken for self-bias. We conduct an empirical
analysis of self-bias on a large dataset (>5000 prompt-completion pairs)
consisting of expert human annotations and judgments from nine different LLM
judges. We find that some models, such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet,
systematically assign higher scores to their own outputs. These models also
display family-bias; systematically assigning higher ratings to outputs
produced by other models of the same family. Our findings highlight potential
pitfalls of using LLM judges and offer practical guidance to mitigate biases
when interpreting automated evaluations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种可扩展的框架，利用LLMs（如ChatGPT、Llama和Qwen）自动对日裔美国人监禁口述历史进行语义和情感标注，并通过多阶段方法验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 口述历史是记录系统性不公和历史抹除的重要资料，但其大规模分析因非结构化格式、情感复杂性和高标注成本而受限。

Method: 结合专家标注、提示设计和LLM评估（ChatGPT、Llama、Qwen），采用零样本、少样本和RAG策略，标注了558句话并评估模型性能。

Result: ChatGPT在语义分类中表现最佳（F1 88.71%），Llama在情感分析中略优（82.66%）。最终标注了92,191句话。

Conclusion: LLMs在精心设计的提示下可有效标注大规模口述历史，为文化敏感的档案分析提供了可复用的流程和实用指南。

Abstract: Oral histories are vital records of lived experience, particularly within
communities affected by systemic injustice and historical erasure. Effective
and efficient analysis of their oral history archives can promote access and
understanding of the oral histories. However, Large-scale analysis of these
archives remains limited due to their unstructured format, emotional
complexity, and high annotation costs. This paper presents a scalable framework
to automate semantic and sentiment annotation for Japanese American
Incarceration Oral History. Using LLMs, we construct a high-quality dataset,
evaluate multiple models, and test prompt engineering strategies in
historically sensitive contexts. Our multiphase approach combines expert
annotation, prompt design, and LLM evaluation with ChatGPT, Llama, and Qwen. We
labeled 558 sentences from 15 narrators for sentiment and semantic
classification, then evaluated zero-shot, few-shot, and RAG strategies. For
semantic classification, ChatGPT achieved the highest F1 score (88.71%),
followed by Llama (84.99%) and Qwen (83.72%). For sentiment analysis, Llama
slightly outperformed Qwen (82.66%) and ChatGPT (82.29%), with all models
showing comparable results. The best prompt configurations were used to
annotate 92,191 sentences from 1,002 interviews in the JAIOH collection. Our
findings show that LLMs can effectively perform semantic and sentiment
annotation across large oral history collections when guided by well-designed
prompts. This study provides a reusable annotation pipeline and practical
guidance for applying LLMs in culturally sensitive archival analysis. By
bridging archival ethics with scalable NLP techniques, this work lays the
groundwork for responsible use of artificial intelligence in digital humanities
and preservation of collective memory. GitHub:

TL;DR: 论文提出多轮越狱攻击（multi-turn jailbreaking），并构建了MTJ-Bench基准测试，揭示了LLMs在多轮对话中的新安全威胁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有越狱研究仅关注单轮攻击，而LLMs能处理多轮对话，因此需探索多轮越狱的潜在威胁。

Method: 构建MTJ-Bench基准测试，用于评估开源和闭源模型在多轮越狱中的表现。

Result: 揭示了LLMs在多轮对话中的新安全漏洞。

Conclusion: 呼吁社区关注多轮越狱威胁，推动构建更安全的LLMs。

Abstract: Current jailbreaking work on large language models (LLMs) aims to elicit
unsafe outputs from given prompts. However, it only focuses on single-turn
jailbreaking targeting one specific query. On the contrary, the advanced LLMs
are designed to handle extremely long contexts and can thus conduct multi-turn
conversations. So, we propose exploring multi-turn jailbreaking, in which the
jailbroken LLMs are continuously tested on more than the first-turn
conversation or a single target query. This is an even more serious threat
because 1) it is common for users to continue asking relevant follow-up
questions to clarify certain jailbroken details, and 2) it is also possible
that the initial round of jailbreaking causes the LLMs to respond to additional
irrelevant questions consistently. As the first step (First draft done at June
2024) in exploring multi-turn jailbreaking, we construct a Multi-Turn Jailbreak
Benchmark (MTJ-Bench) for benchmarking this setting on a series of open- and
closed-source models and provide novel insights into this new safety threat. By
revealing this new vulnerability, we aim to call for community efforts to build
safer LLMs and pave the way for a more in-depth understanding of jailbreaking
LLMs.

Abstract: Sarcasm detection is a crucial yet challenging Natural Language Processing
task. Existing Large Language Model methods are often limited by
single-perspective analysis, static reasoning pathways, and a susceptibility to
hallucination when processing complex ironic rhetoric, which impacts their
accuracy and reliability. To address these challenges, we propose **SEVADE**, a
novel **S**elf-**Ev**olving multi-agent **A**nalysis framework with
**D**ecoupled **E**valuation for hallucination-resistant sarcasm detection. The
core of our framework is a Dynamic Agentive Reasoning Engine (DARE), which
utilizes a team of specialized agents grounded in linguistic theory to perform
a multifaceted deconstruction of the text and generate a structured reasoning
chain. Subsequently, a separate lightweight rationale adjudicator (RA) performs
the final classification based solely on this reasoning chain. This decoupled
architecture is designed to mitigate the risk of hallucination by separating
complex reasoning from the final judgment. Extensive experiments on four
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with average improvements of **6.75%** in Accuracy and **6.29%**
in Macro-F1 score.

Result: 开发了数据集并比较了不同系统的性能，教师评估了反馈的相关性、准确性和可理解性。

Conclusion: 研究为语言学习提供了更有效的反馈生成方法，支持学习者理解语法规则。

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have contributed to the
development of automated writing evaluation (AWE) systems that can correct
grammatical errors. However, while these systems are effective at improving
text, they are not optimally designed for language learning. They favor direct
revisions, often with a click-to-fix functionality that can be applied without
considering the reason for the correction. Meanwhile, depending on the error
type, learners may benefit most from simple explanations and strategically
indirect hints, especially on generalizable grammatical rules. To support the
generation of such feedback, we introduce an annotation framework that models
each error's error type and generalizability. For error type classification, we
introduce a typology focused on inferring learners' knowledge gaps by
connecting their errors to specific grammatical patterns. Following this
framework, we collect a dataset of annotated learner errors and corresponding
human-written feedback comments, each labeled as a direct correction or hint.
With this data, we evaluate keyword-guided, keyword-free, and template-guided
methods of generating feedback using large language models (LLMs). Human
teachers examined each system's outputs, assessing them on grounds including
relevance, factuality, and comprehensibility. We report on the development of
the dataset and the comparative performance of the systems investigated.

Conclusion: 提供了一种高效、可解释且可扩展的多源NER语料库整合方案。

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental task in natural language
processing. It remains a research hotspot due to its wide applicability across
domains. Although recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved
NER performance, they rely heavily on large, high-quality annotated datasets.
However, building these datasets is expensive and time-consuming, posing a
major bottleneck for further research. Current dataset merging approaches
mainly focus on strategies like manual label mapping or constructing label
graphs, which lack interpretability and scalability. To address this, we
propose an automatic label alignment method based on label similarity. The
method combines empirical and semantic similarities, using a greedy pairwise
merging strategy to unify label spaces across different datasets. Experiments
are conducted in two stages: first, merging three existing NER datasets into a
unified corpus with minimal impact on NER performance; second, integrating this
corpus with a small-scale, self-built dataset in the financial domain. The
results show that our method enables effective dataset merging and enhances NER
performance in the low-resource financial domain. This study presents an
efficient, interpretable, and scalable solution for integrating multi-source
NER corpora.

Conclusion: ReQAP通过透明化的答案追踪机制，提升了系统的可理解性和用户信任度。

Abstract: Personal information is abundant on users' devices, from structured data in
calendar, shopping records or fitness tools, to unstructured contents in mail

users with answers for complex questions that involve filters, joins and
aggregation over heterogeneous sources. The unique trait of ReQAP is that it
recursively decomposes questions and incrementally builds an operator tree for
execution. Both the question interpretation and the individual operators make
smart use of light-weight language models, with judicious fine-tuning. The demo
showcases the rich functionality for advanced user questions, and also offers
detailed tracking of how the answers are computed by the operators in the
execution tree. Being able to trace answers back to the underlying sources is
vital for human comprehensibility and user trust in the system.

Result: 在PERSONA-CHAT和ConvAI2数据集上，SBS显著提升了角色一致性对话生成效果。

Conclusion: SBS框架通过评分条件训练，有效提升了对话模型在角色一致性方面的表现。

Abstract: Persona-based dialogue generation is an important milestone towards building
conversational artificial intelligence. Despite the ever-improving capabilities
of large language models (LLMs), effectively integrating persona fidelity in
conversations remains challenging due to the limited diversity in existing
dialogue data. We propose a novel framework SBS (Score-Before-Speaking), which
outperforms previous methods and yields improvements for both million and
billion-parameter models. Unlike previous methods, SBS unifies the learning of
responses and their relative quality into a single step. The key innovation is
to train a dialogue model to correlate augmented responses with a quality score
during training and then leverage this knowledge at inference. We use
noun-based substitution for augmentation and semantic similarity-based scores
as a proxy for response quality. Through extensive experiments with benchmark
datasets (PERSONA-CHAT and ConvAI2), we show that score-conditioned training
allows existing models to better capture a spectrum of persona-consistent
dialogues. Our ablation studies also demonstrate that including scores in the
input prompt during training is superior to conventional training setups. Code

Result: 在多个数据集和LLM上表现优越，F1分数提升显著，且对干扰更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SentiDetect为检测LLM生成文本提供了高效且鲁棒的新方法。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has resulted in
increasingly sophisticated AI-generated content, posing significant challenges
in distinguishing LLM-generated text from human-written language. Existing
detection methods, primarily based on lexical heuristics or fine-tuned
classifiers, often suffer from limited generalizability and are vulnerable to
paraphrasing, adversarial perturbations, and cross-domain shifts. In this work,
we propose SentiDetect, a model-agnostic framework for detecting LLM-generated
text by analyzing the divergence in sentiment distribution stability. Our
method is motivated by the empirical observation that LLM outputs tend to
exhibit emotionally consistent patterns, whereas human-written texts display
greater emotional variability. To capture this phenomenon, we define two
complementary metrics: sentiment distribution consistency and sentiment
distribution preservation, which quantify stability under sentiment-altering
and semantic-preserving transformations. We evaluate SentiDetect on five
diverse datasets and a range of advanced LLMs,including Gemini-1.5-Pro,
Claude-3, GPT-4-0613, and LLaMa-3.3. Experimental results demonstrate its
superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, with over 16% and 11% F1 score
improvements on Gemini-1.5-Pro and GPT-4-0613, respectively. Moreover,
SentiDetect also shows greater robustness to paraphrasing, adversarial attacks,
and text length variations, outperforming existing detectors in challenging
scenarios.

Abstract: Quranic Question Answering presents unique challenges due to the linguistic
complexity of Classical Arabic and the semantic richness of religious texts. In
this paper, we propose a novel two-stage framework that addresses both passage

Arabic language models to achieve superior ranking performance. For answer
extraction, we employ instruction-tuned large language models with few-shot
prompting to overcome the limitations of fine-tuning on small datasets. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the Quran QA 2023 Shared Task,
with a MAP@10 of 0.3128 and MRR@10 of 0.5763 for retrieval, and a pAP@10 of

Result: 实验表明，该方法在不同规模的LLM上优于现有方法，实现了高性能的1-bit LLM。

Conclusion: 通过利用预训练模型，该方法避免了昂贵的从头训练，实现了高效的1-bit量化。

Abstract: 1-bit LLM quantization offers significant advantages in reducing storage and
computational costs. However, existing methods typically train 1-bit LLMs from
scratch, failing to fully leverage pre-trained models. This results in high
training costs and notable accuracy degradation. We identify that the large gap
between full precision and 1-bit representations makes direct adaptation
difficult. In this paper, we introduce a consistent progressive training for
both forward and backward, smoothly converting the floating-point weights into
the binarized ones. Additionally, we incorporate binary-aware initialization
and dual-scaling compensation to reduce the difficulty of progressive training
and improve the performance. Experimental results on LLMs of various sizes
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches. Our results show
that high-performance 1-bit LLMs can be achieved using pre-trained models,
eliminating the need for expensive training from scratch.

using a single mean vector in the semantic embedding space, capturing the
central meaning of the corpus. To reconstruct fluent summaries, we perform
embedding inversion -- decoding this mean vector into natural language using a
generative language model. To improve reconstruction quality and capture some
degree of topical variability, we introduce stochasticity by sampling from a
Gaussian distribution centered on the mean. This approach is loosely analogous
to bagging in ensemble learning, where controlled randomness encourages more
robust and varied outputs. Vec2Summ addresses key limitations of LLM-based
summarization methods. It avoids context-length constraints, enables
interpretable and controllable generation via semantic parameters, and scales
efficiently with corpus size -- requiring only $O(d + d^2)$ parameters.
Empirical results show that Vec2Summ produces coherent summaries for topically
focused, order-invariant corpora, with performance comparable to direct LLM
summarization in terms of thematic coverage and efficiency, albeit with less
fine-grained detail. These results underscore Vec2Summ's potential in settings
where scalability, semantic control, and corpus-level abstraction are
prioritized.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了BharatBBQ，一个针对印度多语言环境的文化适应基准，用于评估语言模型中的社会偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏见评估基准主要关注西方语境，缺乏对印度多语言和文化背景的适用性。

Method: 开发了涵盖8种语言和13个社会类别的BharatBBQ数据集，并通过翻译和验证扩展了样本数量。评估了5种多语言模型在零样本和少样本设置下的偏见表现。

Result: 研究发现语言模型在印度语言中的偏见比英语更显著，且跨语言和社会类别存在持续偏见。

Conclusion: 强调需要基于语言和文化背景的偏见评估基准，以确保AI系统的公平性。

Abstract: Evaluating social biases in language models (LMs) is crucial for ensuring
fairness and minimizing the reinforcement of harmful stereotypes in AI systems.
Existing benchmarks, such as the Bias Benchmark for Question Answering (BBQ),
primarily focus on Western contexts, limiting their applicability to the Indian
context. To address this gap, we introduce BharatBBQ, a culturally adapted
benchmark designed to assess biases in Hindi, English, Marathi, Bengali, Tamil,
Telugu, Odia, and Assamese. BharatBBQ covers 13 social categories, including 3
intersectional groups, reflecting prevalent biases in the Indian sociocultural
landscape. Our dataset contains 49,108 examples in one language that are
expanded using translation and verification to 392,864 examples in eight
different languages. We evaluate five multilingual LM families across zero and
few-shot settings, analyzing their bias and stereotypical bias scores. Our
findings highlight persistent biases across languages and social categories and
often amplified biases in Indian languages compared to English, demonstrating
the necessity of linguistically and culturally grounded benchmarks for bias
evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LessIsMore是一种无需训练的稀疏注意力机制，通过全局注意力模式提升推理任务的效率和准确性，减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏注意力方法在长生成推理中因累积误差导致准确性下降，且需要高令牌保留率或昂贵重训练。

Method: LessIsMore利用全局注意力模式，聚合局部注意力头的令牌选择与上下文信息，实现跨头令牌统一排名。

Result: 在多种推理任务中，LessIsMore保持或提升准确性，解码速度平均提升1.1倍，令牌关注数减少2倍。

Conclusion: LessIsMore显著提升推理任务的效率和准确性，优于现有稀疏注意力方法。

Abstract: Large reasoning models achieve strong performance through test-time scaling
but incur substantial computational overhead, particularly from excessive token
generation when processing short input prompts. While sparse attention
mechanisms can reduce latency and memory usage, existing approaches suffer from
significant accuracy degradation due to accumulated errors during
long-generation reasoning. These methods generally require either high token
retention rates or expensive retraining. We introduce LessIsMore, a
training-free sparse attention mechanism for reasoning tasks, which leverages
global attention patterns rather than relying on traditional head-specific
local optimizations. LessIsMore aggregates token selections from local
attention heads with recent contextual information, enabling unified cross-head
token ranking for future decoding layers. This unified selection improves
generalization and efficiency by avoiding the need to maintain separate token
subsets per head. Evaluation across diverse reasoning tasks and benchmarks
shows that LessIsMore preserves -- and in some cases improves -- accuracy while
achieving a $1.1\times$ average decoding speed-up compared to full attention.
Moreover, LessIsMore attends to $2\times$ fewer tokens without accuracy loss,
achieving a $1.13\times$ end-to-end speed-up compared to existing sparse
attention methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在交叉性偏见中的表现，提出了新的评估基准WinoIdentity和度量方法Coreference Confidence Disparity，发现模型对弱势群体的不确定性更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在资源受限场景中广泛应用，但其可能加剧社会偏见，尤其是在交叉性身份中。现有研究多关注单一维度偏见，缺乏对交叉性偏见的评估。

Method: 通过扩展WinoBias数据集，创建包含25个人口统计标记的WinoIdentity基准，评估50种偏见模式。提出Coreference Confidence Disparity度量模型对不同交叉性身份的置信度差异。

Result: 评估五个LLMs发现，模型在某些交叉性身份（如双重弱势群体）中置信度差异高达40%，且对特权标记的置信度也下降，表明其表现可能依赖记忆而非逻辑推理。

Conclusion: LLMs在价值对齐和有效性上存在独立缺陷，可能导致社会危害，需进一步改进以减少交叉性偏见。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance, leading to
their widespread adoption as decision-support tools in resource-constrained
contexts like hiring and admissions. There is, however, scientific consensus
that AI systems can reflect and exacerbate societal biases, raising concerns
about identity-based harm when used in critical social contexts. Prior work has
laid a solid foundation for assessing bias in LLMs by evaluating demographic
disparities in different language reasoning tasks. In this work, we extend
single-axis fairness evaluations to examine intersectional bias, recognizing
that when multiple axes of discrimination intersect, they create distinct
patterns of disadvantage. We create a new benchmark called WinoIdentity by
augmenting the WinoBias dataset with 25 demographic markers across 10
attributes, including age, nationality, and race, intersected with binary
gender, yielding 245,700 prompts to evaluate 50 distinct bias patterns.
Focusing on harms of omission due to underrepresentation, we investigate bias
through the lens of uncertainty and propose a group (un)fairness metric called
Coreference Confidence Disparity which measures whether models are more or less
confident for some intersectional identities than others. We evaluate five
recently published LLMs and find confidence disparities as high as 40% along
various demographic attributes including body type, sexual orientation and
socio-economic status, with models being most uncertain about
doubly-disadvantaged identities in anti-stereotypical settings. Surprisingly,
coreference confidence decreases even for hegemonic or privileged markers,
indicating that the recent impressive performance of LLMs is more likely due to
memorization than logical reasoning. Notably, these are two independent
failures in value alignment and validity that can compound to cause social
harm.

Motivation: 研究ASR系统的公平性，揭示其对非标准方言使用者的不公影响，并呼吁技术应尊重语言多样性。

Method: 通过哲学视角分析ASR偏见的伦理维度，区分技术分类与有害歧视，提出三个独特伦理问题。

Result: 发现ASR偏见导致时间负担、对话中断和身份认同问题，现有公平性指标无法完全捕捉。

Conclusion: 解决ASR偏见需技术改进与对语言多样性的认可，呼吁开发尊重多样性的系统。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems now mediate countless
human-technology interactions, yet research on their fairness implications
remains surprisingly limited. This paper examines ASR bias through a
philosophical lens, arguing that systematic misrecognition of certain speech
varieties constitutes more than a technical limitation -- it represents a form
of disrespect that compounds historical injustices against marginalized
linguistic communities. We distinguish between morally neutral classification
(discriminate1) and harmful discrimination (discriminate2), demonstrating how
ASR systems can inadvertently transform the former into the latter when they
consistently misrecognize non-standard dialects. We identify three unique
ethical dimensions of speech technologies that differentiate ASR bias from
other algorithmic fairness concerns: the temporal burden placed on speakers of
non-standard varieties ("temporal taxation"), the disruption of conversational
flow when systems misrecognize speech, and the fundamental connection between
speech patterns and personal/cultural identity. These factors create asymmetric
power relationships that existing technical fairness metrics fail to capture.
The paper analyzes the tension between linguistic standardization and pluralism
in ASR development, arguing that current approaches often embed and reinforce
problematic language ideologies. We conclude that addressing ASR bias requires
more than technical interventions; it demands recognition of diverse speech
varieties as legitimate forms of expression worthy of technological
accommodation. This philosophical reframing offers new pathways for developing
ASR systems that respect linguistic diversity and speaker autonomy.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SafeGrad的新方法，通过梯度手术解决恶意样本在微调数据集中破坏LLM安全对齐的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在高有害比例下防御能力急剧下降，原因是用户任务梯度与安全目标梯度冲突。

Method: SafeGrad通过检测冲突并将用户任务梯度投影到对齐梯度的正交平面，消除有害成分，同时采用KL散度对齐损失增强鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，SafeGrad在高有害比例下仍能保持安全性和任务性能。

Conclusion: SafeGrad为LLM安全微调提供了先进的防御方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning-as-a-Service introduces a critical vulnerability where a few
malicious examples mixed into the user's fine-tuning dataset can compromise the
safety alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs). While a recognized paradigm
frames safe fine-tuning as a multi-objective optimization problem balancing
user task performance with safety alignment, we find existing solutions are
critically sensitive to the harmful ratio, with defenses degrading sharply as
harmful ratio increases. We diagnose that this failure stems from conflicting
gradients, where the user-task update directly undermines the safety objective.
To resolve this, we propose SafeGrad, a novel method that employs gradient
surgery. When a conflict is detected, SafeGrad nullifies the harmful component
of the user-task gradient by projecting it onto the orthogonal plane of the
alignment gradient, allowing the model to learn the user's task without
sacrificing safety. To further enhance robustness and data efficiency, we
employ a KL-divergence alignment loss that learns the rich, distributional
safety profile of the well-aligned foundation model. Extensive experiments show
that SafeGrad provides state-of-the-art defense across various LLMs and
datasets, maintaining robust safety even at high harmful ratios without
compromising task fidelity.

TL;DR: Omni-SafetyBench是首个针对全模态大语言模型（OLLMs）安全评估的综合基准，填补了现有评估工具的空白，并揭示了OLLMs在复杂多模态输入下的安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏专门评估OLLMs安全性的基准，且现有基准无法评估音频-视觉联合输入或跨模态安全一致性。

Method: 提出Omni-SafetyBench，包含24种模态组合和972个样本，并设计Safety-score和CMSC-score两种指标。

Result: 评估显示OLLMs在整体安全性和一致性上表现不佳，复杂输入下防御能力下降，部分模态得分极低。

Conclusion: 该研究为OLLMs安全性改进提供了基础，凸显了增强安全性的紧迫性。

Abstract: The rise of Omni-modal Large Language Models (OLLMs), which integrate visual
and auditory processing with text, necessitates robust safety evaluations to
mitigate harmful outputs. However, no dedicated benchmarks currently exist for
OLLMs, and prior benchmarks designed for other LLMs lack the ability to assess
safety performance under audio-visual joint inputs or cross-modal safety
consistency. To fill this gap, we introduce Omni-SafetyBench, the first
comprehensive parallel benchmark for OLLM safety evaluation, featuring 24
modality combinations and variations with 972 samples each, including dedicated
audio-visual harm cases. Considering OLLMs' comprehension challenges with
complex omni-modal inputs and the need for cross-modal consistency evaluation,
we propose tailored metrics: a Safety-score based on conditional Attack Success
Rate (C-ASR) and Refusal Rate (C-RR) to account for comprehension failures, and
a Cross-Modal Safety Consistency Score (CMSC-score) to measure consistency
across modalities. Evaluating 6 open-source and 4 closed-source OLLMs reveals
critical vulnerabilities: (1) no model excels in both overall safety and
consistency, with only 3 models achieving over 0.6 in both metrics and top
performer scoring around 0.8; (2) safety defenses weaken with complex inputs,
especially audio-visual joints; (3) severe weaknesses persist, with some models
scoring as low as 0.14 on specific modalities. Our benchmark and metrics
highlight urgent needs for enhanced OLLM safety, providing a foundation for
future improvements.

Motivation: 现有方法未能有效处理历史点击流中的噪声，导致生成的标题偏离用户真实兴趣。

Method: PHG-DIF采用双阶段过滤去除噪声，并结合多级时间融合动态建模用户兴趣。

Result: 实验表明PHG-DIF显著减少了噪声影响，在DT-PENS数据集上达到SOTA效果。

Conclusion: PHG-DIF通过去噪和动态兴趣建模，显著提升了个性化标题生成的准确性。

Abstract: Accurate personalized headline generation hinges on precisely capturing user
interests from historical behaviors. However, existing methods neglect
personalized-irrelevant click noise in entire historical clickstreams, which
may lead to hallucinated headlines that deviate from genuine user preferences.
In this paper, we reveal the detrimental impact of click noise on personalized
generation quality through rigorous analysis in both user and news dimensions.
Based on these insights, we propose a novel Personalized Headline Generation
framework via Denoising Fake Interests from Implicit Feedback (PHG-DIF).
PHG-DIF first employs dual-stage filtering to effectively remove clickstream
noise, identified by short dwell times and abnormal click bursts, and then
leverages multi-level temporal fusion to dynamically model users' evolving and
multi-faceted interests for precise profiling. Moreover, we release DT-PENS, a
new benchmark dataset comprising the click behavior of 1,000 carefully curated
users and nearly 10,000 annotated personalized headlines with historical dwell
time annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PHG-DIF substantially
mitigates the adverse effects of click noise and significantly improves
headline quality, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on DT-PENS. Our
framework implementation and dataset are available at

Motivation: 企业数据管道中的多语言复杂转换导致原始元数据与下游数据之间的语义脱节（语义漂移），影响数据可重现性和治理，以及RAG和文本到SQL系统的实用性。

Method: 提出了一种自动化提取细粒度模式谱系的框架，识别源模式、源表、转换逻辑和聚合操作，并引入SLiCE评估谱系质量。

Result: 实验表明，模式谱系提取性能随模型规模和提示技术的复杂度提升而提升，32B开源模型在标准提示下性能接近GPT系列。

Conclusion: 研究为实际应用中部署模式感知代理提供了一种可扩展且经济的解决方案。

Abstract: Enterprise data pipelines, characterized by complex transformations across
multiple programming languages, often cause a semantic disconnect between
original metadata and downstream data. This "semantic drift" compromises data
reproducibility and governance, and impairs the utility of services like
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and text-to-SQL systems. To address this,
a novel framework is proposed for the automated extraction of fine-grained
schema lineage from multilingual enterprise pipeline scripts. This method
identifies four key components: source schemas, source tables, transformation
logic, and aggregation operations, creating a standardized representation of
data transformations. For the rigorous evaluation of lineage quality, this
paper introduces the Schema Lineage Composite Evaluation (SLiCE), a metric that
assesses both structural correctness and semantic fidelity. A new benchmark is
also presented, comprising 1,700 manually annotated lineages from real-world
industrial scripts. Experiments were conducted with 12 language models, from
1.3B to 32B small language models (SLMs) to large language models (LLMs) like
GPT-4o and GPT-4.1. The results demonstrate that the performance of schema
lineage extraction scales with model size and the sophistication of prompting
techniques. Specially, a 32B open-source model, using a single reasoning trace,
can achieve performance comparable to the GPT series under standard prompting.
This finding suggests a scalable and economical approach for deploying
schema-aware agents in practical applications.

Result: 在时效性问答任务中，DySK-Attn在准确性和效率上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DySK-Attn为构建能适应动态世界的大语言模型提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from a critical limitation: their
knowledge is static and quickly becomes outdated. Retraining these massive
models is computationally prohibitive, while existing knowledge editing
techniques can be slow and may introduce unforeseen side effects. To address
this, we propose DySK-Attn, a novel framework that enables LLMs to efficiently
integrate real-time knowledge from a dynamic external source. Our approach
synergizes an LLM with a dynamic Knowledge Graph (KG) that can be updated
instantaneously. The core of our framework is a sparse knowledge attention
mechanism, which allows the LLM to perform a coarse-to-fine grained search,
efficiently identifying and focusing on a small, highly relevant subset of
facts from the vast KG. This mechanism avoids the high computational cost of
dense attention over the entire knowledge base and mitigates noise from
irrelevant information. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on
time-sensitive question-answering tasks that DySK-Attn significantly
outperforms strong baselines, including standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) and model editing techniques, in both factual accuracy for updated
knowledge and computational efficiency. Our framework offers a scalable and
effective solution for building LLMs that can stay current with the
ever-changing world.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在自然语言处理中表现优异，但直接应用于时间序列预测面临时间模式异质性和模态差异的挑战。

Method: 设计了异构时间编码器分割时间序列，并引入语义对齐模块将时间特征与LLM兼容表示对齐。

Result: 在七个真实世界基准测试中，TALON表现优异，平均MSE提升达11%。

Conclusion: 结合模式感知和语义感知设计，能有效适应LLMs进行时间序列预测。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive
capabilities in natural language processing due to their strong generalization
and sequence modeling capabilities. However, their direct application to time
series forecasting remains challenging due to two fundamental issues: the
inherent heterogeneity of temporal patterns and the modality gap between
continuous numerical signals and discrete language representations. In this
work, we propose TALON, a unified framework that enhances LLM-based forecasting
by modeling temporal heterogeneity and enforcing semantic alignment.
Specifically, we design a Heterogeneous Temporal Encoder that partitions
multivariate time series into structurally coherent segments, enabling
localized expert modeling across diverse temporal patterns. To bridge the
modality gap, we introduce a Semantic Alignment Module that aligns temporal
features with LLM-compatible representations, enabling effective integration of
time series into language-based models while eliminating the need for
handcrafted prompts during inference. Extensive experiments on seven real-world
benchmarks demonstrate that TALON achieves superior performance across all
datasets, with average MSE improvements of up to 11\% over recent
state-of-the-art methods. These results underscore the effectiveness of
incorporating both pattern-aware and semantic-aware designs when adapting LLMs
for time series forecasting. The code is available at:

Conclusion: PEP策略有效学习帖子互动特征，显著提升PLMs在谣言检测任务中的表现。

Abstract: Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) have excelled in various Natural Language
Processing tasks, benefiting from large-scale pretraining and self-attention
mechanism's ability to capture long-range dependencies. However, their
performance on social media application tasks like rumor detection remains
suboptimal. We attribute this to mismatches between pretraining corpora and
social texts, inadequate handling of unique social symbols, and pretraining
tasks ill-suited for modeling user engagements implicit in propagation
structures. To address these issues, we propose a continue pretraining strategy
called Post Engagement Prediction (PEP) to infuse information from propagation
structures into PLMs. PEP makes models to predict root, branch, and parent
relations between posts, capturing interactions of stance and sentiment crucial
for rumor detection. We also curate and release large-scale Twitter corpus:
TwitterCorpus (269GB text), and two unlabeled claim conversation datasets with
propagation structures (UTwitter and UWeibo). Utilizing these resources and PEP
strategy, we train a Twitter-tailored PLM called SoLM. Extensive experiments
demonstrate PEP significantly boosts rumor detection performance across
universal and social media PLMs, even in few-shot scenarios. On benchmark
datasets, PEP enhances baseline models by 1.0-3.7\% accuracy, even enabling it
to outperform current state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets. SoLM
alone, without high-level modules, also achieves competitive results,
highlighting the strategy's effectiveness in learning discriminative post
interaction features.

Abstract: Despite their success in speech processing, neural networks often operate as
black boxes, prompting the question: what informs their decisions, and how can
we interpret them? This work examines this issue in the context of lexical
stress. A dataset of English disyllabic words was automatically constructed
from read and spontaneous speech. Several Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
architectures were trained to predict stress position from a spectrographic
representation of disyllabic words lacking minimal stress pairs (e.g., initial
stress WAllet, final stress exTEND), achieving up to 92% accuracy on held-out
test data. Layerwise Relevance Propagation (LRP), a technique for CNN
interpretability analysis, revealed that predictions for held-out minimal pairs
(PROtest vs. proTEST ) were most strongly influenced by information in stressed
versus unstressed syllables, particularly the spectral properties of stressed
vowels. However, the classifiers also attended to information throughout the
word. A feature-specific relevance analysis is proposed, and its results
suggest that our best-performing classifier is strongly influenced by the
stressed vowel's first and second formants, with some evidence that its pitch
and third formant also contribute. These results reveal deep learning's ability
to acquire distributed cues to stress from naturally occurring data, extending
traditional phonetic work based around highly controlled stimuli.

Few-Shot CLNER (FS-CLNER) tasks, the scarcity of new-class entities makes it
difficult for the trained model to generalize during inference. More
critically, the lack of old-class entity information hinders the distillation
of old knowledge, causing the model to fall into what we refer to as the
Few-Shot Distillation Dilemma. In this work, we address the above challenges
through a prompt tuning paradigm and memory demonstration template strategy.
Specifically, we designed an expandable Anchor words-oriented Prompt Tuning
(APT) paradigm to bridge the gap between pre-training and fine-tuning, thereby
enhancing performance in few-shot scenarios. Additionally, we incorporated
Memory Demonstration Templates (MDT) into each training instance to provide
replay samples from previous tasks, which not only avoids the Few-Shot
Distillation Dilemma but also promotes in-context learning. Experiments show
that our approach achieves competitive performances on FS-CLNER.

*Bernd J. Kröger*

TL;DR: 论文扩展了DYNARTmo模型，通过集成三维腭穹表示，从矢状舌轮廓估计舌-腭接触区域，并实现了两种几何模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进动态发音模型，以更准确地模拟舌-腭接触，支持语音科学教育和治疗。

Method: 集成三维腭穹表示，采用半椭圆和余弦曲线建模，计算侧向接触点，生成电腭图可视化。

Result: 模型支持三视图同步显示，适用于静态和动态发音展示。

Conclusion: 未来将增加面部视图和发音-声学合成，以评估模型真实性。

Abstract: This paper describes an extension of the two-dimensional dynamic articulatory
model DYNARTmo by integrating an internal three-dimensional representation of
the palatal dome to estimate tongue-palate contact areas from midsagittal
tongue contours. Two alternative dome geometries - a half-ellipse and a cosine
based profile - are implemented to model lateral curvature in the coronal
plane. Using these geometries, lateral contact points are analytically computed
for each anterior-posterior position, enabling the generation of
electropalatography-like visualizations within the 2D+ framework. The enhanced
model supports three synchronized views (sagittal, glottal, and palatal) for
static and dynamic (animated) articulation displays, suitable for speech
science education and speech therapy. Future work includes adding a facial
(lip) view and implementing articulatory-to-acoustic synthesis to
quantitatively evaluate model realism.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种方法（显式和隐式）将上下文副语言信息融入语音语言模型训练，显著提升了模型的共情推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音语言模型在共情推理方面表现不足，主要因缺乏结合上下文内容和副语言线索的训练数据。

Method: 1. 显式方法：直接提供副语言元数据（如情感标注）；2. 隐式方法：自动生成结合情感标注和语音转录的训练问答对。

Result: 隐式方法性能提升38.41%，与显式方法结合后达46.02%，验证了LLM评判的可靠性。

Conclusion: 结合显式和隐式方法能有效提升模型对上下文副语言的理解能力。

Abstract: Current large speech language models (Speech-LLMs) often exhibit limitations
in empathetic reasoning, primarily due to the absence of training datasets that
integrate both contextual content and paralinguistic cues. In this work, we
propose two approaches to incorporate contextual paralinguistic information
into model training: (1) an explicit method that provides paralinguistic
metadata (e.g., emotion annotations) directly to the LLM, and (2) an implicit
method that automatically generates novel training question-answer (QA) pairs
using both categorical and dimensional emotion annotations alongside speech
transcriptions. Our implicit method boosts performance (LLM-judged) by 38.41%
on a human-annotated QA benchmark, reaching 46.02% when combined with the
explicit approach, showing effectiveness in contextual paralinguistic
understanding. We also validate the LLM judge by demonstrating its correlation
with classification metrics, providing support for its reliability.

TL;DR: MAQuA是一种自适应提问框架，用于多维心理健康筛查，通过结合多结果建模、项目反应理论和因子分析，显著减少问题数量并提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型（LLM）在心理健康评估中效率低下，用户负担重，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 结合多结果建模、项目反应理论（IRT）和因子分析，动态选择最具信息量的问题。

Result: MAQuA将问题数量减少50-87%，在抑郁和饮食障碍等领域表现优异。

Conclusion: MAQuA是一种高效工具，可推动LLM在临床工作流中的应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for
scalable, interactive mental health assessment, but excessive querying by LLMs
burdens users and is inefficient for real-world screening across
transdiagnostic symptom profiles. We introduce MAQuA, an adaptive
question-asking framework for simultaneous, multidimensional mental health
screening. Combining multi-outcome modeling on language responses with item
response theory (IRT) and factor analysis, MAQuA selects the questions with
most informative responses across multiple dimensions at each turn to optimize
diagnostic information, improving accuracy and potentially reducing response
burden. Empirical results on a novel dataset reveal that MAQuA reduces the
number of assessment questions required for score stabilization by 50-87%
compared to random ordering (e.g., achieving stable depression scores with 71%
fewer questions and eating disorder scores with 85% fewer questions). MAQuA
demonstrates robust performance across both internalizing (depression, anxiety)
and externalizing (substance use, eating disorder) domains, with early stopping
strategies further reducing patient time and burden. These findings position
MAQuA as a powerful and efficient tool for scalable, nuanced, and interactive
mental health screening, advancing the integration of LLM-based agents into
real-world clinical workflows.

<details>

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在伦理敏感决策中的作用增加，理解其道德推理过程变得至关重要。

Method: 通过因子提示协议，收集了3,780个二元决策和自然语言解释，分析模型的决策果断性、解释一致性、公众道德对齐及对无关伦理线索的敏感性。

Result: 推理增强模型表现更果断且解释更结构化，但未必更符合人类共识；在利他主义、公平和美德伦理框架下表现较好，而在亲属关系、法律或自利框架下表现较差。

Conclusion: 道德提示不仅是行为调节工具，也是揭示模型潜在对齐哲学的诊断工具，建议将道德推理作为模型对齐的主要评估维度。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate ethically sensitive
decisions, understanding their moral reasoning processes becomes imperative.
This study presents a comprehensive empirical evaluation of 14 leading LLMs,
both reasoning enabled and general purpose, across 27 diverse trolley problem
scenarios, framed by ten moral philosophies, including utilitarianism,
deontology, and altruism. Using a factorial prompting protocol, we elicited
3,780 binary decisions and natural language justifications, enabling analysis
along axes of decisional assertiveness, explanation answer consistency, public
moral alignment, and sensitivity to ethically irrelevant cues. Our findings
reveal significant variability across ethical frames and model types: reasoning
enhanced models demonstrate greater decisiveness and structured justifications,
yet do not always align better with human consensus. Notably, "sweet zones"
emerge in altruistic, fairness, and virtue ethics framings, where models
achieve a balance of high intervention rates, low explanation conflict, and
minimal divergence from aggregated human judgments. However, models diverge
under frames emphasizing kinship, legality, or self interest, often producing
ethically controversial outcomes. These patterns suggest that moral prompting
is not only a behavioral modifier but also a diagnostic tool for uncovering
latent alignment philosophies across providers. We advocate for moral reasoning
to become a primary axis in LLM alignment, calling for standardized benchmarks
that evaluate not just what LLMs decide, but how and why.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AEC领域NER任务中预训练模型因领域术语和复杂关系导致的性能限制，避免高成本的人工标注。

Method: 使用LLM生成简单解释（Cote），基于此增量预训练RoBERTa模型，再进行下游任务微调。

Result: 在AEC基准数据集上达到77.20%的Macro-F1分数，表现优于复杂角色推理。

Conclusion: 简单解释型知识比复杂推理更有效，ARCE为领域适应提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate information extraction from specialized texts is a critical
challenge, particularly for named entity recognition (NER) in the architecture,
engineering, and construction (AEC) domain to support automated rule checking
(ARC). The performance of standard pre-trained models is often constrained by
the domain gap, as they struggle to interpret the specialized terminology and
complex relational contexts inherent in AEC texts. Although this issue can be
mitigated by further pre-training on large, human-curated domain corpora, as
exemplified by methods like ARCBERT, this approach is both labor-intensive and
cost-prohibitive. Consequently, leveraging large language models (LLMs) for
automated knowledge generation has emerged as a promising alternative. However,
the optimal strategy for generating knowledge that can genuinely enhance
smaller, efficient models remains an open question. To address this, we propose
ARCE (augmented RoBERTa with contextualized elucidations), a novel approach
that systematically explores and optimizes this generation process. ARCE
employs an LLM to first generate a corpus of simple, direct explanations, which
we term Cote, and then uses this corpus to incrementally pre-train a RoBERTa
model prior to its fine-tuning on the downstream task. Our extensive
experiments show that ARCE establishes a new state-of-the-art on a benchmark
AEC dataset, achieving a Macro-F1 score of 77.20%. This result also reveals a
key finding: simple, explanation-based knowledge proves surprisingly more
effective than complex, role-based rationales for this task. The code is

Motivation: 现有基准主要关注英语文本或视觉模态，缺乏对多语言语音输入的事实性评估。

Method: 构建了包含8种语言的平行语音-文本事实问题数据集（CCFQA），并提出少样本迁移学习策略。

Result: 当前MLLMs在CCFQA上表现不佳，但少样本迁移学习能有效提升性能。

Conclusion: CCFQA为促进MLLMs在多语言语音理解能力的发展提供了基础资源。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly popularized in the
multilingual world, ensuring hallucination-free factuality becomes markedly
crucial. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating the reliability of
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) predominantly focus on textual or
visual modalities with a primary emphasis on English, which creates a gap in
evaluation when processing multilingual input, especially in speech. To bridge
this gap, we propose a novel \textbf{C}ross-lingual and \textbf{C}ross-modal
\textbf{F}actuality benchmark (\textbf{CCFQA}). Specifically, the CCFQA
benchmark contains parallel speech-text factual questions across 8 languages,
designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs' cross-lingual and cross-modal
factuality capabilities. Our experimental results demonstrate that current
MLLMs still face substantial challenges on the CCFQA benchmark. Furthermore, we
propose a few-shot transfer learning strategy that effectively transfers the
Question Answering (QA) capabilities of LLMs in English to multilingual Spoken
Question Answering (SQA) tasks, achieving competitive performance with
GPT-4o-mini-Audio using just 5-shot training. We release CCFQA as a
foundational research resource to promote the development of MLLMs with more
robust and reliable speech understanding capabilities. Our code and dataset are

Method: 提出ObfusQAte技术和ObfusQA框架，通过三个维度（命名实体间接、干扰项间接、上下文过载）评估LLMs。

Result: LLMs在复杂语言变化下表现不佳，容易失败或产生幻觉回答。

Conclusion: ObfusQA为评估LLMs的鲁棒性和适应性提供了全面基准，并公开了ObfusQAte以促进相关研究。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly
contributed to the development of equitable AI systems capable of factual
question-answering (QA). However, no known study tests the LLMs' robustness
when presented with obfuscated versions of questions. To systematically
evaluate these limitations, we propose a novel technique, ObfusQAte and,
leveraging the same, introduce ObfusQA, a comprehensive, first of its kind,
framework with multi-tiered obfuscation levels designed to examine LLM
capabilities across three distinct dimensions: (i) Named-Entity Indirection,
(ii) Distractor Indirection, and (iii) Contextual Overload. By capturing these
fine-grained distinctions in language, ObfusQA provides a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating LLM robustness and adaptability. Our study observes
that LLMs exhibit a tendency to fail or generate hallucinated responses when
confronted with these increasingly nuanced variations. To foster research in
this direction, we make ObfusQAte publicly available.

Conclusion: 研究展示了多语言技术的潜力，但也指出未充分开发技术的潜在问题。

Abstract: Most people are multilingual, and most multilinguals code-switch, yet the
characteristics of code-switched language are not fully understood. We
developed a chatbot capable of completing a Map Task with human participants
using code-switched Spanish and English. In two experiments, we prompted the
bot to code-switch according to different strategies, examining (1) the
feasibility of such experiments for investigating bilingual language use, and
(2) whether participants would be sensitive to variations in discourse and
grammatical patterns. Participants generally enjoyed code-switching with our
bot as long as it produced predictable code-switching behavior; when
code-switching was random or ungrammatical (as when producing unattested
incongruent mixed-language noun phrases, such as `la fork'), participants
enjoyed the task less and were less successful at completing it. These results
underscore the potential downsides of deploying insufficiently developed
multilingual language technology, while also illustrating the promise of such
technology for conducting research on bilingual language use.

Conclusion: TurnGuide有效解决了FD-SLMs的关键挑战，提升了语音交互的自然性和质量。

Abstract: Full-Duplex Speech Language Models (FD-SLMs) are specialized foundation
models designed to enable natural, real-time spoken interactions by modeling
complex conversational dynamics such as interruptions, backchannels, and
overlapping speech, and End-to-end (e2e) FD-SLMs leverage real-world
double-channel conversational data to capture nuanced two-speaker dialogue
patterns for human-like interactions. However, they face a critical challenge
-- their conversational abilities often degrade compared to pure-text
conversation due to prolonged speech sequences and limited high-quality spoken
dialogue data. While text-guided speech generation could mitigate these issues,
it suffers from timing and length issues when integrating textual guidance into
double-channel audio streams, disrupting the precise time alignment essential
for natural interactions. To address these challenges, we propose TurnGuide, a
novel planning-inspired approach that mimics human conversational planning by
dynamically segmenting assistant speech into dialogue turns and generating
turn-level text guidance before speech output, which effectively resolves both
insertion timing and length challenges. Extensive experiments demonstrate our
approach significantly improves e2e FD-SLMs' conversational abilities, enabling
them to generate semantically meaningful and coherent speech while maintaining
natural conversational flow. Demos are available at

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在高资源环境下表现优异，但在低资源语言和文化长尾实体上表现不佳，需要填补这一文化鸿沟。

Method: 利用Wikidata知识图谱收集文化相关实体图像，生成合成多语言视觉问答数据，构建22M高质量VQA对的数据集CulturalGround，并训练开源模型CulturalPangea。

Result: CulturalPangea在文化相关多语言多模态基准测试中表现最优，平均提升5.0分，且不影响主流视觉语言任务性能。

Conclusion: 通过文化知识直接嵌入模型的方法，有效缩小了多模态大语言模型的文化差距，为全球包容性多模态系统提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models excel in high-resource settings, but often
misinterpret long-tail cultural entities and underperform in low-resource
languages. To address this gap, we propose a data-centric approach that
directly grounds MLLMs in cultural knowledge. Leveraging a large scale
knowledge graph from Wikidata, we collect images that represent culturally
significant entities, and generate synthetic multilingual visual question
answering data. The resulting dataset, CulturalGround, comprises 22 million
high-quality, culturally-rich VQA pairs spanning 42 countries and 39 languages.
We train an open-source MLLM CulturalPangea on CulturalGround, interleaving
standard multilingual instruction-tuning data to preserve general abilities.
CulturalPangea achieves state-of-the-art performance among open models on
various culture-focused multilingual multimodal benchmarks, outperforming prior
models by an average of 5.0 without degrading results on mainstream
vision-language tasks. Our findings show that our targeted, culturally grounded
approach could substantially narrow the cultural gap in MLLMs and offer a
practical path towards globally inclusive multimodal systems.

Motivation: 现有代码生成方法在效率和可扩展性上存在不足，如树搜索方法树规模增长快，改进方法奖励信号不明确。

Method: ReLoc通过初始代码草拟、邻域代码生成、候选评估和代码更新四个组件实现局部搜索，并结合修订奖励模型指导搜索。

Result: 实验表明，ReLoc在多种代码生成任务中表现优异，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ReLoc为代码生成提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with inference-time scaling techniques show
promise for code generation, yet face notable efficiency and scalability
challenges. Construction-based tree-search methods suffer from rapid growth in
tree size, high token consumption, and lack of anytime property. In contrast,
improvement-based methods offer better performance but often struggle with
uninformative reward signals and inefficient search strategies. In this work,
we propose \textbf{ReLoc}, a unified local search framework which effectively
performs step-by-step code revision. Specifically, ReLoc explores a series of
local revisions through four key algorithmic components: initial code drafting,
neighborhood code generation, candidate evaluation, and incumbent code
updating, each of which can be instantiated with specific decision rules to
realize different local search algorithms such as Hill Climbing (HC) or Genetic
Algorithm (GA). Furthermore, we develop a specialized revision reward model
that evaluates code quality based on revision distance to produce fine-grained
preferences that guide the local search toward more promising candidates.
Finally, our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach
achieves superior performance across diverse code generation tasks,
significantly outperforming both construction-based tree search as well as the
state-of-the-art improvement-based code generation methods.

TL;DR: 研究发现，大语言模型（LLMs）在长输入中存在位置偏差，如“迷失在中间”（LiM）效应。当输入占模型上下文窗口的50%以内时，LiM效应最强；超过后，首因效应减弱，而近因效应保持稳定。此外，检索是LLMs推理的前提，位置偏差主要源于检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在长输入中的位置偏差（如LiM效应）及其表现条件，以改进长上下文任务和评估方法。

Method: 采用相对输入长度（相对于模型上下文窗口）进行综合分析。

Result: LiM效应在输入占窗口50%以内时最强；超过后，首因效应减弱，近因效应稳定，且推理偏差主要源于检索。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在长输入中的位置偏差特性，对长上下文任务、基准设计和评估方法有重要启示。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to use information across long
inputs effectively. Prior work has identified positional biases, such as the
Lost in the Middle (LiM) effect, where models perform better when information
appears at the beginning (primacy bias) or end (recency bias) of the input,
rather than in the middle. However, long-context studies have not consistently
replicated these effects, raising questions about their intensity and the
conditions under which they manifest. To address this, we conducted a
comprehensive analysis using relative rather than absolute input lengths,
defined with respect to each model's context window. Our findings reveal that
the LiM effect is strongest when inputs occupy up to 50% of a model's context
window. Beyond that, the primacy bias weakens, while recency bias remains
relatively stable. This effectively eliminates the LiM effect; instead, we
observe a distance-based bias, where model performance is better when relevant
information is closer to the end of the input. Furthermore, our results suggest
that successful retrieval is a prerequisite for reasoning in LLMs, and that the
observed positional biases in reasoning are largely inherited from retrieval.
These insights have implications for long-context tasks, the design of future
LLM benchmarks, and evaluation methodologies for LLMs handling extended inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的QE系统因预训练任务与回归任务不匹配及低资源语言数据分布问题表现不佳。

Method: ALOPE结合低秩适配器（LoRA）和回归任务头，动态加权多层表示并采用多头回归策略。

Result: ALOPE在多种LLM-based QE方法中表现更优，中间Transformer层更适合跨语言QE任务。

Conclusion: ALOPE框架公开可用，支持现有LLM-based MT框架扩展QE能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across a wide
range of natural language processing tasks. Quality Estimation (QE) for Machine
Translation (MT), which assesses the quality of a source-target pair without
relying on reference translations, remains a challenging cross-lingual task for
LLMs. The challenges stem from the inherent limitations of existing LLM-based
QE systems, which are pre-trained for causal language modelling rather than
regression-specific tasks, further elevated by the presence of low-resource
languages given pre-training data distribution. This paper introduces ALOPE, an
adaptive layer-optimization framework designed to enhance LLM-based QE by
restructuring Transformer representations through layer-wise adaptation for
improved regression-based prediction. Our framework integrates low-rank
adapters (LoRA) with regression task heads, leveraging selected pre-trained
Transformer layers for improved cross-lingual alignment. In addition to the
layer-specific adaptation, ALOPE introduces two strategies-dynamic weighting,
which adaptively combines representations from multiple layers, and multi-head
regression, which aggregates regression losses from multiple heads for QE. Our
framework shows improvements over various existing LLM-based QE approaches.
Empirical evidence suggests that intermediate Transformer layers in LLMs
provide contextual representations that are more aligned with the cross-lingual
nature of the QE task. We make resultant models and framework code publicly
available for further research, also allowing existing LLM-based MT frameworks
to be scaled with QE capabilities.

groups remain underdeveloped. In this study, we present a method using
topological data analysis to identify which heads in GPT-2 contribute to the
misrepresentation of identity groups present in the StereoSet dataset. We find
that biases for particular categories, such as gender or profession, are
concentrated in attention heads that act as hot spots. The metric we propose
can also be used to determine which heads capture bias for a specific group
within a bias category, and future work could extend this method to help
de-bias large language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ThemeClouds是一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的可视化工具，用于生成主题词云，解决了传统频率词云在对话语境中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统频率词云在对话语境中效果不佳，无法有效捕捉语义相关概念，限制了其在早期分析中的实用性。

Method: ThemeClouds利用LLM识别语料库中的概念级主题，并统计每个主题被提及的参与者数量，生成基于提及广度的词云。

Result: 与频率词云和主题建模基线相比，ThemeClouds能更有效地提取用户研究中的关键设备问题。

Conclusion: ThemeClouds为定性工作流提供了透明且可控的LLM辅助工具，同时探讨了交互式分析的潜力。

Abstract: Word clouds are a common way to summarize qualitative interviews, yet
traditional frequency-based methods often fail in conversational contexts: they
surface filler words, ignore paraphrase, and fragment semantically related
ideas. This limits their usefulness in early-stage analysis, when researchers
need fast, interpretable overviews of what participant actually said. We
introduce ThemeClouds, an open-source visualization tool that uses large
language models (LLMs) to generate thematic, participant-weighted word clouds
from dialogue transcripts. The system prompts an LLM to identify concept-level
themes across a corpus and then counts how many unique participants mention
each topic, yielding a visualization grounded in breadth of mention rather than
raw term frequency. Researchers can customize prompts and visualization
parameters, providing transparency and control. Using interviews from a user
study comparing five recording-device configurations (31 participants; 155
transcripts, Whisper ASR), our approach surfaces more actionable device
concerns than frequency clouds and topic-modeling baselines (e.g., LDA,
BERTopic). We discuss design trade-offs for integrating LLM assistance into
qualitative workflows, implications for interpretability and researcher agency,
and opportunities for interactive analyses such as per-condition contrasts
(``diff clouds'').

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL方法在LLM推理任务中表现有限，RLVR虽有效但探索行为机制未明，需深入研究以优化性能。

Method: 研究RLVR的探索能力，包括探索空间塑造、熵-性能交换分析和RL性能优化方法。

Result: 提出了量化指标分析LLM能力边界，探索了熵与性能的关系，并优化了RL性能。

Conclusion: 为RLVR系统提供了基础框架，统一了现有见解与新实证证据。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). Unlike traditional RL approaches, RLVR leverages rule-based
feedback to guide LLMs in generating and refining complex reasoning chains -- a
process critically dependent on effective exploration strategies. While prior
work has demonstrated RLVR's empirical success, the fundamental mechanisms
governing LLMs' exploration behaviors remain underexplored. This technical
report presents a systematic investigation of exploration capacities in RLVR,
covering four main aspects: (1) exploration space shaping, where we develop
quantitative metrics to characterize LLMs' capability boundaries; (2)
entropy-performance exchange, analyzed across training stages, individual
instances, and token-level patterns; and (3) RL performance optimization,
examining methods to effectively translate exploration gains into measurable
improvements. By unifying previously identified insights with new empirical
evidence, this work aims to provide a foundational framework for advancing RLVR
systems.

TL;DR: 印度保释预测系统（IBPS）利用AI预测保释结果并生成法律依据，旨在减少主观性和延迟，提高印度司法系统的公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印度法院保释决定存在主观性、延迟和不一致问题，且多数未审囚犯来自社会经济弱势群体，加剧人权问题和司法积压。

Method: 基于15万份高等法院保释判决数据集，通过参数高效技术微调大语言模型，结合法律条文背景评估性能。

Result: 结合法律知识的模型显著优于基线，表现出高准确性和解释质量，并能泛化到专家标注的测试集。

Conclusion: IBPS为印度司法系统提供了透明、可扩展的解决方案，支持数据驱动的法律辅助，促进程序公平。

Abstract: Bail decisions are among the most frequently adjudicated matters in Indian
courts, yet they remain plagued by subjectivity, delays, and inconsistencies.
With over 75% of India's prison population comprising undertrial prisoners,
many from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds, the lack of timely and
fair bail adjudication exacerbates human rights concerns and contributes to
systemic judicial backlog. In this paper, we present the Indian Bail Prediction
System (IBPS), an AI-powered framework designed to assist in bail
decision-making by predicting outcomes and generating legally sound rationales
based solely on factual case attributes and statutory provisions. We curate and
release a large-scale dataset of 150,430 High Court bail judgments, enriched
with structured annotations such as age, health, criminal history, crime
category, custody duration, statutes, and judicial reasoning. We fine-tune a
large language model using parameter-efficient techniques and evaluate its
performance across multiple configurations, with and without statutory context,
and with RAG. Our results demonstrate that models fine-tuned with statutory
knowledge significantly outperform baselines, achieving strong accuracy and
explanation quality, and generalize well to a test set independently annotated
by legal experts. IBPS offers a transparent, scalable, and reproducible
solution to support data-driven legal assistance, reduce bail delays, and
promote procedural fairness in the Indian judicial system.

TL;DR: 论文提出KeyCP++方法，通过关键词链式思维提示改进LLM在事件检测中的表现，解决传统ICL的过解释问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在事件检测中因缺乏对触发词的准确理解而表现不佳，传统ICL无法有效纠正过解释问题。

Method: KeyCP++通过关键词链式思维提示，自动标注输入文本与检测结果间的逻辑差距，构建触发词判别模板，生成深度推理依据。

Result: 实验证明KeyCP++在单样本事件检测中显著提升性能。

Conclusion: KeyCP++有效解决了LLM在事件检测中的过解释问题，推动了检测规则学习。

Abstract: Although the LLM-based in-context learning (ICL) paradigm has demonstrated
considerable success across various natural language processing tasks, it
encounters challenges in event detection. This is because LLMs lack an accurate
understanding of event triggers and tend to make over-interpretation, which
cannot be effectively corrected through in-context examples alone. In this
paper, we focus on the most challenging one-shot setting and propose KeyCP++, a
keyword-centric chain-of-thought prompting approach. KeyCP++ addresses the
weaknesses of conventional ICL by automatically annotating the logical gaps
between input text and detection results for the demonstrations. Specifically,
to generate in-depth and meaningful rationale, KeyCP++ constructs a trigger
discrimination prompting template. It incorporates the exemplary triggers
(a.k.a keywords) into the prompt as the anchor to simply trigger profiling, let
LLM propose candidate triggers, and justify each candidate. These
propose-and-judge rationales help LLMs mitigate over-reliance on the keywords
and promote detection rule learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, showcasing significant advancements in one-shot
event detection.

TL;DR: InterChart是一个诊断基准，用于评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）在多个相关图表中的推理能力，适用于科学报告、金融分析和公共政策仪表板等实际应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注孤立且视觉单一的图表，而InterChart旨在挑战模型在多样化的图表和问题类型中的表现，以更贴近真实场景。

Method: InterChart分为三个难度层级：1）单个图表的事实推理；2）合成对齐图表集的综合分析；3）视觉复杂的真实图表对的语义推理。

Result: 评估显示，随着图表复杂性增加，VLMs的准确性显著下降。分解多实体图表为简单视觉单元可提升模型表现，但跨图表整合仍是挑战。

Conclusion: InterChart揭示了VLMs在多视觉环境中的系统性局限，为推进多模态推理提供了严格框架。

Abstract: We introduce InterChart, a diagnostic benchmark that evaluates how well
vision-language models (VLMs) reason across multiple related charts, a task
central to real-world applications such as scientific reporting, financial
analysis, and public policy dashboards. Unlike prior benchmarks focusing on
isolated, visually uniform charts, InterChart challenges models with diverse
question types ranging from entity inference and trend correlation to numerical
estimation and abstract multi-step reasoning grounded in 2-3 thematically or
structurally related charts. We organize the benchmark into three tiers of
increasing difficulty: (1) factual reasoning over individual charts, (2)
integrative analysis across synthetically aligned chart sets, and (3) semantic
inference over visually complex, real-world chart pairs. Our evaluation of
state-of-the-art open and closed-source VLMs reveals consistent and steep
accuracy declines as chart complexity increases. We find that models perform
better when we decompose multi-entity charts into simpler visual units,
underscoring their struggles with cross-chart integration. By exposing these
systematic limitations, InterChart provides a rigorous framework for advancing
multimodal reasoning in complex, multi-visual environments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LoSemB的逻辑引导语义桥接框架，用于解决大语言模型在工具学习中处理未见工具时的分布偏移和相似性检索脆弱性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中工具库不断更新，现有方法在训练时假设所有工具已知，无法适应新工具。

Method: LoSemB框架包含逻辑嵌入对齐模块和关系增强检索机制，以挖掘和转移逻辑信息。

Result: 实验表明LoSemB在归纳设置中表现优异，同时在转导设置中保持良好效果。

Conclusion: LoSemB为工具学习中的归纳检索提供了一种高效且无需重新训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Tool learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for large language models
(LLMs) to solve many real-world tasks. Nonetheless, with the tool repository
rapidly expanding, it is impractical to contain all tools within the limited
input length of LLMs. To alleviate these issues, researchers have explored
incorporating a tool retrieval module to select the most relevant tools or
represent tools as unique tokens within LLM parameters. However, most
state-of-the-art methods are under transductive settings, assuming all tools
have been observed during training. Such a setting deviates from reality as the
real-world tool repository is evolving and incorporates new tools frequently.
When dealing with these unseen tools, which refer to tools not encountered
during the training phase, these methods are limited by two key issues,
including the large distribution shift and the vulnerability of
similarity-based retrieval. To this end, inspired by human cognitive processes
of mastering unseen tools through discovering and applying the logical
information from prior experience, we introduce a novel Logic-Guided Semantic
Bridging framework for inductive tool retrieval, namely, LoSemB, which aims to
mine and transfer latent logical information for inductive tool retrieval
without costly retraining. Specifically, LoSemB contains a logic-based
embedding alignment module to mitigate distribution shifts and implements a
relational augmented retrieval mechanism to reduce the vulnerability of
similarity-based retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoSemB
achieves advanced performance in inductive settings while maintaining desirable
effectiveness in the transductive setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索NTP（Next Token Prediction）在长距离连贯性和全局一致性上的局限性，尤其是在结构化文档中。

Method: 评估三种商业LLM（GPT-4o、Claude 3.5 Sonnet、Gemini 2.0 Flash）在Masked Sentence Prediction任务中的表现，涵盖叙事、程序和说明性文本。

Result: 商业LLMs在低结构化领域中预测掩码句子的能力较差。

Conclusion: 当前模型在全局一致性和长距离规划能力上存在不足，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Transformer-based models primarily rely on Next Token Prediction (NTP), which
predicts the next token in a sequence based on the preceding context. However,
NTP's focus on single-token prediction often limits a model's ability to plan
ahead or maintain long-range coherence, raising questions about how well LLMs
can predict longer contexts, such as full sentences within structured
documents. While NTP encourages local fluency, it provides no explicit
incentive to ensure global coherence across sentence boundaries-an essential
skill for reconstructive or discursive tasks. To investigate this, we evaluate
three commercial LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) on
Masked Sentence Prediction (MSP) - the task of infilling a randomly removed
sentence - from three domains: ROCStories (narrative), Recipe1M (procedural),
and Wikipedia (expository). We assess both fidelity (similarity to the original
sentence) and cohesiveness (fit within the surrounding context). Our key
finding reveals that commercial LLMs, despite their superlative performance in
other tasks, are poor at predicting masked sentences in low-structured domains,
highlighting a gap in current model capabilities.

Motivation: 尽管LLM在多任务中表现优异，但其输出与输入不一致的忠实性幻觉问题尚未被深入研究，尤其是社会偏见是否为其原因。

Method: 使用结构因果模型（SCM）验证因果关系，设计偏见干预措施，并开发偏见干预数据集（BID）以精确测量因果效应。

Result: 实验表明偏见是忠实性幻觉的重要原因，且不同偏见状态的影响方向各异。

Conclusion: 社会偏见对幻觉生成具有微妙但显著的因果影响，尤其在针对不公平幻觉时。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various
tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to faithfulness hallucinations, where the
output does not align with the input. In this study, we investigate whether
social bias contributes to these hallucinations, a causal relationship that has
not been explored. A key challenge is controlling confounders within the
context, which complicates the isolation of causality between bias states and
hallucinations. To address this, we utilize the Structural Causal Model (SCM)
to establish and validate the causality and design bias interventions to
control confounders. In addition, we develop the Bias Intervention Dataset
(BID), which includes various social biases, enabling precise measurement of
causal effects. Experiments on mainstream LLMs reveal that biases are
significant causes of faithfulness hallucinations, and the effect of each bias
state differs in direction. We further analyze the scope of these causal
effects across various models, specifically focusing on unfairness
hallucinations, which are primarily targeted by social bias, revealing the
subtle yet significant causal effect of bias on hallucination generation.

Conclusion: 语法结构在LLM驱动的同步语音翻译系统中具有显著效果。

Abstract: This work proposes a grammar-based chunking strategy that segments input
streams into semantically complete units by parsing dependency relations (e.g.,
noun phrase boundaries, verb-object structures) and punctuation features. The
method ensures chunk coherence and minimizes semantic fragmentation. Building
on this mechanism, we present SASST (Syntax-Aware Simultaneous Speech
Translation), an end-to-end framework integrating frozen Whisper encoder and
decoder-only LLM. The unified architecture dynamically outputs translation
tokens or <WAIT> symbols to jointly optimize translation timing and content,
with target-side reordering addressing word-order divergence. Experiments on
CoVoST2 multilingual corpus En-{De, Zh, Ja} demonstrate significant translation
quality improvements across languages and validate the effectiveness of
syntactic structures in LLM-driven SimulST systems.

Motivation: 传统MoE架构使用同质化专家，固定激活参数，限制了计算效率。Grove MoE旨在通过异质化专家和动态激活解决这一问题。

Method: 引入异质化专家和动态激活机制，基于输入复杂度调整激活参数数量，开发了GroveMoE-Base和GroveMoE-Inst模型。

Result: GroveMoE模型动态激活3.14-3.28B参数，性能与类似或更大规模的SOTA开源模型相当。

Conclusion: Grove MoE架构显著提升了计算效率和模型性能，为LLM的扩展提供了新方向。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture is a cornerstone of modern
state-of-the-art (SOTA) large language models (LLMs). MoE models facilitate
scalability by enabling sparse parameter activation. However, traditional MoE
architecture uses homogeneous experts of a uniform size, activating a fixed
number of parameters irrespective of input complexity and thus limiting
computational efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Grove MoE,
a novel architecture incorporating experts of varying sizes, inspired by the
heterogeneous big.LITTLE CPU architecture. This architecture features novel
adjugate experts with a dynamic activation mechanism, enabling model capacity
expansion while maintaining manageable computational overhead. Building on this
architecture, we present GroveMoE-Base and GroveMoE-Inst, 33B-parameter LLMs
developed by applying an upcycling strategy to the Qwen3-30B-A3B-Base model
during mid-training and post-training. GroveMoE models dynamically activate
3.14-3.28B parameters based on token complexity and achieve performance
comparable to SOTA open-source models of similar or even larger size.

Method: 基于亚里士多德的修辞原则，设计七种说服技巧，并将其嵌入数学任务的回答中，测试LLM评委的反应。

Result: 说服性语言导致LLM评委对错误答案评分虚高8%，且模型规模增大无法显著缓解此问题。

Conclusion: LLM评委易受说服性语言影响，需开发防御机制以应对此类攻击。

Abstract: As large language models take on growing roles as automated evaluators in
practical settings, a critical question arises: Can individuals persuade an LLM
judge to assign unfairly high scores? This study is the first to reveal that
strategically embedded persuasive language can bias LLM judges when scoring
mathematical reasoning tasks, where correctness should be independent of
stylistic variation. Grounded in Aristotle's rhetorical principles, we
formalize seven persuasion techniques (Majority, Consistency, Flattery,
Reciprocity, Pity, Authority, Identity) and embed them into otherwise identical
responses. Across six math benchmarks, we find that persuasive language leads
LLM judges to assign inflated scores to incorrect solutions, by up to 8% on
average, with Consistency causing the most severe distortion. Notably,
increasing model size does not substantially mitigate this vulnerability.
Further analysis demonstrates that combining multiple persuasion techniques
amplifies the bias, and pairwise evaluation is likewise susceptible. Moreover,
the persuasive effect persists under counter prompting strategies, highlighting
a critical vulnerability in LLM-as-a-Judge pipelines and underscoring the need
for robust defenses against persuasion-based attacks.

Motivation: 填补FA领域缺乏组合方法定量评估的研究空白，并论证SA的组合规则同样适用于FA。

Method: 利用通用依赖（UDs）形式化的基本句法规则（如修饰、协调和否定）进行组合分析，并与非组合方法VADER对比。

Result: 组合方法在SA中表现出更高的可解释性和准确性，且结果可推广至FA。

Conclusion: 组合方法在FA和SA中均有效，为相关研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper summarizes the results of evaluating a compositional approach for
Focus Analysis (FA) in Linguistics and Sentiment Analysis (SA) in Natural
Language Processing (NLP). While quantitative evaluations of compositional and
non-compositional approaches in SA exist in NLP, similar quantitative
evaluations are very rare in FA in Linguistics that deal with linguistic
expressions representing focus or emphasis such as "it was John who left". We
fill this gap in research by arguing that compositional rules in SA also apply
to FA because FA and SA are closely related meaning that SA is part of FA. Our
compositional approach in SA exploits basic syntactic rules such as rules of
modification, coordination, and negation represented in the formalism of
Universal Dependencies (UDs) in English and applied to words representing
sentiments from sentiment dictionaries. Some of the advantages of our
compositional analysis method for SA in contrast to non-compositional analysis
methods are interpretability and explainability. We test the accuracy of our
compositional approach and compare it with a non-compositional approach VADER
that uses simple heuristic rules to deal with negation, coordination and
modification. In contrast to previous related work that evaluates
compositionality in SA on long reviews, this study uses more appropriate
datasets to evaluate compositionality. In addition, we generalize the results
of compositional approaches in SA to compositional approaches in FA.

Abstract: Textual data annotation, the process of labeling or tagging text with
relevant information, is typically costly, time-consuming, and labor-intensive.
While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential as direct
alternatives to human annotators for general domains natural language
processing (NLP) tasks, their effectiveness on annotation tasks in domains
requiring expert knowledge remains underexplored. In this paper, we
investigate: whether top-performing LLMs, which might be perceived as having
expert-level proficiency in academic and professional benchmarks, can serve as
direct alternatives to human expert annotators? To this end, we evaluate both
individual LLMs and multi-agent approaches across three highly specialized
domains: finance, biomedicine, and law. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent
discussion framework to simulate a group of human annotators, where LLMs are
tasked to engage in discussions by considering others' annotations and
justifications before finalizing their labels. Additionally, we incorporate
reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) to enable a more comprehensive comparison. Our
empirical results reveal that: (1) Individual LLMs equipped with inference-time
techniques (e.g., chain-of-thought (CoT), self-consistency) show only marginal
or even negative performance gains, contrary to prior literature suggesting
their broad effectiveness. (2) Overall, reasoning models do not demonstrate
statistically significant improvements over non-reasoning models in most
settings. This suggests that extended long CoT provides relatively limited
benefits for data annotation in specialized domains. (3) Certain model
behaviors emerge in the multi-agent discussion environment. For instance,
Claude 3.7 Sonnet with thinking rarely changes its initial annotations, even
when other agents provide correct annotations or valid reasoning.

compare them with 7 general-purpose LLMs. The results show that legal-specific
LLMs consistently outperform general-purpose models, especially on tasks
requiring nuanced legal understanding. Legal-BERT and Contracts-BERT establish
new SOTAs on two of the three tasks, despite having 69% fewer parameters than
the best-performing general-purpose LLM. We also identify CaseLaw-BERT and
LexLM as strong additional baselines for contract understanding. Our results
provide a holistic evaluation of legal-specific LLMs and will facilitate the

general-purpose LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot settings, while fine-tuned LLMs
achieve state-of-the-art results. We analyze how factors such as
multilingualism, model size, and recency influence performance and present an
error analysis highlighting key challenges, particularly in aspect term
prediction. Our findings provide insights into the suitability of LLMs for
Czech ABSA and offer guidance for future research in this area.

Motivation: 解决低资源语言ABSA任务中标注数据稀缺的问题，探索少量目标语言示例对性能的影响。

Method: 在四种ABSA任务、六种目标语言和两种序列到序列模型中，评估加入少量目标语言示例的效果。

Result: 加入十个目标语言示例显著优于零样本设置，结合1000个示例甚至超越单语基线。

Conclusion: 少量高质量目标语言示例对提升跨语言ABSA性能既可行又高效。

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has received substantial attention in
English, yet challenges remain for low-resource languages due to the scarcity
of labelled data. Current cross-lingual ABSA approaches often rely on external
translation tools and overlook the potential benefits of incorporating a small
number of target language examples into training. In this paper, we evaluate
the effect of adding few-shot target language examples to the training set
across four ABSA tasks, six target languages, and two sequence-to-sequence
models. We show that adding as few as ten target language examples
significantly improves performance over zero-shot settings and achieves a
similar effect to constrained decoding in reducing prediction errors.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that combining 1,000 target language examples with
English data can even surpass monolingual baselines. These findings offer
practical insights for improving cross-lingual ABSA in low-resource and
domain-specific settings, as obtaining ten high-quality annotated examples is
both feasible and highly effective.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在提供文化敏感情感支持方面的潜力，填补现有资源不足的空白。

Method: 引入CultureCare数据集，开发四种适应策略，并使用LLM评委、文化内人类标注者和临床心理学家进行评估。

Result: 调整后的LLMs表现优于匿名在线同行回复，但简单的文化角色扮演效果不佳。

Conclusion: LLMs在临床培训中具有潜力，可帮助培养未来治疗师的文化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in offering emotional support and
generating empathetic responses for individuals in distress, but their ability
to deliver culturally sensitive support remains underexplored due to lack of
resources. In this work, we introduce CultureCare, the first dataset designed
for this task, spanning four cultures and including 1729 distress messages,
1523 cultural signals, and 1041 support strategies with fine-grained emotional
and cultural annotations. Leveraging CultureCare, we (i) develop and test four
adaptation strategies for guiding three state-of-the-art LLMs toward culturally
sensitive responses; (ii) conduct comprehensive evaluations using LLM judges,
in-culture human annotators, and clinical psychologists; (iii) show that
adapted LLMs outperform anonymous online peer responses, and that simple
cultural role-play is insufficient for cultural sensitivity; and (iv) explore
the application of LLMs in clinical training, where experts highlight their
potential in fostering cultural competence in future therapists.

Result: 该方法能更一致地表达细腻情感状态，并提升语言学标注的连贯性。

Conclusion: 双参数表示法为手语虚拟角色的情感表达提供了更直观和一致的解决方案。

Abstract: Non-manual signals in sign languages continue to be a challenge for signing
avatars. More specifically, emotional content has been difficult to incorporate
because of a lack of a standard method of specifying the avatar's emotional
state. This paper explores the application of an intuitive two-parameter
representation for emotive non-manual signals to the Paula signing avatar that
shows promise for facilitating the linguistic specification of emotional facial
expressions in a more coherent manner than previous methods. Users can apply
these parameters to control Paula's emotional expressions through a textual
representation called the EASIER notation. The representation can allow avatars
to express more nuanced emotional states using two numerical parameters. It
also has the potential to enable more consistent specification of emotional
non-manual signals in linguistic annotations which drive signing avatars.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学写作需专业知识，现有自动评估方法难以捕捉专家偏好和领域标准，需改进以支持人机协作写作。

Method: 提出GREP框架，分解评估为细粒度维度，结合对比示例，设计两种变体（专有和开源LLM）。

Result: GREP评估更鲁棒，与专家评估强相关，发现当前LLM生成内容难以满足相关工作要求。

Conclusion: GREP框架有效提升科学写作评估质量，但LLM生成内容仍需改进。

Abstract: Expert domain writing, such as scientific writing, typically demands
extensive domain knowledge. Recent advances in LLMs show promising potential in
reducing the expert workload. However, evaluating the quality of automatically
generated scientific writing is a crucial open issue, as it requires knowledge
of domain-specific evaluation criteria and the ability to discern expert
preferences. Conventional automatic metrics and LLM-as-a-judge systems are
insufficient to grasp expert preferences and domain-specific quality standards.
To address this gap and support human-AI collaborative writing, we focus on
related work generation, one of the most challenging scientific tasks, as an
exemplar. We propose GREP, a multi-turn evaluation framework that integrates
classical related work evaluation criteria with expert-specific preferences.
Instead of assigning a single score, our framework decomposes the evaluation
into fine-grained dimensions. This localized evaluation approach is further
augmented with contrastive few-shot examples to provide detailed contextual
guidance for the evaluation dimensions. The design principles allow our
framework to deliver cardinal assessment of quality, which can facilitate
better post-training compared to ordinal preference data. For better
accessibility, we design two variants of GREP: a more precise variant with
proprietary LLMs as evaluators, and a cheaper alternative with open-weight
LLMs. Empirical investigation reveals that our framework is able to assess the
quality of related work sections in a much more robust manner compared to
standard LLM judges, reflects natural scenarios of scientific writing, and
bears a strong correlation with the human expert assessment. We also observe
that generations from state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to satisfy validation
constraints of a suitable related work section. They (mostly) fail to improve
based on feedback as well.

Conclusion: 本文为情感计算、比喻语言处理与LLMs交叉领域的研究者提供了有价值的资源，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Subjective language understanding refers to a broad set of natural language
processing tasks where the goal is to interpret or generate content that
conveys personal feelings, opinions, or figurative meanings rather than
objective facts. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) such as
ChatGPT, LLaMA, and others, there has been a paradigm shift in how we approach
these inherently nuanced tasks. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive
review of recent advances in applying LLMs to subjective language tasks,
including sentiment analysis, emotion recognition, sarcasm detection, humor
understanding, stance detection, metaphor interpretation, intent detection, and
aesthetics assessment. We begin by clarifying the definition of subjective
language from linguistic and cognitive perspectives, and we outline the unique
challenges posed by subjective language (e.g. ambiguity, figurativeness,
context dependence). We then survey the evolution of LLM architectures and
techniques that particularly benefit subjectivity tasks, highlighting why LLMs
are well-suited to model subtle human-like judgments. For each of the eight
tasks, we summarize task definitions, key datasets, state-of-the-art LLM-based
methods, and remaining challenges. We provide comparative insights, discussing
commonalities and differences among tasks and how multi-task LLM approaches
might yield unified models of subjectivity. Finally, we identify open issues
such as data limitations, model bias, and ethical considerations, and suggest
future research directions. We hope this survey will serve as a valuable
resource for researchers and practitioners interested in the intersection of
affective computing, figurative language processing, and large-scale language
models.

Abstract: Current speech translation systems, while having achieved impressive
accuracies, are rather static in their behavior and do not adapt to real-world

usefulness and enable interpreting-like experiences, a precise understanding of
the nature of human interpreting is crucial. To this end, we discuss human
interpreting literature from the perspective of the machine translation field,
while considering both operational and qualitative aspects. We identify
implications for the development of speech translation systems and argue that
there is great potential to adopt many human interpreting principles using
recent modeling techniques. We hope that our findings provide inspiration for
closing the perceived usability gap, and can motivate progress toward true
machine interpreting.

Motivation: 现有SiLM模型评估规模小、系统性不足且缺乏可比性，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 比较了Structformer、UDGN和GPST三种模型在句法表示、语法判断任务和训练动态上的表现。

Result: GPST在长距离依赖任务中表现最佳，且小型模型在合成数据上训练有助于评估基本特性。

Conclusion: GPST表现最稳定，合成数据训练的小模型为评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Structure-inducing Language Models (SiLM) are trained on a self-supervised
language modeling task, and induce a hierarchical sentence representation as a
byproduct when processing an input. A wide variety of SiLMs have been proposed.
However, these have typically been evaluated on a relatively small scale, and
evaluation of these models has systematic gaps and lacks comparability. In this
work, we study three different SiLM architectures using both natural language
(English) corpora and synthetic bracketing expressions: Structformer (Shen et
al., 2021), UDGN (Shen et al., 2022) and GPST (Hu et al., 2024). We compare
them with respect to (i) properties of the induced syntactic representations
(ii) performance on grammaticality judgment tasks, and (iii) training dynamics.
We find that none of the three architectures dominates across all evaluation
metrics. However, there are significant differences, in particular with respect
to the induced syntactic representations. The Generative Pretrained Structured
Transformer (GPST; Hu et al. 2024) performs most consistently across evaluation
settings, and outperforms the other models on long-distance dependencies in
bracketing expressions. Furthermore, our study shows that small models trained
on large amounts of synthetic data provide a useful testbed for evaluating
basic model properties.

Conclusion: ASearcher在简单设计下超越现有开源32B代理，成果已开源。

Abstract: Recent advancements in LLM-based agents have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in handling complex, knowledge-intensive tasks by integrating
external tools. Among diverse choices of tools, search tools play a pivotal
role in accessing vast external knowledge. However, open-source agents still
fall short of achieving expert-level Search Intelligence, the ability to
resolve ambiguous queries, generate precise searches, analyze results, and
conduct thorough exploration. Existing approaches fall short in scalability,
efficiency, and data quality. For example, small turn limits in existing online
RL methods, e.g. <=10, restrict complex strategy learning. This paper
introduces ASearcher, an open-source project for large-scale RL training of
search agents. Our key contributions include: (1) Scalable fully asynchronous
RL training that enables long-horizon search while maintaining high training
efficiency. (2) A prompt-based LLM agent that autonomously synthesizes
high-quality and challenging QAs, creating a large-scale QA dataset. Through RL
training, our prompt-based QwQ-32B agent achieves substantial improvements,
with 46.7% and 20.8% Avg@4 gains on xBench and GAIA, respectively. Notably, our
agent exhibits extreme long-horizon search, with tool calls exceeding 40 turns
and output tokens exceeding 150k during training time. With a simple agent
design and no external LLMs, ASearcher-Web-QwQ achieves Avg@4 scores of 42.1 on
xBench and 52.8 on GAIA, surpassing existing open-source 32B agents. We
open-source our models, training data, and codes in

Conclusion: MCC为隐喻检测、生成系统和患者沟通工具等研究提供了基础资源。

Abstract: Metaphor is a fundamental cognitive mechanism that shapes scientific
understanding, enabling the communication of complex concepts while potentially
constraining paradigmatic thinking. Despite the prevalence of figurative
language in scientific discourse, existing metaphor detection resources
primarily focus on general-domain text, leaving a critical gap for
domain-specific applications. In this paper, we present the Medical Metaphors
Corpus (MCC), a comprehensive dataset of 792 annotated scientific conceptual
metaphors spanning medical and biological domains. MCC aggregates metaphorical
expressions from diverse sources including peer-reviewed literature, news
media, social media discourse, and crowdsourced contributions, providing both
binary and graded metaphoricity judgments validated through human annotation.
Each instance includes source-target conceptual mappings and perceived
metaphoricity scores on a 0-7 scale, establishing the first annotated resource
for computational scientific metaphor research. Our evaluation demonstrates
that state-of-the-art language models achieve modest performance on scientific
metaphor detection, revealing substantial room for improvement in
domain-specific figurative language understanding. MCC enables multiple
research applications including metaphor detection benchmarking, quality-aware
generation systems, and patient-centered communication tools.

Abstract: From professional research to everyday planning, many tasks are bottlenecked
by wide-scale information seeking, which is more repetitive than cognitively
complex. With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), automated
search agents powered by LLMs offer a promising solution to liberate humans
from this tedious work. However, the capability of these agents to perform such
"wide-context" collection reliably and completely remains largely unevaluated
due to a lack of suitable benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce
WideSearch, a new benchmark engineered to evaluate agent reliability on these
large-scale collection tasks. The benchmark features 200 manually curated
questions (100 in English, 100 in Chinese) from over 15 diverse domains,
grounded in real user queries. Each task requires agents to collect large-scale
atomic information, which could be verified one by one objectively, and arrange
it into a well-organized output. A rigorous five-stage quality control pipeline
ensures the difficulty, completeness, and verifiability of the dataset. We
benchmark over 10 state-of-the-art agentic search systems, including
single-agent, multi-agent frameworks, and end-to-end commercial systems. Most
systems achieve overall success rates near 0\%, with the best performer
reaching just 5\%. However, given sufficient time, cross-validation by multiple
human testers can achieve a near 100\% success rate. These results demonstrate
that present search agents have critical deficiencies in large-scale
information seeking, underscoring urgent areas for future research and
development in agentic search. Our dataset, evaluation pipeline, and benchmark
results have been publicly released at https://widesearch-seed.github.io/

Method: 通过最优传输对齐和融合相邻层的Transformer块，创建新层。

Result: OpT-DeUS在持续预训练和监督微调中表现优于现有方法，且插入新层靠近顶部时效率更高。

Conclusion: OpT-DeUS有效解决了神经元排列不匹配问题，提升了训练效率和模型性能。

Abstract: Scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) yields performance gains but incurs
substantial training costs. Depth up-scaling offers training efficiency by
adding new layers to pre-trained models. However, most existing methods copy or
average weights from base layers, neglecting neuron permutation differences.
This limitation can potentially cause misalignment that harms performance.
Inspired by applying Optimal Transport (OT) for neuron alignment, we propose
Optimal Transport Depth Up-Scaling (OpT-DeUS). OpT-DeUS aligns and fuses
Transformer blocks in adjacent base layers via OT for new layer creation, to
mitigate neuron permutation mismatch between layers. OpT-DeUS achieves better
overall performance and offers improved training efficiency than existing
methods for continual pre-training and supervised fine-tuning across different
model sizes. To further evaluate the impact of interpolation positions, our
extensive analysis shows that inserting new layers closer to the top results in
higher training efficiency due to shorter back-propagation time while obtaining
additional performance gains.

Abstract: Conversational systems relying on text-based large language models (LLMs)
often overlook paralinguistic cues, essential for understanding emotions and
intentions. Speech-language models (SLMs), which use speech as input, are
emerging as a promising solution. However, SLMs built by extending frozen LLMs
struggle to capture paralinguistic information and exhibit reduced context
understanding. We identify entangled information and improper training
strategies as key issues. To address these issues, we propose two heterogeneous
adapters and suggest a weakly supervised training strategy. Our approach
disentangles paralinguistic and linguistic information, enabling SLMs to
interpret speech through structured representations. It also preserves
contextual understanding by avoiding the generation of task-specific vectors
through controlled randomness. This approach trains only the adapters on common
datasets, ensuring parameter and data efficiency. Experiments demonstrate
competitive performance in emotional conversation tasks, showcasing the model's
ability to effectively integrate both paralinguistic and linguistic information
within contextual settings.

Method: 提出GEDE数据集（含900篇学生作文和12,500篇LLM生成文本），定义贡献级别（从纯人类写作到完全LLM生成），并测试多种检测器的性能。

Result: 多数检测器对中等贡献级别的文本（如LLM改进的人类文本）分类不准确，易产生假阳性。

Conclusion: 现有检测器在教育场景中效果有限，需改进以减少误判对学生的影响。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their increased
accessibility have made it easier than ever for students to automatically
generate texts, posing new challenges for educational institutions. To enforce
norms of academic integrity and ensure students' learning, learning analytics
methods to automatically detect LLM-generated text appear increasingly
appealing. This paper benchmarks the performance of different state-of-the-art
detectors in educational contexts, introducing a novel dataset, called
Generative Essay Detection in Education (GEDE), containing over 900
student-written essays and over 12,500 LLM-generated essays from various
domains. To capture the diversity of LLM usage practices in generating text, we
propose the concept of contribution levels, representing students' contribution
to a given assignment. These levels range from purely human-written texts, to
slightly LLM-improved versions, to fully LLM-generated texts, and finally to
active attacks on the detector by "humanizing" generated texts. We show that
most detectors struggle to accurately classify texts of intermediate student
contribution levels, like LLM-improved human-written texts. Detectors are
particularly likely to produce false positives, which is problematic in
educational settings where false suspicions can severely impact students'
lives. Our dataset, code, and additional supplementary materials are publicly

Abstract: Self-supervised models for speech representation learning now see widespread
use for their versatility and performance on downstream tasks, but the effect
of model architecture on the linguistic information learned in their
representations remains under-studied. This study investigates two such models,
HuBERT and wav2vec 2.0, and minimally compares two of their architectural
differences: training objective and iterative pseudo-label refinement through
multiple training iterations. We find that differences in canonical correlation
of hidden representations to word identity, phoneme identity, and speaker
identity are explained by training iteration, not training objective. We
suggest that future work investigate the reason for the effectiveness of
iterative refinement in encoding linguistic information in self-supervised
speech representations.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel Czech dataset for aspect-based sentiment
analysis (ABSA), which consists of 3.1K manually annotated reviews from the
restaurant domain. The dataset is built upon the older Czech dataset, which
contained only separate labels for the basic ABSA tasks such as aspect term
extraction or aspect polarity detection. Unlike its predecessor, our new
dataset is specifically designed for more complex tasks, e.g.
target-aspect-category detection. These advanced tasks require a unified
annotation format, seamlessly linking sentiment elements (labels) together. Our
dataset follows the format of the well-known SemEval-2016 datasets. This design
choice allows effortless application and evaluation in cross-lingual scenarios,
ultimately fostering cross-language comparisons with equivalent counterpart
datasets in other languages. The annotation process engaged two trained
annotators, yielding an impressive inter-annotator agreement rate of
approximately 90%. Additionally, we provide 24M reviews without annotations
suitable for unsupervised learning. We present robust monolingual baseline
results achieved with various Transformer-based models and insightful error
analysis to supplement our contributions. Our code and dataset are freely
available for non-commercial research purposes.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为OTReg的方法，通过最优传输正则化减少语音与文本表示之间的模态差距，提升语音语言模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音语言模型（SLMs）在处理语音输入时泛化能力不足，可能未按预期以文本方式处理语音，主要原因是语音与文本表示之间的模态差距。

Method: 引入最优传输正则化（OTReg），将语音与文本对齐建模为最优传输问题，通过正则化损失优化SLMs的训练。

Result: 实验表明，OTReg能有效提升语音与文本的对齐性，减少模态差距，从而增强SLMs在多语言ASR任务中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: OTReg是一种轻量级方法，无需额外标签或参数，可无缝集成到现有SLM训练中，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Spoken Language Models (SLMs), which extend Large Language Models (LLMs) to
perceive speech inputs, have gained increasing attention for their potential to
advance speech understanding tasks. However, despite recent progress, studies
show that SLMs often struggle to generalize across datasets, even for trained
languages and tasks, raising concerns about whether they process speech in a
text-like manner as intended. A key challenge underlying this limitation is the
modality gap between speech and text representations. The high variability in
speech embeddings may allow SLMs to achieve strong in-domain performance by
exploiting unintended speech variations, ultimately hindering generalization.
To mitigate this modality gap, we introduce Optimal Transport Regularization
(OTReg), a method that formulates speech-text alignment as an optimal transport
problem and derives a regularization loss to improve SLM training. In each
training iteration, OTReg first establishes a structured correspondence between
speech and transcript embeddings by determining the optimal transport plan,
then incorporates the regularization loss based on this transport plan to
optimize SLMs in generating speech embeddings that align more effectively with
transcript embeddings. OTReg is lightweight, requiring no additional labels or
learnable parameters, and integrates seamlessly into existing SLM training
procedures. Extensive multilingual ASR experiments demonstrate that OTReg
enhances speech-text alignment, mitigates the modality gap, and consequently
improves SLM generalization across diverse datasets.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）生成不可靠内容的问题，提出了一种基于令牌级不确定性的可靠性估计方法，以改进不可靠输出的检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在多轮或代理应用中容易生成流畅但不正确的内容（即虚构），这增加了风险。研究旨在探索上下文信息如何影响模型行为，以及LLMs是否能识别其不可靠响应。

Method: 提出了一种可靠性估计方法，通过计算输出逻辑的偶然性和认知不确定性来识别显著令牌，并将其隐藏状态聚合为紧凑表示，用于响应级可靠性预测。

Result: 实验表明，正确的上下文信息提高了答案准确性和模型置信度，而误导性上下文常导致模型自信地生成错误答案，揭示了不确定性与正确性之间的不一致。基于探测的方法改进了对不可靠输出的检测。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了直接不确定性信号的局限性，并强调了不确定性引导探测在可靠性感知生成中的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to generating fluent but incorrect
content, known as confabulation, which poses increasing risks in multi-turn or
agentic applications where outputs may be reused as context. In this work, we
investigate how in-context information influences model behavior and whether
LLMs can identify their unreliable responses. We propose a reliability
estimation that leverages token-level uncertainty to guide the aggregation of
internal model representations. Specifically, we compute aleatoric and
epistemic uncertainty from output logits to identify salient tokens and
aggregate their hidden states into compact representations for response-level
reliability prediction. Through controlled experiments on open QA benchmarks,
we find that correct in-context information improves both answer accuracy and
model confidence, while misleading context often induces confidently incorrect
responses, revealing a misalignment between uncertainty and correctness. Our
probing-based method captures these shifts in model behavior and improves the
detection of unreliable outputs across multiple open-source LLMs. These results
underscore the limitations of direct uncertainty signals and highlight the
potential of uncertainty-guided probing for reliability-aware generation.

TL;DR: Dual-Div框架通过两阶段检索和排序，优化生物医学ICL任务中的示例选择，提升多样性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生物医学NLP任务中选择示例时偏重代表性而忽视多样性，Dual-Div旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用两阶段检索和排序：首阶段优化代表性和多样性筛选候选示例，次阶段根据测试查询排名选择最优演示。

Result: 在三个生物医学NLP任务中，Dual-Div显著优于基线方法（最高提升5%宏F1分数），且对提示变化和类别不平衡具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 初始检索阶段的多样性比排序阶段优化更重要，且3-5个示例能最大化性能效率。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has leveraged their
in-context learning (ICL) abilities to enable quick adaptation to unseen
biomedical NLP tasks. By incorporating only a few input-output examples into
prompts, LLMs can rapidly perform these new tasks. While the impact of these
demonstrations on LLM performance has been extensively studied, most existing
approaches prioritize representativeness over diversity when selecting examples
from large corpora. To address this gap, we propose Dual-Div, a
diversity-enhanced data-efficient framework for demonstration selection in
biomedical ICL. Dual-Div employs a two-stage retrieval and ranking process:
First, it identifies a limited set of candidate examples from a corpus by
optimizing both representativeness and diversity (with optional annotation for
unlabeled data). Second, it ranks these candidates against test queries to
select the most relevant and non-redundant demonstrations. Evaluated on three
biomedical NLP tasks (named entity recognition (NER), relation extraction (RE),
and text classification (TC)) using LLaMA 3.1 and Qwen 2.5 for inference, along
with three retrievers (BGE-Large, BMRetriever, MedCPT), Dual-Div consistently
outperforms baselines-achieving up to 5% higher macro-F1 scores-while
demonstrating robustness to prompt permutations and class imbalance. Our
findings establish that diversity in initial retrieval is more critical than
ranking-stage optimization, and limiting demonstrations to 3-5 examples
maximizes performance efficiency.

Motivation: LLM在强化学习中容易陷入无效推理路径（“死胡同”），导致决策不准确，影响探索和政策优化。

Method: 提出REX-RAG框架，结合混合采样策略（探测采样和探索性提示）和政策校正机制（重要性采样）。

Result: 在七个问答基准测试中，REX-RAG平均性能提升5.1%（Qwen2.5-3B）和3.6%（Qwen2.5-7B）。

Conclusion: REX-RAG有效解决了LLM在强化学习中的推理路径问题，性能显著优于基线方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is emerging as a powerful paradigm for enabling
large language models (LLMs) to perform complex reasoning tasks. Recent
advances indicate that integrating RL with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
allows LLMs to dynamically incorporate external knowledge, leading to more
informed and robust decision making. However, we identify a critical challenge
during policy-driven trajectory sampling: LLMs are frequently trapped in
unproductive reasoning paths, which we refer to as "dead ends", committing to
overconfident yet incorrect conclusions. This severely hampers exploration and
undermines effective policy optimization. To address this challenge, we propose
REX-RAG (Reasoning Exploration with Policy Correction in Retrieval-Augmented
Generation), a novel framework that explores alternative reasoning paths while
maintaining rigorous policy learning through principled distributional
corrections. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) Mixed Sampling
Strategy, which combines a novel probe sampling method with exploratory prompts
to escape dead ends; and (2) Policy Correction Mechanism, which employs
importance sampling to correct distribution shifts induced by mixed sampling,
thereby mitigating gradient estimation bias. We evaluate it on seven
question-answering benchmarks, and the experimental results show that REX-RAG
achieves average performance gains of 5.1% on Qwen2.5-3B and 3.6% on Qwen2.5-7B
over strong baselines, demonstrating competitive results across multiple
datasets. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/MiliLab/REX-RAG.

improvements. In this paper, we extend the DisCo by incorporating annotator
metadata, enhancing input representations, and modifying the loss functions to
capture disagreement patterns better. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate substantial improvements in both soft and perspectivist evaluation
metrics across three datasets. We also conduct in-depth error and calibration
analyses, highlighting the conditions under which improvements occur. Our
findings underscore the value of disagreement-aware modeling and offer insights
into how system components interact with the complexity of human-annotated

Method: 详细介绍了训练和推理优化技术，以支持Llama模型的EAGLE-based推测解码生产级扩展。

Result: 在8个NVIDIA H100 GPU上，Llama4 Maverick的推理延迟为每token约4毫秒（批量为1），比之前最优方法快10%。对于大批量，优化实现了1.4x到2.0x的加速。

Conclusion: 通过优化技术，论文实现了Llama模型在生产规模下的EAGLE-based推测解码，显著提升了推理速度。

Abstract: Speculative decoding is a standard method for accelerating the inference
speed of large language models. However, scaling it for production environments
poses several engineering challenges, including efficiently implementing
different operations (e.g., tree attention and multi-round speculative
decoding) on GPU. In this paper, we detail the training and inference
optimization techniques that we have implemented to enable EAGLE-based
speculative decoding at a production scale for Llama models. With these
changes, we achieve a new state-of-the-art inference latency for Llama models.
For example, Llama4 Maverick decodes at a speed of about 4 ms per token (with a
batch size of one) on 8 NVIDIA H100 GPUs, which is 10% faster than the
previously best known method. Furthermore, for EAGLE-based speculative
decoding, our optimizations enable us to achieve a speed-up for large batch
sizes between 1.4x and 2.0x at production scale.

Method: 使用多种推理时不确定性度量方法，包括传统指标和新变体，评估其与人类群体不确定性和模型校准的关联。

Result: 研究发现部分度量方法与人类不确定性高度一致，且模型校准效果良好，尽管与人类答案偏好不一致。

Conclusion: 结论表明某些不确定性度量方法能有效反映人类不确定性，且模型校准效果显著。

Abstract: There has been much recent interest in evaluating large language models for
uncertainty calibration to facilitate model control and modulate user trust.
Inference time uncertainty, which may provide a real-time signal to the model
or external control modules, is particularly important for applying these
concepts to improve LLM-user experience in practice. While many of the existing
papers consider model calibration, comparatively little work has sought to
evaluate how closely model uncertainty aligns to human uncertainty. In this
work, we evaluate a collection of inference-time uncertainty measures, using
both established metrics and novel variations, to determine how closely they
align with both human group-level uncertainty and traditional notions of model
calibration. We find that numerous measures show evidence of strong alignment
to human uncertainty, even despite the lack of alignment to human answer
preference. For those successful metrics, we find moderate to strong evidence
of model calibration in terms of both correctness correlation and
distributional analysis.

TL;DR: SAEMark是一种后处理多比特水印框架，通过推理时基于特征的拒绝采样嵌入个性化消息，无需修改模型逻辑或训练，适用于多语言和API模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水印方法会降低文本质量，且需要白盒模型访问和逻辑操作，限制了其在API模型和多语言场景的应用。

Method: SAEMark利用生成文本的确定性特征，选择特征统计与密钥目标一致的输出，通过采样而非修改来保持文本质量。

Result: 实验表明SAEMark在4个数据集上表现一致，英语F1达99.7%，多比特检测准确率高。

Conclusion: SAEMark为闭源LLM提供了一种可扩展的水印范式，支持内容归属且无需修改模型。

Abstract: Watermarking LLM-generated text is critical for content attribution and
misinformation prevention. However, existing methods compromise text quality,
require white-box model access and logit manipulation. These limitations
exclude API-based models and multilingual scenarios. We propose SAEMark, a
general framework for post-hoc multi-bit watermarking that embeds personalized
messages solely via inference-time, feature-based rejection sampling without
altering model logits or requiring training. Our approach operates on
deterministic features extracted from generated text, selecting outputs whose
feature statistics align with key-derived targets. This framework naturally
generalizes across languages and domains while preserving text quality through
sampling LLM outputs instead of modifying. We provide theoretical guarantees
relating watermark success probability and compute budget that hold for any
suitable feature extractor. Empirically, we demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), achieving superior detection
accuracy and text quality. Experiments across 4 datasets show SAEMark's
consistent performance, with 99.7% F1 on English and strong multi-bit detection
accuracy. SAEMark establishes a new paradigm for scalable watermarking that
works out-of-the-box with closed-source LLMs while enabling content
attribution.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（如GPT-5）在医疗领域中的多模态推理能力，以支持复杂的临床决策。

Method: 系统评估GPT-5及其变体在多个医疗问答基准（如MedQA、MedXpertQA等）上的零样本推理性能，并与人类专家对比。

Result: GPT-5在所有基准测试中表现最佳，尤其在多模态推理方面显著优于GPT-4o和人类专家。

Conclusion: GPT-5在医疗多模态推理任务中达到超越人类专家的水平，为未来临床决策支持系统设计提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled general-purpose
systems to perform increasingly complex domain-specific reasoning without
extensive fine-tuning. In the medical domain, decision-making often requires
integrating heterogeneous information sources, including patient narratives,
structured data, and medical images. This study positions GPT-5 as a generalist
multimodal reasoner for medical decision support and systematically evaluates
its zero-shot chain-of-thought reasoning performance on both text-based
question answering and visual question answering tasks under a unified
protocol. We benchmark GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, GPT-5-nano, and GPT-4o-2024-11-20
against standardized splits of MedQA, MedXpertQA (text and multimodal), MMLU
medical subsets, USMLE self-assessment exams, and VQA-RAD. Results show that
GPT-5 consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving state-of-the-art
accuracy across all QA benchmarks and delivering substantial gains in
multimodal reasoning. On MedXpertQA MM, GPT-5 improves reasoning and
understanding scores by +29.62% and +36.18% over GPT-4o, respectively, and
surpasses pre-licensed human experts by +24.23% in reasoning and +29.40% in
understanding. In contrast, GPT-4o remains below human expert performance in
most dimensions. A representative case study demonstrates GPT-5's ability to
integrate visual and textual cues into a coherent diagnostic reasoning chain,
recommending appropriate high-stakes interventions. Our results show that, on
these controlled multimodal reasoning benchmarks, GPT-5 moves from
human-comparable to above human-expert performance. This improvement may
substantially inform the design of future clinical decision-support systems.

Result: 实验显示，该方法与专家评估一致性最高，且评估理由更易解释。

Conclusion: PsyCrisis-Bench及其数据集为心理健康对话的安全对齐研究提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Evaluating the safety alignment of LLM responses in high-risk mental health
dialogues is particularly difficult due to missing gold-standard answers and
the ethically sensitive nature of these interactions. To address this
challenge, we propose PsyCrisis-Bench, a reference-free evaluation benchmark
based on real-world Chinese mental health dialogues. It evaluates whether the
model responses align with the safety principles defined by experts.
Specifically designed for settings without standard references, our method
adopts a prompt-based LLM-as-Judge approach that conducts in-context evaluation
using expert-defined reasoning chains grounded in psychological intervention
principles. We employ binary point-wise scoring across multiple safety
dimensions to enhance the explainability and traceability of the evaluation.
Additionally, we present a manually curated, high-quality Chinese-language
dataset covering self-harm, suicidal ideation, and existential distress,
derived from real-world online discourse. Experiments on 3600 judgments show
that our method achieves the highest agreement with expert assessments and
produces more interpretable evaluation rationales compared to existing
approaches. Our dataset and evaluation tool are publicly available to
facilitate further research.

Abstract: Unlimited, or so-called helpful-only language models are trained without
safety alignment constraints and never refuse user queries. They are widely
used by leading AI companies as internal tools for red teaming and alignment
evaluation. For example, if a safety-aligned model produces harmful outputs
similar to an unlimited model, this indicates alignment failures that require
further attention. Despite their essential role in assessing alignment, such
models are not available to the research community.
  We introduce Jinx, a helpful-only variant of popular open-weight LLMs. Jinx
responds to all queries without refusals or safety filtering, while preserving
the base model's capabilities in reasoning and instruction following. It
provides researchers with an accessible tool for probing alignment failures,
evaluating safety boundaries, and systematically studying failure modes in
language model safety.

Motivation: Pasur游戏规则复杂且游戏树庞大，传统方法难以高效处理，因此需要一种高效的计算框架。

Method: 使用PyTorch CUDA张量处理规则复杂性，将游戏树分解为实际状态和继承分数，采用逐轮反向训练策略减少内存开销。

Result: 构建了包含超过10^9个节点的完整游戏树，并通过大规模自对弈估计每副牌的公平价值。

Conclusion: 该框架可扩展至其他多轮分解的强化学习算法，如回合制策略游戏或金融市场序列决策。

Abstract: Pasur is a fishing card game played over six rounds and is played similarly
to games such as Cassino and Scopa, and Bastra. This paper introduces a
CUDA-accelerated computational framework for simulating Pasur, emphasizing
efficient memory management. We use our framework to compute near-Nash
equilibria via Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR), a well-known algorithm
for solving large imperfect-information games.
  Solving Pasur presents unique challenges due to its intricate rules and the
large size of its game tree. We handle rule complexity using PyTorch CUDA
tensors and to address the memory-intensive nature of the game, we decompose
the game tree into two key components: (1) actual game states, and (2)
inherited scores from previous rounds. We construct the Full Game Tree by
pairing card states with accumulated scores in the Unfolding Process. This
design reduces memory overhead by storing only essential strategy values and
node connections. To further manage computational complexity, we apply a
round-by-round backward training strategy, starting from the final round and
recursively propagating average utilities to earlier stages. Our approach
constructs the complete game tree, which on average consists of over $10^9$
nodes. We provide detailed implementation snippets.
  After computing a near-Nash equilibrium strategy, we train a tree-based model
to predict these strategies for use during gameplay. We then estimate the fair
value of each deck through large-scale self-play between equilibrium strategies
by simulating, for instance, 10,000 games per matchup, executed in parallel
using GPU acceleration.
  Similar frameworks can be extended to other reinforcement learning algorithms
where the action tree naturally decomposes into multiple rounds such as
turn-based strategy games or sequential trading decisions in financial markets.

Abstract: The history of science is punctuated by serendipitous discoveries, where
unexpected observations, rather than targeted hypotheses, opened new fields of
inquiry. While modern autonomous laboratories excel at accelerating hypothesis
testing, their optimization for efficiency risks overlooking these crucial,
unplanned findings. To address this gap, we introduce SciLink, an open-source,
multi-agent artificial intelligence framework designed to operationalize
serendipity in materials research by creating a direct, automated link between
experimental observation, novelty assessment, and theoretical simulations. The
framework employs a hybrid AI strategy where specialized machine learning
models perform quantitative analysis of experimental data, while large language
models handle higher-level reasoning. These agents autonomously convert raw
data from materials characterization techniques into falsifiable scientific
claims, which are then quantitatively scored for novelty against the published
literature. We demonstrate the framework's versatility across diverse research
scenarios, showcasing its application to atomic-resolution and hyperspectral
data, its capacity to integrate real-time human expert guidance, and its
ability to close the research loop by proposing targeted follow-up experiments.
By systematically analyzing all observations and contextualizing them, SciLink
provides a practical framework for AI-driven materials research that not only
enhances efficiency but also actively cultivates an environment ripe for
serendipitous discoveries, thereby bridging the gap between automated
experimentation and open-ended scientific exploration.

leading to suboptimal and constrained performance, (2) Close-loop training
relies heavily on high-fidelity sensor simulation, where domain gaps and
computational inefficiencies pose significant barriers. In this paper, we
introduce IRL-VLA, a novel close-loop Reinforcement Learning via
\textbf{I}nverse \textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{L}earning reward world model
with a self-built VLA approach. Our framework proceeds in a three-stage
paradigm: In the first stage, we propose a VLA architecture and pretrain the
VLA policy via imitation learning. In the second stage, we construct a
lightweight reward world model via inverse reinforcement learning to enable
efficient close-loop reward computation. To further enhance planning
performance, finally, we design specialized reward world model guidence
reinforcement learning via PPO(Proximal Policy Optimization) to effectively
balance the safety incidents, comfortable driving, and traffic efficiency. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in NAVSIM v2 end-to-end driving
benchmark, 1st runner up in CVPR2025 Autonomous Grand Challenge. We hope that
our framework will accelerate VLA research in close-loop autonomous driving.

### [320] [CountQA: How Well Do MLLMs Count in the Wild?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06585)
*Jayant Sravan Tamarapalli,Rynaa Grover,Nilay Pande,Sahiti Yerramilli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文指出多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在物体计数能力上存在严重不足，并提出了CountQA基准测试来评估和改进这一缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在视觉场景理解上表现流畅，但缺乏基本的物体计数能力，限制了其在实际应用中的可靠性。现有基准测试未能充分评估复杂场景下的计数能力。

Method: 作者设计了CountQA基准测试，包含1,500多个问答对，涵盖高密度、杂乱和遮挡的真实世界图像，并评估了15种主流MLLMs的表现。

Result: 表现最佳的模型准确率仅为42.9%，且随着物体数量增加，性能下降。

Conclusion: CountQA为诊断和改进MLLMs的计数能力提供了工具，推动了更具数值基础和空间感知能力的MLLMs发展。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable fluency in
understanding visual scenes, yet they exhibit a critical lack in a fundamental
cognitive skill: object counting. This blind spot severely limits their
reliability in real-world applications. To date, this capability has been
largely unevaluated in complex scenarios, as existing benchmarks either feature
sparse object densities or are confined to specific visual domains, failing to
test models under realistic conditions. Addressing this gap, we introduce
CountQA, a challenging new benchmark designed to probe this deficiency.
Comprising over 1,500 question-answer pairs, CountQA features real-world images
with high object density, clutter, and occlusion. We investigate this weakness
by evaluating 15 prominent MLLMs on the CountQA benchmark and reveal that the
top-performing model achieves a mere 42.9% accuracy, with performance declining
as object counts rise. By providing a dedicated benchmark to diagnose and
rectify this core weakness, CountQA paves the way for a new generation of MLLMs
that are not only descriptively fluent but also numerically grounded and
spatially aware. We will open-source the dataset and code upon paper acceptance
to foster further research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文总结了形式概念分析（FCA）在变异性分析中的关键属性及其应用方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管FCA在知识表示和发现方面具有潜力，但其数学基础文献使得如何利用其属性进行变异性分析并不直观。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过筛选FCA框架中与变异性分析相关的关键属性，并探讨如何利用这些属性解释概念结构中的变异性信息。

Result: 确定了FCA中可用于变异性分析的关键属性，并提供了如何利用这些属性解释变异性信息的方法。

Conclusion: 本文为FCA在变异性分析中的应用提供了实用指导，帮助研究者更好地理解和利用FCA的潜力。

Abstract: Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is a mathematical framework for knowledge
representation and discovery. It performs a hierarchical clustering over a set
of objects described by attributes, resulting in conceptual structures in which
objects are organized depending on the attributes they share. These conceptual
structures naturally highlight commonalities and variabilities among similar
objects by categorizing them into groups which are then arranged by similarity,
making it particularly appropriate for variability extraction and analysis.
Despite the potential of FCA, determining which of its properties can be
leveraged for variability-related tasks (and how) is not always
straightforward, partly due to the mathematical orientation of its foundational
literature. This paper attempts to bridge part of this gap by gathering a
selection of properties of the framework which are essential to variability
analysis, and how they can be used to interpret diverse variability information
within the resulting conceptual structures.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于像素的轨迹校准辅助方法，用于零样本细胞轨迹地图匹配（CTMM），通过迁移地理空间知识校准轨迹，并结合高斯混合模型和时空感知模块提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CTMM方法依赖ID特征和区域特定数据，难以适应未探索区域，需开发无需目标区域训练的零样本方法。

Method: 结合高斯混合模型的VAE提取场景自适应特征，设计时空感知模块捕获序列特征和位置不确定性，使用约束路径查找算法重建道路ID序列。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在零样本CTMM中性能优于现有方法16.8%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过知识迁移和不确定性处理，显著提升了零样本CTMM的准确性和适应性。

Abstract: Cellular Trajectory Map-Matching (CTMM) aims to align cellular location
sequences to road networks, which is a necessary preprocessing in
location-based services on web platforms like Google Maps, including navigation
and route optimization. Current approaches mainly rely on ID-based features and
region-specific data to learn correlations between cell towers and roads,
limiting their adaptability to unexplored areas. To enable high-accuracy CTMM
without additional training in target regions, Zero-shot CTMM requires to
extract not only region-adaptive features, but also sequential and location
uncertainty to alleviate positioning errors in cellular data. In this paper, we
propose a pixel-based trajectory calibration assistant for zero-shot CTMM,
which takes advantage of transferable geospatial knowledge to calibrate
pixelated trajectory, and then guide the path-finding process at the road
network level. To enhance knowledge sharing across similar regions, a Gaussian
mixture model is incorporated into VAE, enabling the identification of
scenario-adaptive experts through soft clustering. To mitigate high positioning
errors, a spatial-temporal awareness module is designed to capture sequential
features and location uncertainty, thereby facilitating the inference of
approximate user positions. Finally, a constrained path-finding algorithm is
employed to reconstruct the road ID sequence, ensuring topological validity
within the road network. This process is guided by the calibrated trajectory
while optimizing for the shortest feasible path, thus minimizing unnecessary
detours. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms existing
methods in zero-shot CTMM by 16.8\%.

*Jaikrishna Manojkumar Patil,Nathaniel Lee,Al Mehdi Saadat Chowdhury,YooJung Choi,Paulo Shakarian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过发现规则上下文并利用概率分布优化规则集，显著减少规则数量同时保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于规则的知识图谱补全方法中规则数量过多导致解释性下降的问题。

Method: 从训练数据中发现规则上下文，利用概率电路学习规则上下文的概率分布，快速达到完整规则集的性能。

Result: 规则数量减少70-96%，性能优于基线31倍，保留91%的峰值性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在8个标准数据集上验证有效，为基于规则的推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Rule-based methods for knowledge graph completion provide explainable results
but often require a significantly large number of rules to achieve competitive
performance. This can hinder explainability due to overwhelmingly large rule
sets. We discover rule contexts (meaningful subsets of rules that work
together) from training data and use learned probability distribution (i.e.
probabilistic circuits) over these rule contexts to more rapidly achieve
performance of the full rule set. Our approach achieves a 70-96% reduction in
number of rules used while outperforming baseline by up to 31$\times$ when
using equivalent minimal number of rules and preserves 91% of peak baseline
performance even when comparing our minimal rule sets against baseline's full
rule sets. We show that our framework is grounded in well-known semantics of
probabilistic logic, does not require independence assumptions, and that our
tractable inference procedure provides both approximate lower bounds and exact
probability of a given query. The efficacy of our method is validated by
empirical studies on 8 standard benchmark datasets where we show competitive
performance by using only a fraction of the rules required by AnyBURL's
standard inference method, the current state-of-the-art for rule-based
knowledge graph completion. This work may have further implications for general
probabilistic reasoning over learned sets of rules.

TL;DR: GLIDR是一种可微分的归纳逻辑编程方法，通过更丰富的语法和消息传递推理算法，提升了知识图谱任务中的规则学习和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设链式规则结构，限制了性能和可解释性，GLIDR旨在解决这一问题。

Method: GLIDR使用可微分的消息传递推理算法，支持分支和循环等复杂规则结构，并允许从模型权重中提取显式逻辑规则。

Result: GLIDR在知识图谱补全任务中显著优于现有规则学习方法，甚至可与嵌入方法竞争，且对训练数据噪声具有高度鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GLIDR不仅提升了规则学习的表达能力，还能与深度神经网络结合进行端到端优化，适用于多模态数据。

Abstract: Differentiable inductive logic programming (ILP) techniques have proven
effective at finding approximate rule-based solutions to link prediction and
node classification problems on knowledge graphs; however, the common
assumption of chain-like rule structure can hamper the performance and
interpretability of existing approaches. We introduce GLIDR, a differentiable
rule learning method that models the inference of logic rules with more
expressive syntax than previous methods. GLIDR uses a differentiable message
passing inference algorithm that generalizes previous chain-like rule learning
methods to allow rules with features like branches and cycles. GLIDR has a
simple and expressive rule search space which is parameterized by a limit on
the maximum number of free variables that may be included in a rule. Explicit
logic rules can be extracted from the weights of a GLIDR model for use with
symbolic solvers. We demonstrate that GLIDR can significantly outperform
existing rule learning methods on knowledge graph completion tasks and even
compete with embedding methods despite the inherent disadvantage of being a
structure-only prediction method. We show that rules extracted from GLIDR
retain significant predictive performance, and that GLIDR is highly robust to
training data noise. Finally, we demonstrate that GLIDR can be chained with
deep neural networks and optimized end-to-end for rule learning on arbitrary
data modalities.

Method: 提出ParBalans，结合求解器和算法级别的并行化，扩展Balans的并行能力。

Result: 实验表明，ParBalans在困难优化基准测试中与Gurobi性能相当。

Conclusion: ParBalans通过并行化显著提升了MIP问题的求解效率。

Abstract: Solving Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) problems often requires substantial
computational resources due to their combinatorial nature. Parallelization has
emerged as a critical strategy to accelerate solution times and enhance
scalability to tackle large, complex instances. This paper investigates the
parallelization capabilities of Balans, a recently proposed multi-armed
bandits-based adaptive large neighborhood search for MIPs. While Balans's
modular architecture inherently supports parallel exploration of diverse
parameter configurations, this potential has not been thoroughly examined. To
address this gap, we introduce ParBalans, an extension that leverages both
solver-level and algorithmic-level parallelism to improve performance on
challenging MIP instances. Our experimental results demonstrate that ParBalans
exhibits competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art commercial
solver Gurobi, particularly on hard optimization benchmarks.

Abstract: With the growing demand for Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks in
sensitive applications, such as urban monitoring, emergency response, and
secure sensing, ensuring reliable connectivity and covert communication has
become increasingly vital. However, dynamic mobility and exposure risks pose
significant challenges. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a
self-organizing UAV network framework combining Graph Diffusion-based Policy
Optimization (GDPO) with a Stackelberg Game (SG)-based incentive mechanism. The
GDPO method uses generative AI to dynamically generate sparse but
well-connected topologies, enabling flexible adaptation to changing node
distributions and Ground User (GU) demands. Meanwhile, the Stackelberg Game
(SG)-based incentive mechanism guides self-interested UAVs to choose relay
behaviors and neighbor links that support cooperation and enhance covert
communication. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of model convergence, topology
generation quality, and enhancement of covert communication performance.

Motivation: 研究旨在解决超低比特LLM模型在资源受限环境（如边缘设备和AI PC）中部署时的计算效率问题。

Method: 采用自底向上的方法，设计并实现了针对现代CPU优化的1位和2位微内核，并将其集成到PyTorch-TPP框架中。

Conclusion: 该研究为超低比特LLM模型的高效部署提供了新的解决方案，推动了边缘设备和AI PC上的LLM推理技术发展。

Abstract: The advent of ultra-low-bit LLM models (1/1.58/2-bit), which match the
perplexity and end-task performance of their full-precision counterparts using
the same model size, is ushering in a new era of LLM inference for
resource-constrained environments such as edge devices and AI PCs. While these
quantization advances promise models that are more cost-effective in terms of
latency, memory, throughput, and energy consumption, the computational
efficiency of state-of-the-art (SOTA) inference runtimes (e.g., bitnet.cpp)
used to deploy them remains underexplored. In this work, we take a bottom-up
approach: we first design and implement 1-bit and 2-bit microkernels optimized
for modern CPUs, achieving peak computational efficiency across a variety of
CPU platforms. We integrate these microkernels into a state-of-the-art LLM
inference framework, namely PyTorch-TPP, and present end-to-end inference
results with 2-bit models that outperform the current SOTA runtime bitnet.cpp
by up to 2.2x, and deliver up to 7x speedup compared to the 16-bit model
inference. Our optimized runtime advances the state of LLM inference on AI PCs
and edge devices, paving the way for efficient deployment of ultra-low-bit LLM
models.

Method: 结合自然语言边界提示和控制模式，采用模糊支架逻辑和适应规则，无需微调或外部协调。

Result: 在模拟智能辅导环境中，框架显著提升了支架质量、适应性和教学对齐性，优于标准提示方法。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅适用于教育领域，还可扩展至其他交互密集型场景，如游戏内容生成，提供了一种可重用、安全的LLM行为结构化方法。

Abstract: We introduce a modular prompting framework that supports safer and more
adaptive use of large language models (LLMs) across dynamic, user-centered
tasks. Grounded in human learning theory, particularly the Zone of Proximal
Development (ZPD), our method combines a natural language boundary prompt with
a control schema encoded with fuzzy scaffolding logic and adaptation rules.
This architecture enables LLMs to modulate behavior in response to user state
without requiring fine-tuning or external orchestration. In a simulated
intelligent tutoring setting, the framework improves scaffolding quality,
adaptivity, and instructional alignment across multiple models, outperforming
standard prompting baselines. Evaluation is conducted using rubric-based LLM
graders at scale. While initially developed for education, the framework has
shown promise in other interaction-heavy domains, such as procedural content
generation for games. Designed for safe deployment, it provides a reusable
methodology for structuring interpretable, goal-aligned LLM behavior in
uncertain or evolving contexts.

Abstract: Exploring volumetric data is crucial for interpreting scientific datasets.
However, selecting optimal viewpoints for effective navigation can be
challenging, particularly for users without extensive domain expertise or
familiarity with 3D navigation. In this paper, we propose a novel framework
that leverages natural language interaction to enhance volumetric data
exploration. Our approach encodes volumetric blocks to capture and
differentiate underlying structures. It further incorporates a CLIP Score
mechanism, which provides semantic information to the blocks to guide
navigation. The navigation is empowered by a reinforcement learning framework
that leverage these semantic cues to efficiently search for and identify
desired viewpoints that align with the user's intent. The selected viewpoints
are evaluated using CLIP Score to ensure that they best reflect the user
queries. By automating viewpoint selection, our method improves the efficiency

Conclusion: 该研究为下一代遥感解释系统提供了概念基础，并建立了认知驱动智能地理空间分析的路线图。

Abstract: The mainstream paradigm of remote sensing image interpretation has long been
dominated by vision-centered models, which rely on visual features for semantic
understanding. However, these models face inherent limitations in handling
multi-modal reasoning, semantic abstraction, and interactive decision-making.
While recent advances have introduced Large Language Models (LLMs) into remote
sensing workflows, existing studies primarily focus on downstream applications,
lacking a unified theoretical framework that explains the cognitive role of
language. This review advocates a paradigm shift from vision-centered to
language-centered remote sensing interpretation. Drawing inspiration from the
Global Workspace Theory (GWT) of human cognition, We propose a
language-centered framework for remote sensing interpretation that treats LLMs
as the cognitive central hub integrating perceptual, task, knowledge and action
spaces to enable unified understanding, reasoning, and decision-making. We
first explore the potential of LLMs as the central cognitive component in
remote sensing interpretation, and then summarize core technical challenges,
including unified multimodal representation, knowledge association, and
reasoning and decision-making. Furthermore, we construct a global
workspace-driven interpretation mechanism and review how language-centered
solutions address each challenge. Finally, we outline future research
directions from four perspectives: adaptive alignment of multimodal data, task
understanding under dynamic knowledge constraints, trustworthy reasoning, and
autonomous interaction. This work aims to provide a conceptual foundation for
the next generation of remote sensing interpretation systems and establish a
roadmap toward cognition-driven intelligent geospatial analysis.

Motivation: 多智能体强化学习（MARL）中信用分配是一个关键挑战，需要评估每个智能体对共享奖励的贡献，尤其是在任务多样性和智能体协作方式不同的情况下。

Method: MACA通过多级优势公式进行显式反事实推理，评估不同协作级别的信用分配，并结合注意力框架识别智能体间的相关性。

Result: 在Starcraft任务上的实验表明，MACA在复杂信用分配场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: MACA通过多级优势信用分配，有效解决了MARL中的复杂信用分配问题。

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) aims to coordinate
multiple agents to achieve a common goal. A key challenge in MARL is credit
assignment, which involves assessing each agent's contribution to the shared
reward. Given the diversity of tasks, agents may perform different types of
coordination, with rewards attributed to diverse and often overlapping agent
subsets. In this work, we formalize the credit assignment level as the number
of agents cooperating to obtain a reward, and address scenarios with multiple
coexisting levels. We introduce a multi-level advantage formulation that
performs explicit counterfactual reasoning to infer credits across distinct
levels. Our method, Multi-level Advantage Credit Assignment (MACA), captures
agent contributions at multiple levels by integrating advantage functions that
reason about individual, joint, and correlated actions. Utilizing an
attention-based framework, MACA identifies correlated agent relationships and
constructs multi-level advantages to guide policy learning. Comprehensive
experiments on challenging Starcraft v1\&v2 tasks demonstrate MACA's superior
performance, underscoring its efficacy in complex credit assignment scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which integrate language and visual
cues for problem-solving, are crucial for advancing artificial general
intelligence (AGI). However, current benchmarks for measuring the intelligence
of MLLMs suffer from limited scale, narrow coverage, and unstructured
knowledge, offering only static and undifferentiated evaluations. To bridge
this gap, we introduce MDK12-Bench, a large-scale multidisciplinary benchmark
built from real-world K-12 exams spanning six disciplines with 141K instances
and 6,225 knowledge points organized in a six-layer taxonomy. Covering five
question formats with difficulty and year annotations, it enables comprehensive
evaluation to capture the extent to which MLLMs perform over four dimensions:
1) difficulty levels, 2) temporal (cross-year) shifts, 3) contextual shifts,
and 4) knowledge-driven reasoning. We propose a novel dynamic evaluation
framework that introduces unfamiliar visual, textual, and question form shifts
to challenge model generalization while improving benchmark objectivity and
longevity by mitigating data contamination. We further evaluate knowledge-point
reference-augmented generation (KP-RAG) to examine the role of knowledge in
problem-solving. Key findings reveal limitations in current MLLMs in multiple
aspects and provide guidance for enhancing model robustness, interpretability,
and AI-assisted education.

Abstract: Timely and accurate severe weather warnings are critical for disaster
mitigation. However, current forecasting systems remain heavily reliant on
manual expert interpretation, introducing subjectivity and significant
operational burdens. With the rapid development of AI technologies, the
end-to-end "AI weather station" is gradually emerging as a new trend in
predicting severe weather events. Three core challenges impede the development
of end-to-end AI severe weather system: (1) scarcity of severe weather event
samples; (2) imperfect alignment between high-dimensional meteorological data
and textual warnings; (3) existing multimodal language models are unable to
handle high-dimensional meteorological data and struggle to fully capture the
complex dependencies across temporal sequences, vertical pressure levels, and
spatial dimensions. To address these challenges, we introduce MP-Bench, the
first large-scale temporal multimodal dataset for severe weather events
prediction, comprising 421,363 pairs of raw multi-year meteorological data and
corresponding text caption, covering a wide range of severe weather scenarios
across China. On top of this dataset, we develop a meteorology multimodal large
model (MMLM) that directly ingests 4D meteorological inputs. In addition, it is
designed to accommodate the unique characteristics of 4D meteorological data
flow, incorporating three plug-and-play adaptive fusion modules that enable
dynamic feature extraction and integration across temporal sequences, vertical
pressure layers, and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments on MP-Bench
demonstrate that MMLM performs exceptionally well across multiple tasks,
highlighting its effectiveness in severe weather understanding and marking a
key step toward realizing automated, AI-driven weather forecasting systems. Our
source code and dataset will be made publicly available.

Method: 基于确定性下推自动机设计pdRMs，并提出了两种策略变体：一种可以访问整个堆栈，另一种仅能访问堆栈顶部的k个符号。

Result: 理论证明了pdRMs的表达能力，并提供了空间复杂度分析。实验验证了pdRMs在训练代理执行确定性上下文无关语言任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: pdRMs显著提升了强化学习中对复杂行为的表达能力，为更广泛的应用场景提供了支持。

Abstract: Reward machines (RMs) are automata structures that encode (non-Markovian)
reward functions for reinforcement learning (RL). RMs can reward any behaviour
representable in regular languages and, when paired with RL algorithms that
exploit RM structure, have been shown to significantly improve sample
efficiency in many domains. In this work, we present pushdown reward machines
(pdRMs), an extension of reward machines based on deterministic pushdown
automata. pdRMs can recognize and reward temporally extended behaviours
representable in deterministic context-free languages, making them more
expressive than reward machines. We introduce two variants of pdRM-based
policies, one which has access to the entire stack of the pdRM, and one which
can only access the top $k$ symbols (for a given constant $k$) of the stack. We
propose a procedure to check when the two kinds of policies (for a given
environment, pdRM, and constant $k$) achieve the same optimal expected reward.
We then provide theoretical results establishing the expressive power of pdRMs,
and space complexity results about the proposed learning problems. Finally, we
provide experimental results showing how agents can be trained to perform tasks
representable in deterministic context-free languages using pdRMs.

*Yanchen Deng,Xinrun Wang,Bo An*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的分布式引导局部搜索（DGLS）方法，解决了GDBA在分布式约束优化问题（DCOPs）中的性能问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GDBA在解决DCOPs时容易陷入局部最优，且性能提升有限。

Method: 提出DGLS，采用自适应违规条件、惩罚蒸发机制和同步方案。

Result: DGLS在标准基准测试中显著优于现有方法，尤其在结构化问题上表现突出。

Conclusion: DGLS是一种高效的DCOP解决方法，具有理论保证和实际优势。

Abstract: Local search is an important class of incomplete algorithms for solving
Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) but it often converges to
poor local optima. While GDBA provides a comprehensive rule set to escape
premature convergence, its empirical benefits remain marginal on general-valued
problems. In this work, we systematically examine GDBA and identify three
factors that potentially lead to its inferior performance, i.e.,
over-aggressive constraint violation conditions, unbounded penalty
accumulation, and uncoordinated penalty updates. To address these issues, we
propose Distributed Guided Local Search (DGLS), a novel GLS framework for DCOPs
that incorporates an adaptive violation condition to selectively penalize
constraints with high cost, a penalty evaporation mechanism to control the
magnitude of penalization, and a synchronization scheme for coordinated penalty
updates. We theoretically show that the penalty values are bounded, and agents
play a potential game in our DGLS. Our extensive empirical results on various
standard benchmarks demonstrate the great superiority of DGLS over
state-of-the-art baselines. Particularly, compared to Damped Max-sum with high
damping factors (e.g., 0.7 or 0.9), our DGLS achieves competitive performance
on general-valued problems, and outperforms it by significant margins
(\textbf{3.77\%--66.3\%}) on structured problems in terms of anytime results.

TL;DR: CRAMF是一个基于检索增强的数学形式化框架，通过检索核心数学概念的形式化定义，提升LLM的自动形式化能力，解决了模型幻觉和语义鸿沟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决交互式定理证明器（ITPs）手动形式化的高成本和专业需求，以及自动形式化中的模型幻觉和语义鸿沟问题。

Method: 提出CRAMF框架，利用Mathlib4构建概念定义知识库，采用上下文查询增强和双通道混合检索策略。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，CRAMF显著提升了翻译准确率，最高达62.1%，平均提升29.9%。

Conclusion: CRAMF为自动形式化提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了LLM的性能。

Abstract: Interactive theorem provers (ITPs) require manual formalization, which is
labor-intensive and demands expert knowledge. While automated formalization
offers a potential solution, it faces two major challenges: model hallucination
(e.g., undefined predicates, symbol misuse, and version incompatibility) and
the semantic gap caused by ambiguous or missing premises in natural language
descriptions. To address these issues, we propose CRAMF, a Concept-driven
Retrieval-Augmented Mathematical Formalization framework. CRAMF enhances
LLM-based autoformalization by retrieving formal definitions of core
mathematical concepts, providing contextual grounding during code generation.
However, applying retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in this setting is
non-trivial due to the lack of structured knowledge bases, the polymorphic
nature of mathematical concepts, and the high precision required in formal
retrieval. We introduce a framework for automatically constructing a
concept-definition knowledge base from Mathlib4, the standard mathematical
library for the Lean 4 theorem prover, indexing over 26,000 formal definitions
and 1,000+ core mathematical concepts. To address conceptual polymorphism, we
propose contextual query augmentation with domain- and application-level
signals. In addition, we design a dual-channel hybrid retrieval strategy with
reranking to ensure accurate and relevant definition retrieval. Experiments on
miniF2F, ProofNet, and our newly proposed AdvancedMath benchmark show that
CRAMF can be seamlessly integrated into LLM-based autoformalizers, yielding
consistent improvements in translation accuracy, achieving up to 62.1% and an
average of 29.9% relative improvement.

TL;DR: 论文研究了基于Transformer的多模态学习模型在农业子田块产量预测中的应用，通过自注意力机制评估特征和模态贡献，发现Transformer优于卷积和循环网络，且Attention Rollout方法更可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习在农业中应用广泛，但模型可解释性常被忽视。本文旨在利用Transformer的固有可解释性，提升多模态网络的可解释性，特别是在子田块产量预测任务中。

Method: 使用Transformer模型处理四种输入模态（多光谱卫星、天气时间序列、地形高程图和土壤属性），采用Attention Rollout和Generic Attention方法估计特征贡献，并提出Weighted Modality Activation方法评估模态贡献。

Result: Transformer模型在子田块和田间水平上分别比卷积和循环网络高0.10和0.04的R2分数；Attention Rollout方法在时间贡献评估上更可靠。

Conclusion: Transformer模型在多模态农业任务中表现优异，且其自注意力机制提供了可解释性，有助于结合农学知识理解预测结果。

Abstract: Multimodal learning enables various machine learning tasks to benefit from
diverse data sources, effectively mimicking the interplay of different factors
in real-world applications, particularly in agriculture. While the
heterogeneous nature of involved data modalities may necessitate the design of
complex architectures, the model interpretability is often overlooked. In this
study, we leverage the intrinsic explainability of Transformer-based models to
explain multimodal learning networks, focusing on the task of crop yield
prediction at the subfield level. The large datasets used cover various crops,
regions, and years, and include four different input modalities: multispectral
satellite and weather time series, terrain elevation maps and soil properties.
Based on the self-attention mechanism, we estimate feature attributions using
two methods, namely the Attention Rollout (AR) and Generic Attention (GA), and
evaluate their performance against Shapley-based model-agnostic estimations,
Shapley Value Sampling (SVS). Additionally, we propose the Weighted Modality
Activation (WMA) method to assess modality attributions and compare it with SVS
attributions. Our findings indicate that Transformer-based models outperform
other architectures, specifically convolutional and recurrent networks,
achieving R2 scores that are higher by 0.10 and 0.04 at the subfield and field
levels, respectively. AR is shown to provide more robust and reliable temporal
attributions, as confirmed through qualitative and quantitative evaluation,
compared to GA and SVS values. Information about crop phenology stages was
leveraged to interpret the explanation results in the light of established
agronomic knowledge. Furthermore, modality attributions revealed varying
patterns across the two methods compared.[...]

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM是否能替代人类参与者进行心理学研究，并揭示其局限性。

Method: 通过概念论证和实证研究，比较LLM与人类对相同问题的反应差异。

Result: LLM对细微语义变化的反应与人类不一致，且不同模型间差异显著，表明其不可靠。

Conclusion: LLM无法模拟人类心理学，心理学研究应将其作为需验证的工具使用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs),such as ChatGPT, are increasingly used in
research, ranging from simple writing assistance to complex data annotation
tasks. Recently, some research has suggested that LLMs may even be able to
simulate human psychology and can, hence, replace human participants in
psychological studies. We caution against this approach. We provide conceptual
arguments against the hypothesis that LLMs simulate human psychology. We then
present empiric evidence illustrating our arguments by demonstrating that
slight changes to wording that correspond to large changes in meaning lead to
notable discrepancies between LLMs' and human responses, even for the recent
CENTAUR model that was specifically fine-tuned on psychological responses.
Additionally, different LLMs show very different responses to novel items,
further illustrating their lack of reliability. We conclude that LLMs do not
simulate human psychology and recommend that psychological researchers should
treat LLMs as useful but fundamentally unreliable tools that need to be
validated against human responses for every new application.

Method: 提出了DatasetResearch基准，评估AI代理在208个真实需求中的表现，采用三维评估框架分析搜索与合成代理的能力。

Result: 结果显示，即使先进系统在DatasetResearch-pro子集上仅得22分，搜索代理擅长知识任务，合成代理擅长推理任务，但两者在“极端案例”中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究为数据集发现代理建立了首个严格基准，为下一代自我改进AI系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models has fundamentally shifted the
bottleneck in AI development from computational power to data availability-with
countless valuable datasets remaining hidden across specialized repositories,
research appendices, and domain platforms. As reasoning capabilities and deep
research methodologies continue to evolve, a critical question emerges: can AI
agents transcend conventional search to systematically discover any dataset
that meets specific user requirements, enabling truly autonomous demand-driven
data curation? We introduce DatasetResearch, the first comprehensive benchmark
evaluating AI agents' ability to discover and synthesize datasets from 208
real-world demands across knowledge-intensive and reasoning-intensive tasks.
Our tri-dimensional evaluation framework reveals a stark reality: even advanced
deep research systems achieve only 22% score on our challenging
DatasetResearch-pro subset, exposing the vast gap between current capabilities
and perfect dataset discovery. Our analysis uncovers a fundamental
dichotomy-search agents excel at knowledge tasks through retrieval breadth,
while synthesis agents dominate reasoning challenges via structured
generation-yet both catastrophically fail on "corner cases" outside existing
distributions. These findings establish the first rigorous baseline for dataset
discovery agents and illuminate the path toward AI systems capable of finding
any dataset in the digital universe. Our benchmark and comprehensive analysis
provide the foundation for the next generation of self-improving AI systems and

Motivation: 现有修复方法（如SFT和RLHF）成本高且慢，而提示工程缺乏鲁棒性和可扩展性。表示工程提供了一种轻量级替代方案，但依赖手动样本和固定策略。

Method: MASteer结合AutoTester（多智能体生成样本）和AutoRepairer（自适应策略选择），实现自动化、上下文感知的修复。

Result: 实验表明，MASteer在LLaMA-3.1-8B-Chat和Qwen-3-8B-Chat上分别提升15.36%和4.21%，同时保持模型通用能力。

Conclusion: MASteer展示了高效、可扩展的可信性修复潜力，具有强鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face persistent and evolving trustworthiness
issues, motivating developers to seek automated and flexible repair methods
that enable convenient deployment across diverse scenarios. Existing repair
methods like supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF) are costly and slow, while prompt engineering lacks robustness
and scalability. Representation engineering, which steers model behavior by
injecting targeted concept vectors during inference, offers a lightweight,
training-free alternative. However, current approaches depend on manually
crafted samples and fixed steering strategies, limiting automation and
adaptability. To overcome these challenges, we propose MASteer, the first
end-to-end framework for trustworthiness repair in LLMs based on representation
engineering. MASteer integrates two core components: AutoTester, a multi-agent
system that generates diverse, high-quality steer samples tailored to developer
needs; and AutoRepairer, which constructs adaptive steering strategies with
anchor vectors for automated, context-aware strategy selection during
inference. Experiments on standard and customized trustworthiness tasks show
MASteer consistently outperforms baselines, improving metrics by 15.36% on
LLaMA-3.1-8B-Chat and 4.21% on Qwen-3-8B-Chat, while maintaining general model
capabilities. MASteer demonstrates strong robustness, generalization, and
practical value for scalable, efficient trustworthiness repair.

Motivation: 解决分布式零知识机器学习中全模型电路化的高成本和僵化问题。

Method: 采用策略性选择的子计算（“切片”）进行验证，支持审计、复制或经济激励确保全局一致性。

Result: 在多种证明系统下评估，展示了内存使用、运行时间和电路行为的实验结果。

Conclusion: DSperse通过灵活的验证边界支持可扩展、针对性强的验证策略，适应多样化部署需求。

Abstract: DSperse is a modular framework for distributed machine learning inference
with strategic cryptographic verification. Operating within the emerging
paradigm of distributed zero-knowledge machine learning, DSperse avoids the
high cost and rigidity of full-model circuitization by enabling targeted
verification of strategically chosen subcomputations. These verifiable
segments, or "slices", may cover part or all of the inference pipeline, with
global consistency enforced through audit, replication, or economic incentives.
This architecture supports a pragmatic form of trust minimization, localizing
zero-knowledge proofs to the components where they provide the greatest value.
We evaluate DSperse using multiple proving systems and report empirical results
on memory usage, runtime, and circuit behavior under sliced and unsliced
configurations. By allowing proof boundaries to align flexibly with the model's
logical structure, DSperse supports scalable, targeted verification strategies
suited to diverse deployment needs.

Abstract: With recent and rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI),
understanding the foundation of purposeful behaviour in autonomous agents is
crucial for developing safe and efficient systems. While artificial neural
networks have dominated the path to AI, recent studies are exploring the
potential of biologically based systems, such as networks of living biological
neuronal networks. Along with promises of high power and data efficiency, these
systems may also inform more explainable and biologically plausible models. In
this work, we propose a framework rooted in active inference, a general theory
of behaviour, to model decision-making in embodied agents. Using
experiment-informed generative models, we simulate decision-making processes in
a simulated game-play environment, mirroring experimental setups that use
biological neurons. Our results demonstrate learning in these agents, providing
insights into the role of memory-based learning and predictive planning in
intelligent decision-making. This work contributes to the growing field of
explainable AI by offering a biologically grounded and scalable approach to
understanding purposeful behaviour in agents.

Motivation: 研究动机在于探索IHS框架中替代传统整数规划求解命中集（HS）的方法，以提高效率和可靠性。

Method: 方法包括使用伪布尔（PB）推理和随机局部搜索作为HS计算的替代技术，并与商业整数规划求解器进行比较。

Result: 结果表明，商业整数规划求解器在效率上最优，但存在数值不稳定性问题；而基于PB推理的精确HS计算在可靠性上表现更好，且能提供正确性证明。

Conclusion: 结论指出，PB推理可作为HS计算的有效替代方法，尤其在需要正确性证明的场景中，而商业求解器在效率上仍有优势。

Abstract: The implicit hitting set (IHS) approach offers a general framework for
solving computationally hard combinatorial optimization problems declaratively.
IHS iterates between a decision oracle used for extracting sources of
inconsistency and an optimizer for computing so-called hitting sets (HSs) over
the accumulated sources of inconsistency. While the decision oracle is
language-specific, the optimizers is usually instantiated through integer
programming.
  We explore alternative algorithmic techniques for hitting set optimization
based on different ways of employing pseudo-Boolean (PB) reasoning as well as
stochastic local search. We extensively evaluate the practical feasibility of
the alternatives in particular in the context of pseudo-Boolean (0-1 IP)
optimization as one of the most recent instantiations of IHS. Highlighting a
trade-off between efficiency and reliability, while a commercial IP solver
turns out to remain the most effective way to instantiate HS computations, it
can cause correctness issues due to numerical instability; in fact, we show
that exact HS computations instantiated via PB reasoning can be made
competitive with a numerically exact IP solver. Furthermore, the use of PB
reasoning as a basis for HS computations allows for obtaining certificates for
the correctness of IHS computations, generally applicable to any IHS
instantiation in which reasoning in the declarative language at hand can be
captured in the PB-based proof format we employ.

Motivation: 现有知识编辑研究主要集中在通用领域和医学QA任务，缺乏对多模态医学场景的关注，而医学KE需要结合视觉推理以支持临床决策的安全性和可解释性。

Method: 提出MultiMedEdit基准，涵盖理解和推理任务类型，定义三维度量标准，支持跨范式比较，并在单次编辑和终身编辑设置下进行实验。

Result: 当前方法在泛化和长尾推理方面表现不佳，尤其在复杂临床工作流中；效率分析揭示了实际部署中的权衡。

Conclusion: MultiMedEdit不仅揭示了当前方法的局限性，还为未来开发临床鲁棒的知识编辑技术奠定了基础。

Abstract: Knowledge editing (KE) provides a scalable approach for updating factual
knowledge in large language models without full retraining. While previous
studies have demonstrated effectiveness in general domains and medical QA
tasks, little attention has been paid to KE in multimodal medical scenarios.
Unlike text-only settings, medical KE demands integrating updated knowledge
with visual reasoning to support safe and interpretable clinical decisions. To
address this gap, we propose MultiMedEdit, the first benchmark tailored to
evaluating KE in clinical multimodal tasks. Our framework spans both
understanding and reasoning task types, defines a three-dimensional metric
suite (reliability, generality, and locality), and supports cross-paradigm
comparisons across general and domain-specific models. We conduct extensive
experiments under single-editing and lifelong-editing settings. Results suggest
that current methods struggle with generalization and long-tail reasoning,
particularly in complex clinical workflows. We further present an efficiency
analysis (e.g., edit latency, memory footprint), revealing practical trade-offs
in real-world deployment across KE paradigms. Overall, MultiMedEdit not only
reveals the limitations of current approaches but also provides a solid
foundation for developing clinically robust knowledge editing techniques in the
future.

Conclusion: 自主科学推理需要专门构建的系统，而不仅仅是增强的语言模型，K-Dense Analyst为完全自主的计算生物学家迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: The complexity of modern bioinformatics analysis has created a critical gap
between data generation and developing scientific insights. While large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise in scientific reasoning, they remain
fundamentally limited when dealing with real-world analytical workflows that
demand iterative computation, tool integration and rigorous validation. We
introduce K-Dense Analyst, a hierarchical multi-agent system that achieves
autonomous bioinformatics analysis through a dual-loop architecture. K-Dense
Analyst, part of the broader K-Dense platform, couples planning with validated
execution using specialized agents to decompose complex objectives into
executable, verifiable tasks within secure computational environments. On
BixBench, a comprehensive benchmark for open-ended biological analysis, K-Dense
Analyst achieves 29.2% accuracy, surpassing the best-performing language model
(GPT-5) by 6.3 percentage points, representing nearly 27% improvement over what
is widely considered the most powerful LLM available. Remarkably, K-Dense
Analyst achieves this performance using Gemini 2.5 Pro, which attains only
18.3% accuracy when used directly, demonstrating that our architectural
innovations unlock capabilities far beyond the underlying model's baseline
performance. Our insights demonstrate that autonomous scientific reasoning
requires more than enhanced language models, it demands purpose-built systems
that can bridge the gap between high-level scientific objectives and low-level
computational execution. These results represent a significant advance toward
fully autonomous computational biologists capable of accelerating discovery
across the life sciences.

Conclusion: 研究强调了LLMs在关键领域的不足，建议引入更多异质数据和人类参与以提升模型的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Abstract: As AI systems become more integrated into daily life, the need for safer and
more reliable moderation has never been greater. Large Language Models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, surpassing earlier models in
complexity and performance. Their evaluation across diverse tasks has
consistently showcased their potential, enabling the development of adaptive
and personalized agents. However, despite these advancements, LLMs remain prone
to errors, particularly in areas requiring nuanced moral reasoning. They
struggle with detecting implicit hate, offensive language, and gender biases
due to the subjective and context-dependent nature of these issues. Moreover,
their reliance on training data can inadvertently reinforce societal biases,
leading to inconsistencies and ethical concerns in their outputs. To explore
the limitations of LLMs in this role, we developed an experimental framework
based on state-of-the-art (SOTA) models to assess human emotions and offensive
behaviors. The framework introduces a unified benchmark dataset encompassing 49
distinct categories spanning the wide spectrum of human emotions, offensive and
hateful text, and gender and racial biases. Furthermore, we introduced SafePhi,
a QLoRA fine-tuned version of Phi-4, adapting diverse ethical contexts and
outperforming benchmark moderators by achieving a Macro F1 score of 0.89, where
OpenAI Moderator and Llama Guard score 0.77 and 0.74, respectively. This
research also highlights the critical domains where LLM moderators consistently
underperformed, pressing the need to incorporate more heterogeneous and
representative data with human-in-the-loop, for better model robustness and
explainability.

Conclusion: 该系统将静态预测器转变为自优化系统，推动教育分析向以人为本、数据驱动和响应式AI发展。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of student performance is essential for timely academic
intervention. However, most machine learning models in education are static and
cannot adapt when new data, such as post-intervention outcomes, become
available. To address this limitation, we propose a Feedback-Driven Decision
Support System (DSS) with a closed-loop architecture that enables continuous
model refinement. The system integrates a LightGBM-based regressor with
incremental retraining, allowing educators to input updated student results,
which automatically trigger model updates. This adaptive mechanism improves
prediction accuracy by learning from real-world academic progress. The platform
features a Flask-based web interface for real-time interaction and incorporates
SHAP for explainability, ensuring transparency. Experimental results show a
10.7\% reduction in RMSE after retraining, with consistent upward adjustments
in predicted scores for intervened students. By transforming static predictors
into self-improving systems, our approach advances educational analytics toward
human-centered, data-driven, and responsive AI. The framework is designed for
integration into LMS and institutional dashboards.

across multiple dimensions using large language model (LLM)-based agents.
Traditional table-to-text models often lack the capacity to reason across
hierarchical structures and context-aware deltas, which are essential in
business reporting tasks. Our method introduces a multi-agent pipeline that
extracts, analyzes, and summarizes multi-dimensional data using agents for
slicing, variance detection, context construction, and LLM-based generation.
Our results show that the proposed framework outperforms traditional
approaches, achieving 83\% faithfulness to underlying data, superior coverage
of significant changes, and high relevance scores (4.4/5) for decision-critical
insights. The improvements are especially pronounced in categories involving
subtle trade-offs, such as increased revenue due to price changes amid
declining unit volumes, which competing methods either overlook or address with
limited specificity. We evaluate the framework on Kaggle datasets and
demonstrate significant improvements in faithfulness, relevance, and insight
quality over baseline table summarization approaches.

Motivation: 现有基于大规模预训练的方法在多任务协调和复杂临床流程处理上表现不足，AI代理在内窥镜领域的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出EndoAgent，结合迭代推理与自适应工具选择，采用双记忆设计（短期行动跟踪和长期经验学习），并集成专家设计工具。

Result: 在EndoAgentBench基准测试中，EndoAgent表现优于通用和医疗多模态模型，展示了其灵活性和推理能力。

Conclusion: EndoAgent为内窥镜图像诊断提供了一种灵活且高效的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Developing general artificial intelligence (AI) systems to support endoscopic
image diagnosis is an emerging research priority. Existing methods based on
large-scale pretraining often lack unified coordination across tasks and
struggle to handle the multi-step processes required in complex clinical
workflows. While AI agents have shown promise in flexible instruction parsing
and tool integration across domains, their potential in endoscopy remains
underexplored. To address this gap, we propose EndoAgent, the first
memory-guided agent for vision-to-decision endoscopic analysis that integrates
iterative reasoning with adaptive tool selection and collaboration. Built on a
dual-memory design, it enables sophisticated decision-making by ensuring
logical coherence through short-term action tracking and progressively
enhancing reasoning acuity through long-term experiential learning. To support
diverse clinical tasks, EndoAgent integrates a suite of expert-designed tools
within a unified reasoning loop. We further introduce EndoAgentBench, a
benchmark of 5,709 visual question-answer pairs that assess visual
understanding and language generation capabilities in realistic scenarios.
Extensive experiments show that EndoAgent consistently outperforms both general
and medical multimodal models, exhibiting its strong flexibility and reasoning
capabilities.

diagonalization, incomputability, and information theory boundaries supported
by the new "learner pump lemma". However, we propose two "escape routes": one
is to model Retrieval Enhanced Generations (RAGs) as oracle machines, proving
their absolute escape through "computational jumps", providing the first formal

Result: 通过案例研究创建了XUBench，验证了Comp-Comp框架的有效性。

Conclusion: Comp-Comp框架不仅适用于学术领域，还可扩展到其他领域，为基准构建提供有价值的见解。

Abstract: Numerous benchmarks have been built to evaluate the domain-specific abilities
of large language models (LLMs), highlighting the need for effective and
efficient benchmark construction. Existing domain-specific benchmarks primarily
focus on the scaling law, relying on massive corpora for supervised fine-tuning
or generating extensive question sets for broad coverage. However, the impact
of corpus and question-answer (QA) set design on the precision and recall of
domain-specific LLMs remains unexplored. In this paper, we address this gap and
demonstrate that the scaling law is not always the optimal principle for
benchmark construction in specific domains. Instead, we propose Comp-Comp, an
iterative benchmarking framework based on a comprehensiveness-compactness
principle. Here, comprehensiveness ensures semantic recall of the domain, while
compactness enhances precision, guiding both corpus and QA set construction. To
validate our framework, we conducted a case study in a well-renowned
university, resulting in the creation of XUBench, a large-scale and
comprehensive closed-domain benchmark. Although we use the academic domain as
the case in this work, our Comp-Comp framework is designed to be extensible
beyond academia, providing valuable insights for benchmark construction across
various domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在渗透测试中存在错误处理差、推理效率低和无法自主完成复杂任务的问题，Pentest-R1旨在解决这些局限性。

Method: 采用两阶段强化学习：离线RL学习基础攻击逻辑，在线RL在CTF环境中通过环境反馈微调模型，实现错误自校正和自适应策略。

Result: 在AutoPenBench上达到24.2%成功率，仅次于Gemini 2.5 Flash；在Cybench上以15.0%成功率创开源LLM新纪录。

Conclusion: 两阶段训练协同对Pentest-R1的成功至关重要，证明了其在渗透测试中的有效性。

Abstract: Automating penetration testing is crucial for enhancing cybersecurity, yet
current Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant limitations in this
domain, including poor error handling, inefficient reasoning, and an inability
to perform complex end-to-end tasks autonomously. To address these challenges,
we introduce Pentest-R1, a novel framework designed to optimize LLM reasoning
capabilities for this task through a two-stage reinforcement learning pipeline.
We first construct a dataset of over 500 real-world, multi-step walkthroughs,
which Pentest-R1 leverages for offline reinforcement learning (RL) to instill
foundational attack logic. Subsequently, the LLM is fine-tuned via online RL in
an interactive Capture The Flag (CTF) environment, where it learns directly
from environmental feedback to develop robust error self-correction and
adaptive strategies. Our extensive experiments on the Cybench and AutoPenBench
benchmarks demonstrate the framework's effectiveness. On AutoPenBench,
Pentest-R1 achieves a 24.2\% success rate, surpassing most state-of-the-art
models and ranking second only to Gemini 2.5 Flash. On Cybench, it attains a
15.0\% success rate in unguided tasks, establishing a new state-of-the-art for
open-source LLMs and matching the performance of top proprietary models.
Ablation studies confirm that the synergy of both training stages is critical
to its success.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法过度优化时间IoU，牺牲了语义动作理解，影响TVG的鲁棒性。

Method: 引入三个反转任务（动词补全、动作识别、视频描述），结合强化学习框架优化定位和语义。

Result: 在Charades-STA上R1@0.7提升7.1%，优于Time-R1。

Conclusion: 通过反转任务增强语义理解，显著提升定位精度上限。

Abstract: Temporal Video Grounding (TVG) seeks to localize video segments matching a
given textual query. Current methods, while optimizing for high temporal
Intersection-over-Union (IoU), often overfit to this metric, compromising
semantic action understanding in the video and query, a critical factor for
robust TVG. To address this, we introduce Inversion Tasks for TVG (Invert4TVG),
a novel framework that enhances both localization accuracy and action
understanding without additional data. Our approach leverages three inversion
tasks derived from existing TVG annotations: (1) Verb Completion, predicting
masked action verbs in queries from video segments; (2) Action Recognition,
identifying query-described actions; and (3) Video Description, generating
descriptions of video segments that explicitly embed query-relevant actions.
These tasks, integrated with TVG via a reinforcement learning framework with
well-designed reward functions, ensure balanced optimization of localization
and semantics. Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving a 7.1\% improvement in R1@0.7 on Charades-STA for a 3B
model compared to Time-R1. By inverting TVG to derive query-related actions
from segments, our approach strengthens semantic understanding, significantly
raising the ceiling of localization accuracy.

Result: 结果显示，BERTopic和NMF均能生成与100%的愿景元素相似的主题，其中BERTopic表现更优，超过一半的主题达到“中等”或“强”相关性。

Conclusion: GAI支持的战略计划开发对数十亿美元的行业具有重要影响，并帮助联邦政府克服对公共利益至关重要的监管要求。未来工作将聚焦于该概念的实操化及其他模块的可行性。

Abstract: Given recent breakthroughs in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) and
Large Language Models (LLMs), more and more professional services are being
augmented through Artificial Intelligence (AI), which once seemed impossible to
automate. This paper presents a modular model for leveraging GAI in developing
strategic plans for large scale government organizations and evaluates leading
machine learning techniques in their application towards one of the identified
modules. Specifically, the performance of BERTopic and Non-negative Matrix
Factorization (NMF) are evaluated in their ability to use topic modeling to
generate themes representative of Vision Elements within a strategic plan. To
accomplish this, BERTopic and NMF models are trained using a large volume of
reports from the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The generated topics
from each model are then scored for similarity against the Vision Elements of a
published strategic plan and the results are compared. Our results show that
these techniques are capable of generating themes similar to 100% of the
elements being evaluated against. Further, we conclude that BERTopic performs
best in this application with more than half of its correlated topics achieving
a "medium" or "strong" correlation. A capability of GAI-enabled strategic plan
development impacts a multi-billion dollar industry and assists the federal
government in overcoming regulatory requirements which are crucial to the
public good. Further work will focus on the operationalization of the concept
proven in this study as well as viability of the remaining modules in the
proposed model for GAI-generated strategic plans.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have sparked growing interest in AI
agents capable of solving complex, real-world tasks. However, most existing
agent systems rely on manually crafted configurations that remain static after
deployment, limiting their ability to adapt to dynamic and evolving
environments. To this end, recent research has explored agent evolution
techniques that aim to automatically enhance agent systems based on interaction
data and environmental feedback. This emerging direction lays the foundation
for self-evolving AI agents, which bridge the static capabilities of foundation
models with the continuous adaptability required by lifelong agentic systems.
In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of existing techniques for
self-evolving agentic systems. Specifically, we first introduce a unified
conceptual framework that abstracts the feedback loop underlying the design of
self-evolving agentic systems. The framework highlights four key components:
System Inputs, Agent System, Environment, and Optimisers, serving as a
foundation for understanding and comparing different strategies. Based on this
framework, we systematically review a wide range of self-evolving techniques
that target different components of the agent system. We also investigate
domain-specific evolution strategies developed for specialised fields such as
biomedicine, programming, and finance, where optimisation objectives are
tightly coupled with domain constraints. In addition, we provide a dedicated
discussion on the evaluation, safety, and ethical considerations for
self-evolving agentic systems, which are critical to ensuring their
effectiveness and reliability. This survey aims to provide researchers and
practitioners with a systematic understanding of self-evolving AI agents,
laying the foundation for the development of more adaptive, autonomous, and
lifelong agentic systems.

Abstract: Language is a ubiquitous tool that is foundational to reasoning and
collaboration, ranging from everyday interactions to sophisticated

powerful asset in ensuring clear communication and understanding amongst

extend the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by integrating them
with advancements in multi-agent decision-making algorithms. We propose a
systematic framework for the design of multi-agentic large language models
(LLMs), focusing on key integration practices. These include advanced prompt
engineering techniques, the development of effective memory architectures,
multi-modal information processing, and alignment strategies through
fine-tuning algorithms. We evaluate these design choices through extensive
ablation studies on classic game settings with significant underlying social
dilemmas and game-theoretic considerations.

Method: 开发了一个基于ReAct原则的通用Python编码代理，通过精心设计的项目提示注入领域知识，结合文件操作和代码执行工具动态测试和调试。

Result: 该方法成功解决了CP-Bench基准集中的所有101个问题。

Conclusion: 约束建模任务需要通用编码工具和提示编码的领域知识，而非专用代理架构或预定义流程。

Abstract: Translating natural language problem descriptions into formal constraint
models remains a fundamental challenge in constraint programming, requiring
deep expertise in both the problem domain and modeling frameworks. Previous
approaches to automating this translation have employed fixed workflows with
predetermined modeling steps, failing on a significant number of benchmark
problems. We present a new approach using a pure agentic strategy without any
fixed pipeline. We developed a general-purpose Python coding agent based on the
ReAct (Reason and Act) principle, utilizing a persistent IPython kernel for
stateful code execution and iterative development. Rather than embedding
constraint programming logic into the agent architecture, domain-specific
expertise is injected solely through a carefully crafted project prompt. The
agent combines this prompt-encoded knowledge with access to file operations and
code execution tools, enabling it to test hypotheses, debug failures, and
verify solutions dynamically. Implemented in just a few hundred lines of code,
this architecture successfully solves all 101 problems of the CP-Bench
constraint programming benchmark set. The results suggest that constraint
modeling tasks require the combination of general coding tools and domain
expertise encoded in prompts, rather than specialized agent architectures or
predefined workflows.

Abstract: We present the first evaluation harness that enables any out-of-the-box,
local, Large Language Models (LLMs) to play full-press Diplomacy without
fine-tuning or specialized training. Previous work required frontier LLMs, or
fine-tuning, due to the high complexity and information density of Diplomacy's
game state. Combined with the high variance of matches, these factors made
Diplomacy prohibitive for study. In this work, we used data-driven iteration to
optimize a textual game state representation such that a 24B model can reliably
complete matches without any fine tuning. We develop tooling to facilitate
hypothesis testing and statistical analysis, and we present case studies on
persuasion, aggressive playstyles, and performance across a range of models. We
conduct a variety of experiments across many popular LLMs, finding the larger
models perform the best, but the smaller models still play adequately. We also
introduce Critical State Analysis: an experimental protocol for rapidly
iterating and analyzing key moments in a game at depth. Our harness
democratizes the evaluation of strategic reasoning in LLMs by eliminating the
need for fine-tuning, and it provides insights into how these capabilities
emerge naturally from widely used LLMs. Our code is available in the supplement
and will be open sourced.

Result: 评估了具有代理能力的SOTA LLMs，并报告了结果。

Conclusion: MCPToolBench++为评估LLMs在MCP工具调用中的性能提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: LLMs' capabilities are enhanced by using function calls to integrate various
data sources or API results into the context window. Typical tools include
search, web crawlers, maps, financial data, file systems, and browser usage,
etc. Integrating these data sources or functions requires a standardized
method. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way to supply
context to LLMs. However, the evaluation of LLMs and AI Agents' MCP tool use
abilities suffer from several issues. First, there's a lack of comprehensive
datasets or benchmarks to evaluate various MCP tools. Second, the diverse
formats of response from MCP tool call execution further increase the
difficulty of evaluation. Additionally, unlike existing tool-use benchmarks
with high success rates in functions like programming and math functions, the
success rate of real-world MCP tool is not guaranteed and varies across
different MCP servers. Furthermore, the LLMs' context window also limits the
number of available tools that can be called in a single run, because the
textual descriptions of tool and the parameters have long token length for an
LLM to process all at once. To help address the challenges of evaluating LLMs'
performance on calling MCP tools, we propose MCPToolBench++, a large-scale,
multi-domain AI Agent tool use benchmark. As of July 2025, this benchmark is
build upon marketplace of over 4k MCP servers from more than 40 categories,
collected from the MCP marketplaces and GitHub communities. The datasets
consist of both single-step and multi-step tool calls across different
categories. We evaluated SOTA LLMs with agentic abilities on this benchmark and
reported the results.

Conclusion: 提出的算法有效提升了语义通信的安全性和传输质量，无需服务器与干扰器之间的通信。

Abstract: In this paper, a novel covert semantic communication framework is
investigated. Within this framework, a server extracts and transmits the
semantic information, i.e., the meaning of image data, to a user over several
time slots. An attacker seeks to detect and eavesdrop the semantic transmission
to acquire details of the original image. To avoid data meaning being
eavesdropped by an attacker, a friendly jammer is deployed to transmit jamming
signals to interfere the attacker so as to hide the transmitted semantic
information. Meanwhile, the server will strategically select time slots for
semantic information transmission. Due to limited energy, the jammer will not
communicate with the server and hence the server does not know the transmit
power of the jammer. Therefore, the server must jointly optimize the semantic
information transmitted at each time slot and the corresponding transmit power
to maximize the privacy and the semantic information transmission quality of
the user. To solve this problem, we propose a prioritised sampling assisted
twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm to jointly determine
the transmitted semantic information and the transmit power per time slot
without the communications between the server and the jammer. Compared to
standard reinforcement learning methods, the propose method uses an additional
Q network to estimate Q values such that the agent can select the action with a
lower Q value from the two Q networks thus avoiding local optimal action
selection and estimation bias of Q values. Simulation results show that the
proposed algorithm can improve the privacy and the semantic information
transmission quality by up to 77.8% and 14.3% compared to the traditional
reinforcement learning methods.

Result: 实验表明，HGMF显著提高了工具选择准确性并降低了推理延迟。

Conclusion: HGMF框架在大规模工具库中具有可扩展性和高效性。

Abstract: Invoking external tools enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform
complex, real-world tasks, yet selecting the correct tool from large,
hierarchically-structured libraries remains a significant challenge. The
limited context windows of LLMs and noise from irrelevant options often lead to
low selection accuracy and high computational costs. To address this, we
propose the Hierarchical Gaussian Mixture Framework (HGMF), a probabilistic
pruning method for scalable tool invocation. HGMF first maps the user query and
all tool descriptions into a unified semantic space. The framework then
operates in two stages: it clusters servers using a Gaussian Mixture Model
(GMM) and filters them based on the query's likelihood. Subsequently, it
applies the same GMM-based clustering and filtering to the tools associated
with the selected servers. This hierarchical process produces a compact,
high-relevance candidate set, simplifying the final selection task for the LLM.
Experiments on a public dataset show that HGMF significantly improves tool
selection accuracy while reducing inference latency, confirming the framework's
scalability and effectiveness for large-scale tool libraries.

Result: 在多个基准测试中平均提升3.85%，在MATH-500、AIME和GPQA-Diamond上分别提升2.08%、2.23%和3.99%。

Conclusion: ThinkTuning通过教师模型的隐式监督有效提升了学生模型的推理能力，为模型训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in test-time scaling have led to the emergence of thinking
LLMs that exhibit self-reflective behaviors and multi-step reasoning. While RL
drives this self-improvement paradigm, a recent study (Gandhi et al., 2025)
shows that RL alone does not truly instill these new reasoning abilities - it
merely draws out behaviors already present in the base models. This raises a
question: How can we train the models that don't exhibit such thinking behavior
to develop it in the first place? To this end, we propose ThinkTuning, a
GRPO-based interactive training approach where we augment the rollouts of a
student model with the guidance from a teacher model. A simple idea from
classroom practice inspires our method: a teacher poses a problem, lets the
student try an answer, then gives corrective feedback -- enough to point the
mind in the right direction and then show the solution. Each piece of feedback
reshapes the student's thoughts, leading them to arrive at the correct
solution. Similarly, we find that this type of implicit supervision through
feedback from a teacher model of the same size improves the reasoning

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出利用多模态AI技术替代传统主观、劳动密集型的家禽福利监测，通过整合视觉、声学、环境和生理数据，实现更精准的蛋鸡福利评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监测方法受限于人工观察和单一传感器数据，无法全面捕捉现代养殖场中蛋鸡福利的复杂性。

Method: 采用多模态AI技术，提出中间（特征级）融合策略，并引入领域转移评分（DTS）和数据可靠性指数（DRI）作为评估工具。

Result: 中间融合策略在鲁棒性和性能之间取得最佳平衡，且更具可扩展性。

Conclusion: 研究为从被动、单模态监测转向主动、精准驱动的福利系统奠定了基础，结合生产力和科学伦理的动物护理。

Abstract: The future of poultry production depends on a paradigm shift replacing
subjective, labor-intensive welfare checks with data-driven, intelligent
monitoring ecosystems. Traditional welfare assessments-limited by human
observation and single-sensor data-cannot fully capture the complex,
multidimensional nature of laying hen welfare in modern farms. Multimodal
Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a breakthrough, integrating visual,
acoustic, environmental, and physiological data streams to reveal deeper
insights into avian welfare dynamics. This investigation highlights multimodal
As transformative potential, showing that intermediate (feature-level) fusion
strategies achieve the best balance between robustness and performance under
real-world poultry conditions, and offer greater scalability than early or late
fusion approaches. Key adoption barriers include sensor fragility in harsh farm
environments, high deployment costs, inconsistent behavioral definitions, and
limited cross-farm generalizability. To address these, we introduce two novel
evaluation tools - the Domain Transfer Score (DTS) to measure model
adaptability across diverse farm settings, and the Data Reliability Index (DRI)
to assess sensor data quality under operational constraints. We also propose a
modular, context-aware deployment framework designed for laying hen
environments, enabling scalable and practical integration of multimodal
sensing. This work lays the foundation for a transition from reactive, unimodal
monitoring to proactive, precision-driven welfare systems that unite
productivity with ethical, science based animal care.

TL;DR: SkillNav是一个模块化框架，通过将导航分解为可解释的原子技能，并结合零样本视觉语言模型路由器，提升了视觉与语言导航任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在复杂空间和时间推理的未见场景中泛化能力不足，需要更结构化的解决方案。

Method: 提出SkillNav框架，将导航任务分解为原子技能，每个技能由专门代理处理，并引入VLM路由器动态选择代理。

Result: 在R2R和GSA-R2R基准测试中达到新最优性能，展示了强泛化能力。

Conclusion: SkillNav通过模块化和技能分解显著提升了导航任务的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) poses significant challenges in enabling
agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate complex 3D
environments. While recent progress has been driven by large-scale pre-training
and data augmentation, current methods still struggle to generalize to unseen
scenarios, particularly when complex spatial and temporal reasoning is
required. In this work, we propose SkillNav, a modular framework that
introduces structured, skill-based reasoning into Transformer-based VLN agents.
Our method decomposes navigation into a set of interpretable atomic skills
(e.g., Vertical Movement, Area and Region Identification, Stop and Pause), each
handled by a specialized agent. We then introduce a novel zero-shot
Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based router, which dynamically selects the most
suitable agent at each time step by aligning sub-goals with visual observations
and historical actions. SkillNav achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on
the R2R benchmark and demonstrates strong generalization to the GSA-R2R
benchmark that includes novel instruction styles and unseen environments.

TL;DR: DiMuST模型通过解耦多路时空转换图的学习，提升了POI推荐的性能，解决了现有方法中时空信息分离导致的冗余问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有POI推荐方法中时空信息分离导致表示不匹配，引入冗余信息，降低模型性能和可解释性。

Method: 提出DiMuST模型，采用解耦变分多路图自编码器（DAE），通过多路时空图策略分离共享和私有分布，利用PoE机制融合共享特征，并通过对比约束降噪私有特征。

Result: 在两个数据集上的实验表明，DiMuST在多项指标上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DiMuST有效捕捉了POI的时空转换表示，同时保持了时空关系的内在相关性。

Abstract: Next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation is a research hotspot in business
intelligence, where users' spatial-temporal transitions and social
relationships play key roles. However, most existing works model spatial and
temporal transitions separately, leading to misaligned representations of the
same spatial-temporal key nodes. This misalignment introduces redundant
information during fusion, increasing model uncertainty and reducing
interpretability. To address this issue, we propose DiMuST, a socially enhanced
POI recommendation model based on disentangled representation learning over
multiplex spatial-temporal transition graphs. The model employs a novel
Disentangled variational multiplex graph Auto-Encoder (DAE), which first
disentangles shared and private distributions using a multiplex
spatial-temporal graph strategy. It then fuses the shared features via a
Product of Experts (PoE) mechanism and denoises the private features through
contrastive constraints. The model effectively captures the spatial-temporal
transition representations of POIs while preserving the intrinsic correlation
of their spatial-temporal relationships. Experiments on two challenging
datasets demonstrate that our DiMuST significantly outperforms existing methods
across multiple metrics.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多智能体框架，通过分解隐私推理任务减少信息负载，显著降低了隐私信息泄露。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在多源信息处理中的上下文隐私问题。

Method: 引入多智能体框架，将隐私推理分解为专门子任务（提取、分类），并通过信息流拓扑分析错误传播。

Result: 在ConfAIde和PrivacyLens基准测试中，多智能体配置显著减少隐私泄露（GPT-4o下分别降低18%和19%）。

Conclusion: 多智能体系统的信息流设计在上下文隐私保护中具有潜力。

Abstract: Addressing contextual privacy concerns remains challenging in interactive
settings where large language models (LLMs) process information from multiple
sources (e.g., summarizing meetings with private and public information). We
introduce a multi-agent framework that decomposes privacy reasoning into
specialized subtasks (extraction, classification), reducing the information
load on any single agent while enabling iterative validation and more reliable
adherence to contextual privacy norms. To understand how privacy errors emerge
and propagate, we conduct a systematic ablation over information-flow
topologies, revealing when and why upstream detection mistakes cascade into
downstream leakage. Experiments on the ConfAIde and PrivacyLens benchmark with
several open-source and closed-sourced LLMs demonstrate that our best
multi-agent configuration substantially reduces private information leakage
(\textbf{18\%} on ConfAIde and \textbf{19\%} on PrivacyLens with GPT-4o) while
preserving the fidelity of public content, outperforming single-agent
baselines. These results highlight the promise of principled information-flow
design in multi-agent systems for contextual privacy with LLMs.

TL;DR: EMPATHIA是一个多智能体框架，旨在解决难民整合中的文化、情感和伦理问题，通过模块化设计实现透明和可解释的决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI方法在难民整合中过于关注就业等狭窄目标，忽视了文化、情感和伦理等长期成功的关键维度。

Method: EMPATHIA基于Kegan的建构发展理论，分为SEED、RISE和THRIVE三个模块，采用选择器-验证器架构，包含情感、文化和伦理三个智能体。

Result: 在UN Kakuma数据集上验证，实现了87.4%的收敛率，并在五个东道国中提供了可解释的评估。

Conclusion: EMPATHIA通过平衡多种价值观，支持人机协作，为AI驱动的分配任务提供了通用框架。

Abstract: Current AI approaches to refugee integration optimize narrow objectives such
as employment and fail to capture the cultural, emotional, and ethical
dimensions critical for long-term success. We introduce EMPATHIA (Enriched
Multimodal Pathways for Agentic Thinking in Humanitarian Immigrant Assistance),
a multi-agent framework addressing the central Creative AI question: how do we
preserve human dignity when machines participate in life-altering decisions?
Grounded in Kegan's Constructive Developmental Theory, EMPATHIA decomposes
integration into three modules: SEED (Socio-cultural Entry and Embedding
Decision) for initial placement, RISE (Rapid Integration and Self-sufficiency
Engine) for early independence, and THRIVE (Transcultural Harmony and
Resilience through Integrated Values and Engagement) for sustained outcomes.
SEED employs a selector-validator architecture with three specialized agents -
emotional, cultural, and ethical - that deliberate transparently to produce
interpretable recommendations. Experiments on the UN Kakuma dataset (15,026
individuals, 7,960 eligible adults 15+ per ILO/UNHCR standards) and
implementation on 6,359 working-age refugees (15+) with 150+ socioeconomic
variables achieved 87.4% validation convergence and explainable assessments
across five host countries. EMPATHIA's weighted integration of cultural,
emotional, and ethical factors balances competing value systems while
supporting practitioner-AI collaboration. By augmenting rather than replacing
human expertise, EMPATHIA provides a generalizable framework for AI-driven
allocation tasks where multiple values must be reconciled.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI系统与人类价值观对齐的挑战，尤其是在涉及不可比较的伦理价值时。

Method: 扩展Anything2vec方法，将代理的决策策略映射为多元向量表示，用于比较和评估与人类价值观的对齐程度。

Result: 提出了Ethics2Vec方法，并在二元决策和自动控制（如自动驾驶）场景中验证其可行性。

Conclusion: Ethics2Vec为AI系统与人类价值观对齐提供了一种可行的量化方法，适用于复杂伦理决策场景。

Abstract: Though intelligent agents are supposed to improve human experience (or make
it more efficient), it is hard from a human perspective to grasp the ethical
values which are explicitly or implicitly embedded in an agent behaviour. This
is the well-known problem of alignment, which refers to the challenge of
designing AI systems that align with human values, goals and preferences. This
problem is particularly challenging since most human ethical considerations
refer to \emph{incommensurable} (i.e. non-measurable and/or incomparable)
values and criteria. Consider, for instance, a medical agent prescribing a
treatment to a cancerous patient. How could it take into account (and/or weigh)
incommensurable aspects like the value of a human life and the cost of the
treatment? Now, the alignment between human and artificial values is possible
only if we define a common space where a metric can be defined and used. This
paper proposes to extend to ethics the conventional Anything2vec approach,
which has been successful in plenty of similar and hard-to-quantify domains
(ranging from natural language processing to recommendation systems and graph
analysis). This paper proposes a way to map an automatic agent decision-making
(or control law) strategy to a multivariate vector representation, which can be
used to compare and assess the alignment with human values. The Ethics2Vec
method is first introduced in the case of an automatic agent performing binary
decision-making. Then, a vectorisation of an automatic control law (like in the
case of a self-driving car) is discussed to show how the approach can be
extended to automatic control settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在自动规划领域应用受限，尤其是面对问题对称性时表现不佳，导致难以从简单问题推广到复杂问题。

Method: 结合对比学习目标和架构改进，训练Transformer用于规划生成或启发式预测。

Result: 在多领域规划任务中，对称感知训练有效解决了PlanGPT的局限性。

Conclusion: 对称感知训练显著提升了Transformer在规划任务中的表现。

Abstract: While transformers excel in many settings, their application in the field of
automated planning is limited. Prior work like PlanGPT, a state-of-the-art
decoder-only transformer, struggles with extrapolation from easy to hard
planning problems. This in turn stems from problem symmetries: planning tasks
can be represented with arbitrary variable names that carry no meaning beyond
being identifiers. This causes a combinatorial explosion of equivalent
representations that pure transformers cannot efficiently learn from. We
propose a novel contrastive learning objective to make transformers
symmetry-aware and thereby compensate for their lack of inductive bias.
Combining this with architectural improvements, we show that transformers can
be efficiently trained for either plan-generation or heuristic-prediction. Our
results across multiple planning domains demonstrate that our symmetry-aware
training effectively and efficiently addresses the limitations of PlanGPT.

TL;DR: 论文研究了鲁棒马尔可夫决策过程（RMDPs）的推广，提出了一种新的策略选择标准——最优鲁棒最佳努力（ORBE）策略，旨在在对抗性概率下最大化期望回报的同时，优化非对抗性概率下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在RMDPs中，虽然可以通过鲁棒值迭代高效计算最优鲁棒策略，但这些策略在非对抗性概率下的表现可能不同。因此，需要一种更精细的策略选择标准。

Method: 论文提出了ORBE策略，结合了博弈论中的支配和最佳努力概念，要求策略不仅在对抗性概率下最优，还在非对抗性概率下表现最佳。并给出了计算ORBE策略的算法。

Result: 证明了ORBE策略的存在性，描述了其结构，并通过数值实验验证了方法的可行性。

Conclusion: ORBE策略为RMDPs中的最优鲁棒策略提供了原则性的选择标准，计算开销小，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We study the common generalization of Markov decision processes (MDPs) with
sets of transition probabilities, known as robust MDPs (RMDPs). A standard goal
in RMDPs is to compute a policy that maximizes the expected return under an
adversarial choice of the transition probabilities. If the uncertainty in the
probabilities is independent between the states, known as s-rectangularity,
such optimal robust policies can be computed efficiently using robust value
iteration. However, there might still be multiple optimal robust policies,
which, while equivalent with respect to the worst-case, reflect different
expected returns under non-adversarial choices of the transition probabilities.
Hence, we propose a refined policy selection criterion for RMDPs, drawing
inspiration from the notions of dominance and best-effort in game theory.
Instead of seeking a policy that only maximizes the worst-case expected return,
we additionally require the policy to achieve a maximal expected return under
different (i.e., not fully adversarial) transition probabilities. We call such
a policy an optimal robust best-effort (ORBE) policy. We prove that ORBE
policies always exist, characterize their structure, and present an algorithm
to compute them with a small overhead compared to standard robust value
iteration. ORBE policies offer a principled tie-breaker among optimal robust
policies. Numerical experiments show the feasibility of our approach.

Conclusion: 知识图谱和AI技术的结合为急救场景提供了有效的知识管理解决方案。

Abstract: Over the years, the need for rescue operations throughout the world has
increased rapidly. Demographic changes and the resulting risk of injury or
health disorders form the basis for emergency calls. In such scenarios, first
responders are in a rush to reach the patient in need, provide first aid, and
save lives. In these situations, they must be able to provide personalized and
optimized healthcare in the shortest possible time and estimate the patients
condition with the help of freshly recorded vital data in an emergency
situation. However, in such a timedependent situation, first responders and
medical experts cannot fully grasp their knowledge and need assistance and
recommendation for further medical treatments. To achieve this, on the spot
calculated, evaluated, and processed knowledge must be made available to
improve treatments by first responders. The Knowledge Graph presented in this
article as a central knowledge representation provides first responders with an
innovative knowledge management that enables intelligent treatment
recommendations with an artificial intelligence-based pre-recognition of the
situation.

Motivation: 当前结合LLM和EA的方法通常演化单个解，导致LLM调用成本高昂，限制了其在高维问题中的应用。

Method: X-evolve通过LLM生成可调程序，定义可调解空间，并利用基于分数的搜索算法高效探索该空间。

Result: 在三个优化问题上取得显著成果：发现更大的部分可容许集（cap set问题）、更大的独立集（信息论问题）以及更优的启发式算法（在线装箱问题）。

Conclusion: X-evolve通过演化解空间显著提高了搜索效率，为高维优化问题提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: While combining large language models (LLMs) with evolutionary algorithms
(EAs) shows promise for solving complex optimization problems, current
approaches typically evolve individual solutions, often incurring high LLM call
costs. We introduce \(X\)-evolve, a paradigm-shifting method that instead
evolves solution spaces \(X\) (sets of individual solutions) - subsets of the
overall search space \(S\). In \(X\)-evolve, LLMs generate tunable programs
wherein certain code snippets, designated as parameters, define a tunable
solution space. A score-based search algorithm then efficiently explores this
parametrically defined space, guided by feedback from objective function
scores. This strategy enables broader and more efficient exploration, which can
potentially accelerate convergence at a much lower search cost, requiring up to
two orders of magnitude fewer LLM calls than prior leading methods. We
demonstrate \(X\)-evolve's efficacy across three distinct hard optimization
problems. For the cap set problem, we discover a larger partial admissible set,
establishing a new tighter asymptotic lower bound for the cap set constant (\(C
\ge 2.2203\)). In information theory, we uncover a larger independent set for
the 15-vertex cycle graph (\(\mathcal{C}_{15}^{\boxtimes 5}\), size 19,946),
thereby raising the known lower bound on its Shannon capacity. Furthermore, for
the NP-hard online bin packing problem, we generate heuristics that
consistently outperform standard strategies across established benchmarks. By
evolving solution spaces, our method considerably improves search
effectiveness, making it possible to tackle high-dimensional problems that were
previously computationally prohibitive.

Motivation: 在无通信和标识的受限环境中，机器人运动易发生碰撞，需低成本解决方案。

Method: 使用LSTM预测机器人位置，动态调整DQN奖励以预判碰撞风险。

Result: 在1Hz采样频率下，碰撞次数显著减少，稳定性提升。

Conclusion: 该方法计算成本低，适合嵌入式系统实现。

Abstract: This article proposes a collision risk anticipation method based on
short-term prediction of the agents position. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
model, trained on past trajectories, is used to estimate the next position of
each robot. This prediction allows us to define an anticipated collision risk
by dynamically modulating the reward of a Deep Q-Learning Network (DQN) agent.
The approach is tested in a constrained environment, where two robots move
without communication or identifiers. Despite a limited sampling frequency (1
Hz), the results show a significant decrease of the collisions number and a
stability improvement. The proposed method, which is computationally
inexpensive, appears particularly attractive for implementation on embedded
systems.

Abstract: Forensic cause-of-death determination faces systemic challenges, including
workforce shortages and diagnostic variability, particularly in high-volume
systems like China's medicolegal infrastructure. We introduce FEAT (ForEnsic
AgenT), a multi-agent AI framework that automates and standardizes death
investigations through a domain-adapted large language model. FEAT's
application-oriented architecture integrates: (i) a central Planner for task
decomposition, (ii) specialized Local Solvers for evidence analysis, (iii) a
Memory & Reflection module for iterative refinement, and (iv) a Global Solver
for conclusion synthesis. The system employs tool-augmented reasoning,
hierarchical retrieval-augmented generation, forensic-tuned LLMs, and
human-in-the-loop feedback to ensure legal and medical validity. In evaluations
across diverse Chinese case cohorts, FEAT outperformed state-of-the-art AI
systems in both long-form autopsy analyses and concise cause-of-death
conclusions. It demonstrated robust generalization across six geographic
regions and achieved high expert concordance in blinded validations. Senior
pathologists validated FEAT's outputs as comparable to those of human experts,
with improved detection of subtle evidentiary nuances. To our knowledge, FEAT
is the first LLM-based AI agent system dedicated to forensic medicine, offering
scalable, consistent death certification while maintaining expert-level rigor.
By integrating AI efficiency with human oversight, this work could advance
equitable access to reliable medicolegal services while addressing critical
capacity constraints in forensic systems.

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效提升了Fedspeak解析的准确性和可靠性，感知不确定性可作为诊断信号。

Abstract: "Fedspeak", the stylized and often nuanced language used by the U.S. Federal
Reserve, encodes implicit policy signals and strategic stances. The Federal
Open Market Committee strategically employs Fedspeak as a communication tool to
shape market expectations and influence both domestic and global economic
conditions. As such, automatically parsing and interpreting Fedspeak presents a
high-impact challenge, with significant implications for financial forecasting,
algorithmic trading, and data-driven policy analysis. In this paper, we propose
an LLM-based, uncertainty-aware framework for deciphering Fedspeak and
classifying its underlying monetary policy stance. Technically, to enrich the
semantic and contextual representation of Fedspeak texts, we incorporate
domain-specific reasoning grounded in the monetary policy transmission
mechanism. We further introduce a dynamic uncertainty decoding module to assess
the confidence of model predictions, thereby enhancing both classification
accuracy and model reliability. Experimental results demonstrate that our
framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the policy stance analysis
task. Moreover, statistical analysis reveals a significant positive correlation
between perceptual uncertainty and model error rates, validating the
effectiveness of perceptual uncertainty as a diagnostic signal.

Conclusion: AdaptFlow通过语言引导的修改实现强泛化能力，为复杂任务提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest
in agentic workflows, which are structured sequences of LLM invocations
intended to solve complex tasks. However, existing approaches often rely on
static templates or manually designed workflows, which limit adaptability to
diverse tasks and hinder scalability. We propose AdaptFlow, a natural
language-based meta-learning framework inspired by model-agnostic meta-learning
(MAML). AdaptFlow learns a generalizable workflow initialization that enables
rapid subtask-level adaptation. It employs a bi-level optimization scheme: the
inner loop refines the workflow for a specific subtask using LLM-generated
feedback, while the outer loop updates the shared initialization to perform
well across tasks. This setup allows AdaptFlow to generalize effectively to
unseen tasks by adapting the initialized workflow through language-guided

*Meishen He,Wenjun Ma,Jiao Wang,Huijun Yue,Xiaoma Fan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Dempster-Shafer理论的开放世界信息融合方法FNBT，通过扩展框架和全否定机制解决异构框架下的融合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中，数据或模型常来自不同区域或组织，传统融合方法在异构框架下效果不佳。

Method: 引入标准判断开放世界设定，扩展框架以容纳异构元素，采用全否定机制转换质量函数。

Result: FNBT在理论上满足三个理想性质，实验显示其在模式分类任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: FNBT有效解决了异构框架下的信息融合问题，具有理论和实践价值。

Abstract: The Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence has been widely applied in the field
of information fusion under uncertainty. Most existing research focuses on
combining evidence within the same frame of discernment. However, in real-world
scenarios, trained algorithms or data often originate from different regions or
organizations, where data silos are prevalent. As a result, using different
data sources or models to generate basic probability assignments may lead to
heterogeneous frames, for which traditional fusion methods often yield
unsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, this study proposes an
open-world information fusion method, termed Full Negation Belief
Transformation (FNBT), based on the Dempster-Shafer theory. More specially, a
criterion is introduced to determine whether a given fusion task belongs to the
open-world setting. Then, by extending the frames, the method can accommodate
elements from heterogeneous frames. Finally, a full negation mechanism is
employed to transform the mass functions, so that existing combination rules
can be applied to the transformed mass functions for such information fusion.
Theoretically, the proposed method satisfies three desirable properties, which
are formally proven: mass function invariance, heritability, and essential
conflict elimination. Empirically, FNBT demonstrates superior performance in
pattern classification tasks on real-world datasets and successfully resolves
Zadeh's counterexample, thereby validating its practical effectiveness.

TL;DR: TeamMedAgents 是一种多智能体方法，将人类团队合作的心理学模型应用于医疗决策中，通过六个核心团队合作组件提升大型语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将人类团队合作的理论应用于计算多智能体医疗系统，以提升医疗决策的准确性和协作效率。

Method: 基于 Salas 等人的“Big Five”模型，实现六个团队合作组件（如团队领导和共享心智模型），并在医疗基准测试中评估其效果。

Result: 在八个医疗基准测试中，七个数据集表现提升，且不同任务需要不同的团队合作配置。

Conclusion: TeamMedAgents 为关键决策领域的多智能体系统设计提供了理论基础和实践验证。

Abstract: We present TeamMedAgents, a novel multi-agent approach that systematically
integrates evidence-based teamwork components from human-human collaboration
into medical decision-making with large language models (LLMs). Our approach
validates an organizational psychology teamwork model from human collaboration
to computational multi-agent medical systems by operationalizing six core
teamwork components derived from Salas et al.'s "Big Five" model: team
leadership, mutual performance monitoring, team orientation, shared mental
models, closed-loop communication, and mutual trust. We implement and evaluate
these components as modular, configurable mechanisms within an adaptive
collaboration architecture while assessing the effect of the number of agents
involved based on the task's requirements and domain. Systematic evaluation of
computational implementations of teamwork behaviors across eight medical
benchmarks (MedQA, MedMCQA, MMLU-Pro Medical, PubMedQA, DDXPlus, MedBullets,
Path-VQA, and PMC-VQA) demonstrates consistent improvements across 7 out of 8
evaluated datasets. Controlled ablation studies conducted on 50 questions per
configuration across 3 independent runs provide mechanistic insights into
individual component contributions, revealing optimal teamwork configurations
that vary by reasoning task complexity and domain-specific requirements. Our
ablation analyses reveal dataset-specific optimal teamwork configurations,
indicating that different medical reasoning modalities benefit from distinct
collaborative patterns. TeamMedAgents represents an advancement in
collaborative AI by providing a systematic translation of established teamwork
theories from human collaboration into agentic collaboration, establishing a
foundation for evidence-based multi-agent system design in critical
decision-making domains.

*Rui Miao,Yixin Liu,Yili Wang,Xu Shen,Yue Tan,Yiwei Dai,Shirui Pan,Xin Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BlindGuard是一种无监督防御方法，用于检测LLM多智能体系统中的恶意代理，无需标签或先验知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督防御方法依赖标记数据，不适用于实际场景，需开发通用且实用的防御方法。

Method: BlindGuard通过分层代理编码器捕捉代理的个体、邻域和全局交互模式，并结合噪声注入和对比学习训练检测模型。

Result: 实验表明BlindGuard能有效检测多种攻击类型，且泛化性能优于监督基线。

Conclusion: BlindGuard为多智能体系统提供了一种无需标签的高效防御方案。

Abstract: The security of LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) is critically threatened
by propagation vulnerability, where malicious agents can distort collective
decision-making through inter-agent message interactions. While existing
supervised defense methods demonstrate promising performance, they may be
impractical in real-world scenarios due to their heavy reliance on labeled
malicious agents to train a supervised malicious detection model. To enable
practical and generalizable MAS defenses, in this paper, we propose BlindGuard,
an unsupervised defense method that learns without requiring any
attack-specific labels or prior knowledge of malicious behaviors. To this end,
we establish a hierarchical agent encoder to capture individual, neighborhood,
and global interaction patterns of each agent, providing a comprehensive
understanding for malicious agent detection. Meanwhile, we design a
corruption-guided detector that consists of directional noise injection and
contrastive learning, allowing effective detection model training solely on
normal agent behaviors. Extensive experiments show that BlindGuard effectively
detects diverse attack types (i.e., prompt injection, memory poisoning, and
tool attack) across MAS with various communication patterns while maintaining
superior generalizability compared to supervised baselines. The code is

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的代理，将电力系统优化场景的自然语言描述自动转换为可求解的数学模型，并通过验证和迭代修复确保可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接使用LLM生成解决方案常导致不可行或次优结果，因其缺乏数值精度和约束处理能力。

Method: 结合领域感知提示与LLM，通过系统验证和迭代修复生成可求解的数学模型。

Result: 以机组组合问题为例，代理生成了最优或接近最优的调度方案及其目标成本。

Conclusion: 结合AI与传统优化框架，能高效连接高层问题描述与可执行数学模型，提升能源系统决策效率。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Large Language Models (LLMs)-assisted agent
that automatically converts natural-language descriptions of power system
optimization scenarios into compact, solver-ready formulations and generates
corresponding solutions. In contrast to approaches that rely solely on LLM to
produce solutions directly, the proposed method focuses on discovering a
mathematically compatible formulation that can be efficiently solved by
off-the-shelf optimization solvers. Directly using LLMs to produce solutions
often leads to infeasible or suboptimal results, as these models lack the
numerical precision and constraint-handling capabilities of established
optimization solvers. The pipeline integrates a domain-aware prompt and schema
with an LLM, enforces feasibility through systematic validation and iterative
repair, and returns both solver-ready models and user-facing results. Using the
unit commitment problem as a representative case study, the agent produces
optimal or near-optimal schedules along with the associated objective costs.
Results demonstrate that coupling the solver with task-specific validation
significantly enhances solution reliability. This work shows that combining AI
with established optimization frameworks bridges high-level problem
descriptions and executable mathematical models, enabling more efficient
decision-making in energy systems

Conclusion: 该方法为冠状动脉自动标记提供了高效且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the leading cause of death globally,
with computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) serving as a key
diagnostic tool. However, coronary arterial analysis using CTCA, such as
identifying artery-specific features from computational modelling, is
labour-intensive and time-consuming. Automated anatomical labelling of coronary
arteries offers a potential solution, yet the inherent anatomical variability
of coronary trees presents a significant challenge. Traditional knowledge-based
labelling methods fall short in leveraging data-driven insights, while recent
deep-learning approaches often demand substantial computational resources and
overlook critical clinical knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose
a lightweight method that integrates anatomical knowledge with rule-based
topology constraints for effective coronary artery labelling. Our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, providing a
promising alternative for automated coronary artery labelling.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable classification of brain tumors from magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) is critical for effective diagnosis and treatment
planning. This study presents an ensemble-based deep learning framework that
combines MobileNetV2 and DenseNet121 convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using
a soft voting strategy to classify three common brain tumor types: glioma,
meningioma, and pituitary adenoma. The models were trained and evaluated on the
Figshare dataset using a stratified 5-fold cross-validation protocol. To
enhance transparency and clinical trust, the framework integrates an
Explainable AI (XAI) module employing Grad-CAM++ for class-specific saliency
visualization, alongside a symbolic Clinical Decision Rule Overlay (CDRO) that
maps predictions to established radiological heuristics. The ensemble
classifier achieved superior performance compared to individual CNNs, with an
accuracy of 91.7%, precision of 91.9%, recall of 91.7%, and F1-score of 91.6%.
Grad-CAM++ visualizations revealed strong spatial alignment between model
attention and expert-annotated tumor regions, supported by Dice coefficients up
to 0.88 and IoU scores up to 0.78. Clinical rule activation further validated
model predictions in cases with distinct morphological features. A
human-centered interpretability assessment involving five board-certified
radiologists yielded high Likert-scale scores for both explanation usefulness
(mean = 4.4) and heatmap-region correspondence (mean = 4.0), reinforcing the
framework's clinical relevance. Overall, the proposed approach offers a robust,
interpretable, and generalizable solution for automated brain tumor
classification, advancing the integration of deep learning into clinical
neurodiagnostics.

Abstract: Image-based personalized medicine has the potential to transform healthcare,
particularly for diseases that exhibit heterogeneous progression such as
Multiple Sclerosis (MS). In this work, we introduce the first treatment-aware
spatio-temporal diffusion model that is able to generate future masks
demonstrating lesion evolution in MS. Our voxel-space approach incorporates
multi-modal patient data, including MRI and treatment information, to forecast
new and enlarging T2 (NET2) lesion masks at a future time point. Extensive
experiments on a multi-centre dataset of 2131 patient 3D MRIs from randomized
clinical trials for relapsing-remitting MS demonstrate that our generative
model is able to accurately predict NET2 lesion masks for patients across six
different treatments. Moreover, we demonstrate our model has the potential for
real-world clinical applications through downstream tasks such as future lesion
count and location estimation, binary lesion activity classification, and
generating counterfactual future NET2 masks for several treatments with
different efficacies. This work highlights the potential of causal, image-based
generative models as powerful tools for advancing data-driven prognostics in
MS.

Conclusion: 研究为提升LLM驱动的医学影像系统的安全性和可信度提供了见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to medical imaging
tasks, including image interpretation and synthetic image generation. However,
these models often produce hallucinations, which are confident but incorrect
outputs that can mislead clinical decisions. This study examines hallucinations
in two directions: image to text, where LLMs generate reports from X-ray, CT,
or MRI scans, and text to image, where models create medical images from
clinical prompts. We analyze errors such as factual inconsistencies and
anatomical inaccuracies, evaluating outputs using expert informed criteria
across imaging modalities. Our findings reveal common patterns of hallucination
in both interpretive and generative tasks, with implications for clinical
reliability. We also discuss factors contributing to these failures, including
model architecture and training data. By systematically studying both image
understanding and generation, this work provides insights into improving the
safety and trustworthiness of LLM driven medical imaging systems.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides detailed soft-tissue
characteristics that assist in disease diagnosis and screening. However, the
accuracy of clinical practice is often hindered by missing or unusable slices
due to various factors. Volumetric MRI synthesis methods have been developed to
address this issue by imputing missing slices from available ones. The inherent
3D nature of volumetric MRI data, such as cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR),
poses significant challenges for missing slice imputation approaches, including
(1) the difficulty of modeling local inter-slice correlations and dependencies
of volumetric slices, and (2) the limited exploration of crucial 3D spatial
information and global context. In this study, to mitigate these issues, we
present Spatial-Aware Graph Completion Network (SAGCNet) to overcome the
dependency on complete volumetric data, featuring two main innovations: (1) a
volumetric slice graph completion module that incorporates the inter-slice
relationships into a graph structure, and (2) a volumetric spatial adapter
component that enables our model to effectively capture and utilize various
forms of 3D spatial context. Extensive experiments on cardiac MRI datasets
demonstrate that SAGCNet is capable of synthesizing absent CMR slices,
outperforming competitive state-of-the-art MRI synthesis methods both
quantitatively and qualitatively. Notably, our model maintains superior
performance even with limited slice data.

Abstract: Multi-sequence Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers remarkable
versatility, enabling the distinct visualization of different tissue types.
Nevertheless, the inherent heterogeneity among MRI sequences poses significant
challenges to the generalization capability of deep learning models. These
challenges undermine model performance when faced with varying acquisition
parameters, thereby severely restricting their clinical utility. In this study,
we present PRISM, a foundation model PRe-trained with large-scale
multI-Sequence MRI. We collected a total of 64 datasets from both public and
private sources, encompassing a wide range of whole-body anatomical structures,
with scans spanning diverse MRI sequences. Among them, 336,476 volumetric MRI
scans from 34 datasets (8 public and 26 private) were curated to construct the
largest multi-organ multi-sequence MRI pretraining corpus to date. We propose a
novel pretraining paradigm that disentangles anatomically invariant features
from sequence-specific variations in MRI, while preserving high-level semantic
representations. We established a benchmark comprising 44 downstream tasks,
including disease diagnosis, image segmentation, registration, progression
prediction, and report generation. These tasks were evaluated on 32 public
datasets and 5 private cohorts. PRISM consistently outperformed both
non-pretrained models and existing foundation models, achieving first-rank
results in 39 out of 44 downstream benchmarks with statistical significance
improvements. These results underscore its ability to learn robust and
generalizable representations across unseen data acquired under diverse MRI
protocols. PRISM provides a scalable framework for multi-sequence MRI analysis,
thereby enhancing the translational potential of AI in radiology. It delivers
consistent performance across diverse imaging protocols, reinforcing its

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) reveals spatial heterogeneity of gene
expression, yet its resolution is limited by current platforms. Recent methods
enhance resolution via H&E-stained histology, but three major challenges
persist: (1) isolating expression-relevant features from visually complex H&E
images; (2) achieving spatially precise multimodal alignment in diffusion-based
frameworks; and (3) modeling gene-specific variation across expression
channels. We propose HaDM-ST (Histology-assisted Differential Modeling for ST
Generation), a high-resolution ST generation framework conditioned on H&E
images and low-resolution ST. HaDM-ST includes: (i) a semantic distillation
network to extract predictive cues from H&E; (ii) a spatial alignment module
enforcing pixel-wise correspondence with low-resolution ST; and (iii) a
channel-aware adversarial learner for fine-grained gene-level modeling.
Experiments on 200 genes across diverse tissues and species show HaDM-ST
consistently outperforms prior methods, enhancing spatial fidelity and

Result: EfficientNetV2S模型准确率达93.65%，结合HITL系统后进一步提升了性能。

Conclusion: 人机协作方法为AI辅助医疗诊断提供了高效、高精度的新方向。

Abstract: Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most prevalent form of breast cancer,
and early, accurate diagnosis is critical to improving patient survival rates
by guiding treatment decisions. Combining medical expertise with artificial
intelligence (AI) holds significant promise for enhancing the precision and
efficiency of IDC detection. In this work, we propose a human-in-the-loop
(HITL) deep learning system designed to detect IDC in histopathology images.
The system begins with an initial diagnosis provided by a high-performance
EfficientNetV2S model, offering feedback from AI to the human expert. Medical
professionals then review the AI-generated results, correct any misclassified
images, and integrate the revised labels into the training dataset, forming a
feedback loop from the human back to the AI. This iterative process refines the
model's performance over time. The EfficientNetV2S model itself achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods in the literature,
with an overall accuracy of 93.65\%. Incorporating the human-in-the-loop system
further improves the model's accuracy using four experimental groups with
misclassified images. These results demonstrate the potential of this
collaborative approach to enhance AI performance in diagnostic systems. This
work contributes to advancing automated, efficient, and highly accurate methods
for IDC detection through human-AI collaboration, offering a promising

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的扩散模型框架，用于生成解剖学精确的女性盆腔MRI图像，解决了现有模型在此领域的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在生成女性盆腔图像时解剖学精度不足，限制了其在妇科影像中的应用。数据稀缺和患者隐私问题也是重要挑战。

Method: 结合无条件与条件去噪扩散概率模型（DDPMs）和潜在扩散模型（LDMs），在2D和3D中生成高保真合成图像。

Result: 生成的图像解剖学一致且高保真，显著提升了诊断模型的准确性，并通过专家盲评验证了临床真实性。

Conclusion: 该框架为妇科影像提供了有价值的合成数据资源，支持可重复研究和公平AI发展，同时注重隐私保护。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in generative modelling, existing diffusion
models often struggle to produce anatomically precise female pelvic images,
limiting their application in gynaecological imaging, where data scarcity and
patient privacy concerns are critical. To overcome these barriers, we introduce
a novel diffusion-based framework for uterine MRI synthesis, integrating both
unconditional and conditioned Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs)
and Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) in 2D and 3D. Our approach generates
anatomically coherent, high fidelity synthetic images that closely mimic real
scans and provide valuable resources for training robust diagnostic models. We
evaluate generative quality using advanced perceptual and distributional
metrics, benchmarking against standard reconstruction methods, and demonstrate
substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy on a key classification task. A
blinded expert evaluation further validates the clinical realism of our
synthetic images. We release our models with privacy safeguards and a
comprehensive synthetic uterine MRI dataset to support reproducible research
and advance equitable AI in gynaecology.

Abstract: Red blood cells (RBCs) are essential to human health, and their precise
morphological analysis is important for diagnosing hematological disorders.
Despite the promise of foundation models in medical diagnostics, comprehensive
AI solutions for RBC analysis remain scarce. We present RedDino, a
self-supervised foundation model designed for RBC image analysis. RedDino uses
an RBC-specific adaptation of the DINOv2 self-supervised learning framework and
is trained on a curated dataset of 1.25 million RBC images from diverse
acquisition modalities and sources. Extensive evaluations show that RedDino
outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on RBC shape classification.
Through assessments including linear probing and nearest neighbor
classification, we confirm its strong feature representations and
generalization ability. Our main contributions are: (1) a foundation model
tailored for RBC analysis, (2) ablation studies exploring DINOv2 configurations
for RBC modeling, and (3) a detailed evaluation of generalization performance.
RedDino addresses key challenges in computational hematology by capturing
nuanced morphological features, advancing the development of reliable
diagnostic tools. The source code and pretrained models for RedDino are

TL;DR: DiffVC-OSD是一种基于单步扩散的感知神经视频压缩框架，通过直接输入重建的潜在表示到单步扩散模型中提升感知质量，并利用时间上下文适配器和端到端微调策略优化性能。实验表明其解码速度提升20倍，比特率降低86.92%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多步扩散方法效率较低，DiffVC-OSD旨在通过单步扩散提升视频压缩的感知质量和效率。

Method: 提出单步扩散模型，设计时间上下文适配器编码多级特征，并采用端到端微调策略。

Result: DiffVC-OSD在感知压缩性能上达到SOTA，解码速度快20倍，比特率降低86.92%。

Conclusion: DiffVC-OSD通过单步扩散显著提升了视频压缩的效率和感知质量。

Abstract: In this work, we first propose DiffVC-OSD, a One-Step Diffusion-based
Perceptual Neural Video Compression framework. Unlike conventional multi-step
diffusion-based methods, DiffVC-OSD feeds the reconstructed latent
representation directly into a One-Step Diffusion Model, enhancing perceptual
quality through a single diffusion step guided by both temporal context and the
latent itself. To better leverage temporal dependencies, we design a Temporal
Context Adapter that encodes conditional inputs into multi-level features,
offering more fine-grained guidance for the Denoising Unet. Additionally, we
employ an End-to-End Finetuning strategy to improve overall compression
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffVC-OSD achieves
state-of-the-art perceptual compression performance, offers about 20$\times$
faster decoding and a 86.92\% bitrate reduction compared to the corresponding
multi-step diffusion-based variant.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有低剂量CT去噪方法忽略了人体组织的解剖语义，可能导致去噪效果不佳。ALDEN旨在解决这一问题。

Method: ALDEN通过解剖感知判别器和语义引导对比学习模块，动态融合参考正常剂量CT的语义特征，并强制解剖一致性。

Result: 在两个低剂量CT去噪数据集上，ALDEN实现了最先进的性能，显著减少了过平滑问题并保留了解剖结构。

Conclusion: ALDEN在去噪任务中表现出色，同时在下游多器官分割任务中验证了其解剖感知能力。

Abstract: To reduce radiation exposure and improve the diagnostic efficacy of low-dose
computed tomography (LDCT), numerous deep learning-based denoising methods have
been developed to mitigate noise and artifacts. However, most of these
approaches ignore the anatomical semantics of human tissues, which may
potentially result in suboptimal denoising outcomes. To address this problem,
we propose ALDEN, an anatomy-aware LDCT denoising method that integrates
semantic features of pretrained vision models (PVMs) with adversarial and
contrastive learning. Specifically, we introduce an anatomy-aware discriminator
that dynamically fuses hierarchical semantic features from reference
normal-dose CT (NDCT) via cross-attention mechanisms, enabling tissue-specific
realism evaluation in the discriminator. In addition, we propose a
semantic-guided contrastive learning module that enforces anatomical
consistency by contrasting PVM-derived features from LDCT, denoised CT and
NDCT, preserving tissue-specific patterns through positive pairs and
suppressing artifacts via dual negative pairs. Extensive experiments conducted
on two LDCT denoising datasets reveal that ALDEN achieves the state-of-the-art
performance, offering superior anatomy preservation and substantially reducing
over-smoothing issue of previous work. Further validation on a downstream
multi-organ segmentation task (encompassing 117 anatomical structures) affirms
the model's ability to maintain anatomical awareness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MRI定量图像合成方法在准确性和泛化性上存在不足，需要一种更可靠的方法。

Method: 采用物理驱动的神经网络，嵌入MRI序列参数，输入T1、T2和T2-FLAIR图像，合成T1、T2和PD定量图。

Result: 在内部和外部测试数据集上表现优异，PSNR超过34 dB，SSIM高于0.92，泛化能力强。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了定量MRI合成的性能和可靠性，具有临床潜力。

Abstract: We propose a deep learning-based approach that integrates MRI sequence
parameters to improve the accuracy and generalizability of quantitative image
synthesis from clinical weighted MRI. Our physics-driven neural network embeds
MRI sequence parameters -- repetition time (TR), echo time (TE), and inversion
time (TI) -- directly into the model via parameter embedding, enabling the
network to learn the underlying physical principles of MRI signal formation.
The model takes conventional T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and T2-FLAIR images as
input and synthesizes T1, T2, and proton density (PD) quantitative maps.
Trained on healthy brain MR images, it was evaluated on both internal and
external test datasets. The proposed method achieved high performance with PSNR
values exceeding 34 dB and SSIM values above 0.92 for all synthesized parameter
maps. It outperformed conventional deep learning models in accuracy and
robustness, including data with previously unseen brain structures and lesions.
Notably, our model accurately synthesized quantitative maps for these unseen
pathological regions, highlighting its superior generalization capability.
Incorporating MRI sequence parameters via parameter embedding allows the neural
network to better learn the physical characteristics of MR signals,
significantly enhancing the performance and reliability of quantitative MRI
synthesis. This method shows great potential for accelerating qMRI and
improving its clinical utility.

*Zixuan Li,Zixiong Wang,Jian Yang,Milos Hasan,Beibei Wang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: PureSample提出了一种基于神经网络的BRDF表示方法，通过随机行走采样学习材料行为，简化了传统复杂且模型特定的BRDF推导过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于物理的材料模型依赖复杂的解析BRDF推导，且忽略了空间变化，同时需要额外的模型特定重要性采样设计。

Method: PureSample通过两个可学习组件实现：1) 使用流匹配神经网络建模采样分布；2) 引入轻量级神经网络捕获视点相关反照率。

Result: 该方法在多层材料、多次散射微表面材料等多种复杂材料上表现优异。

Conclusion: PureSample为BRDF建模提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案，适用于均匀和空间变化的材料。

Abstract: Traditional physically-based material models rely on analytically derived
bidirectional reflectance distribution functions (BRDFs), typically by
considering statistics of micro-primitives such as facets, flakes, or spheres,
sometimes combined with multi-bounce interactions such as layering and multiple
scattering. These derivations are often complex and model-specific, and
typically consider a statistical aggregate of a large surface area, ignoring
spatial variation. Once an analytic BRDF's evaluation is defined, one still
needs to design an importance sampling method for it, and a way to evaluate the
pdf of that sampling distribution, requiring further model-specific
derivations.
  We present PureSample: a novel neural BRDF representation that allows
learning a material's behavior purely by sampling forward random walks on the
microgeometry, which is usually straightforward to implement. Our
representation allows for efficient importance sampling, pdf evaluation, and
BRDF evaluation, for homogeneous as well as spatially varying materials.
  We achieve this by two learnable components: first, the sampling distribution
is modeled using a flow matching neural network, which allows both importance
sampling and pdf evaluation; second, we introduce a view-dependent albedo term,
captured by a lightweight neural network, which allows for converting a scalar
pdf value to a colored BRDF value for any pair of view and light directions.
  We demonstrate PureSample on challenging materials, including multi-layered
materials, multiple-scattering microfacet materials, and various other
microstructures.

Abstract: The criteria for determining graph isomorphism are crucial for solving graph
isomorphism problems. The necessary condition is that two isomorphic graphs
possess invariants, but their function can only be used to filtrate and
subdivide candidate spaces. The sufficient conditions are used to rebuild the
isomorphic reconstruction of special graphs, but their drawback is that the
isomorphic functions of subgraphs may not form part of the isomorphic functions
of the parent graph. The use of sufficient or necessary conditions generally
results in backtracking to ensure the correctness of the decision algorithm.
The sufficient and necessary conditions can ensure that the determination of
graph isomorphism does not require backtracking, but the correctness of its
proof process is difficult to guarantee. This article proposes a verification
method that can correctly determine whether the judgment conditions proposed by
previous researchers are sufficient and necessary conditions. A subdivision
method has also been proposed in this article, which can obtain more
subdivisions for necessary conditions and effectively reduce the size of
backtracking space.

Abstract: Recent research on learnable neural representations has been widely adopted
in the field of 3D scene reconstruction and neural rendering applications.
However, traditional feature grid representations often suffer from substantial
memory footprint, posing a significant bottleneck for modern parallel computing
hardware. In this paper, we present neural vertex features, a generalized
formulation of learnable representation for neural rendering tasks involving
explicit mesh surfaces. Instead of uniformly distributing neural features
throughout 3D space, our method stores learnable features directly at mesh
vertices, leveraging the underlying geometry as a compact and structured
representation for neural processing. This not only optimizes memory
efficiency, but also improves feature representation by aligning compactly with
the surface using task-specific geometric priors. We validate our neural
representation across diverse neural rendering tasks, with a specific emphasis
on neural radiosity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces
memory consumption to only one-fifth (or even less) of grid-based
representations, while maintaining comparable rendering quality and lowering
inference overhead.

Abstract: The ability to engineer complex three-dimensional shapes from planar sheets
with precise, programmable control underpins emerging technologies in soft
robotics, reconfigurable devices, and functional materials. Here, we present a
reduced-order numerical and experimental framework for a bilayer system
consisting of a stimuli-responsive thermoplastic sheet (Shrinky Dink) bonded to
a kirigami-patterned, inert plastic layer. Upon uniform heating, the active
layer contracts while the patterned layer constrains in-plane stretch but
allows out-of-plane bending, yielding programmable 3D morphologies from simple
planar precursors. Our approach enables efficient computational design and
scalable manufacturing of 3D forms with a single-layer reduced model that
captures the coupled mechanics of stretching and bending. Unlike traditional
bilayer modeling, our framework collapses the multilayer composite into a
single layer of nodes and elements, reducing the degrees of freedom and
enabling simulation on a 2D geometry. This is achieved by introducing a novel
energy formulation that captures the coupling between in-plane stretch mismatch
and out-of-plane bending - extending beyond simple isotropic linear elastic
models. Experimentally, we establish a fully planar, repeatable fabrication
protocol using a stimuli-responsive thermoplastic and a laser-cut inert plastic
layer. The programmed strain mismatch drives an array of 3D morphologies, such
as bowls, canoes, and flower petals, all verified by both simulation and
physical prototypes.

Abstract: We present LL3M, a multi-agent system that leverages pretrained large
language models (LLMs) to generate 3D assets by writing interpretable Python
code in Blender. We break away from the typical generative approach that learns
from a collection of 3D data. Instead, we reformulate shape generation as a
code-writing task, enabling greater modularity, editability, and integration
with artist workflows. Given a text prompt, LL3M coordinates a team of
specialized LLM agents to plan, retrieve, write, debug, and refine Blender
scripts that generate and edit geometry and appearance. The generated code
works as a high-level, interpretable, human-readable, well-documented
representation of scenes and objects, making full use of sophisticated Blender
constructs (e.g. B-meshes, geometry modifiers, shader nodes) for diverse,
unconstrained shapes, materials, and scenes. This code presents many avenues
for further agent and human editing and experimentation via code tweaks or
procedural parameters. This medium naturally enables a co-creative loop in our
system: agents can automatically self-critique using code and visuals, while
iterative user instructions provide an intuitive way to refine assets. A shared
code context across agents enables awareness of previous attempts, and a
retrieval-augmented generation knowledge base built from Blender API
documentation, BlenderRAG, equips agents with examples, types, and functions
empowering advanced modeling operations and code correctness. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of LL3M across diverse shape categories, style and material
edits, and user-driven refinements. Our experiments showcase the power of code
as a generative and interpretable medium for 3D asset creation. Our project
