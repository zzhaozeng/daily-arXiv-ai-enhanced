However, numerous technical reports indicate that purely rule-based reward RL frequently results in poor-quality reasoning chains or inconsistencies between reasoning processes and final answers, particularly when the base model is of smaller scale. During the RL exploration process, models might employ low-quality reasoning chains due to the lack of knowledge, occasionally producing correct answers randomly and receiving rewards based on established rule-based judges. This constrains the potential for resource-limited organizations to conduct direct reinforcement learning training on smaller-scale models. We propose a novel confidence-based reward model tailored for enhancing STEM reasoning capabilities. Unlike conventional approaches, our model penalizes not only incorrect answers but also low-confidence correct responses, thereby promoting more robust and logically consistent reasoning. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through static evaluations, Best-of-N inference tests, and PPO-based RL training. Our method outperforms several state-of-the-art open-source reward models across diverse STEM benchmarks.

To bridge this gap, we propose the \\textbf{Generative Semantic Workspace} (GSW), a neuro-inspired generative memory framework that builds structured, interpretable representations of evolving situations, enabling LLMs to reason over evolving roles, actions, and spatiotemporal contexts. Our framework comprises an \\textit{Operator}, which maps incoming observations to intermediate semantic structures, and a \\textit{Reconciler}, which integrates these into a persistent workspace that enforces temporal, spatial, and logical coherence. On the Episodic Memory Benchmark (EpBench) \\cite{huet_episodic_2025} comprising corpora ranging from 100k to 1M tokens in length, GSW outperforms existing RAG based baselines by up to \\textbf{20\\%}.

LLMs are trained to follow human alignment for safety, and post training quantization(PTQ) is applied afterward for efficiency. However, these two objectives are often in conflict, revealing a fundamental flaw in the conventional PTQ paradigm: quantization can turn into a safety vulnerability if it only aims to achieve low perplexity. Models can demonstrate low perplexity yet exhibit significant degradation in alignment with the safety policy, highlighting that perplexity alone is an insufficient and often misleading proxy for model safety. To address this, we propose Alignment-Aware Quantization(AAQ), a novel approach that integrates Alignment-Preserving Contrastive(APC) loss into the PTQ pipeline. Compared to simple reconstruction loss, ours explicitly preserves alignment by encouraging the quantized model to mimic its safe, instruction-tuned model while diverging from the unaligned, pre-trained counterpart. Our method achieves this robust safety alignment without resorting to specialized safety-focused calibration datasets, highlighting its practical utility and broad applicability. AAQ is compatible with standard PTQ techniques and enables robust 4-bit (W4A4) quantization across diverse model families such as LLaMA, Qwen, and Mistral while maintaining safety where previous methods fail.

Despite growing interest in brain-computer interface technologies, relatively little attention has been paid to developing EEG-based communication support systems tailored for aphasic patients. To address this gap, we recruited a single participant with expressive aphasia and conducted an Korean-based automatic speech task. EEG signals were recorded during task performance, and each trial was labeled as either correct or incorrect depending on whether the intended word was successfully spoken. Spectral analysis revealed distinct neural activation patterns between the two trial types: misarticulated trials exhibited excessive delta power across widespread channels and increased theta-alpha activity in frontal regions. Building upon these findings, we developed a soft multitask learning framework with maximum mean discrepancy regularization that focus on delta features to jointly optimize class discrimination while aligning the EEG feature distributions of correct and misarticulated trials. The proposed model achieved 58.6 % accuracy for correct and 45.5 % for misarticulated trials-outperforming the baseline by over 45 % on the latter-demonstrating robust intention decoding even under articulation errors. These results highlight the feasibility of EEG-based assistive systems capable of supporting real-world, imperfect speech conditions in aphasia patients.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eEEG\u7684\u8f6f\u6027\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u7801\u5931\u8bed\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u53d1\u97f3\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u8111\u673a\u63a5\u53e3\u6280\u672f\u5728\u9488\u5bf9\u5931\u8bed\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u9762\u5173\u6ce8\u5ea6\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e13\u95e8\u7684EEG\u901a\u4fe1\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u60a3\u8005\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u4e00\u4f4d\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u5931\u8bed\u75c7\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u97e9\u8bed\u81ea\u52a8\u8a00\u8bed\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8bb0\u5f55EEG\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u8a00\u8bed\u662f\u5426\u6210\u529f\u6807\u8bb0\u4e3a\u6b63\u786e\u6216\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u5229\u7528\u8f6f\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u6700\u5927\u5747\u503c\u5dee\u5f02\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8edelta\u6ce2\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u7c7b\u522b\u5224\u522b\u5e76\u8c03\u6574\u6b63\u786e\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u53d1\u97f3\u8bd5\u9a8c\u7684EEG\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6b63\u786e\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523058.6%\uff0c\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u53d1\u97f3\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523045.5%\uff0c\u5728\u540e\u8005\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4e0a\u8d85\u8fc7\u57fa\u7ebf45%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u8bed\u97f3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eEEG\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e5f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u5931\u8bed\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u4ea4\u6d41\u3002"}}

However, training reliable RMs under limited resources remains challenging due to the reliance on large-scale preference annotations and the high cost of fine-tuning LLMs. To address this, we propose SparseRM, which leverages Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to extract preference-relevant information encoded in model representations, enabling the construction of a lightweight and interpretable reward model. SparseRM first employs SAE to decompose LLM representations into interpretable directions that capture preference-relevant features. The representations are then projected onto these directions to compute alignment scores, which quantify the strength of each preference feature in the representations. A simple reward head aggregates these scores to predict preference scores. Experiments on three preference modeling tasks show that SparseRM achieves superior performance over most mainstream RMs while using less than 1% of trainable parameters.

Advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven significant progress in unified structural QA frameworks like TrustUQA. However, these frameworks face challenges when applied to small-scale LLMs since small-scale LLMs are prone to errors in generating structured queries. To improve the structured data QA ability of small-scale LLMs, we propose a self-correction distillation (SCD) method. In SCD, an error prompt mechanism (EPM) is designed to detect errors and provide customized error messages during inference, and a two-stage distillation strategy is designed to transfer large-scale LLMs' query-generation and error-correction capabilities to small-scale LLM. Experiments across 5 benchmarks with 3 structured data types demonstrate that our SCD achieves the best performance and superior generalization on small-scale LLM (8B) compared to other distillation methods, and closely approaches the performance of GPT4 on some datasets.

Existing methods either use one shared parameterized module across all roles or assign a separate parameterized module to each role. However, the role-shared module may ignore distinct traits of each role, weakening personality learning, while the role-specific module may overlook shared traits across multiple roles, hindering commonality modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel HyCoRA: Hyper-Contrastive Role-Adaptive learning framework, which efficiently improves multi-character role-playing ability by balancing the learning of distinct and shared traits. Specifically, we propose a Hyper-Half Low-Rank Adaptation structure, where one half is a role-specific module generated by a lightweight hyper-network, and the other half is a trainable role-shared module. The role-specific module is devised to represent distinct persona signatures, while the role-shared module serves to capture common traits.

BARD10 is a curated corpus of Bangla blog and opinion prose from ten contemporary authors, alongside the methodical assessment of four representative classifiers: SVM (Support Vector Machine), Bangla BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), XGBoost, and a MLP (Multilayer Perception), utilizing uniform preprocessing on both BARD10 and the benchmark corpora BAAD16 (Bangla Authorship Attribution Dataset of 16 authors). In all datasets, the classical TF-IDF + SVM baseline outperformed, attaining a macro-F1 score of 0.997 on BAAD16 and 0.921 on BARD10, while Bangla BERT lagged by as much as five points. This study reveals that BARD10 authors are highly sensitive to stop-word pruning, while BAAD16 authors remain comparatively robust highlighting genre-dependent reliance on stop-word signatures. Error analysis revealed that high frequency components transmit authorial signatures that are diminished or reduced by transformer models.

However, these approaches neglect supervision over the reasoning process, making it difficult to guarantee logical coherence and rigor. To address these limitations, we propose Thinker, a hierarchical thinking model for deep search through multi-turn interaction, making the reasoning process supervisable and verifiable. It decomposes complex problems into independently solvable sub-problems, each dually represented in both natural language and an equivalent logical function to support knowledge base and web searches. Concurrently, dependencies between sub-problems are passed as parameters via these logical functions, enhancing the logical coherence of the problem-solving process. To avoid unnecessary external searches, we perform knowledge boundary determination to check if a sub-problem is within the LLM's intrinsic knowledge, allowing it to answer directly. Experimental results indicate that with as few as several hundred training samples, the performance of Thinker is competitive with established baselines. Furthermore, when scaled to the full training set, Thinker significantly outperforms these methods across various datasets and model sizes.

Drawing on corpora of science fiction (Gollancz SF Masterworks) and general fiction (NovelTM), we operationalise Darko Suvin's theory of estrangement as computationally measurable deviation in token prediction, using RoBERTa to generate lexical substitutes for masked referents and classifying them via Gemini. We quantify conceptual slippage through three metrics: retention rate, replacement rate, and entropy, mapping the stability or disruption of category boundaries across genres. Our findings reveal that science fiction exhibits heightened conceptual permeability, particularly around machine referents, which show significant cross-category substitution and dispersion. Human terms, by contrast, maintain semantic coherence and often anchor substitutional hierarchies. These patterns suggest a genre-specific restructuring within anthropocentric logics. We argue that estrangement in science fiction operates as a controlled perturbation of semantic norms, detectable through probabilistic modelling, and that MLMs, when used critically, serve as interpretive instruments capable of surfacing genre-conditioned ontological assumptions.

A major challenge lies in modeling the intrinsic stochasticity of temporal dynamics, as real-world sequences often exhibit random fluctuations and localized variations. While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success, their generation process is computationally inefficient, often requiring hundreds to thousands of expensive function evaluations per sample. Flow matching has emerged as a more efficient paradigm, yet its conventional ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based formulation fails to explicitly capture stochasticity, thereby limiting the fidelity of generated sequences. By contrast, stochastic differential equation (SDE) are naturally suited for modeling randomness and uncertainty. Motivated by these insights, we propose TimeFlow, a novel SDE-based flow matching framework that integrates a encoder-only architecture. Specifically, we design a component-wise decomposed velocity field to capture the multi-faceted structure of time series and augment the vanilla flow-matching optimization with an additional stochastic term to enhance representational expressiveness. TimeFlow is flexible and general, supporting both unconditional and conditional generation tasks within a unified framework. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms strong baselines in generation quality, diversity, and efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTimeFlow\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eSDE\u7684\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5728\u4e8e\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5185\u5728\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfODE-based\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff0c\u800cSDE\u5929\u7136\u9002\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u968f\u673a\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5206\u89e3\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u6765\u6355\u6349\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u591a\u9762\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u589e\u52a0\u968f\u673a\u9879\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\uff0c\u91c7\u7528encoder-only\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTimeFlow\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "TimeFlow\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

Addressing these challenges, we introduce VersAtile and Risk-Sensitive cardiac diagnosis (VARS), an innovative approach that employs a graph-based representation to uniformly model heterogeneous ECG signals. VARS stands out by transforming ECG signals into versatile graph structures that capture critical diagnostic features, irrespective of signal diversity in the lead count, sampling frequency, and duration. This graph-centric formulation also enhances diagnostic sensitivity, enabling precise localization and identification of abnormal ECG patterns that often elude standard analysis methods. To facilitate representation transformation, our approach integrates denoising reconstruction with contrastive learning to preserve raw ECG information while highlighting pathognomonic patterns. We rigorously evaluate the efficacy of VARS on three distinct ECG datasets, encompassing a range of structural variations. The results demonstrate that VARS not only consistently surpasses existing state-of-the-art models across all these datasets but also exhibits substantial improvement in identifying risk signals. Additionally, VARS offers interpretability by pinpointing the exact waveforms that lead to specific model outputs, thereby assisting clinicians in making informed decisions. These findings suggest that our VARS will likely emerge as an invaluable tool for comprehensive cardiac health assessment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aVARS\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\uff08ECG\uff09\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u5f62\u5316\u8868\u793a\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u914d\u7f6e\u7684ECG\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u6837\u672c\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728ECG\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u5feb\u901f\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u969c\u788d\uff1a\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6837\u5316ECG\u4fe1\u53f7\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7531\u4e8e\u6837\u672c\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5bfc\u81f4\u98ce\u9669\u4fe1\u53f7\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "VARS\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06ECG\u4fe1\u53f7\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u5173\u952e\u8bca\u65ad\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e0d\u53d7\u5bfc\u8054\u6570\u3001\u91c7\u6837\u9891\u7387\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u53bb\u566a\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u59cbECG\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u7a81\u51fa\u75c5\u7406\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5f02\u7684ECG\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cVARS\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u98ce\u9669\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u8fd8\u5177\u5907\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5bfc\u81f4\u7279\u5b9a\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u6ce2\u5f62\u3002", "conclusion": "VARS\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u654f\u611f\u6027\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u6210\u4e3a\u5168\u9762\u5fc3\u810f\u5065\u5eb7\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u505a\u51fa\u66f4\u660e\u667a\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u3002"}}

However, existing legal benchmarks often conflate factual recall with genuine inference, fragment the reasoning process, and overlook the quality of reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce MSLR, the first Chinese multi-step legal reasoning dataset grounded in real-world judicial decision making. MSLR adopts the IRAC framework (Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion) to model structured expert reasoning from official legal documents. In addition, we design a scalable Human-LLM collaborative annotation pipeline that efficiently produces fine-grained step-level reasoning annotations and provides a reusable methodological framework for multi-step reasoning datasets. Evaluation of multiple LLMs on MSLR shows only moderate performance, highlighting the challenges of adapting to complex legal reasoning. Further experiments demonstrate that Self-Initiated Chain-of-Thought prompts generated by models autonomously improve reasoning coherence and quality, outperforming human-designed prompts. MSLR contributes to advancing LLM reasoning and Chain-of-Thought strategies and offers open resources for future research.

It is an open question whether this architectural bias leads to degraded performance for languages that are structurally different from English. We examine one specific architectural choice: positional encodings, through the lens of the trade-off hypothesis: the supposed interplay between morphological complexity and word order flexibility. This hypothesis posits a trade-off between the two: a more morphologically complex language can have a more flexible word order, and vice-versa. Positional encodings are a direct target to investigate the implications of this hypothesis in relation to language modelling. We pretrain monolingual model variants with absolute, relative, and no positional encodings for seven typologically diverse languages and evaluate them on four downstream tasks.

Prior works study the spatial and temporal dependency in a decouple manner, failing to capture their joint effect. In this work, we propose ST-SAM, a novel and efficient Spatial-Temporal Self-Attention Model for traffic forecasting. ST-SAM uses a region embedding layer to learn time-specific embedding from traffic data for regions. Then, it employs a spatial-temporal dependency learning module based on self-attention mechanism to capture the joint spatial-temporal dependency for both nearby and faraway regions. ST-SAM entirely relies on self-attention to capture both local and global spatial-temporal correlations, which make it effective and efficient. Extensive experiments on two real world datasets show that ST-SAM is substantially more accurate and efficient than the state-of-the-art approaches (with an average improvement of up to 15% on RMSE, 17% on MAPE, and 32 times on training time in our experiments).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u65f6\u7a7a\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578bST-SAM\u7528\u4e8e\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u7531\u4e8e\u533a\u57df\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u800c\u53d8\u5f97\u590d\u6742\u3002\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4ee5\u89e3\u8026\u65b9\u5f0f\u5206\u6790\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u5176\u8054\u5408\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "method": "ST-SAM\u91c7\u7528\u533a\u57df\u5d4c\u5165\u5c42\u4ece\u4ea4\u901a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u533a\u57df\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\u6765\u6355\u6349\u90bb\u8fd1\u548c\u8fdc\u5904\u533a\u57df\u7684\u8054\u5408\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cST-SAM\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff08RMSE\u63d0\u534715%\uff0cMAPE\u63d0\u534717%\uff09\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff08\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1132\u500d\uff09\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ST-SAM\u5b8c\u5168\u4f9d\u8d56\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6355\u6349\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u65f6\u7a7a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u4ea4\u901a\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

However, recent research reveals that LLMs still exhibit performance gaps in Document-level Relation Extraction (DocRE) as requiring fine-grained comprehension. The commonly adopted \"extract entities then predict relations\" paradigm in LLM-based methods leads to these gaps due to two main reasons: (1) Numerous unrelated entity pairs introduce noise and interfere with the relation prediction for truly related entity pairs. (2) Although LLMs have identified semantic associations between entities, relation labels beyond the predefined set are still treated as prediction errors. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Relation as a Prior (RelPrior) paradigm for LLM-based DocRE. For challenge (1), RelPrior utilizes binary relation as a prior to extract and determine whether two entities are correlated, thereby filtering out irrelevant entity pairs and reducing prediction noise. For challenge (2), RelPrior utilizes predefined relation as a prior to match entities for triples extraction instead of directly predicting relation.

But does this assumption hold for low-resource, morphologically rich languages such as Sanskrit? We address this question by comparing instruction-tuned and in-context-prompted LLMs with smaller task-specific encoder-decoder models on the Sanskrit poetry-to-prose conversion task. This task is intrinsically challenging: Sanskrit verse exhibits free word order combined with rigid metrical constraints, and its conversion to canonical prose (anvaya) requires multi-step reasoning involving compound segmentation, dependency resolution, and syntactic linearisation. This makes it an ideal testbed to evaluate whether LLMs can surpass specialised models. For LLMs, we apply instruction fine-tuning on general-purpose models and design in-context learning templates grounded in Paninian grammar and classical commentary heuristics. For task-specific modelling, we fully fine-tune a ByT5-Sanskrit Seq2Seq model. Our experiments show that domain-specific fine-tuning of ByT5-Sanskrit significantly outperforms all instruction-driven LLM approaches. Human evaluation strongly corroborates this result, with scores exhibiting high correlation with Kendall's Tau scores.

While manually crafting CQs can be highly time-consuming and costly for ontology engineers, recent studies have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate this process. However, prior approaches have largely evaluated generated CQs based on their similarity to existing datasets, which often fail to verify semantic pitfalls such as \"Misusing allValuesFrom\". Since such pitfalls cannot be reliably detected through rule-based methods, we propose a novel dataset and model of Validating Semantic Pitfalls in Ontology (VSPO) for CQ generation specifically designed to verify the semantic pitfalls. To simulate missing and misused axioms, we use LLMs to generate natural language definitions of classes and properties and introduce misalignments between the definitions and the ontology by removing axioms or altering logical operators (e.g., substituting union with intersection). We then fine-tune LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct to generate CQs that validate these semantic discrepancies between the provided definitions and the corresponding axioms. The resulting CQs can detect a broader range of modeling errors compared to existing public datasets. Our fine-tuned model demonstrates superior performance over baselines, showing 26% higher precision and 28.2% higher recall than GPT-4.1 in generating CQs for pitfall validation. This research enables automatic generation of TBox-validating CQs using LLMs, significantly reducing manual effort while improving semantic alignment between ontologies and expert knowledge.

However, existing studies on the expressive power of GNNs mainly focuses on simple single-relation graphs, and there is still insufficient discussion on the power of GNN to express logical rules in KGs. How to enhance the logical expressive power of GNNs is still a key issue. Motivated by this, we propose Path-Neighbor enhanced GNN (PN-GNN), a method to enhance the logical expressive power of GNN by aggregating node-neighbor embeddings on the reasoning path. First, we analyze the logical expressive power of existing GNN-based methods and point out the shortcomings of the expressive power of these methods. Then, we theoretically investigate the logical expressive power of PN-GNN, showing that it not only has strictly stronger expressive power than C-GNN but also that its $(k+1)$-hop logical expressiveness is strictly superior to that of $k$-hop. Finally, we evaluate the logical expressive power of PN-GNN on six synthetic datasets and two real-world datasets.

This article presents an embedding-based benchmarking framework to detect bias in LLMs in the context of formative feedback. Using 600 authentic student essays from the AES 2.0 corpus, we constructed controlled counterfactuals along two dimensions: (i) implicit cues via lexicon-based swaps of gendered terms within essays, and (ii) explicit cues via gendered author background in the prompt. We investigated six representative LLMs (i.e. GPT-5 mini, GPT-4o mini, DeepSeek-R1, DeepSeek-R1-Qwen, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama-3-8B). We first quantified the response divergence with cosine and Euclidean distances over sentence embeddings, then assessed significance via permutation tests, and finally, visualised structure using dimensionality reduction. In all models, implicit manipulations reliably induced larger semantic shifts for male-female counterfactuals than for female-male. Only the GPT and Llama models showed sensitivity to explicit gender cues. These findings show that even state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit asymmetric semantic responses to gender substitutions, suggesting persistent gender biases in feedback they provide learners. Qualitative analyses further revealed consistent linguistic differences (e.g., more autonomy-supportive feedback under male cues vs. more controlling feedback under female cues).

In this work, we propose VocalBench-zh, an ability-level divided evaluation suite adapted to Mandarin context consisting of 10 well-crafted subsets and over 10K high-quality instances, covering 12 user-oriented characters. The evaluation experiment on 14 mainstream models reveals the common challenges for current routes, and highlights the need for new insights into next-generation speech interactive systems.

To explore this issue, we propose a new perturbation framework to evaluate LLMs' reasoning ability in complex environments by injecting additional semantically irrelevant perturbation sentences and gradually increasing the perturbation intensity. At the same time, we use an additional perturbation method: core questioning instruction missing, to further analyze the LLMs' problem-solving mechanism. The experimental results show that LLMs perform stably when facing perturbation sentences without numbers, but there is also a robustness boundary. As the perturbation intensity increases, the performance exhibits varying degrees of decline; when facing perturbation sentences with numbers, the performance decreases more significantly, most open source models with smaller parameters decrease by nearly or even more than 10%, and further increasing with the enhancement of perturbation intensity, with the maximum decrease reaching 51.55%. Even the most advanced commercial LLMs have seen a 3%-10% performance drop. By analyzing the reasoning process of LLMs in detail, We find that models are more sensitive to perturbations with numerical information and are more likely to give incorrect answers when disturbed by irrelevant numerical information. The higher the perturbation intensity, the more obvious these defects are. At the same time, in the absence of core questioning instruction, models can still maintain an accuracy of 20%-40%, indicating that LLMs may rely on memory templates or pattern matching to complete the task, rather than logical reasoning.

While large language models(LLMs) show promise in such tasks, their application to biomolecular problems is hindered by logical inconsistencies and the lack of grounding in domain knowledge. Existing approaches often exacerbate these issues: reasoning steps may deviate from biological facts or fail to capture long mechanistic dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose a Knowledge-Augmented Long-CoT Reasoning framework that integrates LLMs with knowledge graph-based multi-hop reasoning chains. The framework constructs mechanistic chains via guided multi-hop traversal and pruning on the knowledge graph; these chains are then incorporated into supervised fine-tuning to improve factual grounding and further refined with reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning reliability and consistency. Furthermore, to overcome the shortcomings of existing benchmarks, which are often restricted in scale and scope and lack annotations for deep reasoning chains, we introduce PrimeKGQA, a comprehensive benchmark for biomolecular question answering. Experimental results on both PrimeKGQA and existing datasets demonstrate that although larger closed-source models still perform well on relatively simple tasks, our method demonstrates clear advantages as reasoning depth increases, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multi-hop tasks that demand traversal of structured biological knowledge.

Specifically, we explore whether VLLMs can infer the hierarchical structure of tables without additional processing. As a basis for our experiments we use the PubTables-1M dataset, a large-scale corpus of scientific tables. From this dataset, we extract a subset of tables that we introduce as Complex Hierarchical Tables (CHiTab): a benchmark collection of complex tables containing hierarchical headings. We adopt a series of prompt engineering strategies to probe the models' comprehension capabilities, experimenting with various prompt formats and writing styles. Multiple state-of-the-art open-weights VLLMs are evaluated on the benchmark first using their off-the-shelf versions and then fine-tuning some models on our task. We also measure the performance of humans to solve the task on a small set of tables comparing with performance of the evaluated VLLMs. The experiments support our intuition that generic VLLMs, not explicitly designed for understanding the structure of tables, can perform this task.

However, the key research question of identifying reasoning steps that balance complexity and computational efficiency remains unsolved. Recent research has increasingly drawn upon psychological theories to explore strategies for optimizing cognitive pathways. The LLM's final outputs and intermediate steps are regarded as System 1 and System 2, respectively. However, an in-depth exploration of the System 2 reasoning is still lacking. Therefore, we propose a novel psychologically backed Scaffold Reasoning framework for code debugging, which encompasses the Scaffold Stream, Analytic Stream, and Integration Stream. The construction of reference code within the Scaffold Stream is integrated with the buggy code analysis results produced by the Analytic Stream through the Integration Stream. Our framework achieves an 88.91% pass rate and an average inference time of 5.36 seconds per-problem on DebugBench, outperforming other reasoning approaches across various LLMs in both reasoning accuracy and efficiency. Further analyses elucidate the advantages and limitations of various cognitive pathways across varying problem difficulties and bug types.

However, they can fall short, especially when required to account for personalization or specific knowledge. In real-life settings, it is impractical to rely on users to detect these errors and request a new response. One way to address this problem is to refine the response before returning it to the user. While existing approaches focus on refining responses within a single LLM, this method struggles to consider diverse aspects needed for effective conversations. In this work, we propose refining responses through a multi-agent framework, where each agent is assigned a specific role for each aspect. We focus on three key aspects crucial to conversational quality: factuality, personalization, and coherence. Each agent is responsible for reviewing and refining one of these aspects, and their feedback is then merged to improve the overall response. To enhance collaboration among them, we introduce a dynamic communication strategy. Instead of following a fixed sequence of agents, our approach adaptively selects and coordinates the most relevant agents based on the specific requirements of each query.

The widespread adoption of test-time scaling further aggravates the tension between model capability and resource consumption, highlighting the importance of inference efficiency. However, a unified metric that accurately reflects an LLM's efficiency across different model sizes and architectures remains absent. Motivated by the correlation between compression and intelligence, we introduce information capacity, a measure of model efficiency based on text compression performance relative to computational complexity. Larger models can predict the next token more accurately, achieving greater compression gains but at higher computational costs. Empirical evaluations on mainstream open-source models show that models of varying sizes within a series exhibit consistent information capacity. This metric enables a fair efficiency comparison across model series and accurate performance prediction within a model series. A distinctive feature of information capacity is that it incorporates tokenizer efficiency, which affects both input and output token counts but is often neglected in LLM evaluations.

Anomaly detection in this type of data constitutes a challenging problem yet with numerous applications in science and engineering because anomaly scores come from the simultaneous consideration of the temporal and variable relationships. In this paper, we propose a clustering-based approach to detect anomalies concerning the amplitude and the shape of multivariate time series. First, we use a sliding window to generate a set of multivariate subsequences and thereafter apply an extended fuzzy clustering to reveal a structure present within the generated multivariate subsequences. Finally, a reconstruction criterion is employed to reconstruct the multivariate subsequences with the optimal cluster centers and the partition matrix. We construct a confidence index to quantify a level of anomaly detected in the series and apply Particle Swarm Optimization as an optimization vehicle for the problem of anomaly detection. Experimental studies completed on several synthetic and six real-world datasets suggest that the proposed methods can detect the anomalies in multivariate time series. With the help of available clusters revealed by the extended fuzzy clustering, the proposed framework can detect anomalies in the multivariate time series and is suitable for identifying anomalous amplitude and shape patterns in various application domains such as health care, weather data analysis, finance, and disease outbreak detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5e45\u503c\u548c\u5f62\u72b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u53d8\u91cf\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u751f\u6210\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u5b50\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u7cca\u805a\u7c7b\u63ed\u793a\u5b50\u5e8f\u5217\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u91cd\u5efa\u51c6\u5219\u548c\u7c92\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f18\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u7cca\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u5e45\u503c\u548c\u5f62\u72b6\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) provide feedback after generating the final answers but fail to evaluate the process for multi-step reasoning. Traditional Process Reward Models (PRMs) evaluate the reasoning process but require costly human annotations or rollout generation. While implicit PRM is trained only with outcome signals and derives step rewards through reward parameterization without explicit annotations, it is more suitable for multi-step reasoning in MHQA tasks. However, existing implicit PRM has only been explored for plain text scenarios. When adapting to MHQA tasks, it cannot handle the graph structure constraints in KGs and capture the potential inconsistency between CoT and KG paths. To address these limitations, we propose the DPRM (Dual Implicit Process Reward Model). It trains two implicit PRMs for CoT and KG reasoning in MHQA tasks. Both PRMs, namely KG-PRM and CoT-PRM, derive step-level rewards from outcome signals via reward parameterization without additional explicit annotations. Among them, KG-PRM uses preference pairs to learn structural constraints from KGs. DPRM further introduces a consistency constraint between CoT and KG reasoning steps, making the two PRMs mutually verify and collaboratively optimize the reasoning paths. We also provide a theoretical demonstration of the derivation of process rewards.

A five-pillar architecture--governance, data lineage, assurance, resilience, and regulatory alignment--translates supervisory expectations from Solvency II, SR 11-7, and guidance from EIOPA (2025), NAIC (2023), and IAIS (2024) into measurable lifecycle controls. The framework is implemented through the Reinsurance AI Reliability and Assurance Benchmark (RAIRAB), which evaluates whether governance-embedded LLMs meet prudential standards for grounding, transparency, and accountability. Across six task families, retrieval-grounded configurations achieved higher grounding accuracy (0.90), reduced hallucination and interpretive drift by roughly 40%, and nearly doubled transparency. These mechanisms lower informational frictions in risk transfer and capital allocation, showing that existing prudential doctrines already accommodate reliable AI when governance is explicit, data are traceable, and assurance is verifiable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u518d\u4fdd\u9669\u9886\u57df\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u5ba1\u614e\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u65bd\u57fa\u51c6RAIRAB\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6cbb\u7406\u5d4c\u5165\u3001\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4fdd\u969c\u4e0b\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u518d\u4fdd\u9669\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u786e\u4fdd\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u8d44\u672c\u5206\u914d\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6469\u64e6\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5ba1\u614e\u539f\u5219\u9700\u8981\u5177\u4f53\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9AI\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e94\u652f\u67f1\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u6cbb\u7406\u3001\u6570\u636e\u8840\u7edf\u3001\u4fdd\u969c\u3001\u5f39\u6027\u548c\u76d1\u7ba1\u5bf9\u9f50\uff09\uff0c\u5c06Solvency II\u3001SR 11-7\u7b49\u76d1\u7ba1\u8981\u6c42\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u8861\u91cf\u7684\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7RAIRAB\u57fa\u51c6\u5b9e\u65bd\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6cbb\u7406\u5d4c\u5165\u7684LLMs\u3002", "result": "\u68c0\u7d22\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u57fa\u7840\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff080.90\uff09\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea640%\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u5e76\u51e0\u4e4e\u4f7f\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u7ffb\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u6cbb\u7406\u660e\u786e\u3001\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u3001\u4fdd\u969c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65f6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5ba1\u614e\u539f\u5219\u5df2\u7ecf\u80fd\u591f\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u9760\u7684AI\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u518d\u4fdd\u9669\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6469\u64e6\u3002"}}

In this paper, we investigate the impact of feature reduction using XAI techniques on the quality classification of injection-molded parts. We apply SHAP, Grad-CAM, and LIME to analyze feature importance in a Long Short-Term Memory model trained on real production data. By reducing the original 19 input features to 9 and 6, we evaluate the trade-off between model accuracy, inference speed, and interpretability. Our results show that reducing features can improve generalization while maintaining high classification performance, with an small increase in inference speed.

However, data acquisition remains a major challenge as it is both time-consuming and costly. Synthetic data offers a promising solution to augment insufficient data sets and improve the robustness of machine learning models. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of incorporating synthetic data into the training process of the injection molding process using an existing Long Short-Term Memory architecture. Our approach is to generate synthetic data by simulating production cycles and incorporating them into the training data set. Through iterative experimentation with different proportions of synthetic data, we attempt to find an optimal balance that maximizes the benefits of synthetic data while preserving the authenticity and relevance of real data. Our results suggest that the inclusion of synthetic data improves the model's ability to handle different scenarios, with potential practical industrial applications to reduce manual labor, machine use, and material waste.

Speech-based assessments show promise for early detection, as phonetic motor planning deficits alter acoustic features (e.g., pitch, tone), while memory and language impairments lead to syntactic and semantic errors. However, conventional speech-processing pipelines with hand-crafted features or general-purpose audio classifiers often exhibit limited performance and generalizability. To address these limitations, we introduce SpeechCARE, a multimodal speech processing pipeline that leverages pretrained, multilingual acoustic and linguistic transformer models to capture subtle speech-related cues associated with cognitive impairment. Inspired by the Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm, SpeechCARE employs a dynamic fusion architecture that weights transformer-based acoustic, linguistic, and demographic inputs, allowing integration of additional modalities (e.g., social factors, imaging) and enhancing robustness across diverse tasks. Its robust preprocessing includes automatic transcription, large language model (LLM)-based anomaly detection, and task identification. A SHAP-based explainability module and LLM reasoning highlight each modality's contribution to decision-making. SpeechCARE achieved AUC = 0.88 and F1 = 0.72 for classifying cognitively healthy, MCI, and AD individuals, with AUC = 0.90 and F1 = 0.62 for MCI detection. Bias analysis showed minimal disparities, except for adults over 80. Mitigation techniques included oversampling and weighted loss.

In particular, the impact of shortcut learning, where models rely on spurious correlations instead of capturing causal task-relevant features, has received limited attention. To address this gap, we conduct an in-depth study to assess how detectors are influenced by potential shortcuts based on textual features, which are most susceptible to manipulation by social bots. We design a series of shortcut scenarios by constructing spurious associations between user labels and superficial textual cues to evaluate model robustness. Results show that shifts in irrelevant feature distributions significantly degrade social bot detector performance, with an average relative accuracy drop of 32\\% in the baseline models. To tackle this challenge, we propose mitigation strategies based on large language models, leveraging counterfactual data augmentation. These methods mitigate the problem from data and model perspectives across three levels, including data distribution at both the individual user text and overall dataset levels, as well as the model's ability to extract causal information. Our strategies achieve an average relative performance improvement of 56\\% under shortcut scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6709\u9650\u3002\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5feb\u6377\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u793e\u4ea4\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7531\u4e8e\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u7684\u5730\u9762\u771f\u76f8\u548c\u591a\u6837\u7684\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u3002\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5feb\u6377\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\uff0c\u8fd9\u4fc3\u4f7f\u672c\u6587\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u7528\u6237\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0e\u8868\u9762\u6587\u672c\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u865a\u5047\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5feb\u6377\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5c42\u9762\u7f13\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u65e0\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u504f\u79fb\u5bfc\u81f4\u793e\u4ea4\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u76f8\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u4e8632%\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5feb\u6377\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5e73\u574756%\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u5feb\u6377\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u793e\u4ea4\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

These require gathering information from a large set of documents and reasoning over them. To address this gap, we propose S-RAG, an approach specifically designed for such queries.

Correspondingly, existing research in this field has been limited to word and alphabet level detection. In this work, we introduce Bangla-SGP, a novel parallel dataset consisting of 1,000 human-annotated sentence-gloss pairs which was augmented with around 3,000 synthetically generated pairs using syntactic and morphological rules through a rule-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. The gloss sequences of the spoken Bangla sentences are made up of individual glosses which are Bangla sign supported words and serve as an intermediate representation for a continuous sign. Our dataset consists of 1000 high quality Bangla sentences that are manually annotated into a gloss sequence by a professional signer. The augmentation process incorporates rule-based linguistic strategies and prompt engineering techniques that we have adopted by critically analyzing our human annotated sentence-gloss pairs and by working closely with our professional signer. Furthermore, we fine-tune several transformer-based models such as mBart50, Google mT5, GPT4.1-nano and evaluate their sentence-to-gloss translation performance using BLEU scores, based on these evaluation metrics we compare the model's gloss-translation consistency across our dataset and the RWTH-PHOENIX-2014T benchmark.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u624b\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6570\u636e\u96c6Bangla-SGP\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5fae\u8c03\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u53e5\u5b50\u5230\u624b\u8bed\u8bcd\u6c47\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u624b\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u800c\u53d7\u5230\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u8bcd\u548c\u5b57\u6bcd\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u53e5\u5b50\u7ea7\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b1000\u4e2a\u624b\u52a8\u6ce8\u91ca\u7684\u53e5\u5b50-\u624b\u8bed\u8bcd\u6c47\u5bf9\u7684\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53e5\u6cd5\u548c\u5f62\u6001\u89c4\u5219\u5408\u6210\u7ea63000\u4e2a\u989d\u5916\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u4e86\u51e0\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528BLEU\u5206\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7BLEU\u8bc4\u5206\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53e5\u5b50\u5230\u624b\u8bed\u8bcd\u6c47\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eRWTH-PHOENIX-2014T\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "conclusion": "Bangla-SGP\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5f15\u5165\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u624b\u8bed\u53e5\u5b50\u7ea7\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90NLP\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

These data are often collected from online sources. This raises serious concerns about the protection of user data, as individuals may not have given consent for their data to be used in training. To address this concern, recent studies introduce the concept of unlearnable examples, i.e., data instances that appear natural but are intentionally altered to prevent models from effectively learning from them. While existing methods demonstrate empirical effectiveness, they typically rely on heuristic trials and lack formal guarantees. Besides, when unlearnable examples are mixed with clean data, as is often the case in practice, their unlearnability disappears. In this work, we propose a novel approach to constructing unlearnable examples by systematically maximising the Bayes error, a measurement of irreducible classification error. We develop an optimisation-based approach and provide an efficient solution using projected gradient ascent. Our method provably increases the Bayes error and remains effective when the unlearning examples are mixed with clean samples. Experimental results across multiple datasets and model architectures are consistent with our theoretical analysis and show that our approach can restrict data learnability, effectively in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5316\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8bef\u5dee\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6837\u672c\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6d77\u91cf\u5728\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5f62\u5f0f\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e14\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u6570\u636e\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6700\u5927\u5316\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8bef\u5dee\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6837\u672c\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u6295\u5f71\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u6570\u636e\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f9d\u7136\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u9650\u5236\u6570\u636e\u7684\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u62a4\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\u3002"}}

Beyond improving abilities, these detailed reasoning traces also create a new opportunity for AI safety, CoT Monitorability: monitoring potential model misbehavior, such as the use of shortcuts or sycophancy, through their chain-of-thought (CoT) during decision-making. However, two key fundamental challenges arise when attempting to build more effective monitors through CoT analysis. First, as prior research on CoT faithfulness has pointed out, models do not always truthfully represent their internal decision-making in the generated reasoning. Second, monitors themselves may be either overly sensitive or insufficiently sensitive, and can potentially be deceived by models' long, elaborate reasoning traces. In this paper, we present the first systematic investigation of the challenges and potential of CoT monitorability. Motivated by two fundamental challenges we mentioned before, we structure our study around two central perspectives: (i) verbalization: to what extent do LRMs faithfully verbalize the true factors guiding their decisions in the CoT, and (ii) monitor reliability: to what extent can misbehavior be reliably detected by a CoT-based monitor?

Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), have enabled virtual screening methods that reduce costs and improve efficiency. However, the growing complexity of these tools has limited their accessibility to wet-lab researchers. Multi-agent systems offer a promising solution by combining the interpretability of LLMs with the precision of specialized models and tools. In this work, we present MADD, a multi-agent system that builds and executes customized hit identification pipelines from natural language queries. MADD employs four coordinated agents to handle key subtasks in de novo compound generation and screening. We evaluate MADD across seven drug discovery cases and demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing LLM-based solutions. Using MADD, we pioneer the application of AI-first drug design to five biological targets and release the identified hit molecules.

While von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions offer a theoretically grounded alternative on the sphere, their reliance on Bessel functions and rejection sampling hinders practical adoption. We propose \\textbf{Geometric Action Control (GAC)}, a novel action generation paradigm that preserves the geometric benefits of spherical distributions while \\textit{simplifying computation}. GAC decomposes action generation into a direction vector and a learnable concentration parameter, enabling efficient interpolation between deterministic actions and uniform spherical noise. This design reduces parameter count from \\(2d\\) to \\(d+1\\), and avoids the \\(O(dk)\\) complexity of vMF rejection sampling, achieving simple \\(O(d)\\) operations. Empirically, GAC consistently matches or exceeds state-of-the-art methods across six MuJoCo benchmarks, achieving 37.6\\% improvement over SAC on Ant-v4 and the best results on 4 out of 6 tasks. Our ablation studies reveal that both \\textbf{spherical normalization} and \\textbf{adaptive concentration control} are essential to GAC's success.

We find that, for moral robustness, model family accounts for most of the variance, while model size shows no systematic effect. The Claude family is, by a significant margin, the most robust, followed by Gemini and GPT-4 models, with other families exhibiting lower robustness. In contrast, moral susceptibility exhibits a mild family effect but a clear within-family size effect, with larger variants being more susceptible. Moreover, robustness and susceptibility are positively correlated, an association that is more pronounced at the family level.

Prior work proposes recurrent transformers, which allocate a fixed number of extra iterations per token to improve generation quality. After the first, standard forward pass, instead of verbalization, last-layer hidden states are fed back as inputs for additional iterations to refine token predictions. Yet we identify a latent overthinking phenomenon: easy token predictions that are already correct after the first pass are sometimes revised into errors in additional iterations. To address this, we propose Think-at-Hard (TaH), a dynamic latent thinking method that iterates deeper only at hard tokens. It employs a lightweight neural decider to trigger latent iterations only at tokens that are likely incorrect after the standard forward pass. During latent iterations, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules shift the LLM objective from general next-token prediction to focused hard-token refinement. We further introduce a duo-causal attention mechanism that extends attention from the token sequence dimension to an additional iteration depth dimension. This enables cross-iteration information flow while maintaining full sequential parallelism. Experiments show that TaH boosts LLM reasoning performance across five challenging benchmarks while maintaining the same parameter count. Compared with baselines that iterate twice for all output tokens, TaH delivers 8.1-11.3% accuracy gains while exempting 94% of tokens from the second iteration. Against strong single-iteration Qwen3 models finetuned with the same data, it also delivers 4.0-5.0% accuracy gains. When allowing less than 3% additional parameters from LoRA and the iteration decider, the gains increase to 8.5-12.6% and 5.3-5.4%, respectively.

To address these challenges, task-vector-based methods have been explored by inserting compact representations of many-shot in-context demonstrations into model activations. However, existing task-vector-based methods either overlook the importance of where to insert task vectors or struggle to determine suitable values for each location. To this end, we propose a novel Sensitivity-aware Task Vector insertion framework (STV) to figure out where and what to insert. Our key insight is that activation deltas across query-context pairs exhibit consistent structural patterns, providing a reliable cue for insertion. Based on the identified sensitive-aware locations, we construct a pre-clustered activation bank for each location by clustering the activation values, and then apply reinforcement learning to choose the most suitable one to insert.

Are they better able to describe themselves than other models? We study the extent to which LMs' privileged access to their own internals can be leveraged to produce new techniques for explaining their behavior. Using existing interpretability techniques as a source of ground truth, we fine-tune LMs to generate natural language descriptions of (1) the information encoded by LM features, (2) the causal structure of LMs' internal activations, and (3) the influence of specific input tokens on LM outputs. When trained with only tens of thousands of example explanations, explainer models exhibit non-trivial generalization to new queries. This generalization appears partly attributable to explainer models' privileged access to their own internals: using a model to explain its own computations generally works better than using a *different* model to explain its computations (even if the other model is significantly more capable). Our results suggest not only that LMs can learn to reliably explain their internal computations, but that such explanations offer a scalable complement to existing interpretability methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u91ca\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e14\u81ea\u8eab\u89e3\u91ca\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u5229\u7528\u5176\u5bf9\u81ea\u8eab\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4f18\u5148\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u91ca\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u65b0\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6280\u672f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u4e09\u7c7b\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\uff1a1) \u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c2) \u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c3) \u7279\u5b9a\u8f93\u5165\u6807\u8bb0\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7ecf\u8fc7\u6570\u4e07\u6761\u793a\u4f8b\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65b0\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u81ea\u8eab\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u89e3\u91ca\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8865\u5145\u3002"}}

Following the growing scientific interest in mechanistic interpretability, recent work encoded refusal behavior as a single direction in the model's latent space; e.g., computed as the difference between the centroids of harmful and harmless prompt representations. However, emerging evidence suggests that concepts in LLMs often appear to be encoded as a low-dimensional manifold embedded in the high-dimensional latent space. Motivated by these findings, we propose a novel method leveraging Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to extract multiple refusal directions. To this end, we first prove that SOMs generalize the prior work's difference-in-means technique. We then train SOMs on harmful prompt representations to identify multiple neurons. By subtracting the centroid of harmless representations from each neuron, we derive a set of multiple directions expressing the refusal concept. We validate our method on an extensive experimental setup, demonstrating that ablating multiple directions from models' internals outperforms not only the single-direction baseline but also specialized jailbreak algorithms, leading to an effective suppression of refusal.

We distinguish between behavioral faithfulness (alignment between reasoning and output) and perceptual faithfulness (alignment between reasoning and input), and introduce FaithEval for quantifying step-level and chain-level faithfulness by evaluating whether each claimed object is visually supported by the image. Building on these insights, we propose FaithAct, a faithfulness-first planning and acting framework that enforces evidential grounding at every reasoning step. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that FaithAct improves perceptual faithfulness by up to 26% without degrading task accuracy compared to prompt-based and tool-augmented baselines. Our analysis shows that treating faithfulness as a guiding principle not only mitigates hallucination but also leads to more stable reasoning trajectories. This work thereby establishes a unified framework for both evaluating and enforcing faithfulness in multimodal reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u4e0d\u5fe0\u5b9e\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165FaithEval\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u53caFaithAct\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u884c\u4e3a\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u751f\u6210\u770b\u4f3c\u5408\u7406\u5374\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u8bc1\u636e\u6216\u6700\u7ec8\u7ed3\u8bba\u8131\u8282\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFaithEval\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u6b65\u9aa4\u7ea7\u548c\u94fe\u7ea7\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u8bbe\u8ba1FaithAct\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee5\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u4e3a\u5148\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u884c\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u6bcf\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u90fd\u6709\u8bc1\u636e\u652f\u6301\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cFaithAct\u4f7f\u611f\u77e5\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6700\u591a26%\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u964d\u4f4e\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6307\u5bfc\u539f\u5219\u4e0d\u4ec5\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u8fd8\u5bfc\u81f4\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

This \"patch\" introduces only 0.003% additional parameters, yet reliably steers model behavior toward that of a safer reference model. Across three critical domains (toxicity mitigation, bias reduction, and harmfulness refusal) policy patches achieve safety improvements comparable to next-generation safety-aligned models while preserving fluency.

From researchers choosing which problems to tackle next, to students deciding which ones to engage with, people's choices are often guided by judgments about how interesting or challenging problems are likely to be. As AI systems, such as LLMs, increasingly participate in mathematics with people -- whether for advanced research or education -- it becomes important to understand how well their judgments align with human ones. Our work examines this alignment through two empirical studies of human and LLM assessment of mathematical interestingness and difficulty, spanning a range of mathematical experience. We study two groups: participants from a crowdsourcing platform and International Math Olympiad competitors. We show that while many LLMs appear to broadly agree with human notions of interestingness, they mostly do not capture the distribution observed in human judgments. Moreover, most LLMs only somewhat align with why humans find certain math problems interesting, showing weak correlation with human-selected interestingness rationales. Together, our findings highlight both the promises and limitations of current LLMs in capturing human interestingness judgments for mathematical AI thought partnerships.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9879\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u6570\u5b66\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u548c\u96be\u5ea6\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u5951\u5408\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982LLMs\uff09\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u591a\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u662f\u5426\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e00\u81f4\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u7fa4\u4f53\uff1a\u6765\u81ea\u4f17\u5305\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u548c\u56fd\u9645\u6570\u5b66\u5965\u6797\u5339\u514b\u7ade\u8d5b\u7684\u9009\u624b\u3002", "result": "\u8bb8\u591aLLMs\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u4e0a\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u7406\u7531\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5728\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u6570\u5b66\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u65b9\u9762\u65e2\u6709\u5e0c\u671b\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u9650\u5236\u3002"}}

The results show that early-stage metadata integration enhances both retrieval and answer accuracy while also revealing persistent challenges for RAG systems, including hallucinations during generation and difficulties in handling temporal or multi-hop historical queries.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u5728\u53f0\u6e7e\u5386\u53f2\u6863\u6848\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u67e5\u8be2\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5143\u6570\u636e\u6574\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22RAG\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\uff08\u53f0\u6e7e\u5386\u53f2\u6863\u6848\uff09\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5386\u53f2\u7e41\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08Fort Zeelandia\u548cTaiwan Provincial Council Gazette\uff09\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528RAG\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u67e5\u8be2\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5143\u6570\u636e\u6574\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u65e9\u671f\u5143\u6570\u636e\u6574\u5408\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63ed\u793aRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u6216\u591a\u8df3\u5386\u53f2\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65e9\u671f\u5143\u6570\u636e\u6574\u5408\u6709\u76ca\u4e8eRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u5386\u53f2\u67e5\u8be2\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

However, adapting LLMs to effectively handle structural data, such as knowledge graphs or web data, remains a challenging problem. Some approaches adopt complex strategies to convert graphs into text sequences, resulting in significant token overhead and rendering them impractical for large-scale graphs. Others introduce additional modules to encode graphs into fixed-size token representations for LLMs. However, these methods typically require large-scale post-training on graph-text corpus and complex alignment procedures, yet often yield sub-optimal results due to poor modality alignment. Inspired by in-parameter knowledge injection for test-time adaptation of LLMs, we propose GRIP, a novel framework that equips LLMs with the ability to internalize complex relational information from graphs through carefully designed fine-tuning tasks. This knowledge is efficiently stored within lightweight LoRA parameters, enabling the fine-tuned LLM to perform a wide range of graph-related tasks without requiring access to the original graph at inference time. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "GRIP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f7f\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u56fe\u4e2d\u5185\u5316\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u77e5\u8bc6\u5b58\u50a8\u5728\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7LoRA\u53c2\u6570\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u65e0\u9700\u8bbf\u95ee\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u5373\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u591a\u79cd\u56fe\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5efa\u6a21\u5e8f\u5217\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5904\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6216\u7f51\u9875\u6570\u636e\u7b49\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u5c06\u56fe\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u5e8f\u5217\u5bfc\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u5f15\u5165\u989d\u5916\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u56fe\u7f16\u7801\u4f46\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "GRIP\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5229\u7528in-parameter\u77e5\u8bc6\u6ce8\u5165\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5c06\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\u4fe1\u606f\u5185\u5316\u5230LLMs\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u606f\u5b58\u50a8\u5728\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7LoRA\u53c2\u6570\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86GRIP\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u8bbf\u95ee\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u591a\u79cd\u56fe\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "GRIP\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06LLMs\u9002\u914d\u5230\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u8bbf\u95ee\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Meanwhile, efforts to interpret their internal mechanisms have emerged, offering insights to enhance multilingual performance. While multi-head self-attention (MHA) has proven critical in many areas, its role in multilingual capabilities remains underexplored. In this work, we study the contribution of MHA in supporting multilingual processing in LLMs. We propose Language Attention Head Importance Scores (LAHIS), an effective and efficient method that identifies attention head importance for multilingual capabilities via a single forward and backward pass through the LLM. Applying LAHIS to Aya-23-8B, Llama-3.2-3B, and Mistral-7B-v0.1, we reveal the existence of both language-specific and language-general heads. Language-specific heads enable cross-lingual attention transfer to guide the model toward target language contexts and mitigate off-target language generation issue, contributing to addressing challenges in multilingual LLMs. We also introduce a lightweight adaptation that learns a soft head mask to modulate attention outputs over language heads, requiring only 20 tunable parameters to improve XQuAD accuracy.

In this work, we systematically evaluate the reliability of six widely used reference-free factuality metrics, originally proposed for short-form summarization, in the long-document setting. We probe metric robustness through seven factuality-preserving perturbations applied to summaries, namely paraphrasing, simplification, synonym replacement, logically equivalent negations, vocabulary reduction, compression, and source text insertion, and further analyze their sensitivity to retrieval context and claim information density. Across three long-form benchmark datasets spanning science fiction, legal, and scientific domains, our results reveal that existing short-form metrics produce inconsistent scores for semantically equivalent summaries and exhibit declining reliability for information-dense claims whose content is semantically similar to many parts of the source document. While expanding the retrieval context improves stability in some domains, no metric consistently maintains factual alignment under long-context conditions. Finally, our results highlight concrete directions for improving factuality evaluation, including multi-span reasoning, context-aware calibration, and training on meaning-preserving variations to enhance robustness in long-form summarization.

We propose a simple yet effective alternative, Confidence-Aware Preference Optimization (CAPO), which replaces DPO's fixed treatment of preference pairs with a dynamic loss scaling mechanism based on a relative reward. By modulating the learning signal according to the confidence in each preference pair, CAPO enhances robustness to noisy or low-margin comparisons, typically encountered in multilingual text. Empirically, CAPO outperforms existing preference optimization baselines by at least 16% in reward accuracy, and improves alignment by widening the gap between preferred and dispreferred responses across languages.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5CAPO\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u635f\u5931\u7f29\u653e\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u9ad8\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "DPO\u7b49\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u4f4e\u8fb9\u9645\u6bd4\u8f83\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCAPO\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u5bf9\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u635f\u5931\u7f29\u653e\u673a\u5236\u66ff\u4ee3DPO\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "CAPO\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u81f3\u5c11\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf16%\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0cCAPO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u800c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing automated systems are typically limited to shallow parsing, failing to extract the actionable intelligence needed for operational decisions. We formalize the complete interpretation task as deep parsing, a dual-reasoning challenge requiring both dynamic knowledge grounding (linking the NOTAM to evolving real-world aeronautical data) and schema-based inference (applying static domain rules to deduce operational status). To tackle this challenge, we propose NOTAM-Evolve, a self-evolving framework that enables a large language model (LLM) to autonomously master complex NOTAM interpretation. Leveraging a knowledge graph-enhanced retrieval module for data grounding, the framework introduces a closed-loop learning process where the LLM progressively improves from its own outputs, minimizing the need for extensive human-annotated reasoning traces. In conjunction with this framework, we introduce a new benchmark dataset of 10,000 expert-annotated NOTAMs. Our experiments demonstrate that NOTAM-Evolve achieves a 30.4% absolute accuracy improvement over the base LLM, establishing a new state of the art on the task of structured NOTAM interpretation.", "AI": {"tldr": "NOTAM-Evolve\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u6211\u8fdb\u5316\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u589e\u5f3a\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u95ed\u73af\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u822a\u7a7a\u901a\u544a\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u51c6\u786e\u89e3\u8bfb\u822a\u7a7a\u901a\u544a\u5bf9\u822a\u7a7a\u5b89\u5168\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u6d45\u5c42\u89e3\u6790\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u63d0\u53d6\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aNOTAM-Evolve\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u95ed\u73af\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cNOTAM-Evolve\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u822a\u7a7a\u901a\u544a\u89e3\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u6bd4\u57fa\u7840\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u5347\u4e8630.4%\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "NOTAM-Evolve\u5728\u822a\u7a7a\u901a\u544a\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u89e3\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8bbe\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}
