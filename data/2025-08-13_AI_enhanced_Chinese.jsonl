We remove the difficulties associated with identifying and\nretargeting the semantics of one rig framework to another by utilizing the same\nframework (3DMM, FLAME, MetaHuman, etc.) for both subjects. Although this does\nnot constrain the choice of framework when retargeting from one person to\nanother, it does force the tracker to use the game/VR character rig when\nretargeting to a game/VR character. We utilize volumetric morphing in order to\nfit facial rigs to both performers and targets; in addition, a carefully chosen\nset of Simon-Says expressions is used to calibrate each rig to the motion\nsignatures of the relevant performer or target. Although a uniform set of\nSimon-Says expressions can likely be used for all person to person retargeting,\nwe argue that person to game/VR character retargeting benefits from Simon-Says\nexpressions that capture the distinct motion signature of the game/VR character\nrig. The Simon-Says calibrated rigs tend to produce the desired expressions\nwhen exercising animation controls (as expected). Unfortunately, these\nwell-calibrated rigs still lead to undesirable controls when tracking a\nperformance (a well-behaved function can have an arbitrarily ill-conditioned\ninverse), even though they typically produce acceptable geometry\nreconstructions. Thus, we propose a fine-tuning approach that modifies the rig\nused by the tracker in order to promote the output of more semantically\nmeaningful animation controls, facilitating high efficacy retargeting. In order\nto better address real-world scenarios, the fine-tuning relies on implicit\ndifferentiation so that the tracker can be treated as a (potentially\nnon-differentiable) black box.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u59823DMM\u3001FLAME\u7b49\uff09\u548c\u4f53\u79ef\u53d8\u5f62\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u4ece\u771f\u4eba\u5230\u865a\u62df\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u8868\u60c5\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0d\u540c\u9762\u90e8\u6846\u67b6\u4e4b\u95f4\u8bed\u4e49\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u7684\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6e38\u620f\u6216VR\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u865a\u62df\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u8868\u60c5\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4f53\u79ef\u53d8\u5f62\u6280\u672f\u62df\u5408\u9762\u90e8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7Simon-Says\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u6821\u51c6\u9762\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u9690\u5f0f\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6821\u51c6\u540e\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u671f\u671b\u7684\u8868\u60c5\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6027\u80fd\u65f6\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6e38\u620f\u548cVR\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Recent filtering methods often suffer\nfrom point clustering or noise retaining issues. In this paper, we propose\nHybrid Point Cloud Filtering ($\\textbf{HybridPF}$) that considers both\nshort-range and long-range filtering trajectories when removing noise. It is\nwell established that short range scores, given by $\\nabla_{x}\\log p(x_t)$, may\nprovide the necessary displacements to move noisy points to the underlying\nclean surface. By contrast, long range velocity flows approximate constant\ndisplacements directed from a high noise variant patch $x_0$ towards the\ncorresponding clean surface $x_1$. Here, noisy patches $x_t$ are viewed as\nintermediate states between the high noise variant and the clean patches. Our\nintuition is that long range information from velocity flow models can guide\nthe short range scores to align more closely with the clean points. In turn,\nscore models generally provide a quicker convergence to the clean surface.\nSpecifically, we devise two parallel modules, the ShortModule and LongModule,\neach consisting of an Encoder-Decoder pair to respectively account for\nshort-range scores and long-range flows. We find that short-range scores,\nguided by long-range features, yield filtered point clouds with good point\ndistributions and convergence near the clean surface. We design a joint loss\nfunction to simultaneously train the ShortModule and LongModule, in an\nend-to-end manner. Finally, we identify a key weakness in current displacement\nbased methods, limitations on the decoder architecture, and propose a dynamic\ngraph convolutional decoder to improve the inference process.

The main goal of this paper is to show that these properties are\ncentral to many applications in causal inference. For example, subobject\nclassifiers allow a categorical formulation of causal intervention, which\ncreates sub-models. Limits and colimits allow causal diagrams of arbitrary\ncomplexity to be ``solved\", using a novel interpretation of causal\napproximation. Exponential objects enable reasoning about equivalence classes\nof operations on causal models, such as covered edge reversal and causal\nhomotopy. Analogous to structural causal models (SCMs), TCMs are defined by a\ncollection of functions, each defining a ``local autonomous\" causal mechanism\nthat assemble to induce a unique global function from exogenous to endogenous\nvariables. Since the category of TCMs is (co)complete, which we prove in this\npaper, every causal diagram has a ``solution\" in the form of a (co)limit: this\nimplies that any arbitrary causal model can be ``approximated\" by some global\nfunction with respect to the morphisms going into or out of the diagram.\nNatural transformations are crucial in measuring the quality of approximation.\nIn addition, we show that causal interventions are modeled by subobject\nclassifiers: any sub-model is defined by a monic arrow into its parent model.\nExponential objects permit reasoning about entire classes of causal\nequivalences and interventions. Finally, as TCMs form a topos, they admit an\ninternal logic defined as a Mitchell-Benabou language with an associated\nKripke-Joyal semantics. We show how to reason about causal models in TCMs using\nthis internal logic.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\u522b\u2014\u2014\u62d3\u6251\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\uff08TCMs\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u62d3\u6251\u8303\u7574\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6027\u8d28\uff08\u5982\uff08\u5171\uff09\u5b8c\u5907\u6027\u3001\u5b50\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u548c\u6307\u6570\u5bf9\u8c61\uff09\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6027\u8d28\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u62d3\u6251\u8303\u7574\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff08\u5982\uff08\u5171\uff09\u5b8c\u5907\u6027\u3001\u5b50\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u548c\u6307\u6570\u5bf9\u8c61\uff09\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49TCMs\u4e3a\u4e00\u7ec4\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c40\u90e8\u81ea\u6cbb\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ec4\u5408\u540e\u751f\u6210\u4ece\u5916\u751f\u53d8\u91cf\u5230\u5185\u751f\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u5229\u7528\u62d3\u6251\u8303\u7574\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff08\u5982\uff08\u5171\uff09\u6781\u9650\uff09\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86TCMs\u8303\u7574\u7684\uff08\u5171\uff09\u5b8c\u5907\u6027\uff0c\u4efb\u4f55\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u90fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\uff08\u5171\uff09\u6781\u9650\u201c\u89e3\u51b3\u201d\uff1b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u548c\u7b49\u4ef7\u7c7b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "TCMs\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u590d\u6742\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

This issue is compounded by the rapid proliferation\nof IoT devices, predicted to surpass 150 billion by 2030.

Unlike\nsystem prompting (3-4% shifts), VISOR provides robust bidirectional control\nwhile maintaining 99.9% performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU tasks. Beyond\neliminating runtime overhead and model access requirements, VISOR exposes a\ncritical security vulnerability: adversaries can achieve sophisticated\nbehavioral manipulation through visual channels alone, bypassing text-based\ndefenses.

To investigate this, we\nselect a typologically diverse set of languages: Telugu (agglutinative), Hindi\n(primarily fusional with some agglutination), and English (fusional). We\nconduct a comprehensive evaluation of language models -- starting from\ntokenizer training and extending through the finetuning and downstream task\nevaluation. To account for the consistent performance differences observed\nacross tokenizer variants, we focus on two key factors: morphological alignment\nand tokenization quality.

Trajectory control is\nimplemented by unprojecting edited 2D trajectories into 3D with focal-length\ncalibration and coordinate transformation, followed by speed alignment and\norientation adjustment; actions are supplied by a motion bank or generated via\ntext-to-motion methods. Then, based on modern text-to-video diffusion\ntransformer models, we inject the subject as tokens for full attention,\nconcatenate the background along the channel dimension, and add motion\n(trajectory and action) control signals by addition.

As these\nmodels grow in size and complexity, fine-tuning becomes costly, emphasizing the\nneed to reuse adaptation knowledge from 'weaker' models to efficiently enhance\n'stronger' ones. However, existing adaptation transfer methods exhibit limited\ntransferability across models due to their model-specific design and high\ncomputational demands. To tackle this, we propose Transferable Model-agnostic\nadapter (TransMiter), a light-weight adapter that improves vision-language\nmodels 'without backpropagation'. TransMiter captures the knowledge gap between\npre-trained and fine-tuned VLMs, in an 'unsupervised' manner. Once trained,\nthis knowledge can be seamlessly transferred across different models without\nthe need for backpropagation. Moreover, TransMiter consists of only a few\nlayers, inducing a negligible additional inference cost. Notably, supplementing\nthe process with a few labeled data further yields additional performance gain,\noften surpassing a fine-tuned stronger model, with a marginal training cost.\nExperimental results and analyses demonstrate that TransMiter effectively and\nefficiently transfers adaptation knowledge while preserving generalization\nabilities across VLMs of different sizes and architectures in visual\nrecognition tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "TransMiter\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u5373\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u8fc1\u79fb\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u590d\u7528\u2018\u5f31\u2019\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u2018\u5f3a\u2019\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTransMiter\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u5f0f\u6355\u6349\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u5373\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTransMiter\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\u9002\u5e94\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "TransMiter\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u7684\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u6781\u4f4e\u3002"}}

While recent advancements in\nreinforcement learning (RL) have primarily focused on domain-specific reasoning\ntasks (e.g., mathematics or code generation), real-world reasoning scenarios\noften require models to handle diverse and complex environments that\nnarrow-domain benchmarks cannot fully capture. To address this gap, we present\nInternBootcamp, an open-source framework comprising 1000+ domain-diverse task\nenvironments specifically designed for LLM reasoning research. Our codebase\noffers two key functionalities: (1) automated generation of unlimited\ntraining/testing cases with configurable difficulty levels, and (2) integrated\nverification modules for objective response evaluation.

Moreover, they\nexperience catastrophic forgetting of old classes when required to continuously\nlearn object instances belonging to new categories. To resolve these\nchallenges, we develop a novel Hierarchical Visual Prompt Learning (HVPL) model\nthat overcomes catastrophic forgetting of previous categories from both\nframe-level and video-level perspectives. Specifically, to mitigate forgetting\nat the frame level, we devise a task-specific frame prompt and an orthogonal\ngradient correction (OGC) module. The OGC module helps the frame prompt encode\ntask-specific global instance information for new classes in each individual\nframe by projecting its gradients onto the orthogonal feature space of old\nclasses. Furthermore, to address forgetting at the video level, we design a\ntask-specific video prompt and a video context decoder. This decoder first\nembeds structural inter-class relationships across frames into the frame prompt\nfeatures, and then propagates task-specific global video contexts from the\nframe prompt features to the video prompt.

However, existing methods face\nlimitations in simultaneously satisfying three essential criteria for\ngeneralizable watermarking: 1) invisibility (imperceptible hide of watermarks),\n2) robustness (reliable watermark recovery under diverse conditions), and 3)\nbroad applicability (low latency in watermarking process). To address these\nlimitations, we propose a Hierarchical Watermark Learning (HiWL), a two-stage\noptimization that enable a watermarking model to simultaneously achieve three\ncriteria. In the first stage, distribution alignment learning is designed to\nestablish a common latent space with two constraints: 1) visual consistency\nbetween watermarked and non-watermarked images, and 2) information invariance\nacross watermark latent representations. In this way, multi-modal inputs\nincluding watermark message (binary codes) and cover images (RGB pixels) can be\nwell represented, ensuring the invisibility of watermarks and robustness in\nwatermarking process thereby. The second stage employs generalized watermark\nrepresentation learning to establish a disentanglement policy for separating\nwatermarks from image content in RGB space. In particular, it strongly\npenalizes substantial fluctuations in separated RGB watermarks corresponding to\nidentical messages. Consequently, HiWL effectively learns generalizable\nlatent-space watermark representations while maintaining broad applicability.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method.

The benchmark's explicit mRAG\nplanning annotations and diverse question design enhance its practical\nrelevance by simulating real-world scenarios requiring dynamic mRAG decisions.\nExperiments across RemPlan and three established benchmarks demonstrate\nE-Agent's superiority: 13% accuracy gain over state-of-the-art mRAG methods\nwhile reducing redundant searches by 37%.", "AI": {"tldr": "E-Agent\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6267\u884c\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08mRAG\uff09\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5197\u4f59\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709mRAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u95fb\u5206\u6790\u548c\u8d8b\u52bf\u8bdd\u9898\u7b49\u5b9e\u65f6\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faE-Agent\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5de5\u5177\u534f\u8c03\u5668\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u5668\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e00\u6b21\u6027mRAG\u89c4\u5212\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728RemPlan\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cE-Agent\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u534713%\uff0c\u5197\u4f59\u641c\u7d22\u51cf\u5c1137%\u3002", "conclusion": "E-Agent\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86mRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Clinically,\nexperts annotate different sub-regions of lens structures with varying\nconfidence levels, considering factors such as sub-region proportions,\nambiguous boundaries, and lens structure shapes. Motivated by this observation,\nwe propose an Adaptive Confidence-Wise (ACW) loss to group each lens structure\nsub-region into different confidence sub-regions via a confidence threshold\nfrom the unique region aspect, aiming to exploit the potential of expert\nannotation confidence prior. Specifically, ACW clusters each target region into\nlow-confidence and high-confidence groups and then applies a region-weighted\nloss to reweigh each confidence group. Moreover, we design an adaptive\nconfidence threshold optimization algorithm to adjust the confidence threshold\nof ACW dynamically. Additionally, to better quantify the miscalibration errors\nin boundary region segmentation, we propose a new metric, termed Boundary\nExpected Calibration Error (BECE). Extensive experiments on a clinical lens\nstructure AS-OCT dataset and other multi-structure datasets demonstrate that\nour ACW significantly outperforms competitive segmentation loss methods across\ndifferent deep segmentation networks (e.g., MedSAM). Notably, our method\nsurpasses CE with 6.13% IoU gain, 4.33% DSC increase, and 4.79% BECE reduction\nin lens structure segmentation under U-Net.

Due to the loss of\nsemantics of entities, previous RAG systems cannot retrieve question-relevant\nknowledge from KGs by matching questions with the meaningless identifiers of\nanonymous entities. To realize an effective RAG system in this scenario, two\nkey challenges must be addressed: (1) How can anonymous entities be converted\ninto retrievable information.

The reliance on\nsuch conditioning leads to complex training requirements, increased data needs,\nand challenges in generating consistent results. Additionally, identity\npreservation is rarely taken into accountor evaluated on a single face\nrecognition system without any control or guarantees on whether identity would\nbe preserved in a generated aged/de-aged face. In this paper, we propose to\nsynthesize aged and de-aged faces via editing latent space of StyleGAN2 using a\nsimple support vector modeling of aging/de-aging direction and several feature\nselection approaches. By using two state-of-the-art face recognition systems,\nwe empirically find the identity preserving subspace within the StyleGAN2\nlatent space, so that an apparent age of a given face can changed while\npreserving the identity. We then propose a simple yet practical formula for\nestimating the limits on aging/de-aging parameters that ensures identity\npreservation for a given input face. Using our method and estimated parameters\nwe have generated a public dataset of synthetic faces at different ages that\ncan be used for benchmarking cross-age face recognition, age assurance systems,\nor systems for detection of synthetic images.

Decoding each parallelizable branch simultaneously (i.e. parallel\ndecoding) can significantly improve the overall inference speed of LLMs. In\nthis paper, we propose an Adaptive Serial-Parallel Decoding (ASPD), which\naddresses two core challenges: automated construction of parallelizable data\nand efficient parallel decoding mechanism. More specifically, we introduce a\nnon-invasive pipeline that automatically extracts and validates parallelizable\nstructures from the responses of autoregressive models. To empower efficient\nadaptive serial-parallel decoding, we implement a Hybrid Decoding Engine which\nenables seamless transitions between serial and parallel decoding modes while\nmaintaining a reusable KV cache, maximizing computational efficiency. Extensive\nevaluations across General Tasks, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Mathematical\nReasoning, demonstrate that ASPD achieves unprecedented performance in both\neffectiveness and efficiency. Notably, on Vicuna Bench, our method achieves up\nto 3.19x speedup (1.85x on average) while maintaining response quality within\n1% difference compared to autoregressive models, realizing significant\nacceleration without compromising generation quality.

While multimodal foundation models (FMs) like CLIP\noffer strong zero-shot capabilities by jointly modeling images and text, most\nprior works on FMs for biometric recognition have relied on fine-tuning for\nspecific downstream tasks, neglecting their potential for direct, generalizable\ndeployment. This work explores a pure zero-shot approach to MAD by leveraging\nCLIP without any additional training or fine-tuning, focusing instead on the\ndesign and aggregation of multiple textual prompts per class. By aggregating\nthe embeddings of diverse prompts, we better align the model's internal\nrepresentations with the MAD task, capturing richer and more varied cues\nindicative of bona-fide or attack samples.

However, existing methods, whether\ntraining-free or training-based, continue to face challenges in maintaining\nsubject consistency due to the lack of fine-grained guidance and inter-frame\ninteraction. Additionally, the scarcity of high-quality data in this field\nmakes it difficult to precisely control storytelling tasks, including the\nsubject's position, appearance, clothing, expression, and posture, thereby\nhindering further advancements. In this paper, we demonstrate that layout\nconditions, such as the subject's position and detailed attributes, effectively\nfacilitate fine-grained interactions between frames. This not only strengthens\nthe consistency of the generated frame sequence but also allows for precise\ncontrol over the subject's position, appearance, and other key details.\nBuilding on this, we introduce an advanced storytelling task: Layout-Togglable\nStorytelling, which enables precise subject control by incorporating layout\nconditions. To address the lack of high-quality datasets with layout\nannotations for this task, we develop Lay2Story-1M, which contains over 1\nmillion 720p and higher-resolution images, processed from approximately 11,300\nhours of cartoon videos.

While\ntraditional change detection methods have been employed to detect changes from\nbi-temporal images, these approaches typically require expert knowledge for\naccurate interpretation.

Our RL model outperformed\nthe best versions of NLI- and STS-driven baselines by 28% (11.43 points) and\n27% (11.21 points), respectively.

These\nmethods decompose images into mutually independent illumination and reflectance\ncomponents, allows each component to be enhanced separately. In fact, achieving\nperfect decomposition of illumination and reflectance components proves to be\nquite challenging, with some residuals still existing after decomposition. In\nthis paper, we formally name these residuals as inter-component residuals\n(ICR), which has been largely underestimated by previous methods. In our\ninvestigation, ICR not only affects the accuracy of the decomposition but also\ncauses enhanced components to deviate from the ideal outcome, ultimately\nreducing the final synthesized image quality. To address this issue, we propose\na novel Inter-correction Retinex model (IRetinex) to alleviate ICR during the\ndecomposition and enhancement stage.

For recent popular video generative models, however, the Variational\nAutoEncoder (VAE) represents one of the major computational bottlenecks. Both\nlarge parameter sizes and mismatched kernels cause out-of-memory errors or\nextremely slow inference on mobile devices. To address this, we propose a\nlow-cost solution that efficiently transfers widely used video VAEs to mobile\ndevices. (1) We analyze redundancy in existing VAE architectures and get\nempirical design insights. By integrating 3D depthwise separable convolutions\ninto our model, we significantly reduce the number of parameters. (2) We\nobserve that the upsampling techniques in mainstream video VAEs are poorly\nsuited to mobile hardware and form the main bottleneck. In response, we propose\na decoupled 3D pixel shuffle scheme that slashes end-to-end delay. Building\nupon these, we develop a universal mobile-oriented VAE decoder, Turbo-VAED. (3)\nWe propose an efficient VAE decoder training method. Since only the decoder is\nused during deployment, we distill it to Turbo-VAED instead of retraining the\nfull VAE, enabling fast mobile adaptation with minimal performance loss. To our\nknowledge, our method enables real-time 720p video VAE decoding on mobile\ndevices for the first time. This approach is widely applicable to most video\nVAEs. When integrated into four representative models, with training cost as\nlow as $95, it accelerates original VAEs by up to 84.5x at 720p resolution on\nGPUs, uses as low as 17.5% of original parameter count, and retains 96.9% of\nthe original reconstruction quality. Compared to mobile-optimized VAEs,\nTurbo-VAED achieves a 2.9x speedup in FPS and better reconstruction quality on\nthe iPhone 16 Pro.
