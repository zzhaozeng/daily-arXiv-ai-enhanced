To overcome these limitations, we\npropose Lion, an adversarial distillation framework that iteratively refines\ntraining data by identifying and generating challenging instructions, enabling\nstate-of-the-art zero-shot reasoning.

In our analysis, we train a set of unconditional image generative\nmodels and adopt a commonly used bias evaluation framework to study bias shift\nbetween training and generated distributions.

However, DAAs\nsuffer from a fundamental limitation we identify as the \"reward-generation gap\"\n-- a misalignment between optimization objectives during training and actual\ngeneration performance during inference. In this paper, we find a contributor\nto the reward-generation gap is the mismatch between the inherent importance of\nprefix tokens during the LLM generation process and how this importance is\nreflected in the implicit reward functions of DAAs. To bridge the gap, we\nintroduce a simple yet effective approach called Prefix-Oriented Equal-length\nTraining (POET), which truncates both preferred and dispreferred responses to\nmatch the shorter one's length. Training with POET, where both responses in\neach sample are truncated to equal length, resulting in diverse truncated\nlengths across samples, the optimization of DAAs objective is implicitly\nconstrained to converge across all positions, thus paying more attention to\nprefix tokens than the standard DAAs. We conduct experiments with DPO and\nSimPO, two representative DAAs, demonstrating that POET improves over their\nstandard implementations, achieving up to 15.6 points in AlpacaEval 2 and\noverall improvements across downstream tasks.

Existing domain adaptation methods\nassume access to target domain data during training and fail to address the\nfundamental issue of domain shift when unknown classes are present, leading to\nnegative transfer and reduced classification performance. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a novel open-set domain generalization framework that\ncombines four key components: Spectrum-Invariant Frequency Disentanglement\n(SIFD) for domain-agnostic feature extraction, Dual-Channel Residual Network\n(DCRN) for robust spectral-spatial feature learning, Evidential Deep Learning\n(EDL) for uncertainty quantification, and Spectral-Spatial Uncertainty\nDisentanglement (SSUD) for reliable open-set classification. The SIFD module\nextracts domain-invariant spectral features in the frequency domain through\nattention-weighted frequency analysis and domain-agnostic regularization, while\nDCRN captures complementary spectral and spatial information via parallel\npathways with adaptive fusion. EDL provides principled uncertainty estimation\nusing Dirichlet distributions, enabling the SSUD module to make reliable\nopen-set decisions through uncertainty-aware pathway weighting and adaptive\nrejection thresholding. Experimental results on three cross-scene hyperspectral\nclassification tasks show that our approach achieves performance comparable to\nstate-of-the-art domain adaptation methods while requiring no access to the\ntarget domain during training. The implementation will be made available at\nhttps://github.com/amir-khb/SSUDOSDG upon acceptance."}

Existing UQ methods are often heuristic and lack a probabilistic\nfoundation. This paper begins by providing a theoretical justification for the\nrole of perturbations in UQ for LLMs. We then introduce a dual random walk\nperspective, modeling input-output pairs as two Markov chains with transition\nprobabilities defined by semantic similarity. Building on this, we propose a\nfully probabilistic framework based on an inverse model, which quantifies\nuncertainty by evaluating the diversity of the input space conditioned on a\ngiven output through systematic perturbations. Within this framework, we define\na new uncertainty measure, Inv-Entropy. A key strength of our framework is its\nflexibility: it supports various definitions of uncertainty measures,\nembeddings, perturbation strategies, and similarity metrics. We also propose\nGAAP, a perturbation algorithm based on genetic algorithms, which enhances the\ndiversity of sampled inputs. In addition, we introduce a new evaluation metric,\nTemperature Sensitivity of Uncertainty (TSU), which directly assesses\nuncertainty without relying on correctness as a proxy. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that Inv-Entropy outperforms existing semantic UQ methods.

However,\nmore recent results showing strong multilingual performance, even surpassing\nEnglish performance on specific tasks in other languages, challenge this view.\nIn this work, we find that LLMs progressively develop a core language-agnostic\nparameter space-a remarkably small subset of parameters whose deactivation\nresults in significant performance degradation across all languages. This\ncompact yet critical set of parameters underlies the model's ability to\ngeneralize beyond individual languages, supporting the emergence of abstract\nthought that is not tied to any specific linguistic system. Specifically, we\nidentify language-related neurons-those are consistently activated during the\nprocessing of particular languages, and categorize them as either shared\n(active across multiple languages) or exclusive (specific to one). As LLMs\nundergo continued development over time, we observe a marked increase in both\nthe proportion and functional importance of shared neurons, while exclusive\nneurons progressively diminish in influence. These shared neurons constitute\nthe backbone of the core language-agnostic parameter space, supporting the\nemergence of abstract thought. Motivated by these insights, we propose\nneuron-specific training strategies tailored to LLMs' language-agnostic levels\nat different development stages. Experiments across diverse LLM families\nsupport our approach."}

This task remains fundamentally\nchallenging, as it requires inferring 3D structure from incomplete and\nambiguous 2D observations. Early approaches typically rely on strong 3D\nknowledge, including architectural 3D inductive biases (e.g., embedding\nexplicit 3D representations, such as NeRF or 3DGS, into network design) and\nground-truth camera poses for both input and target views. While recent efforts\nhave sought to reduce the 3D inductive bias or the dependence on known camera\nposes of input views, critical questions regarding the role of 3D knowledge and\nthe necessity of circumventing its use remain under-explored. In this work, we\nconduct a systematic analysis on the 3D knowledge and uncover a critical trend:\nthe performance of methods that requires less 3D knowledge accelerates more as\ndata scales, eventually achieving performance on par with their 3D\nknowledge-driven counterparts, which highlights the increasing importance of\nreducing dependence on 3D knowledge in the era of large-scale data.
