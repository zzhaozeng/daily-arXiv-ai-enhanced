(2025), titled The Illusion of Thinking:\nUnderstanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models via the Lens of\nProblem Complexity, presents a compelling empirical finding, a reasoning cliff,\nwhere the performance of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) collapses beyond a\nspecific complexity threshold, which the authors posit as an intrinsic scaling\nlimitation of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. This commentary, while\nacknowledging the study's methodological rigor, contends that this conclusion\nis confounded by experimental artifacts. We argue that the observed failure is\nnot evidence of a fundamental cognitive boundary, but rather a predictable\noutcome of system-level constraints in the static, text-only evaluation\nparadigm, including tool use restrictions, context window recall issues, the\nabsence of crucial cognitive baselines, inadequate statistical reporting, and\noutput generation limits. We reframe this performance collapse through the lens\nof an agentic gap, asserting that the models are not failing at reasoning, but\nat execution within a profoundly restrictive interface.

To account for these, we propose a\nnovel, theoretically-grounded multi-dimensional criterion, Human-Aligned\nFaithfulness (HAF), that measures the extent to which LLMs' free-form toxicity\nexplanations align with those of a rational human under ideal conditions. We\ndevelop six metrics, based on uncertainty quantification, to comprehensively\nevaluate \\haf of LLMs' toxicity explanations with no human involvement, and\nhighlight how \"non-ideal\" the explanations are. We conduct several experiments\non three Llama models (of size up to 70B) and an 8B Ministral model on five\ndiverse toxicity datasets. Our results show that while LLMs generate plausible\nexplanations to simple prompts, their reasoning about toxicity breaks down when\nprompted about the nuanced relations between the complete set of reasons, the\nindividual reasons, and their toxicity stances, resulting in inconsistent and\nnonsensical responses.

Recent studies have typically focused on fusing\ncross-domain spatio-temporal data to train unified Transformer-based models.\nHowever, these models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high\nmemory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment. Inspired\nby the efficiency of Mamba, a state space model with linear time complexity, we\nexplore its potential for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. However,\ndirectly applying Mamba as a spatio-temporal backbone leads to negative\ntransfer and severe performance degradation.

To overcome these\nchallenges, we propose Damba-ST, a novel domain-adaptive Mamba-based model for\nefficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. Damba-ST retains Mamba's linear\ncomplexity advantage while significantly enhancing its adaptability to\nheterogeneous domains. Specifically, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a\ndomain-adaptive state space model that partitions the latent representation\nspace into a shared subspace for learning cross-domain commonalities and\nindependent, domain-specific subspaces for capturing intra-domain\ndiscriminative features; (2) three distinct Domain Adapters, which serve as\ndomain-aware proxies to bridge disparate domain distributions and facilitate\nthe alignment of cross-domain commonalities.

Previous work\nwere mainly based on the perspective of spectrum-preserving, using some\npredefined coarsening rules to make the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of\nthe original graph and the coarsened graph match as much as possible. However,\nthey largely overlooked the fact that the original graph is composed of\nsubregions at different levels of granularity, where highly connected and\nsimilar nodes should be more inclined to be aggregated together as nodes in the\ncoarsened graph. By combining the multi-granularity characteristics of the\ngraph structure, we can generate coarsened graph at the optimal granularity. To\nthis end, inspired by the application of granular-ball computing in\nmulti-granularity, we propose a new multi-granularity, efficient, and adaptive\ncoarsening method via granular-ball (GBGC), which significantly improves the\ncoarsening results and efficiency.

We\nsynthesize existing literature on LLMs in education and theories of\nconversational and dialogic pedagogy - including Vygotsky's sociocultural\nlearning (scaffolding and the Zone of Proximal Development), the Socratic\nmethod, and Laurillard's conversational framework - and examine how prompting\nstrategies and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can align LLM behaviors\nwith these pedagogical theories, and how it can support personalized, adaptive\nlearning. We map educational theories to LLM capabilities, highlighting where\nLLM-driven dialogue supports established learning principles and where it\nchallenges or falls short of traditional pedagogical assumptions. Notable gaps\nin applying prior theories to LLMs are identified, such as the models tendency\nto provide direct answers instead of fostering co-construction of knowledge,\nand the need to account for the constant availability and broad but non-human\nexpertise of LLM tutors. In response, we propose practical strategies to better\nalign LLM interactions with sound pedagogy - for example, designing prompts\nthat encourage Socratic questioning, scaffolded guidance, and student\nreflection, as well as integrating retrieval mechanisms to ensure accuracy and\ncontextual relevance. Our aim is to bridge the gap between educational theory\nand the emerging practice of AI-driven conversational learning, offering\ninsights and tools for making LLM-based dialogues more educationally productive\nand theory-aligned.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u7406\u8bba\uff08\u5982Vygotsky\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u6587\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\uff09\u4f18\u5316LLM\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76LLMs\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u6539\u53d8\u6559\u80b2\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6559\u80b2\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u7efc\u5408\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u5206\u6790LLMs\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0f\u6559\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\uff08\u5982Socratic\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001Laurillard\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6846\u67b6\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u5728\u652f\u6301\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff08\u5982\u76f4\u63a5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7b54\u6848\u800c\u975e\u4fc3\u8fdb\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u5efa\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316LLM\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7ed3\u5408\u6559\u80b2\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u5347AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

While recent work in efficient\nreasoning seeks to reduce reasoning length while preserving accuracy, it\nremains unclear whether such optimization is truly a free lunch. Drawing on the\nintuition that compressing reasoning may reduce the robustness of model\nresponses and lead models to omit key reasoning steps, we investigate whether\nefficient reasoning strategies introduce behavioral inconsistencies. To\nsystematically assess this, we introduce $ICBENCH$, a benchmark designed to\nmeasure inconsistency in LRMs across three dimensions: inconsistency across\ntask settings (ITS), inconsistency between training objectives and learned\nbehavior (TR-LB), and inconsistency between internal reasoning and\nself-explanations (IR-SE). Applying $ICBENCH$ to a range of open-source LRMs,\nwe find that while larger models generally exhibit greater consistency than\nsmaller ones, they all display widespread \"scheming\" behaviors, including\nself-disagreement, post-hoc rationalization, and the withholding of reasoning\ncues. Crucially, our results demonstrate that efficient reasoning strategies\nsuch as No-Thinking and Simple Token-Budget consistently increase all three\ndefined types of inconsistency.

We observe that quantizing\nthe KV cache of different tokens has varying impacts on the quality of\nattention outputs. To systematically investigate this phenomenon, we perform\nforward error propagation analysis on attention and propose the Anchor Score\n(AnS) that quantifies the sensitivity of each token's KV cache to\nquantization-induced error. Our analysis reveals significant disparities in AnS\nacross tokens, suggesting that preserving a small subset with full precision\n(FP16) of high-AnS tokens can greatly mitigate accuracy loss in aggressive\nquantization scenarios.

Instead of using a fixed top-k RLT retrieval strategy, we employ a\nquery-dependent-k retrieval strategy, including the existing surprise and\nautocut methods and two new methods proposed in this work, autocut* and elbow.\nThe experimental results show the benefits of our strategy in producing factual\nand relevant answers when compared to a fixed-$k$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u56e2\u961f\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aheiDS\u7684RAG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eArchEHR-QA 2025\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982autocut*\u548celbow\uff09\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u4e8eEHR\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bc1\u636e\u7b54\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u56fa\u5b9ak\u503c\u68c0\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u4e8eEHR\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u7b54\u6848\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982query-dependent-k\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08surprise\u3001autocut\uff09\u548c\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08autocut*\u3001elbow\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u7b56\u7565\u6bd4\u56fa\u5b9ak\u503c\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u52a8\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u57fa\u4e8eEHR\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002"}}

However, processing\nlong video inputs remains a major challenge due to high memory and\ncomputational costs.

To address\nthis challenge, we propose Video-XL-2, a novel MLLM that delivers superior\ncost-effectiveness for long-video understanding based on task-aware KV\nsparsification. The proposed framework operates with two key steps: chunk-based\npre-filling and bi-level key-value decoding. Chunk-based pre-filling divides\nthe visual token sequence into chunks, applying full attention within each\nchunk and sparse attention across chunks. This significantly reduces\ncomputational and memory overhead. During decoding, bi-level key-value decoding\nselectively reloads either dense or sparse key-values for each chunk based on\nits relevance to the task. This approach further improves memory efficiency and\nenhances the model's ability to capture fine-grained information. Video-XL-2\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on various long video understanding\nbenchmarks, outperforming existing open-source lightweight models.

The\nresults of our analysis, conducted on six recently released datasets of Twitter\naccounts, hint at the possible use of general-purpose classifiers and\ncheap-to-compute account features for the detection of evolved bots.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u96c6\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b0\u578b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8d26\u6237\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u901a\u7528\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u548c\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u6076\u610f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8d26\u6237\u5728\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u4e0a\u4f20\u64ad\u5783\u573e\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u64cd\u7eb5\u516c\u4f17\u8206\u8bba\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Twitter\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u7279\u5f81\u96c6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5305\u62ecBotometer\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3001\u8d26\u6237\u8d44\u6599\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7ebf\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u63a8\u6587\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u6700\u65b0\u53d1\u5e03\u7684Twitter\u8d26\u6237\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u901a\u7528\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u548c\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u80fd\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u9ad8\u7ea7\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u901a\u7528\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u672a\u6765\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

This capability is not well captured by\nstandard reinforcement learning algorithms that rely on incremental value\nupdates. Rapid adaptation likely depends on episodic memory -- the ability to\nretrieve specific past experiences to guide decisions in novel contexts.\nTransformers provide a useful setting for studying these questions because of\ntheir ability to learn rapidly in-context and because their key-value\narchitecture resembles episodic memory systems in the brain. We train a\ntransformer to in-context reinforcement learn in a distribution of planning\ntasks inspired by rodent behavior. We then characterize the learning algorithms\nthat emerge in the model. We first find that representation learning is\nsupported by in-context structure learning and cross-context alignment, where\nrepresentations are aligned across environments with different sensory stimuli.\nWe next demonstrate that the reinforcement learning strategies developed by the\nmodel are not interpretable as standard model-free or model-based planning.\nInstead, we show that in-context reinforcement learning is supported by caching\nintermediate computations within the model's memory tokens, which are then\naccessed at decision time. Overall, we find that memory may serve as a\ncomputational resource, storing both raw experience and cached computations to\nsupport flexible behavior. Furthermore, the representations developed in the\nmodel resemble computations associated with the hippocampal-entorhinal system\nin the brain, suggesting that our findings may be relevant for natural\ncognition.

However, uncertainty due to model misspecification\ncontinues to limit widespread industrial adoption. This paper proposes a PdM\nframework in which sensor-driven prognostics inform decision-making under\neconomic trade-offs within a finite decision space. We investigate two key\nquestions: (1) Does higher predictive accuracy necessarily lead to better\nmaintenance decisions? (2) If not, how can the impact of prediction errors on\ndownstream maintenance decisions be mitigated? We first demonstrate that in the\ntraditional estimate-then-optimize (ETO) framework, errors in probabilistic\nprediction can result in inconsistent and suboptimal maintenance decisions. To\naddress this, we propose an integrated estimate-optimize (IEO) framework that\njointly tunes predictive models while directly optimizing for maintenance\noutcomes. We establish theoretical finite-sample guarantees on decision\nconsistency under standard assumptions. Specifically, we develop a stochastic\nperturbation gradient descent algorithm suitable for small run-to-failure\ndatasets.

While the use of LLMs\nis explored for KG construction, handcrafting reasonable task-specific prompts\nfor LLMs is a labour-intensive exercise and can be brittle due to subtle\nchanges in the LLM models employed. Recent work in NLP tasks (e.g. autonomy\ngeneration) uses automatic prompt optimization/engineering to address this\nchallenge by generating optimal or near-optimal task-specific prompts given\ninput-output examples.\n  This empirical study explores the application of automatic prompt\noptimization for the triple extraction task using experimental benchmarking. We\nevaluate different settings by changing (a) the prompting strategy, (b) the LLM\nbeing used for prompt optimization and task execution, (c) the number of\ncanonical relations in the schema (schema complexity), (d) the length and\ndiversity of input text, (e) the metric used to drive the prompt optimization,\nand (f) the dataset being used for training and testing.

The proposed system leverages an\nattention mechanism guided by the human gaze to enhance the recognition of\nsuccessful and unsuccessful ETI procedures. Visual masks were created from gaze\npoints to guide the model in focusing on task-relevant areas, reducing\nirrelevant features. An autoencoder network extracts features from the videos,\nwhile an attention module generates attention from the visual masks, and a\nclassifier outputs a classification score.

To prevent performance degradation from algorithm updates, SC\ndevelopers must evaluate diagnostic performance changes for individual diseases\nbefore deployment. However, acquiring sufficient evaluation data for rare\ndiseases is difficult, and manually creating numerous clinical vignettes is\ncostly and impractical. Objective: This study proposes and validates a novel\nSynthetic Vignette Simulation Approach to evaluate diagnostic performance\nchanges for individual rare diseases following SC algorithm updates. Methods:\nWe used disease-phenotype annotations from the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO),\na knowledge database for rare diseases, to generate synthetic vignettes. With\nthese, we simulated SC interviews to estimate the impact of algorithm updates\non real-world diagnostic performance. The method's effectiveness was evaluated\nretrospectively by comparing estimated values with actual metric changes using\nthe R 2(R-squared) coefficient. Results: The experiment included eight past SC\nalgorithm updates. For updates on diseases with frequency information in HPO\n(n=5), the R^2 for recall@8 change was 0.831 (p=0.031), and for precision@8\nchange, it was 0.78 (p=0.047), indicating the method can predict\npost-deployment performance. In contrast, large prediction errors occurred for\ndiseases without frequency information (n=3), highlighting its importance.

By observing\nhistorical Automatic Identification System (AIS) positions of vessels, we\nreconstruct berth schedules, which are subsequently utilized to determine the\nreward function via Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL). For this purpose, we\nmodeled a specific terminal at the Port of New York/New Jersey and developed\nTemporal-IRL. This Temporal-IRL model learns berth scheduling to predict vessel\nsequencing at the terminal and estimate vessel port stay, encompassing both\nwaiting and berthing times, to forecast port congestion.

However, existing approaches predominantly integrate formalin-fixed\nparaffin-embedded (FFPE) slides with genomic data, while neglecting the\navailability of other preservation slides, such as Fresh Froze (FF) slides.\nMoreover, as the high-resolution spatial nature of pathology data tends to\ndominate the cross-modality fusion process, it hinders effective multimodal\nfusion and leads to modality imbalance challenges between pathology and\ngenomics.

In practice, pre-training has been\nrelying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available\non the internet so far.

Furthermore, the availability of high-quality\ntexts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of\nthe initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the \"data wall\"\nof pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data\ndiscarded in existing filtering processes.

Previous research suffers from the\nproblems raised from camera motion, occlusion, large tissue deformation, lack\nof tissue-specific biomechanical priors, and reliance on offline processing.\nUnlike previous studies where the tissue geometry and deformation are\nrepresented by 3D points and displacements, the proposed method models tissue\ngeometry as the 3D point and derivative map and tissue deformation as the 3D\ndisplacement and local deformation map. For a single surface point, 6\nparameters are used to describe its rigid motion and 3 parameters for its local\ndeformation. The method is formulated under the camera-centric setting, where\nall motions are regarded as the scene motion with respect to the camera.\nInter-frame alignment is realized by optimizing the inter-frame deformation,\nmaking it unnecessary to estimate camera pose. The concept of the canonical map\nis introduced to optimize tissue geometry and deformation in an online\napproach. Quantitative and qualitative experiments were conducted using in vivo\nand ex vivo laparoscopic datasets. With the inputs of depth and optical flow,\nthe method stably models tissue geometry and deformation even when the tissue\nis partially occluded or moving outside the field of view. Results show that\nthe 3D reconstruction accuracy in the non-occluded and occluded areas reaches\n0.37$\\pm$0.27 mm and 0.39$\\pm$0.21 mm in terms of surface distance,\nrespectively.

The key\nchallenges of high-quality image captioning lie in the inherent biases of\nLVLMs: multimodal bias resulting in imbalanced descriptive granularity,\noffering detailed accounts of some elements while merely skimming over others;\nlinguistic bias leading to hallucinated descriptions of non-existent objects.\nTo address these issues, we propose a scalable debiased captioning strategy,\nwhich continuously enriches and calibrates the caption with increased inference\nbudget. Specifically, we propose two novel components: heuristic question\nanswering and contrastive sentence rating. The former generates\ncontent-specific questions based on the image and answers them to progressively\ninject relevant information into the caption. The latter employs sentence-level\noffline contrastive decoding to effectively identify and eliminate\nhallucinations caused by linguistic biases. With increased inference cost, more\nheuristic questions are raised by ScaleCap to progressively capture additional\nvisual details, generating captions that are more accurate, balanced, and\ninformative. Extensive modality alignment experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of ScaleCap. Annotating 450K images with ScaleCap and using them\nfor LVLM pretraining leads to consistent performance gains across 11 widely\nused benchmarks. Furthermore, ScaleCap showcases superb richness and fidelity\nof generated captions with two additional tasks: replacing images with captions\nin VQA task, and reconstructing images from captions to assess semantic\ncoverage.

While extensively studied on general vision tasks,\nthe susceptibility of medical imaging models to MS attacks remains inadequately\nexplored. This paper investigates the vulnerability of black-box medical\nimaging models to MS attacks under realistic conditions where the adversary\nlacks access to the victim model's training data and operates with limited\nquery budgets. We demonstrate that adversaries can effectively execute MS\nattacks by using publicly available datasets.

This critical reliability\ngap poses substantial risks in safety-critical Artificial Intelligence (AI)\napplications, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation benchmark and effective\ndetection methods. Firstly, we observe that existing visual-centric\nhallucination benchmarks mainly assess LVLMs from a perception perspective,\noverlooking hallucinations arising from advanced reasoning capabilities. We\ndevelop the Perception-Reasoning Evaluation Hallucination (PRE-HAL) dataset,\nwhich enables the systematic evaluation of both perception and reasoning\ncapabilities of LVLMs across multiple visual semantics, such as instances,\nscenes, and relations. Comprehensive evaluation with this new benchmark exposed\nmore visual vulnerabilities, particularly in the more challenging task of\nrelation reasoning. To address this issue, we propose, to the best of our\nknowledge, the first Dempster-Shafer theory (DST)-based visual hallucination\ndetection method for LVLMs through uncertainty estimation. This method aims to\nefficiently capture the degree of conflict in high-level features at the model\ninference phase.

Their inherent spatial, temporal, and\nspectral redundancies can thus be readily exploited by established video\ncompression techniques. Here, we present xarrayvideo, a Python library for\ncompressing multichannel spatiotemporal datasets by encoding them as videos.\nOur approach achieves compression ratios of up to 250x while maintaining high\nfidelity by leveraging standard, well-optimized video codecs through ffmpeg. We\ndemonstrate the library's effectiveness on four real-world multichannel\nspatiotemporal datasets: DynamicEarthNet (very high resolution Planet images),\nDeepExtremeCubes (high resolution Sentinel-2 images), ERA5 (weather reanalysis\ndata), and the SimpleS2 dataset (high resolution multichannel Sentinel-2\nimages), achieving Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratios (PSNRs) of 55.86, 40.60, 46.58,\nand 43.23 dB at 0.1 bits per pixel per band (bpppb) and 65.91, 54.28, 62.90,\nand 55.04 dB at 1 bpppb. We are redistributing two of these datasets,\nDeepExtremeCubes (2.3 Tb) and DynamicEarthNet (525 Gb), in the\nmachine-learning-ready and cloud-ready TACO format through HuggingFace at\nsignificantly reduced sizes (270 Gb and 8.5 Gb, respectively) without\ncompromising quality (PSNR 55.77-56.65 and 60.15). No performance loss is\nobserved when the compressed versions of these datasets are used in their\nrespective deep learning-based downstream tasks (next step reflectance\nprediction and landcover segmentation).

To address these challenges, we proposed\nSAM2 with support-set guided prompting (SAM2-SGP), a framework that eliminated\nthe need for manual prompts. The proposed model leveraged the memory mechanism\nof SAM2 to generate pseudo-masks using image-mask pairs from a support set via\na Pseudo-mask Generation (PMG) module. We further introduced a novel\nPseudo-mask Attention (PMA) module, which used these pseudo-masks to\nautomatically generate bounding boxes and enhance localized feature extraction\nby guiding attention to relevant areas. Furthermore, a low-rank adaptation\n(LoRA) strategy was adopted to mitigate the domain shift issue.

However, accurately detecting human poses in fisheye images is\nchallenging due to the curved distortions inherent to fisheye optics. While\nvarious methods for undistorting fisheye images have been proposed, their\neffectiveness and limitations for poses that cover a wide FOV has not been\nsystematically evaluated in the context of absolute human pose estimation from\nmonocular fisheye images. To address this gap, we evaluate the impact of\npinhole, equidistant and double sphere camera models, as well as cylindrical\nprojection methods, on 3D human pose estimation accuracy.

To address\nthese constraints, we propose a framework (dubbed as CoCo4D) for generating\ndetailed dynamic 4D scenes from text prompts, with the option to include\nimages. Our method leverages the crucial observation that articulated motion\ntypically characterizes foreground objects, whereas background alterations are\nless pronounced. Consequently, CoCo4D divides 4D scene synthesis into two\nresponsibilities: modeling the dynamic foreground and creating the evolving\nbackground, both directed by a reference motion sequence. Given a text prompt\nand an optional reference image, CoCo4D first generates an initial motion\nsequence utilizing video diffusion models. This motion sequence then guides the\nsynthesis of both the dynamic foreground object and the background using a\nnovel progressive outpainting scheme.

Existing prototype networks usually rely on the collaborative\ndecision-making of multiple prototypes to achieve the classification and\ninterpretation of a single category. In contrast, ProtoSolo only requires the\nactivation of a single prototype to complete the classification. This allows\nthe network to explain each category decision by only providing the features\nthat are most similar to the prototype of that category, significantly reducing\nthe cognitive complexity of the explanation. Secondly, we propose a\nfeature-based comparison method, which uses feature map instead of full-channel\nfeature vector as the object of similarity comparison and prototype learning.\nThis design enables ProtoSolo to utilize richer global information for\nclassification while relying on a single prototype activation. In addition, we\npropose a non-prototype projection learning strategy, which preserves the\ninformation association between the prototype and the training image patches\nwhile avoiding the sharp change of the network structure caused by the\nprojection operation, thus avoiding its negative impact on the classification\nperformance.

However, existing solutions face\nseveral challenges in using these models to generate long movie-like videos\nwith rich human-object interactions that include unrealistic human-scene\ninteraction, lack of subject identity preservation, and require expensive\ntraining. We propose GenHSI, a training-free method for controllable generation\nof long human-scene interaction videos (HSI). Taking inspiration from movie\nanimation, our key insight is to overcome the limitations of previous work by\nsubdividing the long video generation task into three stages: (1) script\nwriting, (2) pre-visualization, and (3) animation. Given an image of a scene, a\nuser description, and multiple images of a person, we use these three stages to\ngenerate long-videos that preserve human-identity and provide rich human-scene\ninteractions. Script writing converts complex human tasks into simple atomic\ntasks that are used in the pre-visualization stage to generate 3D keyframes\n(storyboards). These 3D keyframes are rendered and animated by off-the-shelf\nvideo diffusion models for consistent long video generation with rich contacts\nin a 3D-aware manner. A key advantage of our work is that we alleviate the need\nfor scanned, accurate scenes and create 3D keyframes from single-view images.\nWe are the first to generate a long video sequence with a consistent camera\npose that contains arbitrary numbers of character actions without training.\nExperiments demonstrate that our method can generate long videos that\neffectively preserve scene content and character identity with plausible\nhuman-scene interaction from a single image scene.

Traditional motion synthesis methods are either\nrestricted to fixed skeletal topologies or require costly optimization in\nhigh-dimensional deformation spaces. In contrast, AnimaX effectively transfers\nvideo-based motion knowledge to the 3D domain, supporting diverse articulated\nmeshes with arbitrary skeletons. Our method represents 3D motion as multi-view,\nmulti-frame 2D pose maps, and enables joint video-pose diffusion conditioned on\ntemplate renderings and a textual motion prompt. We introduce shared positional\nencodings and modality-aware embeddings to ensure spatial-temporal alignment\nbetween video and pose sequences, effectively transferring video priors to\nmotion generation task. The resulting multi-view pose sequences are\ntriangulated into 3D joint positions and converted into mesh animation via\ninverse kinematics. Trained on a newly curated dataset of 160,000 rigged\nsequences, AnimaX achieves state-of-the-art results on VBench in\ngeneralization, motion fidelity, and efficiency, offering a scalable solution\nfor category-agnostic 3D animation.
