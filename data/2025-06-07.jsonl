We begin by applying cone singularity\ndetection to identify a sparse set of potential handles. The VLM is then\nprompted to select both the deformable sub-parts of the mesh and the handles\nthat best align with user instructions. Subsequently, we query the desired\ndeformed positions of the selected handles in screen space.

To address this, we highlight a free lunch of occupancy labels:\nthe voxel-level class label implicitly provides insight at the instance level,\nwhich is overlooked by the community. Motivated by this observation, we first\nintroduce a training-free Voxel-to-Instance (VoxNT) trick: a simple yet\neffective method that freely converts voxel-level class labels into\ninstance-level offset labels. Building on this, we further propose VoxDet, an\ninstance-centric framework that reformulates the voxel-level occupancy\nprediction as dense object detection by decoupling it into two sub-tasks:\noffset regression and semantic prediction. Specifically, based on the lifted 3D\nvolume, VoxDet first uses (a) Spatially-decoupled Voxel Encoder to generate\ndisentangled feature volumes for the two sub-tasks, which learn task-specific\nspatial deformation in the densely projected tri-perceptive space. Then, we\ndeploy (b) Task-decoupled Dense Predictor to address this task via dense\ndetection. Here, we first regress a 4D offset field to estimate distances (6\ndirections) between voxels and object borders in the voxel space. The regressed\noffsets are then used to guide the instance-level aggregation in the\nclassification branch, achieving instance-aware prediction.

In this paper, we propose Dynamic Epsilon\nScheduling (DES), a novel framework that adaptively adjusts the adversarial\nperturbation budget per instance and per training iteration. DES integrates\nthree key factors: (1) the distance to the decision boundary approximated via\ngradient-based proxies, (2) prediction confidence derived from softmax entropy,\nand (3) model uncertainty estimated via Monte Carlo dropout.

These\nattacks are hard to detect and defend due to their stealthiness and cross-modal\nnature. By analyzing attack samples, we identify two key vulnerabilities: (1)\nabnormal attention concentration on specific image regions, and (2) semantic\ndrift and incoherence in generated captions. To counter this, we propose\nSemantic Reward Defense (SRD), a reinforcement learning framework that\nmitigates backdoor behavior without prior knowledge of triggers. SRD uses a\nDeep Q-Network to learn policies for applying discrete perturbations (e.g.,\nocclusion, color masking) to sensitive image regions, aiming to disrupt the\nactivation of malicious pathways. We design a semantic fidelity score as the\nreward signal, which jointly evaluates semantic consistency and linguistic\nfluency of the output, guiding the agent toward generating robust yet faithful\ncaptions.

Existing hallucination detection methods focus primarily on\nanswer-level uncertainty and often fail to detect hallucinations or logical\ninconsistencies arising from the model's reasoning trace. This oversight is\nparticularly problematic for LRMs, where the explicit thinking trace is not\nonly an important support to the model's decision-making process but also a key\nsource of potential hallucination.

In our\nopinion, LLMs offer a promising solution to these challenges. This paper\npresents a novel comparative analysis of three widely known LLMs - Llama 2,\nMistral, and GPT-3.5 - to explore their potential for creating informative and\nchallenging MCQs. In our approach, we do not rely on the knowledge of the LLM,\nbut we inject the knowledge into the prompt to contrast the hallucinations,\ngiving the educators control over the test's source text, too.

To what extent (if\nany) can the concept of introspection be meaningfully applied to LLMs? Here, we\npresent and critique two examples of apparent introspective self-report from\nLLMs. In the first example, an LLM attempts to describe the process behind its\nown ``creative'' writing, and we argue this is not a valid example of\nintrospection. In the second example, an LLM correctly infers the value of its\nown temperature parameter, and we argue that this can be legitimately\nconsidered a minimal example of introspection, albeit one that is (presumably)\nnot accompanied by conscious experience."}

To\naddress this, we introduce MoViX, a self-supervised cross-view video\nlocalization framework that learns viewpoint- and season-invariant\nrepresentations while preserving directional awareness essential for accurate\nlocalization. MoViX employs a pose-dependent positive sampling strategy to\nenhance directional discrimination and temporally aligned hard negative mining\nto discourage shortcut learning from seasonal cues. A motion-informed frame\nsampler selects spatially diverse frames, and a lightweight temporal aggregator\nemphasizes geometrically aligned observations while downweighting ambiguous\nones. At inference, MoViX runs within a Monte Carlo Localization framework,\nusing a learned cross-view matching module in place of handcrafted models.\nEntropy-guided temperature scaling enables robust multi-hypothesis tracking and\nconfident convergence under visual ambiguity. We evaluate MoViX on the\nTartanDrive 2.0 dataset, training on under 30 minutes of data and testing over\n12.29 km. Despite outdated satellite imagery, MoViX localizes within 25 meters\nof ground truth 93% of the time, and within 50 meters 100% of the time in\nunseen regions, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines without\nenvironment-specific tuning.

However, the\nlikelihood displacement observed in DPO indicates that both $\\log \\pi_\\theta\n(y_w\\mid x)$ and $\\log \\pi_\\theta (y_l\\mid x) $ often decrease during training,\ninadvertently boosting the probabilities of non-target responses. In this\npaper, we systematically revisit this phenomenon from LLMs to Video-LLMs,\nshowing that it intensifies when dealing with the redundant complexity of video\ncontent. To alleviate the impact of this phenomenon, we propose \\emph{Lean\nPreference Optimization} (LeanPO), a reference-free approach that reformulates\nthe implicit reward as the average likelihood of the response with respect to\nthe policy model. A key component of LeanPO is the reward-trustworthiness\ncorrelated self-generated preference data pipeline, which carefully infuses\nrelevant prior knowledge into the model while continuously refining the\npreference data via self-reflection. This allows the policy model to obtain\nhigh-quality paired data and accurately estimate the newly defined reward, thus\nmitigating the unintended drop.

Instead of prematurely discarding cached\ntokens, DMS delays token eviction, implicitly merging representations and\npreserving critical information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\ninference-time hyper-scaling with DMS on multiple families of LLMs, showing\nthat it boosts accuracy for comparable inference runtime and memory load.

It is demonstrated that the\napproximation scheme is faster than state-of-the-art approximation and is\ncompetitive with the same in Rosin's measure and in its aesthetic aspect. The\nscheme comprises of three phases: initial segmentation, iterative vertex\ninsertion, and iterative merging, followed by vertex adjustment. The initial\nsegmentation is used to detect sharp turnings - the vertices that seemingly\nhave high curvature. It is likely that some of important vertices with low\ncurvature might have been missed out at the first phase and so iterative vertex\ninsertion is used to add vertices in a region where the curvature changes\nslowly but steadily. The initial phase may pick up some undesirable vertices\nand so merging is used to eliminate the redundant vertices. Finally, vertex\nadjustment is used to facilitate enhancement in the aesthetic look of the\napproximation. The quality of the approximations is measured using Rosin's\nmeasure. The robustness of the proposed scheme with respect to geometric\ntransformation is observed."}
