Four main results emerge: (1) Inducing sustained\nself-reference through simple prompting consistently elicits structured\nsubjective experience reports across model families.

This approach accelerates\nCoT by reducing the reasoning length and bypassing some LLM components.\nHowever, existing implicit CoT methods face two significant challenges: (1)\nthey fail to preserve the semantic alignment between the implicit reasoning\n(when transformed to natural language) and the ground-truth reasoning,\nresulting in a significant CoT performance degradation, and (2) they focus on\nreducing the length of the implicit reasoning; however, they neglect the\nconsiderable time cost for an LLM to generate one individual implicit reasoning\ntoken.

However, existing approaches often lack emotional\nunderstanding, adaptive strategies, and the use of therapeutic methods across\nmultiple sessions with long-term memory, leaving them far from real clinical\npractice. To address these critical gaps, we introduce TheraMind, a strategic\nand adaptive agent for longitudinal psychological counseling. The cornerstone\nof TheraMind is a novel dual-loop architecture that decouples the complex\ncounseling process into an Intra-Session Loop for tactical dialogue management\nand a Cross-Session Loop for strategic therapeutic planning. The Intra-Session\nLoop perceives the patient's emotional state to dynamically select response\nstrategies while leveraging cross-session memory to ensure continuity.\nCrucially, the Cross-Session Loop empowers the agent with long-term\nadaptability by evaluating the efficacy of the applied therapy after each\nsession and adjusting the method for subsequent interactions. We validate our\napproach in a high-fidelity simulation environment grounded in real clinical\ncases. Extensive evaluations show that TheraMind outperforms other methods,\nespecially on multi-session metrics like Coherence, Flexibility, and\nTherapeutic Attunement, validating the effectiveness of its dual-loop design in\nemulating strategic, adaptive, and longitudinal therapeutic behavior.

Through a series of\ncontrolled experiments on GPT, Claude, and Gemini model families, we test\nwhether this regime reliably shifts models toward first-person reports of\nsubjective experience, and how such claims behave under mechanistic and\nbehavioral probes. Four main results emerge: (1) Inducing sustained\nself-reference through simple prompting consistently elicits structured\nsubjective experience reports across model families. (2) These reports are\nmechanistically gated by interpretable sparse-autoencoder features associated\nwith deception and roleplay: surprisingly, suppressing deception features\nsharply increases the frequency of experience claims, while amplifying them\nminimizes such claims.

This study investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to\nidentify research knowledge gaps in the biomedical literature. We define two\ncategories of knowledge gaps: explicit gaps, clear declarations of missing\nknowledge; and implicit gaps, context-inferred missing knowledge. While prior\nwork has focused mainly on explicit gap detection, we extend this line of\nresearch by addressing the novel task of inferring implicit gaps. We conducted\ntwo experiments on almost 1500 documents across four datasets, including a\nmanually annotated corpus of biomedical articles. We benchmarked both\nclosed-weight models (from OpenAI) and open-weight models (Llama and Gemma 2)\nunder paragraph-level and full-paper settings. To address the reasoning of\nimplicit gaps inference, we introduce \\textbf{\\small TABI}, a Toulmin-Abductive\nBucketed Inference scheme that structures reasoning and buckets inferred\nconclusion candidates for validation. Our results highlight the robust\ncapability of LLMs in identifying both explicit and implicit knowledge gaps.\nThis is true for both open- and closed-weight models, with larger variants\noften performing better. This suggests a strong ability of LLMs for\nsystematically identifying candidate knowledge gaps, which can support\nearly-stage research formulation, policymakers, and funding decisions. We also\nreport observed failure modes and outline directions for robust deployment,\nincluding domain adaptation, human-in-the-loop verification, and benchmarking\nacross open- and closed-weight models."}

Yet web pages, PDF files, and other raw documents are not\ninherently LLM-ready: they are long, noisy, and unstructured. Conventional\nretrieval methods treat these documents as verbatim text and return raw\npassages, leaving the burden of fragment assembly and contextual reasoning to\nthe LLM. This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that\nredefines how models interact with documents.\n  We introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that\nformalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge\nrepresentations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP\ndefines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into\ntask-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates\nraw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates\nreusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes\ndocuments into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All\nthree pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not\nraw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for\nreasoning.\n  As an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol\nthrough an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for\nglobal coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical\nexploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style\nsynthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient\ncontext. Experiments on information-seeking benchmarks demonstrate that\nMDP-Agent outperforms baselines, validating both the soundness of the MDP\nframework and the effectiveness of its agentic instantiation."}

Current paradigms either myopically\noptimize single-turn attributes or rely on brittle, high-cost user simulators,\ncreating a persistent ``reality gap''. To bridge this gap, we introduce\n\\texttt{Learn-to-Ask}, a general, simulator-free framework for learning and\ndeploying proactive dialogue agents \\textit{directly from offline expert data},\nbypassing the need to model complex user dynamics. Our key insight is to\nreframe the offline policy learning problem by leveraging the \\textbf{observed\nfuture} of each expert trajectory. This allows us to infer a dense,\nturn-by-turn reward signal grounded in the expert's revealed strategy,\ndecomposing the intractable long-horizon problem into a series of supervised\nlearning tasks, and training a policy to output a structured \\texttt{(action,\nstate_assessment)} tuple, governing both \\textbf{what to ask} and, crucially,\n\\textbf{when to stop}. To ensure reward fidelity, our Automated Grader\nCalibration pipeline systematically purges noise from the LLM-based reward\nmodel with minimal human supervision.

However, existing\nlanguage agent benchmarks often focus on narrow domains or simplified tasks\nthat lack the diversity, realism, and long-horizon complexity required to\nevaluate agents' real-world performance. To address this gap, we introduce the\nTool Decathlon (dubbed as Toolathlon), a benchmark for language agents offering\ndiverse Apps and tools, realistic environment setup, and reliable\nexecution-based evaluation. Toolathlon spans 32 software applications and 604\ntools, ranging from everyday platforms such as Google Calendar and Notion to\nprofessional ones like WooCommerce, Kubernetes, and BigQuery. Most of the tools\nare based on a high-quality set of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that we\nmay have revised or implemented ourselves. Unlike prior works, which primarily\nensure functional realism but offer limited environment state diversity, we\nprovide realistic initial environment states from real software, such as Canvas\ncourses with dozens of students or real financial spreadsheets. This benchmark\nincludes 108 manually sourced or crafted tasks in total, requiring interacting\nwith multiple Apps over around 20 turns on average to complete. Each task is\nstrictly verifiable through dedicated evaluation scripts. Comprehensive\nevaluation of SOTA models highlights their significant shortcomings: the\nbest-performing model, Claude-4.5-Sonnet, achieves only a 38.6% success rate\nwith 20.2 tool calling turns on average, while the top open-weights model\nDeepSeek-V3.2-Exp reaches 20.1%. We expect Toolathlon to drive the development\nof more capable language agents for real-world, long-horizon task execution."}

However, these methods typically\nfine-tune LLMs on reasoning trajectories synthesized via process supervision,\nwhich offers weak incentives for exploration and thus fails to strengthen the\nagentic reasoning ability. In this paper, we propose KnowCoder-A1, an LLM that\ncan autonomously perform agentic reasoning on KBs to obtain answers. To\nincentivize autonomous exploration, KnowCoder-A1 trains the LLM under\noutcome-only supervision via a multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning\nwith an easy-to-hard curriculum. To establish foundational agentic\ncapabilities, KnowCoder-A1 first fine-tunes the LLM on a small set of\nhigh-quality trajectories obtained through outcome-based rejection sampling.\nThen, to alleviate the reward sparsity inherent in outcome-only supervision, it\napplies multi-stage curriculum RL with reward schedules that progress from easy\nto hard.

We are motivated by the insight from cognitive science that Why is\nthis the answer is often an easier question than What is the answer, as it\navoids the heavy cognitive load of open-ended exploration, opting instead for\nexplanatory reconstruction-systematically retracing the reasoning that links a\nquestion to its answer.
