However, existing educational AI tools don't focus on generating examples or adapting to learners' changing understanding, struggles, or growing skills. We've developed ExaCraft, an AI system that generates personalized examples by adapting to the learner's dynamic context. Through the Google Gemini AI and Python Flask API, accessible via a Chrome extension, ExaCraft combines user-defined profiles (including location, education, profession, and complexity preferences) with real-time analysis of learner behavior. This ensures examples are both culturally relevant and tailored to individual learning needs. The system's core innovation is its ability to adapt to five key aspects of the learning context: indicators of struggle, mastery patterns, topic progression history, session boundaries, and learning progression signals. Our demonstration will show how ExaCraft's examples evolve from basic concepts to advanced technical implementations, responding to topic repetition, regeneration requests, and topic progression patterns in different use cases.", "AI": {"tldr": "ExaCraft\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5229\u7528Google Gemini AI\u548cPython Flask API\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Chrome\u6269\u5c55\u7a0b\u5e8f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f8b\u5b50\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u6559\u80b2AI\u5de5\u5177\u7f3a\u4e4f\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4f8b\u5b50\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u4e0d\u65ad\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "ExaCraft\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u4e2a\u4eba\u8d44\u6599\uff08\u5982\u5730\u70b9\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u3001\u804c\u4e1a\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u504f\u597d\uff09\u548c\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4f8b\u5b50\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u4e94\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u60c5\u5883\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u6574\uff1a\u56f0\u96be\u6307\u6807\u3001\u638c\u63e1\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u4e3b\u9898\u8fdb\u5c55\u5386\u53f2\u3001\u4f1a\u8bdd\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u5c55\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "conclusion": "ExaCraft\u7684\u6f14\u793a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u4f8b\u5b50\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u57fa\u7840\u6982\u5ff5\u53d1\u5c55\u5230\u9ad8\u7ea7\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u54cd\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u7528\u4f8b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\u91cd\u590d\u3001\u518d\u751f\u8bf7\u6c42\u548c\u4e3b\u9898\u8fdb\u5c55\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002"}}

In the first stage, we employ large language models (LLMs) to independently evaluate retrieved articles and compute an aggregated agreement score that reflects the overall evidence stance. When this score indicates insufficient consensus-falling below a predefined threshold-the system proceeds to a second stage.

While recent foundation models for echocardiography can achieve strong performance on individual perceptual subtasks such as view classification, segmentation, or disease prediction, they typically operate in isolation and do not provide a unified, clinically coherent assessment. In this work, we introduce Echo-CoPilot, a multi-view, multi-task agent that uses a large language model to orchestrate a suite of specialized echocardiography tools. Within a ReAct-style loop, the agent decomposes clinician queries, invokes tools for view recognition, cardiac structure segmentation, measurement and disease prediction, and report synthesis, and integrates their outputs into guideline-aware answers and narrative summaries. We evaluate Echo-CoPilot on the public MIMIC-EchoQA benchmark, where it achieves an accuracy of 50.8\\%, outperforming both general-purpose and biomedical video vision-language models. Qualitative analyses further show that the agent leverages quantitative measurements and physiologic context to resolve challenging cases near clinical decision thresholds, such as borderline left ventricular hypertrophy or pericardial effusion severity.

It examines their stochastic nature and their similarity to human abductive reasoning. The argument is that these LLMs create text based on learned patterns rather than performing actual abductive reasoning. When their output seems abductive, this is largely because they are trained on human-generated texts that include reasoning structures. Examples are used to show how LLMs can produce plausible ideas, mimic commonsense reasoning, and give explanatory answers without being grounded in truth, semantics, verification, or understanding, and without performing any real abductive reasoning. This dual nature, where the models have a stochastic base but appear abductive in use, has important consequences for how LLMs are evaluated and applied. They can assist with generating ideas and supporting human thinking, but their outputs must be critically assessed because they cannot identify truth or verify their explanations.

We present a novel question generation pipeline that leverages both the text generation and the probabilistic reasoning abilities of SLMs to generate high-quality questions. Adopting a \"generate-then-validate\" strategy, our pipeline first performs expansive generation to create an abundance of candidate questions and refine them through selective validation based on novel probabilistic reasoning. We conducted two evaluation studies, one with seven human experts and the other with a large language model (LLM), to assess the quality of the generated questions. Most judges (humans or LLMs) agreed that the generated questions had clear answers and generally aligned well with the intended learning objectives. Our findings suggest that an SLM can effectively generate high-quality questions when guided by a well-designed pipeline that leverages its strengths.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6982\u7387\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210-\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u6790\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5360\u636e\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5730\u4f4d\uff0c\u4f46\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u5728\u95ee\u9898\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6982\u7387\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u201c\u751f\u6210-\u9a8c\u8bc1\u201d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u751f\u6210\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u7387\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u5019\u9009\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e24\u9879\u8bc4\u4f30\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u751f\u6210\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u5177\u6709\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u826f\u597d\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e0b\uff0c\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u6790\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, existing methods and tools often struggle with the realities of scientific literature: long-context documents, multi-modal content, and reconciling varied and inconsistent fine-grained information across multiple publications into standardized formats. These challenges are further compounded when the desired data schema or extraction ontology changes rapidly, making it difficult to re-architect or fine-tune existing systems. We present SciEx, a modular and composable framework that decouples key components including PDF parsing, multi-modal retrieval, extraction, and aggregation. This design streamlines on-demand data extraction while enabling extensibility and flexible integration of new models, prompting strategies, and reasoning mechanisms.

This study establishes that this bottleneck arises from existing generative paradigms succumbing to the Statistical Smoothing Trap, a phenomenon that overlooks the high-entropy information acquisition and structured cognitive processes integral to expert-level writing. To address this limitation, we propose the DeepNews Framework, an agentic workflow that explicitly models the implicit cognitive processes of seasoned financial journalists. The framework integrates three core modules: first, a dual-granularity retrieval mechanism grounded in information foraging theory, which enforces a 10:1 saturated information input ratio to mitigate hallucinatory outputs; second, schema-guided strategic planning, a process leveraging domain expert knowledge bases (narrative schemas) and Atomic Blocks to forge a robust logical skeleton; third, adversarial constraint prompting, a technique deploying tactics including Rhythm Break and Logic Fog to disrupt the probabilistic smoothness inherent in model-generated text. Experiments delineate a salient Knowledge Cliff in deep financial reporting: content truthfulness collapses when retrieved context falls below 15,000 characters, while a high-redundancy input exceeding 30,000 characters stabilizes the Hallucination-Free Rate (HFR) above 85%.

While large language models (LLMs) offer powerful text generation capabilities, they often produce generic responses when lacking contextual user data, reducing engagement and effectiveness. In this work, we propose a two-stage prompting framework that infers both explicit (e.g., user-stated preferences) and implicit (e.g., demographic or stylistic cues) personas directly from short review texts. These inferred persona attributes are then incorporated into the response generation prompt to produce user-tailored replies. To encourage diverse yet faithful generations, we adjust decoding temperature during inference.

It also supports multi-robot control and communication. With these key features, we build two challenging robot benchmarks: (1) a multimodal instruction-following task, where a robot must follow vision-language navigation instructions to reach a destination in the presence of pedestrians and traffic; and (2) a multi-agent search task, where two robots must communicate to cooperatively locate and meet each other. Unlike existing benchmarks, these two new benchmarks comprehensively evaluate a wide range of critical robot capacities in realistic scenarios, including (1) multimodal instructions grounding, (2) 3D spatial reasoning in large environments, (3) safe, long-range navigation with people and traffic, (4) multi-robot collaboration, and (5) grounded communication.

While ``Decomposition-and-Fill'' methods like Skeleton-of-Thought attempt to parallelize generation via external orchestration, they suffer from \\textit{coherence drift} due to the lack of cross-stream communication. In this work, we introduce the \\textbf{Parallel Decoder Transformer (PDT)}, a parameter-efficient architecture that embeds coordination primitives directly into the inference process of a frozen pre-trained model.\n  Instead of retraining the base model, PDT injects lightweight \\textit{Speculative Note Conditioning (SNC)} adapters that allow parallel decoding streams to synchronize via a shared, dynamic latent space. We formulate coordination as a \\textit{speculative consensus} problem, where sibling streams broadcast semantic ``notes'' to a global bus, gated by a learned verification head.

However, formally evaluating a dynamic, interactive clinical situation is hindered by its vast combinatorial space of possible patient states and interaction trajectories, making it difficult to standardize and quantitatively measure such scenarios. Here, we introduce AutoMedic, a multi-agent simulation framework that enables automated evaluation of LLMs as clinical conversational agents. AutoMedic transforms off-the-shelf static QA datasets into virtual patient profiles, enabling realistic and clinically grounded multi-turn clinical dialogues between LLM agents. The performance of various clinical conversational agents is then assessed based on our CARE metric, which provides a multi-faceted evaluation standard of clinical conversational accuracy, efficiency/strategy, empathy, and robustness.

This paper explores the challenges of adapting an English-trained VLM to different languages. To this end, we will explore and compare different methods for their performance and computational cost. We consider a translation-based pipeline, LoRA finetuning, and a two-stage finetuning strategy that separates vision adaptation from language adaptation. To evaluate these methods, we use a combination of standard multimodal benchmarks translated into the target language and manual assessments by native experts. The results reveal that dataset translation remains a major bottleneck in multilingual VLM performance, with data quality limiting the effectiveness of training and evaluation.

Current methods often rely on costly LLM-based techniques (e.g. annotating dataset differences) or dense embedding models (e.g. for clustering), which lack control over the properties of interest. We propose using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to create SAE embeddings: representations whose dimensions map to interpretable concepts. Through four data analysis tasks, we show that SAE embeddings are more cost-effective and reliable than LLMs and more controllable than dense embeddings. Using the large hypothesis space of SAEs, we can uncover insights such as (1) semantic differences between datasets and (2) unexpected concept correlations in documents. For instance, by comparing model responses, we find that Grok-4 clarifies ambiguities more often than nine other frontier models. Relative to LLMs, SAE embeddings uncover bigger differences at 2-8x lower cost and identify biases more reliably. Additionally, SAE embeddings are controllable: by filtering concepts, we can (3) cluster documents along axes of interest and (4) outperform dense embeddings on property-based retrieval. Using SAE embeddings, we study model behavior with two case studies: investigating how OpenAI model behavior has changed over time and finding \"trigger\" phrases learned by Tulu-3 (Lambert et al., 2024) from its training data. These results position SAEs as a versatile tool for unstructured data analysis and highlight the neglected importance of interpreting models through their data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAEs\uff09\u521b\u5efa\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\u6620\u5c04\u7684SAE\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6587\u672c\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6216\u5bc6\u96c6\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5174\u8da3\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7SAEs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u5177\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAEs\uff09\u521b\u5efaSAE\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff1a(1) \u6bd4\u8f83\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bed\u4e49\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c(2) \u53d1\u73b0\u6587\u6863\u4e2d\u610f\u5916\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c(3) \u8fc7\u6ee4\u6982\u5ff5\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u5174\u8da3\u8f74\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c(4) \u57fa\u4e8e\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "result": "SAE\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u6210\u672c\u4e0a\u6bd4LLMs\u4f4e2-8\u500d\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6bd4\u5bc6\u96c6\u5d4c\u5165\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\u4e86Grok-4\u5728\u6f84\u6e05\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0OpenAI\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u548cTulu-3\u7684\u201c\u89e6\u53d1\u201d\u77ed\u8bed\u3002", "conclusion": "SAEs\u4f5c\u4e3a\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4e0d\u5bb9\u5ffd\u89c6\u3002"}}

Sliding window attention (SWA) reduces this cost to linear complexity, but naively enabling complete SWA at inference-time for models pretrained with full attention (FA) causes severe long-context performance degradation due to training-inference mismatch. This makes us wonder: Can FA-pretrained LLMs be well adapted to SWA without pretraining? We investigate this by proposing Sliding Window Attention Adaptation (SWAA), a set of practical recipes that combine five methods for better adaptation: (1) applying SWA only during prefilling; (2) preserving \"sink\" tokens; (3) interleaving FA/SWA layers; (4) chain-of-thought (CoT); and (5) fine-tuning. Our experiments show that SWA adaptation is feasible while non-trivial: no single method suffices, yet specific synergistic combinations effectively recover the original long-context performance. We further analyze the performance-efficiency trade-offs of different SWAA configurations and provide recommended recipes for diverse scenarios.

To address these limitations, we propose CoopRAG, a novel RAG framework for the question answering task in which a retriever and an LLM work cooperatively with each other by exchanging informative knowledge, and the earlier and later layers of the retriever model work cooperatively with each other to accurately rank the retrieved documents relevant to a given query. In this framework, we (i) unroll a question into sub-questions and a reasoning chain in which uncertain positions are masked, (ii) retrieve the documents relevant to the question augmented with the sub-questions and the reasoning chain, (iii) rerank the documents by contrasting layers of the retriever, and (iv) reconstruct the reasoning chain by filling the masked positions via the LLM. Our experiments demonstrate that CoopRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art QA methods on three multi-hop QA datasets as well as a simple QA dataset in terms of both the retrieval and QA performances.

This work analyzes conspiratorial narratives in Singapore-based Telegram groups, showing that such content is woven into everyday discussions rather than confined to isolated echo chambers. We propose a two-stage computational framework. First, we fine-tune RoBERTa-large to classify messages as conspiratorial or not, achieving an F1-score of 0.866 on 2,000 expert-labeled messages. Second, we build a signed belief graph in which nodes represent messages and edge signs reflect alignment in belief labels, weighted by textual similarity. We introduce a Signed Belief Graph Neural Network (SiBeGNN) that uses a Sign Disentanglement Loss to learn embeddings that separate ideological alignment from stylistic features.\n  Using hierarchical clustering on these embeddings, we identify seven narrative archetypes across 553,648 messages: legal topics, medical concerns, media discussions, finance, contradictions in authority, group moderation, and general chat. SiBeGNN yields stronger clustering quality (cDBI = 8.38) than baseline methods (13.60 to 67.27), supported by 88 percent inter-rater agreement in expert evaluations. Our analysis shows that conspiratorial messages appear not only in clusters focused on skepticism or distrust, but also within routine discussions of finance, law, and everyday matters.

We introduce AgriRegion, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework designed specifically for high-fidelity, region-aware agricultural advisory. Unlike standard RAG approaches that rely solely on semantic similarity, AgriRegion incorporates a geospatial metadata injection layer and a region-prioritized re-ranking mechanism. By restricting the knowledge base to verified local agricultural extension services and enforcing geo-spatial constraints during retrieval, AgriRegion ensures that the advice regarding planting schedules, pest control, and fertilization is locally accurate. We create a novel benchmark dataset, AgriRegion-Eval, which comprises 160 domain-specific questions across 12 agricultural subfields.

These tools generate \"tortured phrases\", statistically improbable synonyms (e.g. \"counterfeit consciousness\" for \"artificial intelligence\"), that preserve the local grammar while obscuring the original source. Most existing detection methods depend heavily on static blocklists or general-domain language models, which suffer from high false-negative rates for novel obfuscations and cannot determine the source of the plagiarized content. In this paper, we propose Semantic Reconstruction of Adversarial Plagiarism (SRAP), a framework designed not only to detect these anomalies but to mathematically recover the original terminology. We use a two-stage architecture: (1) statistical anomaly detection with a domain-specific masked language model (SciBERT) using token-level pseudo-perplexity, and (2) source-based semantic reconstruction using dense vector retrieval (FAISS) and sentence-level alignment (SBERT). Experiments on a parallel corpus of adversarial scientific text show that while zero-shot baselines fail completely (0.00 percent restoration accuracy), our retrieval-augmented approach achieves 23.67 percent restoration accuracy, significantly outperforming baseline methods. We also show that static decision boundaries are necessary for robust detection in jargon-heavy scientific text, since dynamic thresholding fails under high variance. SRAP enables forensic analysis by linking obfuscated expressions back to their most probable source documents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSRAP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8fd8\u539f\u79d1\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u88ab\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6539\u5199\u5de5\u5177\u751f\u6210\u7684\u201ctortured phrases\u201d\uff0c\u5e76\u6062\u590d\u539f\u59cb\u672f\u8bed\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u6539\u5199\u5de5\u5177\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u201ctortured phrases\u201d\u6765\u63a9\u76d6\u6284\u88ad\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u8bcd\u8868\u6216\u901a\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u800c\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u67b6\u6784\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528SciBERT\u8fdb\u884c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528FAISS\u548cSBERT\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6e90\u6587\u672c\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u8fd8\u539f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u79d1\u5b66\u6587\u672c\u5e73\u884c\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e0a\uff0cSRAP\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8623.67%\u7684\u8fd8\u539f\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SRAP\u901a\u8fc7\u9759\u6001\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u5411\u91cf\u68c0\u7d22\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e76\u8fd8\u539f\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6539\u5199\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u79d1\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u7684\u6eaf\u6e90\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

The 2025 Foundation Model Transparency Index is the third edition of an annual effort to characterize and quantify the transparency of foundation model developers. The 2025 FMTI introduces new indicators related to data acquisition, usage data, and monitoring and evaluates companies like Alibaba, DeepSeek, and xAI for the first time. The 2024 FMTI reported that transparency was improving, but the 2025 FMTI finds this progress has deteriorated: the average score out of 100 fell from 58 in 2024 to 40 in 2025. Companies are most opaque about their training data and training compute as well as the post-deployment usage and impact of their flagship models. In spite of this general trend, IBM stands out as a positive outlier, scoring 95, in contrast to the lowest scorers, xAI and Midjourney, at just 14. The five members of the Frontier Model Forum we score end up in the middle of the Index: we posit that these companies avoid reputational harms from low scores but lack incentives to be transparency leaders.

Utilising a pool of operators instead of a single operator to handle move operations within a neighbourhood remains promising, but an optimum or near optimum sequence of operators necessitates further investigation. One of the promising ideas is to generalise experiences and seek how to utilise it. Although numerous works are done around this issue for single objective optimisation, multi-objective cases have not much been touched in this regard. A generalised approach based on multi-objective reinforcement learning approach seems to create remedy for this issue and offer good solutions.

In traditional generative grammar, systematic contrasts in grammaticality such as subject-auxiliary inversion and the licensing of parasitic gaps are taken as evidence for an internal, hierarchical grammar.

Causal reasoning demands multihop composition and strict conjunctive control, and reliance on spurious lexical relations of the input could provide misleading results. We hypothesize that, due to their ability to project the input into a latent space, encoder and encoder decoder architectures are better suited for said multihop conjunctive reasoning versus decoder only models. To do this, we compare fine-tuned versions of all the aforementioned architectures with zero and few shot ICL in both natural language and non natural language scenarios. We find that ICL alone is insufficient for reliable causal reasoning, often overfocusing on irrelevant input features. In particular, decoder only models are noticeably brittle to distributional shifts, while finetuned encoder and encoder decoder models can generalize more robustly across our tests, including the non natural language split. Both architectures are only matched or surpassed by decoder only architectures at large scales.

Yet, when extended to subjective and open-ended domains such as role play, existing reward models exhibit severe degradation, struggling to capture nuanced and persona-grounded human judgments. To address this gap, we introduce RoleRMBench, the first systematic benchmark for reward modeling in role-playing dialogue, covering seven fine-grained capabilities from narrative management to role consistency and engagement. Evaluation on RoleRMBench reveals large and consistent gaps between general-purpose reward models and human judgment, particularly in narrative and stylistic dimensions. We further propose RoleRM, a reward model trained with Continuous Implicit Preferences (CIP), which reformulates subjective evaluation as continuous consistent pairwise supervision under multiple structuring strategies. Comprehensive experiments show that RoleRM surpasses strong open- and closed-source reward models by over 24% on average, demonstrating substantial gains in narrative coherence and stylistic fidelity.

In this paper, we propose a novel interpretability framework to systematically analyze the internal mechanisms of VLMs, focusing on the functional roles of attention heads in multimodal reasoning. To this end, we introduce CogVision, a dataset that decomposes complex multimodal questions into step-by-step subquestions designed to simulate human reasoning through a chain-of-thought paradigm, with each subquestion associated with specific receptive or cognitive functions such as high-level visual reception and inference. Using a probing-based methodology, we identify attention heads that specialize in these functions and characterize them as functional heads. Our analysis across diverse VLM families reveals that these functional heads are universally sparse, vary in number and distribution across functions, and mediate interactions and hierarchical organization. Furthermore, intervention experiments demonstrate their critical role in multimodal reasoning: removing functional heads leads to performance degradation, while emphasizing them enhances accuracy. These findings provide new insights into the cognitive organization of VLMs and suggest promising directions for designing models with more human-aligned perceptual and reasoning abilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u5728 multimodal reasoning \u4e2d\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u89d2\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1 VLMs \u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u5de5\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\u4ecd\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u8ba4\u77e5\u7ec4\u7ec7\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86 CogVision \u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u9010\u6b65\u7684\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u4e13\u95e8\u6267\u884c\u7279\u5b9a\u8ba4\u77e5\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u529f\u80fd\u5934\u666e\u904d\u7a00\u758f\uff0c\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u5728\u529f\u80fd\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5404\u4e0d\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u8d77\u4e2d\u4ecb\u4f5c\u7528\uff1b\u5e72\u9884\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u53bb\u9664\u529f\u80fd\u5934\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u63ed\u793a\u4e86 VLMs \u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u7ec4\u7ec7\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

By taking aspiration from international standards and Australia's National Framework for AI Assurance initiative, this work demonstrates that trustworthiness can be systematically incorporated (by engineering) into AI systems, ensuring the execution fabric remains verifiable, transparent, reproducible and under meaningful human control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u201cTen Criteria for Trustworthy Orchestration AI\u201d\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5c06\u6cbb\u7406\u5d4c\u5165AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6267\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u91cd\u8981\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u626e\u6f14\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5236\u5ea6\u8d23\u4efb\u4e4b\u95f4\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u4ec5\u9760\u4f26\u7406\u6307\u5bfc\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u67b6\u6784\u5c06\u6cbb\u7406\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6267\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u96c6\u6210\u4eba\u7c7b\u8f93\u5165\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u5ba1\u8ba1\u548c\u6765\u6e90\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u9762\u677f\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u501f\u9274\u56fd\u9645\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a\u56fd\u5bb6AI\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u5021\u8bae\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5de5\u7a0b\u65b9\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u7eb3\u5165AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u786e\u4fddAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6267\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u900f\u660e\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u63a7\u5236\u4e4b\u4e0b\u3002"}}

Using the Serbian language as a case, this study examines the structural, historical, and sociotechnical factors shaping language technology development for low resource languages in the AI age. Drawing on semi structured interviews with ten scholars and practitioners, including linguists, digital humanists, and AI developers, it traces challenges rooted in historical destruction of Serbian textual heritage, intensified by contemporary issues that drive reductive, engineering first approaches prioritizing functionality over linguistic nuance. These include superficial transliteration, reliance on English-trained models, data bias, and dataset curation lacking cultural specificity. To address these challenges, the study proposes Data Care, a framework grounded in CARE principles (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics), that reframes bias mitigation from a post hoc technical fix to an integral component of corpus design, annotation, and governance, and positions Data Care as a replicable model for building inclusive, sustainable, and culturally grounded language technologies in contexts where traditional LLM development reproduces existing power imbalances and cultural blind spots.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86AI\u65f6\u4ee3\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u4ee5\u585e\u5c14\u7ef4\u4e9a\u8bed\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff09\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u3001\u5386\u53f2\u6027\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u6280\u672f\u56e0\u7d20\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eCARE\u539f\u5219\u7684Data Care\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u4ee5\u82f1\u8bed\u7b49\u4e3b\u5bfc\u8bed\u8a00\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5b58\u5728\u6587\u5316\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u504f\u89c1\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u4e9b\u504f\u89c1\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5341\u4f4d\u5b66\u8005\u548c\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u7684\u534a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bbf\u8c08\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u5bb6\u3001\u6570\u5b57\u4eba\u6587\u4e3b\u4e49\u8005\u548cAI\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u585e\u5c14\u7ef4\u4e9a\u8bed\u8a00\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u6311\u6218\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u585e\u5c14\u7ef4\u4e9a\u8bed\u8a00\u6280\u672f\u5f00\u53d1\u9762\u4e34\u5386\u53f2\u6587\u672c\u9057\u4ea7\u7684\u7834\u574f\u3001\u8868\u5c42\u8f6c\u5199\u3001\u5bf9\u82f1\u8bed\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3001\u6570\u636e\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6587\u5316\u7279\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7ba1\u7406\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faData Care\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u504f\u89c1\u7f13\u89e3\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u6ce8\u91ca\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4e3a\u5efa\u7acb\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u6587\u5316\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u590d\u5236\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Regulations such as the European AI Act require identifying and mitigating biases against protected groups in data, with the ultimate goal of preventing unfair model outputs. However, practical guidance and operationalization are lacking. We propose a comprehensive data bias detection and mitigation pipeline comprising four components that address two data bias types, namely representation bias and (explicit) stereotypes for a configurable sensitive attribute. First, we leverage LLM-generated word lists created based on quality criteria to detect relevant group labels. Second, representation bias is quantified using the Demographic Representation Score. Third, we detect and mitigate stereotypes using sociolinguistically informed filtering. Finally, we compensate representation bias through Grammar- and Context-Aware Counterfactual Data Augmentation. We conduct a two-fold evaluation using the examples of gender, religion and age. First, the effectiveness of each individual component on data debiasing is evaluated through human validation and baseline comparison. The findings demonstrate that we successfully reduce representation bias and (explicit) stereotypes in a text dataset. Second, the effect of data debiasing on model bias reduction is evaluated by bias benchmarking of several models (0.6B-8B parameters), fine-tuned on the debiased text dataset. This evaluation reveals that LLMs fine-tuned on debiased data do not consistently show improved performance on bias benchmarks, exposing critical gaps in current evaluation methodologies and highlighting the need for targeted data manipulation to address manifested model bias.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6570\u636e\u504f\u89c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8868\u793a\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u663e\u6027\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u6cd5\u89c4\u8981\u6c42\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u9488\u5bf9\u53d7\u4fdd\u62a4\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u9645\u64cd\u4f5c\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bcd\u8868\u68c0\u6d4b\u76f8\u5173\u7fa4\u4f53\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4eba\u53e3\u8868\u793a\u5206\u6570\u91cf\u5316\u8868\u793a\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u793e\u4f1a\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u8fc7\u6ee4\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u6cd5\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u8865\u507f\u8868\u793a\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u793a\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u663e\u6027\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\uff0c\u4f46\u4f7f\u7528\u53bb\u504f\u89c1\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\u7684LLMs\u5728\u504f\u89c1\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5e76\u672a\u6301\u7eed\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5173\u952e\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u6570\u636e\u64cd\u4f5c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

This advancement is also inseparable from the oversight automated by reliable verifiers. However, current outcome-based verifiers (OVs) are unable to inspect the unreliable intermediate steps in the long reasoning chains of thought (CoTs). Meanwhile, current process-based verifiers (PVs) have difficulties in reliably detecting errors in the complex long CoTs, limited by the scarcity of high-quality annotations due to the prohibitive costs of human annotations. Therefore, we propose the \\textbf{O}utcome-based \\textbf{P}rocess \\textbf{V}erifier (OPV), which verifies the rationale process of summarized outcomes from long CoTs to achieve both accurate and efficient verification and enable large-scale annotation. To empower the proposed verifier, we adopt an iterative active learning framework with expert annotations to progressively improve the verification capability of OPV with fewer annotation costs. Specifically, in each iteration, the most uncertain cases of the current best OPV are annotated and then subsequently used to train a new OPV through Rejection Fine-Tuning (RFT) and RLVR for the next round. Extensive experiments demonstrate OPV's superior performance and broad applicability.

General Scene Adaptation for VLN (GSA-VLN) shifts the focus from zero-shot generalization to continual, environment-specific adaptation, narrowing the gap between static benchmarks and real-world deployment. However, current GSA-VLN frameworks exclude user feedback, relying solely on unsupervised adaptation from repeated environmental exposure. In practice, user feedback offers natural and valuable supervision that can significantly enhance adaptation quality. We introduce a user-feedback-driven adaptation framework that extends GSA-VLN by systematically integrating human interactions into continual learning. Our approach converts user feedback-navigation instructions and corrective signals-into high-quality, environment-aligned training data, enabling efficient and realistic adaptation. A memory-bank warm-start mechanism further reuses previously acquired environmental knowledge, mitigating cold-start degradation and ensuring stable redeployment. Experiments on the GSA-R2R benchmark show that our method consistently surpasses strong baselines such as GR-DUET, improving navigation success and path efficiency. The memory-bank warm start stabilizes early navigation and reduces performance drops after updates. Results under both continual and hybrid adaptation settings confirm the robustness and generality of our framework, demonstrating sustained improvement across diverse deployment conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u7684GSA-VLN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e93\u9884\u70ed\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5bfc\u822a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684GSA-VLN\u6846\u67b6\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u9002\u5e94\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9d\u8d35\u4e14\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9002\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\uff08\u5bfc\u822a\u6307\u4ee4\u548c\u7ea0\u6b63\u4fe1\u53f7\uff09\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u73af\u5883\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e93\u9884\u70ed\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u91cd\u7528\u5148\u524d\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u73af\u5883\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "result": "\u5728GSA-R2R\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6301\u7eed\u8d85\u8d8a\u5982GR-DUET\u7b49\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5bfc\u822a\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e93\u9884\u70ed\u673a\u5236\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e86\u65e9\u671f\u5bfc\u822a\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u9002\u5e94\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u90e8\u7f72\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4e3aVLN\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We present TRIDENT (Transcription and Routing Intelligence for Dispatcher-Empowered National Triage), a three-layer dispatcher-support architecture designed to structure emergency call inputs for human application of established triage protocols (the ESI for routine operations and START for mass casualty events), even when automatic speech recognition fails.\n  The system combines Caribbean-accent-tuned ASR, local entity extraction via large language models, and bio-acoustic distress detection to provide dispatchers with three complementary signals: transcription confidence, structured clinical entities, and vocal stress indicators. Our key insight is that low ASR confidence, rather than representing system failure, serves as a valuable queue prioritization signal -- particularly when combined with elevated vocal distress markers indicating a caller in crisis whose speech may have shifted toward basilectal registers. A complementary insight drives the entity extraction layer: trained responders and composed bystanders may report life-threatening emergencies without elevated vocal stress, requiring semantic analysis to capture clinical indicators that paralinguistic features miss.\n  We describe the architectural design, theoretical grounding in psycholinguistic research on stress-induced code-switching, and deployment considerations for offline operation during disaster scenarios.

A widely used approach is the ratio-of-densities method, which defines a time-indexed target path by reweighting probability-density trajectories from multiple models with positive, or in some cases, negative exponents. This construction, however, harbors a critical and previously unformalized failure mode: Marginal Path Collapse, where intermediate densities become non-normalizable even though endpoints remain valid. Collapse arises systematically when composing heterogeneous models trained on different noise schedules or datasets, including a common setting in molecular design where de-novo, conformer, and pocket-conditioned models must be combined for tasks such as flexible-pose scaffold decoration. We provide a novel and complete solution for the problem. First, we derive a simple path existence criterion that predicts exactly when collapse occurs from noise schedules and exponents alone. Second, we introduce Adaptive path Correction with Exponents (ACE), which extends Feynman-Kac steering to time-varying exponents and guarantees a valid probability path. On a synthetic 2D benchmark and on flexible-pose scaffold decoration, ACE eliminates collapse and enables high-guidance compositional generation, improving distributional and docking metrics over constant-exponent baselines and even specialized task-specific scaffold decoration models.

This advancement is also inseparable from the oversight automated by reliable verifiers. However, current outcome-based verifiers (OVs) are unable to inspect the unreliable intermediate steps in the long reasoning chains of thought (CoTs). Meanwhile, current process-based verifiers (PVs) have difficulties in reliably detecting errors in the complex long CoTs, limited by the scarcity of high-quality annotations due to the prohibitive costs of human annotations. Therefore, we propose the Outcome-based Process Verifier (OPV), which verifies the rationale process of summarized outcomes from long CoTs to achieve both accurate and efficient verification and enable large-scale annotation. To empower the proposed verifier, we adopt an iterative active learning framework with expert annotations to progressively improve the verification capability of OPV with fewer annotation costs. Specifically, in each iteration, the most uncertain cases of the current best OPV are annotated and then subsequently used to train a new OPV through Rejection Fine-Tuning (RFT) and RLVR for the next round. Extensive experiments demonstrate OPV's superior performance and broad applicability. It achieves new state-of-the-art results on our held-out OPV-Bench, outperforming much larger open-source models such as Qwen3-Max-Preview with an F1 score of 83.1 compared to 76.3. Furthermore, OPV effectively detects false positives within synthetic dataset, closely align with expert assessment.

Federated unlearning has therefore emerged as a research frontier, aiming to remove a specific party's contribution from the learned model while preserving the utility of the remaining parties. However, most unlearning techniques focus on Horizontal Federated Learning (HFL), where data are partitioned by samples. In contrast, Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) allows organizations that possess complementary feature spaces to train a joint model without sharing raw data. The resulting feature-partitioned architecture renders HFL-oriented unlearning methods ineffective. In this paper, we propose REMISVFU, a plug-and-play representation misdirection framework that enables fast, client-level unlearning in splitVFL systems. When a deletion request arrives, the forgetting party collapses its encoder output to a randomly sampled anchor on the unit sphere, severing the statistical link between its features and the global model. To maintain utility for the remaining parties, the server jointly optimizes a retention loss and a forgetting loss, aligning their gradients via orthogonal projection to eliminate destructive interference.

Massively multilingual models still underperform compared to language-specific adaptations, especially at smaller model scales. In this work, we investigate scaling as an efficient strategy for adapting pretrained models to new target languages. Through comprehensive scaling ablations with approximately FLOP-matched models, we test whether upscaling an English base model enables more effective and resource-efficient adaptation than standard continued pretraining. We find that, once exposed to sufficient target-language data, larger upscaled models can match or surpass the performance of smaller models continually pretrained on much more data, demonstrating the benefits of scaling for data efficiency. Scaling also helps preserve the base model's capabilities in English, thus reducing catastrophic forgetting.

Existing methods often overlook this dynamic process, typically assuming that emerging items have few or even no historical interactions. Such an assumption oversimplifies the problem, as a good model must preserve the uniqueness of emerging items while leveraging their shared patterns with established ones. To address this challenge, we propose EmerFlow, a novel LLM-empowered representation learning framework that generates distinctive embeddings for emerging items. It first enriches the raw features of emerging items through LLM reasoning, then aligns these representations with the embedding space of the existing recommendation model. Finally, new interactions are incorporated through meta-learning to refine the embeddings. This enables EmerFlow to learn expressive embeddings for emerging items from only limited interactions. Extensive experiments across diverse domains, including movies and pharmaceuticals, show that EmerFlow consistently outperforms existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aEmerFlow\u7684LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b0\u5174\u7269\u54c1\u63a8\u8350\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u6027\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u8868\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u65b0\u5174\u7269\u54c1\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u7d2f\u79ef\u4e92\u52a8\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5047\u8bbe\u65b0\u5174\u7269\u54c1\u51e0\u4e4e\u6ca1\u6709\u5386\u53f2\u4e92\u52a8\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5047\u8bbe\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7b80\u5316\u3002", "method": "EmerFlow\u5229\u7528LLM\u63a8\u7406\u4e30\u5bcc\u65b0\u5174\u7269\u54c1\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u6574\u5408\u65b0\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u5d4c\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u7535\u5f71\u548c\u533b\u836f\uff09\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cEmerFlow\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "EmerFlow\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u6709\u9650\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u4e2d\u4e3a\u65b0\u5174\u7269\u54c1\u5b66\u4e60\u5bcc\u6709\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u3002"}}

In many such settings, speakers of Indian languages frequently communicate using romanized text rather than native scripts, yet existing research rarely evaluates this orthographic variation using real-world data. We investigate how romanization impacts the reliability of LLMs in a critical domain: maternal and newborn healthcare triage. We benchmark leading LLMs on a real-world dataset of user-generated queries spanning five Indian languages and Nepali. Our results reveal consistent degradation in performance for romanized messages, with F1 scores trailing those of native scripts by 5-12 points. At our partner maternal health organization in India, this gap could cause nearly 2 million excess errors in triage. Crucially, this performance gap by scripts is not due to a failure in clinical reasoning. We demonstrate that LLMs often correctly infer the semantic intent of romanized queries. Nevertheless, their final classification outputs remain brittle in the presence of orthographic noise in romanized inputs.

Considering existing RL- based finetuning methods, entropy intervention turns out to be an effective way to benefit exploratory ability, thereby improving policy performance. Notably, most existing stud- ies intervene in entropy by simply controlling the update of specific tokens during policy optimization of RL. They ig- nore the entropy intervention during the RL sampling that can boost the performance of GRPO by improving the di- versity of responses. In this paper, we propose Selective- adversarial Entropy Intervention, namely SaEI, which en- hances policy entropy by distorting the visual input with the token-selective adversarial objective coming from the en- tropy of sampled responses. Specifically, we first propose entropy-guided adversarial sampling (EgAS) that formu- lates the entropy of sampled responses as an adversarial ob- jective. Then, the corresponding adversarial gradient can be used to attack the visual input for producing adversarial samples, allowing the policy model to explore a larger an- swer space during RL sampling. Then, we propose token- selective entropy computation (TsEC) to maximize the ef- fectiveness of adversarial attack in EgAS without distorting factual knowledge within VLMs. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets show that our proposed method can greatly improve policy exploration via entropy intervention, to boost reasoning capabilities.

The package provides a simple high-level interface (AutoFusionClassifier) that trains the full pipeline end-to-end with minimal configuration, and a flexible API for advanced users. Under the hood, LabelFusion integrates vector signals from both sources by concatenating the ML backbone's embeddings with the LLM-derived per-class scores -- obtained through structured prompt-engineering strategies -- and feeds this joint representation into a compact multi-layer perceptron (FusionMLP) that produces the final prediction. This learned fusion approach captures complementary strengths of LLM reasoning and traditional transformer-based classifiers, yielding robust performance across domains -- achieving 92.4% accuracy on AG News and 92.3% on 10-class Reuters 21578 topic classification -- while enabling practical trade-offs between accuracy, latency, and cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "LabelFusion\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u96c6\u6210\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff08\u5982RoBERTa\uff09\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u591a\u7c7b\u548c\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4f20\u7edftransformer-based\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u6210\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "method": "LabelFusion\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06ML\u4e3b\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u7b56\u7565\u83b7\u5f97\u7684LLM\u6bcf\u7c7b\u5f97\u5206\u8fdb\u884c\u62fc\u63a5\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8be5\u8054\u5408\u8868\u793a\u9001\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u5668\uff08FusionMLP\uff09\u6765\u751f\u6210\u6700\u7ec8\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728AG News\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523092.4%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u572810\u7c7bReuters 21578\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523092.3%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "LabelFusion\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u878d\u5408\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u548cLLM\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5141\u8bb8\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u6210\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9645\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

This formulation is the foundation of most algebraic and computational approaches to graph processing. The advent of deep learning language models offers a wide range of powerful computational models that are specialized in the processing of text. However, current procedures to represent graphs are not amenable to processing by these models. In this work, a new method to represent graphs is proposed. It represents the adjacency matrix of a graph by a string of simple instructions. The instructions build the adjacency matrix step by step. The transformation is reversible, i.e. given a graph the string can be produced and vice versa. The proposed representation is compact and it maintains the local structural patterns of the graph.

Current protection methods are limited to passively degrading image quality, failing to achieve stable control. While Targeted Data Protection (TDP) offers a promising paradigm for active redirection toward user-specified target concepts, existing TDP attempts suffer from poor controllability due to snapshot-matching approaches that fail to account for complete learning dynamics. We introduce TAFAP (Trajectory Alignment via Fine-tuning with Adversarial Perturbations), the first method to successfully achieve effective TDP by controlling the entire training trajectory. Unlike snapshot-based methods whose protective influence is easily diluted as training progresses, TAFAP employs trajectory-matching inspired by dataset distillation to enforce persistent, verifiable transformations throughout fine-tuning. We validate our method through extensive experiments, demonstrating the first successful targeted transformation in diffusion models with simultaneous control over both identity and visual patterns.

However, due to weak heuristics for auxiliary constructions, AI for geometry problem solving remains dominated by expert models such as AlphaGeometry 2, which rely heavily on large-scale data synthesis and search for both training and evaluation. In this work, we make the first attempt to build a medalist-level LLM agent for geometry and present InternGeometry. InternGeometry overcomes the heuristic limitations in geometry by iteratively proposing propositions and auxiliary constructions, verifying them with a symbolic engine, and reflecting on the engine's feedback to guide subsequent proposals. A dynamic memory mechanism enables InternGeometry to conduct more than two hundred interactions with the symbolic engine per problem. To further accelerate learning, we introduce Complexity-Boosting Reinforcement Learning (CBRL), which gradually increases the complexity of synthesized problems across training stages. Built on InternThinker-32B, InternGeometry solves 44 of 50 IMO geometry problems (2000-2024), exceeding the average gold medalist score (40.9), using only 13K training examples, just 0.004% of the data used by AlphaGeometry 2, demonstrating the potential of LLM agents on expert-level geometry tasks.

Traditional design methodologies that blend human expertise with specialized simulation tools scale poorly with the increasing system complexity. Recent studies adopt generative artificial intelligence to design plausible human-centric indoor layouts. However, they do not consider the underlying physics, making them unsuitable for the DC design that sets quantifiable operational objectives and strict physical constraints. To bridge the gap, we propose Phythesis, a novel framework that synergizes large language models (LLMs) and physics-guided evolutionary optimization to automate simulation-ready (SimReady) scene synthesis for energy-efficient DC design. Phythesis employs an iterative bi-level optimization architecture, where (i) the LLM-driven optimization level generates physically plausible three-dimensional layouts and self-criticizes them to refine the scene topology, and (ii) the physics-informed optimization level identifies the optimal asset parameters and selects the best asset combination. Experiments on three generation scales show that Phythesis achieves 57.3% generation success rate increase and 11.5% power usage effectiveness (PUE) improvement, compared with the vanilla LLM-based solution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPhythesis\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u548c\u7269\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u8fdb\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8282\u80fd\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u590d\u6742\u6027\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u8003\u8651\u57fa\u7840\u7269\u7406\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "Phythesis\u91c7\u7528\u8fed\u4ee3\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u67b6\u6784\uff0cLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u6210\u4e09\u7ef4\u5e03\u5c40\u5e76\u81ea\u6211\u6279\u8bc4\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u7269\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u4f18\u5316\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u4f73\u8d44\u4ea7\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u751f\u6210\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\uff0cPhythesis\u76f8\u6bd4\u7eafLLM\u65b9\u6848\u751f\u6210\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u9ad857.3%\uff0c\u529f\u8017\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u9ad811.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "Phythesis\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408LLMs\u548c\u7269\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u751f\u6210\u8282\u80fd\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

Although a range of clustering methods have been developed, most focus exclusively on intrinsic cellular structure and ignore the pivotal role of cell-gene associations, which limits their ability to distinguish closely related cell types. To this end, we propose a Refinement Contrastive Learning framework (scRCL) that explicitly incorporates cell-gene interactions to derive more informative representations. Specifically, we introduce two contrastive distribution alignment components that reveal reliable intrinsic cellular structures by effectively exploiting cell-cell structural relationships. Additionally, we develop a refinement module that integrates gene-correlation structure learning to enhance cell embeddings by capturing underlying cell-gene associations. This module strengthens connections between cells and their associated genes, refining the representation learning to exploiting biologically meaningful relationships. Extensive experiments on several single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in cell-type identification accuracy. Moreover, downstream biological analyses confirm that the recovered cell populations exhibit coherent gene-expression signatures, further validating the biological relevance of our approach.

Prior corrective approaches, such as Self-RAG, CRAG, and Adaptive-$k$, typically address this by \\textit{adding} more context or pruning existing lists.

We propose \\textbf{SEAL-RAG}, a training-free controller that adopts a \\textbf{``replace, don't expand''} strategy to fight context dilution under a fixed retrieval depth $k$.

We evaluate SEAL-RAG against faithful re-implementations of Basic RAG, CRAG, Self-RAG, and Adaptive-$k$ in a shared environment on \\textbf{HotpotQA} and \\textbf{2WikiMultiHopQA}. On HotpotQA ($k=3$), SEAL improves answer correctness by \\textbf{+3--13 pp} and evidence precision by \\textbf{+12--18 pp} over Self-RAG.

The results show that value diversity enhances value stability, fosters emergent behaviors, and brings more creative principles developed by the agents themselves without external guidance. However, these effects also show diminishing returns: extreme heterogeneity induces instability.

However, millions use LLMs for personal advice on high-stakes topics like finance and health, where harms are context-dependent rather than universal. While frameworks like the OECD's AI classification recognize the need to assess individual risks, user-welfare safety evaluations remain underdeveloped. We argue that developing such evaluations is non-trivial due to fundamental questions about accounting for user context in evaluation design. In this exploratory study, we evaluated advice on finance and health from GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro across user profiles of varying vulnerability. First, we demonstrate that evaluators must have access to rich user context: identical LLM responses were rated significantly safer by context-blind evaluators than by those aware of user circumstances, with safety scores for high-vulnerability users dropping from safe (5/7) to somewhat unsafe (3/7). One might assume this gap could be addressed by creating realistic user prompts containing key contextual information. However, our second study challenges this: we rerun the evaluation on prompts containing context users report they would disclose, finding no significant improvement. Our work establishes that effective user-welfare safety evaluation requires evaluators to assess responses against diverse user profiles, as realistic user context disclosure alone proves insufficient, particularly for vulnerable populations. By demonstrating a methodology for context-aware evaluation, this study provides both a starting point for such assessments and foundational evidence that evaluating individual welfare demands approaches distinct from existing universal-risk frameworks.

In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) can incorporate task-specific feedback, and its combination with explicit intermediate reasoning (\"thinking\") has demonstrated substantial gains on verifiable math and coding tasks. To investigate the effects of RL and thinking in a CXR VLM, we perform large-scale SFT on CXR data to build an updated RadVLM based on Qwen3-VL, followed by a cold-start SFT stage that equips the model with basic thinking ability. We then apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with clinically grounded, task-specific rewards for report generation and visual grounding, and run matched RL experiments on both domain-specific and general-domain Qwen3-VL variants, with and without thinking. Across these settings, we find that while strong SFT remains crucial for high base performance, RL provides additional gains on both tasks, whereas explicit thinking does not appear to further improve results. Under a unified evaluation pipeline, the RL-optimized RadVLM models outperform their baseline counterparts and reach state-of-the-art performance on both report generation and grounding, highlighting clinically aligned RL as a powerful complement to SFT for medical VLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u5bf9\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bb8\u591a\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u7ed3\u5408\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eQwen3-VL\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21SFT\u6784\u5efaRadVLM\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5f15\u5165\u51b7\u542f\u52a8SFT\u9636\u6bb5\u8d4b\u4e88\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u63a5\u7740\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5e26\u4e34\u5e8a\u4f9d\u636e\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u5956\u52b1\u8fdb\u884cGRPO\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u548c\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57dfQwen3-VL\u53d8\u4f53\u4e0a\u8fd0\u884cRL\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5f3a\u5927\u7684SFT\u5bf9\u57fa\u7840\u6027\u80fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46RL\u5728\u4e24\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u989d\u5916\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u800c\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u672a\u5e26\u6765\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e0b\uff0cRL\u4f18\u5316\u7684RadVLM\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684RL\u4f5c\u4e3aSFT\u7684\u6709\u529b\u8865\u5145\u3002"}}

General-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) shows promise but lacks domain-specific reliability. We evaluated the performance of CA-GPT, a novel large model deployed on an AI-OCT system, against that of the general-purpose ChatGPT-5 and junior physicians for OCT-guided PCI planning and assessment.\n  Methods: In this single-center analysis of 96 patients who underwent OCT-guided PCI, the procedural decisions generated by the CA-GPT, ChatGPT-5, and junior physicians were compared with an expert-derived procedural record. Agreement was assessed using ten pre-specified metrics across pre-PCI and post-PCI phases.\n  Results: For pre-PCI planning, CA-GPT demonstrated significantly higher median agreement scores (5[IQR 3.75-5]) compared to both ChatGPT-5 (3[2-4], P<0.001) and junior physicians (4[3-4], P<0.001). CA-GPT significantly outperformed ChatGPT-5 across all individual pre-PCI metrics and showed superior performance to junior physicians in stent diameter (90.3% vs. 72.2%, P<0.05) and length selection (80.6% vs. 52.8%, P<0.01). In post-PCI assessment, CA-GPT maintained excellent overall agreement (5[4.75-5]), significantly higher than both ChatGPT-5 (4[4-5], P<0.001) and junior physicians (5[4-5], P<0.05).

In realistic scenarios, variations across individuals, devices, environments, and time introduce significant distributional shifts for the same activities. Recent efforts attempt to solve this challenge by applying or adapting existing out-of-distribution (OOD) algorithms, but only in certain distribution shift scenarios (e.g., cross-device or cross-position), lacking comprehensive insights on the effectiveness of these algorithms. For instance, is OOD necessary to HAR? Which OOD algorithm performs the best? In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing HAROOD, a comprehensive benchmark for HAR in OOD settings. We define 4 OOD scenarios: cross-person, cross-position, cross-dataset, and cross-time, and build a testbed covering 6 datasets, 16 comparative methods (implemented with CNN-based and Transformer-based architectures), and two model selection protocols. Then, we conduct extensive experiments and present several findings for future research, e.g., no single method consistently outperforms others, highlighting substantial opportunity for advancement. Our codebase is highly modular and easy to extend for new datasets, algorithms, comparisons, and analysis, with the hope to facilitate the research in OOD-based HAR.

Existing human-in-the-loop approaches typically assume users begin with a clear, stable concept understanding to be able to provide high-quality supervision. In reality, users often start with a vague idea and must iteratively refine it through \"concept deliberation\", a practice we uncovered through structured interviews with content moderation experts. We operationalize the common strategies in deliberation used by real content moderators into a human-in-the-loop framework called \"Agile Deliberation\" that explicitly supports evolving and subjective concepts. The system supports users in defining the concept for themselves by exposing them to borderline cases. The system does this with two deliberation stages: (1) concept scoping, which decomposes the initial concept into a structured hierarchy of sub-concepts, and (2) concept iteration, which surfaces semantically borderline examples for user reflection and feedback to iteratively align an image classifier with the user's evolving intent. Since concept deliberation is inherently subjective and interactive, we painstakingly evaluate the framework through 18 user sessions, each 1.5h long, rather than standard benchmarking datasets. We find that Agile Deliberation achieves 7.5% higher F1 scores than automated decomposition baselines and more than 3% higher than manual deliberation, while participants reported clearer conceptual understanding and lower cognitive effort.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u201cAgile Deliberation\u201d\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u5ff5\u754c\u5b9a\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7528\u6237\u9010\u6b65\u660e\u786e\u4e3b\u89c2\u6982\u5ff5\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5728\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u4e2d\u5047\u8bbe\u7528\u6237\u4e00\u5f00\u59cb\u5c31\u6709\u6e05\u6670\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u7528\u6237\u901a\u5e38\u4ece\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u60f3\u6cd5\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u53cd\u590d\u4fee\u6b63\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bbf\u8c08\u5185\u5bb9\u5ba1\u6838\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u5c06\u5b9e\u9645\u5ba1\u6838\u5458\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316\u4e3a\u201cAgile Deliberation\u201d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6982\u5ff5\u754c\u5b9a\uff08\u5206\u89e3\u6982\u5ff5\u4e3a\u5b50\u6982\u5ff5\uff09\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\u8fed\u4ee3\uff08\u5c55\u793a\u8fb9\u754c\u6848\u4f8b\u4f9b\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc718\u4e2a\u7528\u6237\u4f1a\u8bdd\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4f1a\u8bdd1.5\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0cAgile Deliberation\u6bd4\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5206\u89e3\u57fa\u7ebf\u9ad87.5%\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u6bd4\u624b\u52a8\u5ba1\u8bae\u9ad83%\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u62a5\u544a\u6982\u5ff5\u7406\u89e3\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u4e14\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u62c5\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "Agile Deliberation\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u7528\u6237\u660e\u786e\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002"}}

While existing Safe Offline RL methods typically enforce soft expected-cost constraints, they do not guarantee forward invariance. Conversely, Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) provide rigorous safety guarantees but usually depend on expert-designed barrier functions or full knowledge of the system dynamics. We introduce Value-Guided Offline Control Barrier Functions (V-OCBF), a framework that learns a neural CBF entirely from offline demonstrations. Unlike prior approaches, V-OCBF does not assume access to the dynamics model; instead, it derives a recursive finite-difference barrier update, enabling model-free learning of a barrier that propagates safety information over time. Moreover, V-OCBF incorporates an expectile-based objective that avoids querying the barrier on out-of-distribution actions and restricts updates to the dataset-supported action set. The learned barrier is then used with a Quadratic Program (QP) formulation to synthesize real-time safe control. Across multiple case studies, V-OCBF yields substantially fewer safety violations than baseline methods while maintaining strong task performance, highlighting its scalability for offline synthesis of safety-critical controllers without online interaction or hand-engineered barriers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u5728\u7ebf\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5c4f\u969c\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6V-OCBF\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u795e\u7ecf\u63a7\u5236\u5c4f\u969c\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u6267\u884c\u8f6f\u6027\u671f\u671b\u6210\u672c\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u524d\u5411\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff1b\u800cCBFs\u867d\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e25\u683c\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6216\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5c4f\u969c\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165V-OCBF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9012\u5f52\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u5c4f\u969c\u66f4\u65b0\u4ece\u79bb\u7ebf\u793a\u8303\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u795e\u7ecfCBF\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408expectile-based\u76ee\u6807\u907f\u514d\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u4e8c\u6b21\u89c4\u5212(QP)\u5408\u6210\u5b9e\u65f6\u5b89\u5168\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0cV-OCBF\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5b89\u5168\u8fdd\u89c4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5728\u7ebf\u4ea4\u4e92\u6216\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5c4f\u969c\u3002", "conclusion": "V-OCBF\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u3001\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u3002"}}

It implements a multi-agent system consisting of two agents: an adult language model and a daughter language model that aims to learn the mother language. Crucially, the daughter agent does not have access to the internal knowledge of the mother language model but only to the language exemplars the mother agent generates. These experiments illustrate how this system can be used to acquire abstract grammatical knowledge. We demonstrate how statistical analyses of patterns in the input data corresponding to grammatical categories yield discrete grammatical rules. These rules are subsequently added to the grammatical knowledge of the daughter language model. To this end, hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis was applied to the utterances consecutively generated by the mother language model. It is argued that this procedure can be used to acquire structures resembling grammatical categories proposed by linguists for natural languages. Thus, it is established that non-trivial grammatical knowledge has been acquired. Moreover, the parameter configuration of this computational laboratory environment determined using training data generated by the mother language model is validated in a second experiment with a test set similarly resulting in the acquisition of non-trivial categories.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u4e60\u5f97\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u6f14\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u83b7\u5f97\u62bd\u8c61\u8bed\u6cd5\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u6210\u4eba\u548c\u513f\u7ae5\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u8bed\u8a00\u4e60\u5f97\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u62bd\u8c61\u8bed\u6cd5\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u83b7\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7531\u6210\u4eba\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5973\u513f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5973\u513f\u6a21\u578b\u53ea\u80fd\u8bbf\u95ee\u7531\u6bcd\u4eb2\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u8fd0\u7528\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5c42\u6b21\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u6790\u6765\u63d0\u53d6\u8bed\u6cd5\u89c4\u5219\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u6b21\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u63d0\u53d6\u4e86\u79bb\u6563\u7684\u8bed\u6cd5\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e5f\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u7684\u8bed\u6cd5\u7c7b\u522b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u83b7\u53d6\u7c7b\u4f3c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u8bed\u6cd5\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8bc1\u660e\u53ef\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u7684\u8bed\u6cd5\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002"}}
