However, current methods often suffer from\na geometric inconsistency problem by focusing exclusively on matching\nuser-defined points, neglecting the broader geometry and leading to artifacts\nor unstable edits. We propose FlowDrag, which leverages geometric information\nfor more accurate and coherent transformations. Our approach constructs a 3D\nmesh from the image, using an energy function to guide mesh deformation based\non user-defined drag points. The resulting mesh displacements are projected\ninto 2D and incorporated into a UNet denoising process, enabling precise\nhandle-to-target point alignment while preserving structural integrity.\nAdditionally, existing drag-editing benchmarks provide no ground truth, making\nit difficult to assess how accurately the edits match the intended\ntransformations. To address this, we present VFD (VidFrameDrag) benchmark\ndataset, which provides ground-truth frames using consecutive shots in a video\ndataset. FlowDrag outperforms existing drag-based editing methods on both VFD\nBench and DragBench."}

Other\nmethods rely on heuristic-based selective derivations, which are generally more\ncomputationally efficient, but lack a justification and provide no guarantees\nof preserving the information provided to and returned by the reasoner. Taking\ninspiration from multi-hop symbolic reasoning, this paper proposes a\nparametrized family of grounding methods generalizing classic Backward\nChaining. Different selections within this family allow us to obtain commonly\nemployed grounding methods as special cases, and to control the trade-off\nbetween expressiveness and scalability of the reasoner. The experimental\nresults show that the selection of the grounding criterion is often as\nimportant as the NeSy method itself."}

However,\nthe improvement in resolution leads to increased discrepancies in scattering\ncharacteristics, posing challenges to the generalization ability of target\ndetection models. While domain adaptation technology is a potential solution,\nthe inevitable discrepancies caused by resolution differences often lead to\nblind feature adaptation and unreliable semantic propagation, ultimately\ndegrading the domain adaptation performance. To address these challenges, this\npaper proposes a novel SAR target detection method (termed CR-Net), that\nincorporates structure priors and evidential learning theory into the detection\nmodel, enabling reliable domain adaptation for cross-resolution detection. To\nbe specific, CR-Net integrates Structure-induced Hierarchical Feature\nAdaptation (SHFA) and Reliable Structural Adjacency Alignment (RSAA). SHFA\nmodule is introduced to establish structural correlations between targets and\nachieve structure-aware feature adaptation, thereby enhancing the\ninterpretability of the feature adaptation process. Afterwards, the RSAA module\nis proposed to enhance reliable semantic alignment, by leveraging the secure\nadjacency set to transfer valuable discriminative knowledge from the source\ndomain to the target domain. This further improves the discriminability of the\ndetection model in the target domain. Based on experimental results from\ndifferent-resolution datasets,the proposed CR-Net significantly enhances\ncross-resolution adaptation by preserving intra-domain structures and improving\ndiscriminability. It achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in\ncross-resolution SAR target detection."}

Meanwhile, we use the\ntransformed images obtained through coarse-grained and fine-grained frequency\ndecomposition as inputs, introducing multi-grained information. Furthermore, a\nfeatures angle-norm disentanglement loss is designed to constrain the generated\nstegos closer to covers in the angle and norm space of the steganalyzer's\nclassified features. Consequently, small yet effective adversarial\nperturbations can be injected into the process of generating stegos, ensuring\nthat stegos maintain favorable secret restorability and imperceptibility.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that MRAG can achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance."}

Existing acceleration methods primarily exploit the\ntemporal dimension such as reusing cached features across diffusion timesteps.\nHere, we propose Region-Adaptive Latent Upsampling (RALU), a training-free\nframework that accelerates inference along spatial dimension. RALU performs\nmixed-resolution sampling across three stages: 1) low-resolution denoising\nlatent diffusion to efficiently capture global semantic structure, 2)\nregion-adaptive upsampling on specific regions prone to artifacts at\nfull-resolution, and 3) all latent upsampling at full-resolution for detail\nrefinement.

One way to address this is by compressing the KV\ncache, which can be done either with knowledge of the question being asked\n(query-aware) or without knowledge of the query (query-agnostic).

Such a\nformulation eliminates the need for designing specialized unified architectures\nor task-specific ensemble models. Instead, it achieves multi-task integration\nby endowing displacement estimation algorithms with unprecedented\ngeneralization capabilities.

Moreover, they exhibit limited\nadaptability to real-time knowledge updates due to their static integration\nframeworks. To address these issues, we introduce the first test-time\nKG-augmented framework for LLMs, built around a dedicated knowledge\ngraph-guided attention (KGA) module that enables dynamic knowledge fusion\nwithout any parameter updates. The proposed KGA module augments the standard\nself-attention mechanism with two synergistic pathways: outward and inward\naggregation. Specifically, the outward pathway dynamically integrates external\nknowledge into input representations via input-driven KG fusion. This inward\naggregation complements the outward pathway by refining input representations\nthrough KG-guided filtering, suppressing task-irrelevant signals and amplifying\nknowledge-relevant patterns. Importantly, while the outward pathway handles\nknowledge fusion, the inward path selects the most relevant triples and feeds\nthem back into the fusion process, forming a closed-loop enhancement mechanism.\nBy synergistically combining these two pathways, the proposed method supports\nreal-time knowledge fusion exclusively at test-time, without any parameter\nmodification.

The proposed KGA module augments the standard\nself-attention mechanism with two synergistic pathways: outward and inward\naggregation.

This inward\naggregation complements the outward pathway by refining input representations\nthrough KG-guided filtering, suppressing task-irrelevant signals and amplifying\nknowledge-relevant patterns.

However, existing deep learning-based methods face two\nmajor challenges: 1) They predominantly adopt a flat classification paradigm,\nwhich limits their ability to generate end-to-end multi-granularity\nhierarchical predictions aligned with tree-structured hierarchies used in\npractice. 2) Most cross-domain studies focus on performance degradation caused\nby sensor or scene variations, with limited attention to transferring LCLU\nmodels to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous hierarchies (e.g., LCLU to crop\nclassification). These limitations hinder the flexibility and generalization of\nLCLU models in practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose\nHieraRS, a novel hierarchical interpretation paradigm that enables\nmulti-granularity predictions and supports the efficient transfer of LCLU\nmodels to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous tree-structured hierarchies. We\nintroduce the Bidirectional Hierarchical Consistency Constraint Mechanism\n(BHCCM), which can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream flat classification\nmodels to generate hierarchical predictions, while improving both semantic\nconsistency and classification accuracy.

TransLU supports dynamic category expansion and facilitates the\neffective adaptation of LCLU models to heterogeneous hierarchies.
