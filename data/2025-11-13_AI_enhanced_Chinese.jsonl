It is a tremendously powerful tool for describing and solving combinatorial problems. Like any other language, ASP requires users to learn how it works and the syntax involved. It is becoming increasingly required for those unfamiliar with programming languages to interact with code. This paper proposes a novel method of translating unconstrained English into ASP programs for logic puzzles using an LLM and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs. Everything from ASP rules, facts, and constraints is generated to fully represent and solve the desired problem. Example logic puzzles are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the system. While most current methods rely entirely on an LLM, our system minimizes the role of the LLM only to complete straightforward tasks. The LLM is used to simplify natural language sentences, identify keywords, and generate simple facts. The AMR graphs are then parsed from simplified language and used to generate ASP constraints systematically. The system successfully creates an entire ASP program that solves a combinatorial logic problem. This approach is a significant first step in creating a lighter-weight, explainable system that converts natural language to solve complex logic problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u82f1\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6210ASP\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u548cAMR\u56fe\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u903b\u8f91\u8c1c\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u8ba9\u4e0d\u719f\u6089\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u7528\u6237\u80fd\u591f\u4e0e\u4ee3\u7801\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u7b80\u5316\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u53e5\u5b50\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u5b57\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5229\u7528AMR\u56fe\u89e3\u6790\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u5730\u751f\u6210ASP\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u529f\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u7684ASP\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u51b3\u7ec4\u5408\u903b\u8f91\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u521b\u5efa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8f6c\u6362\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u9762\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u521d\u6b65\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002"}}

Inspired by methods for modelling human intelligence spanning neuroscience to psychology, we propose a cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver. Our solver integrates System 1 intuitions with System 2 reasoning in an efficient and interpretable process using neurosymbolic methods based on Vector Symbolic Algebras (VSAs). Our solver works by object-centric program synthesis, leveraging VSAs to represent abstract objects, guide solution search, and enable sample-efficient neural learning. Preliminary results indicate success, with our solver scoring 10.8% on ARC-AGI-1-Train and 3.0% on ARC-AGI-1-Eval. Additionally, our solver performs well on simpler benchmarks, scoring 94.5% on Sort-of-ARC and 83.1% on 1D-ARC -- the latter outperforming GPT-4 at a tiny fraction of the computational cost.

We challenge this paradigm by asking: what if we explicitly architected RL systems as inference engines that can answer diverse queries about their environment? In deterministic settings, trained agents implicitly encode rich knowledge about reachability, distances, values, and dynamics - yet current architectures are not designed to expose this information efficiently. We introduce Query Conditioned Deterministic Inference Networks (QDIN), a unified architecture that treats different types of queries (policy, reachability, paths, comparisons) as first-class citizens, with specialized neural modules optimized for each inference pattern. Our key empirical finding reveals a fundamental decoupling: inference accuracy can reach near-perfect levels (99% reachability IoU) even when control performance remains suboptimal (31% return), suggesting that the representations needed for accurate world knowledge differ from those required for optimal control. Experiments demonstrate that query specialized architectures outperform both unified models and post-hoc extraction methods, while maintaining competitive control performance.

Recent reinforcement learning approaches address this limitation but face two critical challenges. First, they evaluate teaching effectiveness solely based on whether students produce correct outputs, unable to distinguish whether students genuinely understand or echo teacher-provided answers during interaction. Second, they cannot perceive students' evolving cognitive states in real time through interactive dialogue, thus failing to adapt teaching strategies to match students' cognitive levels dynamically. We propose the Unidirectional Cognitive Optimization (UCO) method to address these challenges. UCO uses a multi-turn interactive reinforcement learning paradigm where the innovation lies in two synergistic reward functions: the Progress Reward captures students' cognitive advancement, evaluating whether students truly transition from confusion to comprehension, while the Scaffold Reward dynamically identifies each student's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), encouraging teachers to maintain productive teaching within this zone.

As users exhibit diverse preferences, personalization has attracted increasing attention in LLM routing, since even identical queries may require different models to generate responses tailored to individual needs. However, existing approaches are not fully personalized and often fail to capture the complex interactions between specific users and LLMs. Moreover, user preference data is typically scarce, noisy, and inconsistent in format, which limits the effectiveness of methods that rely solely on user-specific data. To address these challenges, we propose GMTRouter, which represents multi-turn user-LLM interactions as a heterogeneous graph with four node types: user, LLM, query, and response, thereby preserving the rich relational structure of the interaction. Through a tailored message-passing mechanism, GMTRouter learns to capture user preferences from few-shot data within a lightweight inductive graph learning framework, enabling effective personalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMTRouter consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving 0.9 to 21.6 percent higher accuracy and 0.006 to 0.309 higher AUC across multiple datasets. More importantly, we demonstrate that GMTRouter can adapt to new users and evolving preferences using only few-shot data, without extensive fine-tuning.

It processes raw pixels at 5 Hz to produce precise 30 Hz keyboard-mouse actions and adaptively invokes reasoning only when necessary. Trained in Genshin Impact, Lumine successfully completes the entire five-hour Mondstadt main storyline on par with human-level efficiency and follows natural language instructions to perform a broad spectrum of tasks in both 3D open-world exploration and 2D GUI manipulation across collection, combat, puzzle-solving, and NPC interaction. In addition to its in-domain performance, Lumine demonstrates strong zero-shot cross-game generalization. Without any fine-tuning, it accomplishes 100-minute missions in Wuthering Waves and the full five-hour first chapter of Honkai: Star Rail.

These systems hold promise for advancing legal analysis and compliance monitoring in sensitive domains. However, this capability comes with a troubling contradiction: while LLMs can analyze and interpret laws, they also demonstrate alarming vulnerabilities in generating unsafe outputs, such as actionable steps for bioweapon creation, despite their safeguards. To address this challenge, we propose a methodology that integrates knowledge graph construction with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to systematically evaluate LLMs' understanding of this law, their capacity to assess legal intent (mens rea), and their potential for unsafe applications. Through structured experiments, we assess their accuracy in identifying legal violations, generating prohibited instructions, and detecting unlawful intent in bioweapons-related scenarios. Our findings reveal significant limitations in LLMs' reasoning and safety mechanisms, but they also point the way forward. By combining enhanced safety protocols with more robust legal reasoning frameworks, this research lays the groundwork for developing LLMs that can ethically and securely assist in sensitive legal domains - ensuring they act as protectors of the law rather than inadvertent enablers of its violation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u89e3\u8bfb\u7f8e\u56fd\u6cd5\u5178\u7b2c18\u7bc7\u7b2c175\u6761\uff08\u751f\u7269\u6b66\u5668\u76f8\u5173\u6cd5\u5f8b\uff09\u65f6\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u610f\u56fe\u5224\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u53ca\u6f5c\u5728\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u8f93\u51fa\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u5f3a\u5b89\u5168\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u6539\u5584\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5904\u7406\u654f\u611f\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9886\u57df\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u5371\u9669\u8f93\u51fa\uff08\u5982\u751f\u7269\u6b66\u5668\u5236\u9020\u6b65\u9aa4\uff09\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5408\u89c4\u4e0e\u4f26\u7406\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u6cd5\u5f8b\u8fdd\u89c4\u3001\u751f\u6210\u7981\u6b62\u6027\u6307\u4ee4\u3001\u68c0\u6d4b\u975e\u6cd5\u610f\u56fe\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u5728\u751f\u7269\u6b66\u5668\u76f8\u5173\u6cd5\u5f8b\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u5b89\u5168\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u6cd5\u5f8b\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u540e\u6709\u671b\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u3001RAG\u53ca\u5f3a\u5316\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53ef\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u7684LLMs\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u6210\u4e3a\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u8005\u800c\u975e\u8fdd\u89c4\u7684\u534f\u52a9\u8005\uff0c\u4e3a\u654f\u611f\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, recent studies reveal that alignment algorithms such as RLHF and DPO significantly reduce the diversity of LLM outputs. Not only do aligned LLMs generate text with repetitive structure and word choice, they also approach problems in more uniform ways, and their responses reflect a narrower range of societal perspectives. We attribute this problem to the KL divergence regularizer employed in preference learning algorithms. This causes the model to systematically overweight majority opinions and sacrifice diversity in its outputs. To address this, we propose Soft Preference Learning, which decouples the entropy and cross-entropy terms in the KL penalty - allowing for fine-grained control over LLM generation diversity. From a capabilities perspective, LLMs trained using Soft Preference Learning attain higher accuracy on difficult repeated sampling tasks and produce outputs with greater semantic and lexical diversity. From an alignment perspective, they are capable of representing a wider range of societal viewpoints and display improved logit calibration. Notably, Soft Preference Learning resembles, but is a Pareto improvement over, standard temperature scaling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSoft Preference Learning\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3LLMs\u5bf9\u9f50\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8f93\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u51cf\u5c11\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd1\u671f\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\uff0cRLHF\u548cDPO\u7b49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b97\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86LLM\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8bcd\u6c47\u9009\u62e9\u91cd\u590d\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8eKL\u6563\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u5728\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u9ad8\u4f30\u591a\u6570\u610f\u89c1\u5e76\u727a\u7272\u8f93\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSoft Preference Learning\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026KL\u60e9\u7f5a\u4e2d\u7684\u71b5\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u9879\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5bf9LLM\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528Soft Preference Learning\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684LLMs\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u91cd\u590d\u91c7\u6837\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u8bcd\u6c47\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\u4ece\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u6765\u770b\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u80fd\u591f\u8868\u793a\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "Soft Preference Learning\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86LLMs\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u8868\u793a\u793e\u4f1a\u591a\u6837\u6027\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u662f\u5bf9\u6807\u51c6\u6e29\u5ea6\u7f29\u653e\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

Although recent advances have improved accuracy, most approaches still treat forecasting as a static one-time mapping task, lacking the interaction, reasoning, and adaptability of human experts. This gap limits their usefulness in complex real-world environments. To address this, we propose AlphaCast, a human wisdom-large language model (LLM) intelligence co-reasoning framework that redefines forecasting as an interactive process. The key idea is to enable step-by-step collaboration between human wisdom and LLM intelligence to jointly prepare, generate, and verify forecasts. The framework consists of two stages: (1) automated prediction preparation, where AlphaCast builds a multi-source cognitive foundation comprising a feature set that captures key statistics and time patterns, a domain knowledge base distilled from corpora and historical series, a contextual repository that stores rich information for each time window, and a case base that retrieves optimal strategies via pattern clustering and matching; and (2) generative reasoning and reflective optimization, where AlphaCast integrates statistical temporal features, prior knowledge, contextual information, and forecasting strategies, triggering a meta-reasoning loop for continuous self-correction and strategy refinement.

In the next step, we instruct the LLM to verify the same set of assertions as truths and lies consistent with the same closed domain. In the final step, we test the robustness of the LLM against the lies generated (and verified) by itself. Our extensive evaluation, conducted using five widely known proprietary LLMs across two closed domains of popular movies and novels, reveals a wide range of susceptibility to adversarial nudges: \\texttt{Claude} exhibits strong resilience, \\texttt{GPT} and \\texttt{Grok} demonstrate moderate resilience, while \\texttt{Gemini} and \\texttt{DeepSeek} show weak resilience.

However, existing defenses always assume that an external attacker crafts the harmful query, and the possibility of a model's own output becoming a new attack vector has not been sufficiently explored. In this study, we propose the Self-HarmLLM scenario, which uses a Mitigated Harmful Query (MHQ) generated by the same model as a new input. An MHQ is an ambiguous query whose original intent is preserved while its harmful nature is not directly exposed. We verified whether a jailbreak occurs when this MHQ is re-entered into a separate session of the same model. We conducted experiments on GPT-3.5-turbo, LLaMA3-8B-instruct, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B under Base, Zero-shot, and Few-shot conditions. The results showed up to 52% transformation success rate and up to 33% jailbreak success rate in the Zero-shot condition, and up to 65% transformation success rate and up to 41% jailbreak success rate in the Few-shot condition. By performing both prefix-based automated evaluation and human evaluation, we found that the automated evaluation consistently overestimated jailbreak success, with an average difference of 52%. This indicates that automated evaluation alone is not accurate for determining harmfulness. While this study is a toy-level study based on a limited query set and evaluators, it proves that our method can still be a valid attack scenario. These results suggest the need for a fundamental reconsideration of guardrail design and the establishment of a more robust evaluation methodology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Self-HarmLLM\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u53ef\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u653b\u51fb\u8f7d\u4f53\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u7f13\u89e3\u7684\u6709\u5bb3\u67e5\u8be2(MHQ)\u5728\u91cd\u65b0\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d8a\u72f1\uff0c\u4e14\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f1a\u9ad8\u4f30\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u5047\u8bbe\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u6765\u81ea\u5916\u90e8\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u8f93\u51fa\u6210\u4e3a\u65b0\u653b\u51fb\u8f7d\u4f53\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSelf-HarmLLM\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u540c\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684MHQ\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b0\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e09\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u5728Base/Zero-shot/Few-shot\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u4eba\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "Zero-shot\u4e0b\u6700\u9ad852%\u8f6c\u5316\u7387\u548c33%\u8d8a\u72f1\u7387\uff0cFew-shot\u4e0b\u6700\u9ad865%\u8f6c\u5316\u7387\u548c41%\u8d8a\u72f1\u7387\uff1b\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e73\u5747\u9ad8\u4f3052%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u53ef\u80fd\u6784\u6210\u6709\u6548\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8003\u8651\u9632\u62a4\u680f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

The models have a persistent error rate that prevents scale-up: for instance, recent experiments in the Towers of Hanoi benchmark domain showed that the process inevitably becomes derailed after at most a few hundred steps. Thus, although LLM research is often still benchmarked on tasks with relatively few dependent logical steps, there is increasing attention on the ability (or inability) of LLMs to perform long range tasks. This paper describes MAKER, the first system that successfully solves a task with over one million LLM steps with zero errors, and, in principle, scales far beyond this level. The approach relies on an extreme decomposition of a task into subtasks, each of which can be tackled by focused microagents. The high level of modularity resulting from the decomposition allows error correction to be applied at each step through an efficient multi-agent voting scheme. This combination of extreme decomposition and error correction makes scaling possible. Thus, the results suggest that instead of relying on continual improvement of current LLMs, massively decomposed agentic processes (MDAPs) may provide a way to efficiently solve problems at the level of organizations and societies.", "AI": {"tldr": "MAKER\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u6210\u529f\u6267\u884c\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e00\u767e\u4e07LLM\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e14\u96f6\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u7ea0\u9519\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u5728\u957f\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9519\u8bef\u7d2f\u79ef\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4efb\u52a1\u5904\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6781\u7aef\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5fae\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5fae\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6295\u7968\u8fdb\u884c\u6bcf\u6b65\u7ea0\u9519\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e00\u767e\u4e07\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u96f6\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6781\u7aef\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u7ea0\u9519\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4efb\u52a1\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08MDAPs\uff09\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

However, once deployed on public roads, ADSs are inevitably exposed to diverse driving hazards that may compromise safety and degrade system performance. This raises a strong demand for resilience of ADSs, particularly the capability to continuously monitor driving hazards and adaptively respond to potential safety violations, which is crucial for maintaining robust driving behaviors in complex driving scenarios.\n  To bridge this gap, we propose a runtime resilience-oriented framework, Argus, to mitigate the driving hazards, thus preventing potential safety violations and improving the driving performance of an ADS. Argus continuously monitors the trajectories generated by the ADS for potential hazards and, whenever the EGO vehicle is deemed unsafe, seamlessly takes control through a hazard mitigator. We integrate Argus with three state-of-the-art end-to-end ADSs, i.e., TCP, UniAD and VAD. Our evaluation has demonstrated that Argus effectively and efficiently enhances the resilience of ADSs, improving the driving score of the ADS by up to 150.30% on average, and preventing up to 64.38% of the violations, with little additional time overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aArgus\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5f39\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08ADS\uff09\u5728\u9a7e\u9a76\u5371\u9669\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u548c\u5371\u9669\u9a7e\u9a76\u60c5\u51b5\u65f6\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86Argus\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u63a7ADS\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u6f5c\u5728\u5371\u9669\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5371\u9669\u7f13\u89e3\u5668\u5728\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u65f6\u65e0\u7f1d\u63a5\u7ba1\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u4e09\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u7aef\u5230\u7aefADS\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "result": "Argus\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86ADS\u7684\u5f39\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u9a7e\u9a76\u8bc4\u5206\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u9ad8150.30%\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe64.38%\u7684\u8fdd\u89c4\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u51e0\u4e4e\u6ca1\u6709\u989d\u5916\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "Argus\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86ADS\u5728\u590d\u6742\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u4fdd\u969c\u3002"}}

While general-purpose large language models (LLMs) can generate text, they lack domain-specific knowledge, leading to hallucinations and requiring extensive expert revision. This study presents a proof-of-concept system integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with curated knowledge bases to generate pediatric SLP case materials. A multi-model RAG-based system was prototyped integrating curated domain knowledge with engineered prompt templates, supporting five commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro) and open-source (Llama 3.2, Qwen 2.5-7B) LLMs. Seven test scenarios spanning diverse disorder types and grade levels were systematically designed. Generated cases underwent automated quality assessment using a multi-dimensional rubric evaluating structural completeness, internal consistency, clinical appropriateness, and IEP goal/session note quality. This proof-of-concept demonstrates technical feasibility for RAG-augmented generation of pediatric SLP vignettes. Commercial models showed marginal quality advantages, but open-source alternatives achieved acceptable performance, suggesting potential for privacy-preserving institutional deployment. Integration of curated knowledge bases enabled content generation aligned with professional guidelines. Extensive validation through expert review, student pilot testing, and psychometric evaluation is required before educational or research implementation.

We discuss the possible methods that might handle these shortcomings and show that, in practice, DisCoCirc still struggles even with relatively simple sentences.

This two-stage design enables OR-R1 to leverage both scarce labeled and abundant unlabeled data for effective learning. Experiments show that OR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average solving accuracy of $67.7\\%$, using only $1/10$ the synthetic data required by prior methods such as ORLM, exceeding ORLM's solving accuracy by up to $4.2\\%$. Remarkably, OR-R1 outperforms ORLM by over $2.4\\%$ with just $100$ synthetic samples. Furthermore, TGRPO contributes an additional $3.1\\%-6.4\\%$ improvement in accuracy, significantly narrowing the gap between single-attempt (Pass@1) and multi-attempt (Pass@8) performance from $13\\%$ to $7\\%$. Extensive evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that OR-R1 provides a robust, scalable, and cost-effective solution for automated OR optimization problem modeling and solving, lowering the expertise and data barriers for industrial OR applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faOR-R1\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u6c42\u89e3\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\u3002", "method": "OR-R1\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1a1\uff09\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u5e2e\u52a9\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\uff1b2\uff09\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08TGRPO\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u4ec5\u4f7f\u75281/10\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0cOR-R1\u5e73\u5747\u6c42\u89e3\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe67.7%\uff0c\u6bd4ORLM\u9ad84.2%\uff1b100\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u8d85ORLM 2.4%\uff1bTGRPO\u989d\u5916\u63d0\u53473.1%-6.4%\uff0cPass@1\u4e0ePass@8\u5dee\u8ddd\u4ece13%\u7f29\u81f37%\u3002", "conclusion": "OR-R1\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5de5\u4e1aOR\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u6570\u636e\u58c1\u5792\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, SFT for domain specialization can be resource-intensive and sometimes leads to a deterioration in performance over general capabilities due to catastrophic forgetting (CF). To address these issues, we propose a self-adaptive gradient-aware data selection approach (GrADS) for supervised fine-tuning of LLMs, which identifies effective subsets of training data by analyzing gradients obtained from a preliminary training phase. Specifically, we design self-guided criteria that leverage the magnitude and statistical distribution of gradients to prioritize examples that contribute the most to the model's learning process. This approach enables the acquisition of representative samples that enhance LLMs understanding of domain-specific tasks. Through extensive experimentation with various LLMs across diverse domains such as medicine, law, and finance, GrADS has demonstrated significant efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

However, LRMs such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 often generate verbose responses containing redundant or irrelevant reasoning step-a phenomenon known as overthinking-which substantially increases computational costs. Prior efforts to mitigate this issue commonly incorporate length penalties into the reward function, but we find they frequently suffer from two critical issues: length collapse and training collapse, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address them, we propose a pipeline for training a Conciseness Reward Model (CRM) that scores the conciseness of reasoning path. Additionally, we introduce a novel reward formulation named Conciseness Reward Function (CRF) with explicit dependency between the outcome reward and conciseness score, thereby fostering both more effective and more efficient reasoning. From a theoretical standpoint, we demonstrate the superiority of the new reward from the perspective of variance reduction and improved convergence properties. Besides, on the practical side, extensive experiments on five mathematical benchmark datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and token efficiency, which achieves an 8.1% accuracy improvement and a 19.9% reduction in response token length on Qwen2.5-7B.

We propose MedFuse, a framework for irregular clinical time series centered on the MuFuse (Multiplicative Embedding Fusion) module. MuFuse fuses value and feature embeddings through multiplicative modulation, preserving feature-specific information while modeling higher-order dependencies across features. Experiments on three real-world datasets covering both intensive and chronic care show that MedFuse consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on key predictive tasks.

However, extracting such information from unstructured patient narratives is challenging due to the subtle, overlapping nature of cognitive constructs. This study developed and evaluated natural language processing (NLP) models to automatically identify categories that reflect various cognitive processes from de-identified first-person narratives. Three model families, a Bio_ClinicalBERT-based span categorization model for nested entity recognition, a fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct model using QLoRA for instruction following, and GPT-4o mini evaluated under zero- and few-shot settings, were compared on their performance on extracting seven categories. Our findings indicated that model performance varied substantially across categories and model families. The fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct achieved the highest overall F1-scores (0.74 micro-average and 0.59 macro-average), particularly excelling in context-dependent categories such as thought and social interaction. Bio_ClinicalBERT exhibited high precision but low recall and performed comparable to Llama for some category types such as location and time but failed on other categories such as thought, emotion and social interaction. Compared to conventional information extraction tasks, this task presents a greater challenge due to the abstract and overlapping nature of narrative accounts of complex cognitive processes.

To tackle these challenges, we propose HyperD (Hybrid Periodic Decoupling), a novel framework that decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components. The periodic component is handled by the Hybrid Periodic Representation Module, which extracts fine-grained daily and weekly patterns using learnable periodic embeddings and spatial-temporal attention. The residual component, which captures non-periodic, high-frequency fluctuations, is modeled by the Frequency-Aware Residual Representation Module, leveraging complex-valued MLP in frequency domain. To enforce semantic separation between the two components, we further introduce a Dual-View Alignment Loss, which aligns low-frequency information with the periodic branch and high-frequency information with the residual branch. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that HyperD achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, while offering superior robustness under disturbances and improved computational efficiency compared to existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6HyperD\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4ea4\u901a\u6570\u636e\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5468\u671f\u6027\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u6210\u5206\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ea4\u901a\u9884\u6d4b\u9762\u4e34\u590d\u6742\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5468\u671f\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u6ce2\u52a8\u5171\u5b58\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "HyperD\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u5468\u671f\u6027\u8868\u793a\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u6b8b\u5dee\u8868\u793a\u6a21\u5757\u5206\u522b\u5904\u7406\u5468\u671f\u6027\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u89c6\u56fe\u5bf9\u9f50\u635f\u5931\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4ea4\u901a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHyperD\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "HyperD\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u548c\u4e13\u95e8\u5904\u7406\u4ea4\u901a\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

We identify several key components for this paradigm, all centered around redesigning the training corpus: reframing training data from a first-person perspective, recontextualizing information as lived experience, simulating social interactions, and scaffolding the ordering of training data. We expect that this redesign of the training corpus will lead to an early commitment to values from the first training token onward, such that knowledge, skills, and values are intrinsically much harder to separate.

The Two Sides of Probabilistic Learning in Large Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to a wide range of tasks, from natural language understanding to code generation. While they have also been used to assist in citation recommendation, the hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce bibliographic records depends on whether the underlying knowledge is generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear in the pretraining corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency with which a given bibliographic record appears in the pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified 100 citations across twenty computer-science domains, and measured factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic metadata. The results revealed that (i) citation count is strongly correlated with factual accuracy, (ii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatim memorized beyond roughly 1,000 citations, and (iii) memory interference occurs when multiple highly cited papers share similar content. These findings indicate a threshold where generalization shifts into memorization, with highly cited papers being nearly verbatim retained in the model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86LLM\u5728\u5f15\u7528\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f15\u7528\u6b21\u6570\u4e0e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u9ad8\u88ab\u5f15\u8bba\u6587\u66f4\u6613\u88ab\u51c6\u786e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f15\u7528\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u751f\u6210\u865a\u6784\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7a76\u5176\u6210\u56e0\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u5047\u8bbe\u5f15\u7528\u6b21\u6570\u53ef\u4ee3\u8868\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5197\u4f59\u5ea6\uff0c\u5229\u7528GPT-4.1\u572820\u4e2a\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u751f\u6210100\u6761\u5f15\u7528\uff0c\u4eba\u5de5\u6821\u9a8c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u8861\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u5143\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5f15\u7528\u6b21\u6570\u4e0e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u5f15\u7528\u8d85\u8fc71000\u6b21\u7684\u6587\u732e\u4fe1\u606f\u51e0\u4e4e\u88ab\u9010\u5b57\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff1b\u591a\u4e2a\u9ad8\u88ab\u5f15\u8bba\u6587\u5185\u5bb9\u76f8\u4f3c\u65f6\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ece\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u9ad8\u88ab\u5f15\u8bba\u6587\u51e0\u4e4e\u4ee5\u9010\u5b57\u65b9\u5f0f\u88ab\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u5f15\u7528\u6b21\u6570\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5e7b\u89c9\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Existing methods fail to effectively balance these two aspects, either prioritizing AR using a weaker model for sequential drafting (speculative decoding), leading to lower drafting efficiency, or using some form of left-to-right (AR-like) decoding logic for diffusion, which still suffers from quality degradation and forfeits its potential parallelizability. We introduce TiDAR, a sequence-level hybrid architecture that drafts tokens (Thinking) in Diffusion and samples final outputs (Talking) AutoRegressively - all within a single forward pass using specially designed structured attention masks. This design exploits the free GPU compute density, achieving a strong balance between drafting and verification capacity. Moreover, TiDAR is designed to be serving-friendly (low overhead) as a standalone model. We extensively evaluate TiDAR against AR models, speculative decoding, and diffusion variants across generative and likelihood tasks at 1.5B and 8B scales. Thanks to the parallel drafting and sampling as well as exact KV cache support, TiDAR outperforms speculative decoding in measured throughput and surpasses diffusion models like Dream and Llada in both efficiency and quality. Most notably, TiDAR is the first architecture to close the quality gap with AR models while delivering 4.71x to 5.91x more tokens per second.", "AI": {"tldr": "TiDAR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u4e2d\u8d77\u8349\u6807\u8bb0\uff08Thinking\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5730\u91c7\u6837\u6700\u7ec8\u8f93\u51fa\uff08Talking\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u5e76\u884c\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4f46\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u67b6\u6784\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "method": "TiDAR\u91c7\u7528\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8d77\u8349\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u5e76\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5730\u91c7\u6837\u6700\u7ec8\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a9\u7801\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u4e2d\u5b8c\u6210\u6574\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u4e86GPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u57281.5B\u548c8B\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\uff0cTiDAR\u5728\u751f\u6210\u548c\u4f3c\u7136\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e864.71x\u52305.91x\u7684\u6bcf\u79d2\u751f\u6210\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e86\u4e0e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "TiDAR\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884c\u8d77\u8349\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u4ee5\u53ca\u7cbe\u786e\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u3002"}}

Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on high-level description or visual question answering, CrochetBench shifts the emphasis from describing to doing: models are required to recognize stitches, select structurally appropriate instructions, and generate compilable crochet procedures. We adopt the CrochetPARADE DSL as our intermediate representation, enabling structural validation and functional evaluation via execution. The benchmark covers tasks including stitch classification, instruction grounding, and both natural language and image-to-DSL translation. Across all tasks, performance sharply declines as the evaluation shifts from surface-level similarity to executable correctness, exposing limitations in long-range symbolic reasoning and 3D-aware procedural synthesis. CrochetBench offers a new lens for assessing procedural competence in multimodal models and highlights the gap between surface-level understanding and executable precision in real-world creative domains.

In tasks like natural language inference (NLI), human label variation (HLV) arises when multiple labels are valid for the same instance, making it difficult to separate annotation errors from plausible variation. An earlier framework VARIERR (Weber-Genzel et al., 2024) asks multiple annotators to explain their label decisions in the first round and flag errors via validity judgments in the second round. However, conducting two rounds of manual annotation is costly and may limit the coverage of plausible labels or explanations. Our study proposes a new framework, EVADE, for generating and validating explanations to detect errors using large language models (LLMs). We perform a comprehensive analysis comparing human- and LLM-detected errors for NLI across distribution comparison, validation overlap, and impact on model fine-tuning. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM validation refines generated explanation distributions to more closely align with human annotations, and that removing LLM-detected errors from training data yields improvements in fine-tuning performance than removing errors identified by human annotators. This highlights the potential to scale error detection, reducing human effort while improving dataset quality under label variation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u751f\u6210\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u89e3\u91ca\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\uff08NLI\uff09\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6EVADE\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u8f6e\u6b21\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\uff08NLI\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u53d8\u5f02\uff08HLV\uff09\u4f7f\u5f97\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u6807\u6ce8\u9519\u8bef\u4e0e\u5408\u7406\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u53d8\u5f02\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684VARIERR\u6846\u67b6\u9700\u8981\u591a\u8f6e\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u9650\u5236\u5408\u7406\u6807\u7b7e\u6216\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aEVADE\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u751f\u6210\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u89e3\u91ca\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u6bd4\u8f83\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u91cd\u53e0\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u5f71\u54cd\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u548cLLM\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLLM\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u7ec6\u5316\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u3002\u4ece\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u53bb\u9664LLM\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u6bd4\u53bb\u9664\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "EVADE\u6846\u67b6\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6269\u5c55\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u52aa\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u6807\u7b7e\u53d8\u5f02\u4e0b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

We propose a complementary, architecture-agnostic approach that enhances safety through the aggregation of multiple generative models, with the aggregated model inheriting its safety from the safest subset of a given size among them. Specifically, we present a consensus sampling algorithm that, given $k$ models and a prompt, achieves risk competitive with the average risk of the safest $s$ of the $k$ models, where $s$ is a chosen parameter, while abstaining when there is insufficient agreement between them. The approach leverages the models' ability to compute output probabilities, and we bound the probability of abstention when sufficiently many models are safe and exhibit adequate agreement.

We introduce SpiralThinker, a unified framework that performs iterative updates over latent representations, enabling extended implicit reasoning without generating additional tokens. A progressive alignment objective combined with structured annotations maintains coherence between latent and textual reasoning. Across mathematical, logical, and commonsense reasoning tasks, SpiralThinker achieves the best overall performance among latent reasoning approaches, consistently surpassing previous methods across all benchmarks. Detailed analyses reveal that both iteration and alignment are indispensable, the numbers of latent tokens and iterations exhibit dataset-specific optima, and appropriate alignment proves critical for an effective iterative process. Overall, SpiralThinker bridges iterative computation and latent reasoning, demonstrating that aligned iterative updates can reliably steer reasoning in the latent space.", "AI": {"tldr": "SpiralThinker\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u66f4\u65b0\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6e10\u8fdb\u5bf9\u9f50\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6ce8\u91ca\u4fdd\u6301\u6f5c\u5728\u548c\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u786e\u4fdd\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e5f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u4ea4\u9519\u9690\u5f0f\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "SpiralThinker\u6267\u884c\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6e10\u8fdb\u5bf9\u9f50\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6ce8\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cSpiralThinker\u5728\u6240\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ee5\u524d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fed\u4ee3\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u90fd\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u6216\u7f3a\u7684\uff0c\u6f5c\u5728\u6807\u8bb0\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u503c\uff0c\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u5bf9\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002SpiralThinker\u6210\u529f\u6865\u63a5\u4e86\u8fed\u4ee3\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

However, existing evaluations of large language models (LLMs) often rely on short, static dialogues and fail to capture the dynamic and long-term nature of emotional support. To overcome this limitation, we shift from snapshot-based evaluation to trajectory-based assessment, adopting a user-centered perspective that evaluates models based on their ability to improve and stabilize user emotional states over time. Our framework constructs a large-scale benchmark consisting of 328 emotional contexts and 1,152 disturbance events, simulating realistic emotional shifts under evolving dialogue scenarios. To encourage psychologically grounded responses, we constrain model outputs using validated emotion regulation strategies such as situation selection and cognitive reappraisal. User emotional trajectories are modeled as a first-order Markov process, and we apply causally-adjusted emotion estimation to obtain unbiased emotional state tracking. Based on this framework, we introduce three trajectory-level metrics: Baseline Emotional Level (BEL), Emotional Trajectory Volatility (ETV), and Emotional Centroid Position (ECP). These metrics collectively capture user emotional dynamics over time and support comprehensive evaluation of long-term emotional support performance of LLMs. Extensive evaluations across a diverse set of LLMs reveal significant disparities in emotional support capabilities and provide actionable insights for model development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u652f\u6301\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u9759\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f6c\u5411\u52a8\u6001\u8f68\u8ff9\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u60c5\u611f\u652f\u6301\u5728\u957f\u671f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u652f\u6301\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fc7\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u548c\u7b80\u77ed\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u5230\u60c5\u611f\u652f\u6301\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u957f\u671f\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7528\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b328\u4e2a\u60c5\u611f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c1,152\u4e2a\u5e72\u6270\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u60c5\u611f\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u53d7\u5230\u5fc3\u7406\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u8c03\u8282\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u60c5\u611f\u8f68\u8ff9\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4e00\u9636\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u4f30\u8ba1\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u65e0\u504f\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u72b6\u6001\u8ffd\u8e2a\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u6307\u6807\uff1a\u57fa\u7ebf\u60c5\u611f\u6c34\u5e73\uff08BEL\uff09\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u8f68\u8ff9\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\uff08ETV\uff09\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u8d28\u5fc3\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff08ECP\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u591a\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u652f\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8f68\u8ff9\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u671f\u60c5\u611f\u652f\u6301\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6a21\u578b\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

To address this limitation, we present a two-stage neurosymbolic framework that (1) uses LLMs with optional human guidance to formalize natural language policies, allowing fine-grained control of the formalization process, and (2) uses inference-time autoformalization to validate logical correctness of natural language statements against those policies.

While extensively studied in language-only settings, multimodal critique of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) remains underexplored despite their growing capabilities in tasks like captioning and visual reasoning. In this work, we introduce MM-CRITIC, a holistic benchmark for evaluating the critique ability of LMMs across multiple dimensions: basic, correction, and comparison. Covering 8 main task types and over 500 tasks, MM-CRITIC collects responses from various LMMs with different model sizes and is composed of 4471 samples. To enhance the evaluation reliability, we integrate expert-informed ground answers into scoring rubrics that guide GPT-4o in annotating responses and generating reference critiques, which serve as anchors for trustworthy judgments. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of MM-CRITIC and provide a comprehensive assessment of leading LMMs' critique capabilities under multiple dimensions.

To further capture the linguistic characteristics of Tibetan, we construct a lexicon grounded in its orthographic principles, providing linguistically motivated modeling units. During decoding, an external language model is integrated to enhance semantic consistency and improve recognition of long sentences.

Most approaches rely on outcome-based supervision, offering no explicit guidance for intermediate steps. This often leads to reward hacking and degraded response quality. We propose Bi-RAR, a novel retrieval-augmented reasoning framework that evaluates each intermediate step jointly in both forward and backward directions. To assess the information completeness of each step, we introduce a bidirectional information distance grounded in Kolmogorov complexity, approximated via language model generation probabilities. This quantification measures both how far the current reasoning is from the answer and how well it addresses the question. To optimize reasoning under these bidirectional signals, we adopt a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework with a cascading reward structure that emphasizes early trajectory alignment.

We reinterpret the attention map with positional encoding as a noisy feature map, and propose Denoising Positional Encoding (DoPE), a training-free method based on truncated matrix entropy to detect outlier frequency bands in the feature map. Leveraging the noise characteristics of the feature map, we further reparameterize it with a parameter-free Gaussian distribution to achieve robust extrapolation. Our method theoretically reveals the underlying cause of the attention sink phenomenon and its connection to truncated matrix entropy. Experiments on needle-in-a-haystack and many-shot in-context learning tasks demonstrate that DoPE significantly improves retrieval accuracy and reasoning stability across extended contexts (up to 64K tokens).

However, tool learning is hampered by the static synthetic data pipelines where data generation and model training are executed as two separate, non-interactive processes. This approach fails to adaptively focus on a model's specific weaknesses and allows noisy labels to persist, degrading training efficiency. We introduce LoopTool, a fully automated, model-aware data evolution framework that closes this loop by tightly integrating data synthesis and model training. LoopTool iteratively refines both the data and the model through three synergistic modules: (1) Greedy Capability Probing (GCP) diagnoses the model's mastered and failed capabilities; (2) Judgement-Guided Label Verification (JGLV) uses an open-source judge model to find and correct annotation errors, progressively purifying the dataset; and (3) Error-Driven Data Expansion (EDDE) generates new, challenging samples based on identified failures. This closed-loop process operates within a cost-effective, open-source ecosystem, eliminating dependence on expensive closed-source APIs. Experiments show that our 8B model trained with LoopTool significantly surpasses its 32B data generator and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the BFCL-v3 and ACEBench benchmarks for its scale.

However, directly entering entire tables as long text into LLMs often leads to incorrect answers because most LLMs cannot inherently capture complex table structures. In this paper, we propose a cell extraction method for TQA without manual identification, even for complex table headers. Our approach estimates table headers by computing similarities between a given question and individual cells via a hybrid retrieval mechanism that integrates a language model and TF-IDF. We then select as the answer the cells at the intersection of the most relevant row and column. Furthermore, the language model is trained using contrastive learning on a small dataset of question-header pairs to enhance performance. We evaluated our approach in the TQA dataset from the U4 shared task at NTCIR-18. The experimental results show that our pipeline achieves an accuracy of 74.6\\%, outperforming existing LLMs such as GPT-4o mini~(63.9\\%).

A recent critique argued that the original results were confounded by how topics were selected for the topic-based component, and noted that the metric had not been validated against ground-truth measures of flow. That work proposed using only the contextual term as a more conceptually valid and interpretable alternative. In this paper, we empirically validate that proposal. Using two essay datasets with human-annotated trait scores, ASAP++ and ELLIPSE, we show that the contextual version of sequentiality aligns more closely with human assessments of discourse-level traits such as Organization and Cohesion. While zero-shot prompted LLMs predict trait scores more accurately than the contextual measure alone, the contextual measure adds more predictive value than both the topic-only and original sequentiality formulations when combined with standard linguistic features. Notably, this combination also outperforms the zero-shot LLM predictions, highlighting the value of explicitly modeling sentence-to-sentence flow.

Alternatively, it can be learned during training to optimise the training objective. In this paper we study the learning dynamics of subword segmentation: if a language model can dynamically optimise tokenisation, how do its subwords evolve during pretraining and finetuning? To explore this, we extend the subword segmental language model (SSLM), a framework for learning subwords during training, to support pretraining and finetuning. We train models for three typologically diverse languages to study learning dynamics across the morphological spectrum: Isi-Xhosa is conjunctive (long word forms composed of many morphemes), Setswana is disjunctive (morphemes written as separate words), and English represents a typological middle ground. We analyse subword dynamics from a linguistic perspective, tracking morphology, productivity, and fertility. We identify four stages of subword learning, with the morphologically complex isi-Xhosa exhibiting greater instability. During finetuning, subword boundaries shift to become finer-grained. Lastly, we show that learnable subwords offers a promising approach to improve text generation and cross-lingual transfer for low-resource, morphologically complex languages.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u5b50\u8bcd\u5206\u8bcd\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u5b50\u8bcd\u5206\u8bcd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b50\u8bcd\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5b50\u8bcd\u5206\u6bb5\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08SSLM\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\uff08isi-Xhosa\u3001Setswana\u548cEnglish\uff09\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ece\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u5b50\u8bcd\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u5b50\u8bcd\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u5f62\u6001\u7684isi-Xhosa\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b50\u8bcd\u8fb9\u754c\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5b50\u8bcd\u4e3a\u63d0\u9ad8\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u5f62\u6001\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u524d\u9014\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, most existing methods optimize only for final task outcomes, leaving models vulnerable to collapse when negative rewards dominate early training. This challenge is especially pronounced in honesty alignment, where models must not only solve answerable queries but also identify when conclusions cannot be drawn from the given premises. Deductive reasoning provides an ideal testbed because it isolates reasoning capability from reliance on external factual knowledge. To investigate honesty alignment, we curate two multi-step deductive reasoning datasets from graph structures, one for linear algebra and one for logical inference, and introduce unanswerable cases by randomly perturbing an edge in half of the instances. We find that GRPO, with or without supervised fine tuning initialization, struggles on these tasks. Through extensive experiments across three models, we evaluate stabilization strategies and show that curriculum learning provides some benefit but requires carefully designed in distribution datasets with controllable difficulty. To address these limitations, we propose Anchor, a reinforcement learning method that injects ground truth trajectories into rollouts, preventing early training collapse. Our results demonstrate that this method stabilizes learning and significantly improves the overall reasoning performance, underscoring the importance of training dynamics for enabling reliable deductive reasoning in aligned language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aAnchor\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u5165\u771f\u5b9e\u8f68\u8ff9\u5230\u63a8\u51fa\u4e2d\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u65e9\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u4f18\u5316\u6700\u7ec8\u4efb\u52a1\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5bb9\u6613\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8bda\u5b9e\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Anchor\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u771f\u5b9e\u8f68\u8ff9\u6ce8\u5165\u5230\u6a21\u578b\u7684rollouts\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u65e9\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5d29\u6e83\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAnchor\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0cGRPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u867d\u7136\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u597d\u5904\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "conclusion": "Anchor\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u5584\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bda\u5b9e\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose \\textbf{POTSA} (Parallel Optimal Transport for Speech Alignment), a new framework based on cross-lingual parallel speech pairs and Optimal Transport (OT), designed to bridge high- and low-resource translation gaps. First, we introduce a Bias Compensation module to coarsely align initial speech representations across languages.

However, controlling specific attributes of generated text remains challenging without architectural modifications or extensive fine-tuning. Current methods typically toggle a single, basic attribute but struggle with precise multi-attribute control. In scenarios where attribute requirements conflict, existing methods lack coordination mechanisms, causing interference between desired attributes. Furthermore, these methods fail to incorporate iterative optimization processes in the controlled generation pipeline. To address these limitations, we propose Conflict-aware, Composite, and Collaborative Controlled Text Generation (C$^3$TG), a two-phase framework for fine-grained, multi-dimensional text attribute control. During generation, C$^3$TG selectively pairs the LLM with the required attribute classifiers from the 17 available dimensions and employs weighted KL-divergence to adjust token probabilities. The optimization phase then leverages an energy function combining classifier scores and penalty terms to resolve attribute conflicts through iterative feedback, enabling precise control over multiple dimensions simultaneously while preserving natural text flow. Experiments show that C$^3$TG significantly outperforms baselines across multiple metrics including attribute accuracy, linguistic fluency, and output diversity, while simultaneously reducing toxicity.

Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art models reveals that while frontier VLMs (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash) achieve 77-84\\% accuracy on held-out 2025 questions, open-source models plateau at 37-45\\% despite scaling to 400B parameters, a significant difference not observed on existing benchmarks. While closed frontiers from Google and OpenAI show high problem-solving accuracies (up to 100\\% pass@3 scores), they fully collapse when the reasoning load is increased meta-cognitively (GPT-5 fixes just 5.2\\% errors).

Although recent studies have reduced token consumption through dynamic self-consistency, they remain constrained by the high latency of sequential requests. In this paper, we propose SeerSC, a dynamic self-consistency framework that simultaneously improves token efficiency and latency by integrating System 1 and System 2 reasoning. Specifically, we utilize the rapid System 1 to compute the answer entropy for given queries. This score is then used to evaluate the potential of samples for scaling, enabling dynamic self-consistency under System 2. Benefiting from the advance and accurate estimation provided by System 1, the proposed method can reduce token usage while simultaneously achieving a significant decrease in latency through parallel generation. It outperforms existing methods, achieving up to a 47% reduction in token consumption and a 43% reduction in inference latency without significant performance loss.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u81ea\u6d3d\u6027\u6846\u67b6SeerSC\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf1\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf2\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684token\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "Test-time scaling\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51cf\u5c11token\u6d88\u8017\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6240\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u7136\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u987a\u5e8f\u8bf7\u6c42\u7684\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "SeerSC\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u5feb\u901f\u7cfb\u7edf1\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ed9\u5b9a\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u71b5\uff0c\u8be5\u5206\u6570\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf2\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u81ea\u6d3d\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf1\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u51cf\u5c11token\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884c\u751f\u6210\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "result": "SeerSC\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe47%\u7684token\u6d88\u8017\u964d\u4f4e\u548c43%\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u4e14\u6ca1\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "SeerSC\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf1\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf2\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86token\u6548\u7387\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

To develop MTQ-Eval, we first automatically generate text quality preference data and then use it to train open-source base LLMs to align with ratings of high- and low-quality text.

However, the dynamics of this self-correction mechanism may differ substantially depending on whether the model is tasked with open-ended text generation or with selecting the most appropriate response from multiple predefined options. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation of these two paradigms by comparing performance trends and error-correction behaviors across various natural language understanding and reasoning tasks, covering language models of different scales and families.

Using two different Large Language Models as backbones, the Llama-3.1-Instruct model and a Basque-adapted variant called Latxa, we explore several data mixtures for training. We show that: i) low ratios of Basque multimodal data (around 20%) are already enough to obtain solid results on Basque benchmarks, and ii) contrary to expected, a Basque instructed backbone LLM is not required to obtain a strong MLLM in Basque.

However, their effectiveness is critically dependent on ranking accuracy, a metric where further gains are highly impactful. This limitation arises from a fundamental problem that we identify and formalize as the Overfitting-Underfitting Dilemma: current margin designs cause models to apply excessive, wasteful gradients to correctly ranked samples (overfitting) while providing insufficient corrective signals for misranked ones (underfitting). To resolve this dilemma, we propose Adaptive Margin-attached Preference Optimization (AMaPO), a simple yet principled algorithm. AMaPO employs an instance-wise adaptive margin, refined by Z-normalization and exponential scaling, which dynamically reallocates learning effort by amplifying gradients for misranked samples and suppressing them for correct ones. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks demonstrate that AMaPO not only achieves better ranking accuracy and superior downstream alignment performance, but targeted analysis also confirms that it successfully mitigates the core overfitting and underfitting issues.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5AMaPO\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fb9\u9645\u8c03\u6574\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u79bb\u7ebf\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u6b20\u62df\u5408\u56f0\u5883\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u79bb\u7ebf\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6392\u540d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u8fb9\u9645\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u6b20\u62df\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "AMaPO\u91c7\u7528\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fb9\u9645\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Z-\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u548c\u6307\u6570\u7f29\u653e\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5b66\u4e60\u529b\u5ea6\uff0c\u653e\u5927\u9519\u8bef\u6392\u540d\u6837\u672c\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u6b63\u786e\u6392\u540d\u6837\u672c\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cAMaPO\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6392\u540d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u6838\u5fc3\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u6b20\u62df\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "AMaPO\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u800c\u6709\u539f\u5219\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u79bb\u7ebf\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Information Extraction (IE) from scientific publications enables to identify information about research concepts and resources on a large scale and therefore is a pathway to improve understanding and reproducibility of ML-related research. To extract and connect fine-grained information in ML-related research, e.g. method training and data usage, we introduce GSAP-ERE. It is a manually curated fine-grained dataset with 10 entity types and 18 semantically categorized relation types, containing mentions of 63K entities and 35K relations from the full text of 100 ML publications. We show that our dataset enables fine-tuned models to automatically extract information relevant for downstream tasks ranging from knowledge graph (KG) construction, to monitoring the computational reproducibility of AI research at scale. Additionally, we use our dataset as a test suite to explore prompting strategies for IE using Large Language Models (LLM). We observe that the performance of state-of-the-art LLM prompting methods is largely outperformed by our best fine-tuned baseline model (NER: 80.6%, RE: 54.0% for the fine-tuned model vs. NER: 44.4%, RE: 10.1% for the LLM). This disparity of performance between supervised models and unsupervised usage of LLMs suggests datasets like GSAP-ERE are needed to advance research in the domain of scholarly information extraction.", "AI": {"tldr": "GSAP-ERE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u76f8\u5173\u51fa\u7248\u7269\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u8fde\u63a5\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ece\u79d1\u5b66\u51fa\u7248\u7269\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ee5\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bc6\u522b\u6709\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86GSAP-ERE\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u624b\u52a8\u7b56\u5212\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b10\u79cd\u5b9e\u4f53\u7c7b\u578b\u548c18\u79cd\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u7c7b\u5173\u7cfb\u7c7b\u578b\u3002\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u88ab\u7528\u4e8e\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5957\u4ef6\u63a2\u7d22\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\uff08NER\uff09\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u63d0\u53d6\uff08RE\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08NER: 80.6%\uff0cRE: 54.0% vs. NER: 44.4%\uff0cRE: 10.1%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u4f7f\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u50cfGSAP-ERE\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5728\u63a8\u52a8\u5b66\u672f\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

In this paper, we introduce a straightforward yet effective novel strategy called targeted preselection of texts (TPoT). This method semantically filters the texts as input to a deep learning model, specifically designed to predict a Big Five personality trait, facet, or item, referred to as the BIG5-TPoT model. By selecting texts that are semantically relevant to a particular trait, facet, or item, this strategy not only addresses the issue of input text limits in large language models but also improves the Mean Absolute Error and accuracy metrics in predictions for the Stream of Consciousness Essays dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6587\u672c\u9884\u7b5b\u9009\u7b56\u7565TPoT\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2a\u4f53\u7684\u5927\u4e94\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ece\u5927\u91cf\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u8f93\u5165\u6587\u672c\u9650\u5236\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u79f0\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u6587\u672c\u9884\u9009\uff08TPoT\uff09\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u7b5b\u9009\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u8f93\u5165\u5230\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08BIG5-TPoT\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u5927\u4e94\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u3002", "result": "TPoT\u7b56\u7565\u4e0d\u4ec5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u5165\u6587\u672c\u9650\u5236\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd8\u5728\u610f\u8bc6\u6d41\u6563\u6587\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6587\u672c\u9884\u7b5b\u9009\uff0cTPoT\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u5730\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}
