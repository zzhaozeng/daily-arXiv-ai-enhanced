Therefore, we introduce ARC (Agent\nRAG Cache Mechanism), a novel, annotation-free caching framework that\ndynamically manages small, high-value corpora for each agent. By synthesizing\nhistorical query distribution patterns with the intrinsic geometry of cached\nitems in the embedding space, ARC automatically maintains a high-relevance\ncache. With comprehensive experiments on three retrieval datasets, our\nexperimental results demonstrate that ARC reduces storage requirements to\n0.015% of the original corpus while offering up to 79.8% has-answer rate and\nreducing average retrieval latency by 80%. Our results demonstrate that ARC can\ndrastically enhance efficiency and effectiveness in RAG-powered LLM agents."}

As this\nproblem stems from insufficiently detailed, coarse-grained instructions,\nadvancing 3D scene synthesis guided by more detailed, fine-grained instructions\nthat reflect real-world environments becomes crucial. Without such realistic\nscenes, training embodied agents in unrealistic environments can lead them to\nlearn priors that diverge significantly from real-world physics and semantics,\ndegrading their performance when deployed. Thus, verifying the alignment\nbetween the fine-grained instruction and the generated scene is essential for\neffective learning. However, current evaluation methods, such as CLIPScore and\nvision-language models (VLMs), often fail to reliably assess such alignment.\nThis shortcoming arises primarily from their shallow understanding of 3D\nscenes, which often leads to improperly grounded scene components. To address\nthis, we introduce LEGO-Eval, an evaluation framework equipped with diverse\ntools designed to explicitly ground scene components, enabling more accurate\nalignment assessments.

To address this limitation, we introduce MME-CC\n(Multi-Modal Evaluation benchmark of Cognitive Capacity), a vision-grounded\nbenchmark that organizes 11 representative reasoning tasks into three\nfundamental categories of visual information: spatial, geometric, and\nknowledge-based reasoning, and provides fine-grained analyses of MLLMs'\ncognitive capacity across these dimensions. Based on MME-CC, we conduct\nextensive experiments over 16 representative MLLMs. Our study reveals that\nclosed-source models currently lead overall (e.g., 42.66 for Gemini-2.5-Pro vs.\n30.45 for GLM-4.5V), while spatial and geometric reasoning remain broadly weak\n(less than or equal to 30%).

Existing research using contrastive, meta-learning, or data\naugmentation suffers from generalizability issues or lack of coherence between\ntext and target. Recent works leveraging large language models (LLMs) for ZSSD\nfocus either on improving unseen target-specific knowledge or generating\nexplanations for stance analysis. However, most of these works are limited by\ntheir over-reliance on explicit reasoning, provide coarse explanations that\nlack nuance, and do not explicitly model the reasoning process, making it\ndifficult to interpret the model's predictions. To address these issues, in our\nstudy, we develop a novel interpretable ZSSD framework, IRIS. We provide an\ninterpretable understanding of the attitude of the input towards the target\nimplicitly based on sequences within the text (implicit rationales) and\nexplicitly based on linguistic measures (explicit rationales). IRIS considers\nstance detection as an information retrieval ranking task, understanding the\nrelevance of implicit rationales for different stances to guide the model\ntowards correct predictions without requiring the ground-truth of rationales,\nthus providing inherent interpretability. In addition, explicit rationales\nbased on communicative features help decode the emotional and cognitive\ndimensions of stance, offering an interpretable understanding of the author's\nattitude towards the given target. Extensive experiments on the benchmark\ndatasets of VAST, EZ-STANCE, P-Stance, and RFD using 50%, 30%, and even 10%\ntraining data prove the generalizability of our model, benefiting from the\nproposed architecture and interpretable design."}

To address this issue, we present the Chinese Multi-Document\nQuestion Answering Dataset(ChiMDQA), specifically designed for downstream\nbusiness scenarios across prevalent domains including academic, education,\nfinance, law, medical treatment, and news. ChiMDQA encompasses long-form\ndocuments from six distinct fields, consisting of 6,068 rigorously curated,\nhigh-quality question-answer (QA) pairs further classified into ten\nfine-grained categories. Through meticulous document screening and a systematic\nquestion-design methodology, the dataset guarantees both diversity and high\nquality, rendering it applicable to various NLP tasks such as document\ncomprehension, knowledge extraction, and intelligent QA systems. Additionally,\nthis paper offers a comprehensive overview of the dataset's design objectives,\nconstruction methodologies, and fine-grained evaluation system, supplying a\nsubstantial foundation for future research and practical applications in\nChinese QA.

Probing for a Conspiracy Mindset in Large Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "In this paper, we investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit\nconspiratorial tendencies, whether they display sociodemographic biases in this\ndomain, and how easily they can be conditioned into adopting conspiratorial\nperspectives. Conspiracy beliefs play a central role in the spread of\nmisinformation and in shaping distrust toward institutions, making them a\ncritical testbed for evaluating the social fidelity of LLMs. LLMs are\nincreasingly used as proxies for studying human behavior, yet little is known\nabout whether they reproduce higher-order psychological constructs such as a\nconspiratorial mindset. To bridge this research gap, we administer validated\npsychometric surveys measuring conspiracy mindset to multiple models under\ndifferent prompting and conditioning strategies. Our findings reveal that LLMs\nshow partial agreement with elements of conspiracy belief, and conditioning\nwith socio-demographic attributes produces uneven effects, exposing latent\ndemographic biases. Moreover, targeted prompts can easily shift model responses\ntoward conspiratorial directions, underscoring both the susceptibility of LLMs\nto manipulation and the potential risks of their deployment in sensitive\ncontexts. These results highlight the importance of critically evaluating the\npsychological dimensions embedded in LLMs, both to advance computational social\nscience and to inform possible mitigation strategies against harmful uses."}

We introduce a perspectivist annotation scheme\nfor the HCRC MapTask corpus (Anderson et al., 1991) that separately captures\nspeaker and addressee grounded interpretations for each reference expression,\nenabling us to trace how understanding emerges, diverges, and repairs over\ntime. Using a scheme-constrained LLM annotation pipeline, we obtain 13k\nannotated reference expressions with reliability estimates and analyze the\nresulting understanding states. The results show that full misunderstandings\nare rare once lexical variants are unified, but multiplicity discrepancies\nsystematically induce divergences, revealing how apparent grounding can mask\nreferential misalignment. Our framework provides both a resource and an\nanalytic lens for studying grounded misunderstanding and for evaluating\n(V)LLMs' capacity to model perspective-dependent grounding in collaborative\ndialogue."}
