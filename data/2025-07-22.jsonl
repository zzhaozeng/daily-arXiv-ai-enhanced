However, their use as writing assistants in specialized\ndomains like finance, medicine, and law is often hampered by a lack of deep\ndomain-specific knowledge and a tendency to hallucinate. Existing solutions,\nsuch as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), can suffer from inconsistency\nacross multiple retrieval steps, while online search-based methods often\ndegrade quality due to unreliable web content. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce DeepWriter, a customizable, multimodal, long-form writing assistant\nthat operates on a curated, offline knowledge base. DeepWriter leverages a\nnovel pipeline that involves task decomposition, outline generation, multimodal\nretrieval, and section-by-section composition with reflection. By deeply mining\ninformation from a structured corpus and incorporating both textual and visual\nelements, DeepWriter generates coherent, factually grounded, and\nprofessional-grade documents. We also propose a hierarchical knowledge\nrepresentation to enhance retrieval efficiency and accuracy. Our experiments on\nfinancial report generation demonstrate that DeepWriter produces high-quality,\nverifiable articles that surpasses existing baselines in factual accuracy and\ngenerated content quality."}

This paper proposes a theoretical framework, called the Free\nWill Equation, that draws analogies from quantum field theory to endow AGI\nagents with a form of adaptive, controlled stochasticity in their\ndecision-making process. The core idea is to treat an AI agent's cognitive\nstate as a superposition of potential actions or thoughts, which collapses\nprobabilistically into a concrete action when a decision is made - much like a\nquantum wavefunction collapsing upon measurement.

The other stream of techniques utilizes scene geometries for\nreconstruction. But the cost of building and maintaining a large set of\ngeometry data increases as scene size grows. Our work explores novel view\nsynthesis methods that efficiently reconstruct complex scenes without explicit\nuse of scene geometries.

In this way, our method avoids\nexplicitly relying on scene geometry, significantly reducing the computational\ncost of maintaining large 3D data.

Probe data hold highly accurate depth\ninformation of dense data points, enabling the reconstruction of highly complex\nscenes.

We identify five distinct failure modes when models reason for longer:\n1) Claude models become increasingly distracted by irrelevant information; 2)\nOpenAI o-series models resist distractors but overfit to problem framings; 3)\nmodels shift from reasonable priors to spurious correlations; 4) all models\nshow difficulties in maintaining focus on complex deductive tasks; and 5)\nextended reasoning may amplify concerning behaviors, with Claude Sonnet 4\nshowing increased expressions of self-preservation.

The system\nintroduces a re-calibrated stability parameter S in [0,1], which dynamically\nintegrates emotional load, conflict resolution, and contextual drain factors.\nThis stability model leverages advanced Large Language Model interpretation of\ntextual cues and incorporates hybrid temporal tracking mechanisms to provide\nnuanced assessment of psychological well-being states. Our key contributions\ninclude: (i) mathematical proof demonstrating why five emotions are\ninsufficient for complete geometric coverage, (ii) an eight-coordinate system\nthat eliminates representational blind spots, (iii) novel algorithms for\nemotion mixing, conflict resolution, and distance calculation in emotion space,\nand (iv) a comprehensive computational framework for AI emotion recognition\nwith enhanced multi-dimensional stability modeling. Experimental validation\nthrough case studies demonstrates the system's capability to handle emotionally\nconflicted states, contextual distress factors, and complex psychological\nscenarios that traditional categorical emotion models cannot adequately\nrepresent. This work establishes a new mathematical foundation for emotion\nmodeling in artificial intelligence systems."}

Recent studies have explored the use of Bidirectional Encoder\nRepresentations from Transformers (BERT) models on transcription data to\nreliably detect meaningful CPS indicators. A notable advancement involved the\nmultimodal BERT variant, AudiBERT, which integrates speech and\nacoustic-prosodic audio features to enhance CPS diagnosis. Although initial\nresults demonstrated multimodal improvements, the statistical significance of\nthese enhancements remained unclear, and there was insufficient guidance on\nleveraging human-AI complementarity for CPS diagnosis tasks. This workshop\npaper extends the previous research by highlighting that the AudiBERT model not\nonly improved the classification of classes that were sparse in the dataset,\nbut it also had statistically significant class-wise improvements over the BERT\nmodel for classifications in the social-cognitive dimension. However, similar\nsignificant class-wise improvements over the BERT model were not observed for\nclassifications in the affective dimension. A correlation analysis highlighted\nthat larger training data was significantly associated with higher recall\nperformance for both the AudiBERT and BERT models. Additionally, the precision\nof the BERT model was significantly associated with high inter-rater agreement\namong human coders. When employing the BERT model to diagnose indicators within\nthese subskills that were well-detected by the AudiBERT model, the performance\nacross all indicators was inconsistent. We conclude the paper by outlining a\nstructured approach towards achieving human-AI complementarity for CPS\ndiagnosis, highlighting the crucial inclusion of model explainability to\nsupport human agency and engagement in the reflective coding process."}

Traditionally, developers estimate story points\ncollaboratively using planning poker or other manual techniques. While the\ninitial calibrating of the estimates to each project is helpful, once a team\nhas converged on a set of precedents, story point estimation can become tedious\nand labor-intensive. Machine learning can reduce this burden, but only with\nenough context from the historical decisions made by the project team. That is,\nstate-of-the-art models, such as GPT2SP and FastText-SVM, only make accurate\npredictions (within-project) when trained on data from the same project. The\ngoal of this work is to streamline story point estimation by evaluating a\ncomparative learning-based framework for calibrating project-specific story\npoint prediction models. Instead of assigning a specific story point value to\nevery backlog item, developers are presented with pairs of items, and indicate\nwhich item requires more effort. Using these comparative judgments, a machine\nlearning model is trained to predict the story point estimates. We empirically\nevaluated our technique using data with 23,313 manual estimates in 16 projects.\nThe model learned from comparative judgments can achieve on average 0.34\nSpearman's rank correlation coefficient between its predictions and the ground\ntruth story points.

Therefore, the\nproposed comparative learning approach is more efficient than state-of-the-art\nregression-based approaches according to the law of comparative judgments -\nproviding comparative judgments yields a lower cognitive burden on humans than\nproviding ratings or categorical labels."}

To assess\nwhether citizens can move freely within this unprecedented urban topology, we\ndevelop a hybrid simulation framework that integrates agent-based modeling,\nreinforcement learning, supervised learning, and graph neural networks. The\nsimulation captures multi-modal transportation behaviors across 50 vertical\nlevels and varying density scenarios using both synthetic data and real-world\ntraces from high-density cities. Our experiments reveal that with the full\nAI-integrated architecture, agents achieved an average commute time of 7.8 to\n8.4 minutes, a satisfaction rate exceeding 89 percent, and a reachability index\nof over 91 percent, even during peak congestion periods. Ablation studies\nconfirmed that the removal of intelligent modules such as reinforcement\nlearning or graph neural networks significantly degrades performance, with\ncommute times increasing by up to 85 percent and reachability falling below 70\npercent.

Thus, integrating an unspoken thought\nprocess into SLMs is highly desirable. While naively generating a complete\nchain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before starting to talk can enable thinking\nfor SLMs, this induces additional latency for the speech response, as the CoT\nreasoning can be arbitrarily long.

Traditional approaches treat interaction merely as an interface for\naccessing AI capabilities-a conduit between human intent and machine output.

As AI systems engage in extended thinking processes for research\ntasks, meaningful interaction transitions from an optional enhancement to an\nessential component of effective intelligence. Current deep research systems\nadopt an \"input-wait-output\" paradigm where users initiate queries and receive\nresults after black-box processing. This approach leads to error cascade\neffects, inflexible research boundaries that prevent question refinement during\ninvestigation, and missed opportunities for expertise integration. To address\nthese limitations, we introduce Deep Cognition, a system that transforms the\nhuman role from giving instructions to cognitive oversight-a mode of engagement\nwhere humans guide AI thinking processes through strategic intervention at\ncritical junctures. Deep cognition implements three key innovations:\n(1)Transparent, controllable, and interruptible interaction that reveals AI\nreasoning and enables intervention at any point; (2)Fine-grained bidirectional\ndialogue; and (3)Shared cognitive context where the system observes and adapts\nto user behaviors without explicit instruction.

We introduce\nStableAnimator++, the first ID-preserving video diffusion framework with\nlearnable pose alignment, capable of generating high-quality videos conditioned\non a reference image and a pose sequence without any post-processing. Building\nupon a video diffusion model, StableAnimator++ contains carefully designed\nmodules for both training and inference, striving for identity consistency. In\nparticular, StableAnimator++ first uses learnable layers to predict the\nsimilarity transformation matrices between the reference image and the driven\nposes via injecting guidance from Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). These\nmatrices align the driven poses with the reference image, mitigating\nmisalignment to a great extent. StableAnimator++ then computes image and face\nembeddings using off-the-shelf encoders, refining the face embeddings via a\nglobal content-aware Face Encoder.

To achieve robust and accurate performance\nin such scenarios, we propose DMD, a minutiae-anchored local dense\nrepresentation which captures both fine-grained ridge textures and\ndiscriminative minutiae features in a spatially structured manner.\nSpecifically, descriptors are extracted from local patches centered and\noriented on each detected minutia, forming a three-dimensional tensor, where\ntwo dimensions represent spatial locations on the fingerprint plane and the\nthird encodes semantic features. This representation explicitly captures\nabstract features of local image patches, enabling a multi-level, fine-grained\ndescription that aggregates information from multiple minutiae and their\nsurrounding ridge structures. Furthermore, thanks to its strong spatial\ncorrespondence with the patch image, DMD allows for the use of foreground\nsegmentation masks to identify valid descriptor regions.

RAda employs a\nlearned mask, obtained from a lightweight attention layer attached at the end\nof a VLM, to dynamically calibrate the contribution of each element in the\nrational matrix, enabling targeted adjustments to the final cross-modal\ninteractions without incurring costly modifications to intermediate features.\nExperiments in different settings (i.e., updating, or freezing pretrained\nencoders in adaptation, and test-time training that can only access the\nunlabeled test data) show that RAda serves as a versatile fine-tuning\ntechnique, improving the baseline with minimal code and performing comparably\nagainst current arts in most settings.

To overcome this limitation, we\npropose shifting the entire change detection workflow onboard satellites. This\nrequires to simultaneously solve challenges in data storage, image registration\nand change detection with a strict complexity constraint. In this paper, we\npresent a novel and efficient framework for onboard change detection that\naddresses the aforementioned challenges in an end-to-end fashion with a deep\nneural network composed of three interlinked submodules: (1) image compression,\ntailored to minimize onboard data storage resources; (2) lightweight\nco-registration of non-orthorectified multi-temporal image pairs; and (3) a\nnovel temporally-invariant and computationally efficient change detection\nmodel. This is the first approach in the literature combining all these tasks\nin a single end-to-end framework with the constraints dictated by onboard\nprocessing.

In\nparticular, SeC achieves an 11.8-point improvement over SAM 2.1 on SeCVOS,\nestablishing a new state-of-the-art in concept-aware video object segmentation."}

We observe that\nmodern generative models share a conceptually similar training objective --\nreconstructing clean signals from corrupted inputs such as Gaussian noise or\nmasking -- a process we term denoising. Motivated by this insight, we propose\naligning tokenizer embeddings directly with the downstream denoising objective,\nencouraging latent embeddings to be more easily reconstructed even when heavily\ncorrupted. To achieve this, we introduce the Latent Denoising Tokenizer\n(l-DeTok), a simple yet effective tokenizer trained to reconstruct clean images\nfrom latent embeddings corrupted by interpolative noise and random masking.\nExtensive experiments on ImageNet 256x256 demonstrate that our tokenizer\nconsistently outperforms standard tokenizers across six representative\ngenerative models. Our findings highlight denoising as a fundamental design\nprinciple for tokenizer development, and we hope it could motivate new\nperspectives for future tokenizer design."}

Our work explores novel view\nsynthesis methods that efficiently reconstruct complex scenes without explicit\nuse of scene geometries.

The\napplication to inverse rendering still faces several challenges, as the\ndiscrete nature of Gaussian primitives makes it difficult to apply geometry\nconstraints. Recent works introduce the signed distance field (SDF) as an extra\ncontinuous representation to regularize the geometry defined by Gaussian\nprimitives. It improves the decomposition quality, at the cost of increasing\nmemory usage and complicating training. Unlike these works, we introduce a\ndiscretized SDF to represent the continuous SDF in a discrete manner by\nencoding it within each Gaussian using a sampled value. This approach allows us\nto link the SDF with the Gaussian opacity through an SDF-to-opacity\ntransformation, enabling rendering the SDF via splatting and avoiding the\ncomputational cost of ray marching.The key challenge is to regularize the\ndiscrete samples to be consistent with the underlying SDF, as the discrete\nrepresentation can hardly apply the gradient-based constraints (\\eg Eikonal\nloss). For this, we project Gaussians onto the zero-level set of SDF and\nenforce alignment with the surface from splatting, namely a projection-based\nconsistency loss.
