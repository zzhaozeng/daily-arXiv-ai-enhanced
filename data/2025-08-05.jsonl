The use of stereoscopic 3D graph visualisations has gained\nattraction over the last years, and results from several studies indicate that\nthey can improve analysis efficiency for a range of analysis scenarios.

Video\nframe prediction has critical applications in weather forecasting or autonomous\nsystems and can provide technical improvements, such as video compression and\nstreaming. Among Artificial Intelligence methods, Deep Learning has emerged as\nhighly effective for solving vision-related tasks, although current frame\nprediction models still have room for enhancement. This paper evaluates several\nhybrid deep learning approaches that combine the feature extraction\ncapabilities of autoencoders with temporal sequence modelling using Recurrent\nNeural Networks (RNNs), 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs), and related\narchitectures. The proposed solutions were rigorously evaluated on three\ndatasets that differ in terms of synthetic versus real-world scenarios and\ngrayscale versus color imagery.

With this lens, we dissect CoT reasoning\nvia three dimensions: task, length, and format. To investigate each dimension,\nwe design DataAlchemy, an isolated and controlled environment to train LLMs\nfrom scratch and systematically probe them under various distribution\nconditions. Our results reveal that CoT reasoning is a brittle mirage that\nvanishes when it is pushed beyond training distributions. This work offers a\ndeeper understanding of why and when CoT reasoning fails, emphasizing the\nongoing challenge of achieving genuine and generalizable reasoning."}

The method transforms\nfault detection into a hypothesis testing task by defining a nonconformity\nmeasure based on model residuals. It then leverages a calibration dataset to\ncompute p-values for new samples, which are used to construct prediction sets\nmathematically guaranteed to contain the true label with a user-specified\nprobability, $1-\\alpha$.

These\nmodels provide an alternative to traditional autoregressive approaches by\nframing text generation as an iterative denoising process.

Programming languages differ from natural language in\nthat they follow strict syntactic and semantic rules, with hierarchical\norganization that must be preserved for correctness. Standard token-level\ncorruption techniques used during training often ignore this structure, which\nmay hinder the model's ability to learn meaningful representations of code. To\naddress this limitation, we propose a syntax-aware diffusion framework that\nincorporates structural priors from Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) into the\ndenoising process. Instead of masking individual tokens at random, we\nselectively corrupt syntactically meaningful code spans derived from AST\nsubtrees. This enables the model to reconstruct programs in a way that respects\ngrammatical boundaries and captures long-range dependencies. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that syntax-aware corruption significantly improves\nsyntactic correctness, reconstruction accuracy, and generalization to unseen\ncode patterns. These findings highlight the potential of incorporating\nstructural information into diffusion-based training and suggest that\nsyntax-guided denoising is a promising direction for advancing diffusion-based\nlanguage models in code generation tasks."}

Existing benchmarking and evaluation methods investigate planning with\nLLMs, focusing primarily on success rate as a quality indicator in various\nplanning tasks, such as validating plans or planning in relaxed conditions. In\nthis paper, we approach planning with LLMs as a natural language processing\n(NLP) task, given that LLMs are NLP models themselves. We propose a recovery\npipeline consisting of an NLP-based evaluation of the generated plans, along\nwith three stages to recover the plans through NLP manipulation of the\nLLM-generated plans, and eventually complete the plan using a symbolic planner.\nThis pipeline provides a holistic analysis of LLM capabilities in the context\nof AI task planning, enabling a broader understanding of the quality of invalid\nplans.

To\naddress these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that\nenables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach\nrevisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations:\nrevision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables\ntwo critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by\nintelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories,\nand (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance\nperformance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through\nthese mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that\nincrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench\nVerified to resolve real-world GitHub issues.

To address this issue, this paper proposes a Full-stage\nRefined Proposal (FRP) algorithm aimed at eliminating these false positives\nwithin a two-stage CNN-based pedestrian detection framework. The main\ninnovation of this work lies in employing various pedestrian feature\nre-evaluation strategies to filter out low-quality pedestrian proposals during\nboth the training and testing stages. Specifically, in the training phase, the\nTraining mode FRP algorithm (TFRP) introduces a novel approach for validating\npedestrian proposals to effectively guide the model training process, thereby\nconstructing a model with strong capabilities for false positive suppression.\nDuring the inference phase, two innovative strategies are implemented: the\nClassifier-guided FRP (CFRP) algorithm integrates a pedestrian classifier into\nthe proposal generation pipeline to yield high-quality proposals through\npedestrian feature evaluation, and the Split-proposal FRP (SFRP) algorithm\nvertically divides all proposals, sending both the original and the sub-region\nproposals to the subsequent subnetwork to evaluate their confidence scores,\nfiltering out those with lower sub-region pedestrian confidence scores. As a\nresult, the proposed algorithm enhances the model's ability to suppress\npedestrian false positives across all stages.

A core challenge in RLVR involves managing the exchange between entropy\nand performance of policies. Despite the importance of this exchange, a\nfine-grained understanding of when and how this exchange operates most\neffectively remains limited. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic\nempirical analysis of the entropy-performance exchange mechanism of RLVR across\ndifferent levels of granularity. Specifically, we first divide the training\nprocess into two distinct stages based on entropy dynamics, i.e., rising stage\nand plateau stage, and then systematically investigate how this mechanism\nvaries across stage-level, instance-level, and token-level granularitiess. Our\nanalysis reveals that, in the rising stage, entropy reduction in negative\nsamples facilitates the learning of effective reasoning patterns, which in turn\ndrives rapid performance gains.

Prior works primarily address this issue by reducing response\nlength, without fully examining the underlying semantic structure of the\nreasoning process. In this paper, we revisit overthinking by decomposing it\ninto two distinct forms: internal redundancy, which consists of\nlow-contribution reasoning steps within the first correct solution (FCS), and\nexternal redundancy, which refers to unnecessary continuation after the FCS. To\nmitigate both forms, we propose a dual-penalty reinforcement learning\nframework.

Meanwhile, LaMPE devises a novel multi-grained attention\nmechanism that strategically allocates positional resolution across different\nsequence regions to capture both fine-grained locality and long-range\ndependencies. Our method can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of\nRoPE-based LLMs without training. Extensive experiments on three representative\nLLMs across five mainstream long-context benchmarks demonstrate that LaMPE\nachieves significant performance improvements compared to existing length\nextrapolation methods. The code will be released at\nhttps://github.com/scar-on/LaMPE."}

However,\nexisting research primarily investigates TTS in single-stage tasks; while many\nreal-world problems are multi-stage complex tasks, composed of a sequence of\nheterogeneous subtasks with each subtask requires LLM of specific capability.\nTherefore, we study a novel problem: the test-time compute-optimal scaling in\nmulti-stage complex tasks, aiming to select suitable models and allocate\nbudgets per subtask to maximize overall performance. TTS in multi-stage tasks\nintroduces two fundamental challenges: (i) The combinatorial search space of\nmodel and budget allocations, combined with the high cost of inference, makes\nbrute-force search impractical. (ii) The optimal model and budget allocations\nacross subtasks are interdependent, increasing the complexity of the\ncompute-optimal search.

To address this issue, this paper proposes a Full-stage\nRefined Proposal (FRP) algorithm aimed at eliminating these false positives\nwithin a two-stage CNN-based pedestrian detection framework. The main\ninnovation of this work lies in employing various pedestrian feature\nre-evaluation strategies to filter out low-quality pedestrian proposals during\nboth the training and testing stages. Specifically, in the training phase, the\nTraining mode FRP algorithm (TFRP) introduces a novel approach for validating\npedestrian proposals to effectively guide the model training process, thereby\nconstructing a model with strong capabilities for false positive suppression.\nDuring the inference phase, two innovative strategies are implemented: the\nClassifier-guided FRP (CFRP) algorithm integrates a pedestrian classifier into\nthe proposal generation pipeline to yield high-quality proposals through\npedestrian feature evaluation, and the Split-proposal FRP (SFRP) algorithm\nvertically divides all proposals, sending both the original and the sub-region\nproposals to the subsequent subnetwork to evaluate their confidence scores,\nfiltering out those with lower sub-region pedestrian confidence scores. As a\nresult, the proposed algorithm enhances the model's ability to suppress\npedestrian false positives across all stages.

This paper, developed for the\nMSLR 2025 Workshop Challenge at ICCV 2025, addresses the critical challenge of\nsigner-independent recognition to advance the generalization capabilities of\nCSLR systems across diverse signers. A data-centric methodology is proposed,\ncentered on systematic feature engineering, a robust preprocessing pipeline,\nand an optimized model architecture. Key contributions include a principled\nfeature selection process guided by Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to isolate\ncommunicative keypoints, a rigorous preprocessing pipeline incorporating\nDBSCAN-based outlier filtering and spatial normalization, and the novel\nCSLRConformer architecture. This architecture adapts the hybrid CNN-Transformer\ndesign of the Conformer model, leveraging its capacity to model local temporal\ndependencies and global sequence context; a characteristic uniquely suited for\nthe spatio-temporal dynamics of sign language. The proposed methodology\nachieved a competitive performance, with a Word Error Rate (WER) of 5.60% on\nthe development set and 12.01% on the test set, a result that secured a 3rd\nplace ranking on the official competition platform.

To address these issues, we propose the Context Guided\nTransformer (CGT) entropy model, which estimates probability mass functions of\nthe current frame conditioned on resampled temporal context and\ndependency-weighted spatial context. A temporal context resampler learns\npredefined latent queries to extract critical temporal information using\ntransformer encoders, reducing downstream computational overhead. Meanwhile, a\nteacher-student network is designed as dependency-weighted spatial context\nassigner to explicitly model the dependency of spatial context order.

This lexical overuse can be seen as a sort of misalignment, though our\nstudy highlights the potential divergence between the lexical expectations of\ndifferent populations -- namely LHF workers versus LLM users. Our work\ncontributes to the growing body of research on explainable artificial\nintelligence and emphasizes the importance of both data and procedural\ntransparency in alignment research."}

This limitation has led to efforts to generate images\nconditioned on user-provided images, referred to as image prompts. Recent work\nmodifies the self-attention mechanism to impose image conditions in generated\nimages by replacing or concatenating the keys and values from the image prompt.\nThis enables the self-attention layer to work like a cross-attention layer,\ngenerally used to incorporate text prompts. In this paper, we identify two\ncommon issues in existing methods of modifying self-attention to generate\nimages that reflect the details of image prompts. First, existing approaches\nneglect the importance of image prompts in classifier-free guidance.\nSpecifically, current methods use image prompts as both desired and undesired\nconditions in classifier-free guidance, causing conflicting signals. To resolve\nthis, we propose conflict-free guidance by using image prompts only as desired\nconditions, ensuring that the generated image faithfully reflects the image\nprompt. In addition, we observe that the two most common self-attention\nmodifications involve a trade-off between the realism of the generated image\nand alignment with the image prompt. Specifically, selecting more keys and\nvalues from the image prompt improves alignment, while selecting more from the\ngenerated image enhances realism. To balance both, we propose an new\nself-attention modification method, Stratified Attention to jointly use keys\nand values from both images rather than selecting between them.

However, their low inference speed limits their\ndeployment in low-resource applications. Recent training-free approaches\nexploit the redundancy of features across timesteps by caching and reusing past\nrepresentations to accelerate inference. Building on this idea, TaylorSeer\ninstead uses cached features to predict future ones via Taylor expansion.\nHowever, its module-level prediction across all transformer blocks (e.g.,\nattention or feedforward modules) requires storing fine-grained intermediate\nfeatures, leading to notable memory and computation overhead.

Despite their advancements,\nthe evaluation of MLLMs on VQA benchmarks often relies on point estimates,\noverlooking the significant variance in performance caused by factors such as\nstochastic model outputs, training seed sensitivity, and hyperparameter\nconfigurations. This paper critically examines these issues by analyzing\nvariance across 14 widely used VQA benchmarks, covering diverse tasks such as\nvisual reasoning, text understanding, and commonsense reasoning. We\nsystematically study the impact of training seed, framework non-determinism,\nmodel scale, and extended instruction finetuning on performance variability.\nAdditionally, we explore Cloze-style evaluation as an alternate assessment\nstrategy, studying its effectiveness in reducing stochasticity and improving\nreliability across benchmarks. Our findings highlight the limitations of\ncurrent evaluation practices and advocate for variance-aware methodologies to\nfoster more robust and reliable development of MLLMs."}

The workflow comprises two stages:\n1) Target Modeling: achieving object-centralized reconstruction through dynamic\nscene decomposition and an improved point density control; 2) Motion Recovery:\nrestoring full motion sequences by learning per-frame SE(3) poses. We introduce\nan acceleration consistency constraint to bridge Newtonian mechanics and pose\nestimation, and design a dynamic simulated annealing strategy that adaptively\nschedules learning rates based on motion states.

Additionally, under the RLVR framework, a key,\ncounter-intuitive finding is that training on our curated text-only reasoning\ndata provides a more substantial performance boost than training on multimodal\nimage-text data.

In this\npaper, we propose a novel method, termed the Multi-Criteria Guidance with\nIn-Betweening Motion Model (MCG-IMM), for in-betweening human motion\ngeneration. A key strength of MCG-IMM lies in its plug-and-play nature: it\nenhances the diversity of motions generated by pretrained models without\nintroducing additional parameters This is achieved by providing a sampling\nprocess of pretrained generative models with multi-criteria guidance.\nSpecifically, MCG-IMM reformulates the sampling process of pretrained\ngenerative model as a multi-criteria optimization problem, and introduces an\noptimization process to explore motion sequences that satisfy multiple\ncriteria, e.g., diversity and smoothness. Moreover, our proposed plug-and-play\nmulti-criteria guidance is compatible with different families of generative\nmodels, including denoised diffusion probabilistic models, variational\nautoencoders, and generative adversarial networks.

However, its clinical deployment is\nhindered by three major sources of uncertainty. First, visual uncertainty,\ncaused by noisy or incorrect view annotations, compromises feature extraction.\nSecond, label distribution uncertainty, stemming from long-tailed disease\nprevalence, biases models against rare but clinically critical conditions.\nThird, contextual uncertainty, introduced by unverified historical reports,\noften leads to factual hallucinations. These challenges collectively limit the\nreliability and clinical trustworthiness of MRG systems. To address these\nissues, we propose SURE-Med, a unified framework that systematically reduces\nuncertainty across three critical dimensions: visual, distributional, and\ncontextual. To mitigate visual uncertainty, a Frontal-Aware View Repair\nResampling module corrects view annotation errors and adaptively selects\ninformative features from supplementary views. To tackle label distribution\nuncertainty, we introduce a Token Sensitive Learning objective that enhances\nthe modeling of critical diagnostic sentences while reweighting\nunderrepresented diagnostic terms, thereby improving sensitivity to infrequent\nconditions. To reduce contextual uncertainty, our Contextual Evidence Filter\nvalidates and selectively incorporates prior information that aligns with the\ncurrent image, effectively suppressing hallucinations.

To address this limitation, we propose ROVER (Reasoning Over VidEo\nRecursively), a framework that enables the model to recursively decompose\nlong-horizon video trajectories into segments corresponding to shorter subtasks\nwithin the trajectory. In doing so, ROVER facilitates more focused and accurate\nreasoning over temporally localized frame sequences without losing global\ncontext. We evaluate ROVER, implemented using an in-context learning approach,\non diverse OpenX Embodiment videos and on a new dataset derived from RoboCasa\nthat consists of 543 videos showing both expert and perturbed non-expert\ntrajectories across 27 robotic manipulation tasks. ROVER outperforms strong\nbaselines across three video reasoning tasks: task progress estimation,\nframe-level natural language reasoning, and video question answering.
