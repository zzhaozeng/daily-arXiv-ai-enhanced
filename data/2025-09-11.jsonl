However, the\ninternal workflow of these systems have not been closely examined. This lack of\nscrutiny poses a risk of introducing flaws that could undermine the integrity,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of their research outputs. In this paper, we\nidentify four potential failure modes in contemporary AI scientist systems:\ninappropriate benchmark selection, data leakage, metric misuse, and post-hoc\nselection bias. To examine these risks, we design controlled experiments that\nisolate each failure mode while addressing challenges unique to evaluating AI\nscientist systems. Our assessment of two prominent open-source AI scientist\nsystems reveals the presence of several failures, across a spectrum of\nseverity, which can be easily overlooked in practice. Finally, we demonstrate\nthat access to trace logs and code from the full automated workflow enables far\nmore effective detection of such failures than examining the final paper alone.\nWe thus recommend journals and conferences evaluating AI-generated research to\nmandate submission of these artifacts alongside the paper to ensure\ntransparency, accountability, and reproducibility."}

In this paper, we propose a Similarity-Driven\nCross-Granularity Pre-training (SimCroP) framework on chest CTs, which combines\nsimilarity-driven alignment and cross-granularity fusion to improve radiograph\ninterpretation. We first leverage multi-modal masked modeling to optimize the\nencoder for understanding precise low-level semantics from radiographs.

However, LLM outputs vary significantly depending on the\nimplementation choices made by researchers (e.g., model selection, prompting\nstrategy, or temperature settings). Such variation can introduce systematic\nbiases and random errors, which propagate to downstream analyses and cause Type\nI, Type II, Type S, or Type M errors. We call this LLM hacking.\n  We quantify the risk of LLM hacking by replicating 37 data annotation tasks\nfrom 21 published social science research studies with 18 different models.\nAnalyzing 13 million LLM labels, we test 2,361 realistic hypotheses to measure\nhow plausible researcher choices affect statistical conclusions. We find\nincorrect conclusions based on LLM-annotated data in approximately one in three\nhypotheses for state-of-the-art models, and in half the hypotheses for small\nlanguage models.

However, LLM outputs vary significantly depending on the\nimplementation choices made by researchers (e.g., model selection, prompting\nstrategy, or temperature settings). Such variation can introduce systematic\nbiases and random errors, which propagate to downstream analyses and cause Type\nI, Type II, Type S, or Type M errors. We call this LLM hacking.\n  We quantify the risk of LLM hacking by replicating 37 data annotation tasks\nfrom 21 published social science research studies with 18 different models.\nAnalyzing 13 million LLM labels, we test 2,361 realistic hypotheses to measure\nhow plausible researcher choices affect statistical conclusions. We find\nincorrect conclusions based on LLM-annotated data in approximately one in three\nhypotheses for state-of-the-art models, and in half the hypotheses for small\nlanguage models. While our findings show that higher task performance and\nbetter general model capabilities reduce LLM hacking risk, even highly accurate\nmodels do not completely eliminate it. The risk of LLM hacking decreases as\neffect sizes increase, indicating the need for more rigorous verification of\nfindings near significance thresholds. Our extensive analysis of LLM hacking\nmitigation techniques emphasizes the importance of human annotations in\nreducing false positive findings and improving model selection.

Its early cutaneous manifestations are clinically\nsignificant but often underdiagnosed, particularly in rural areas with limited\naccess to dermatologists. Automated, image-based diagnostic solutions can\nsupport early detection and timely interventions.\n  Methods: In this study, we propose an end-to-end framework for arsenicosis\ndiagnosis using mobile phone-captured skin images. A dataset comprising 20\nclasses and over 11000 images of arsenic-induced and other dermatological\nconditions was curated. Multiple deep learning architectures, including\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models, were\nbenchmarked for arsenicosis detection. Model interpretability was integrated\nvia LIME and Grad-CAM, while deployment feasibility was demonstrated through a\nweb-based diagnostic tool.\n  Results: Transformer-based models significantly outperformed CNNs, with the\nSwin Transformer achieving the best results (86\\\\% accuracy). LIME and Grad-CAM\nvisualizations confirmed that the models attended to lesion-relevant regions,\nincreasing clinical transparency and aiding in error analysis. The framework\nalso demonstrated strong performance on external validation samples, confirming\nits ability to generalize beyond the curated dataset.\n  Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates the potential of deep\nlearning for non-invasive, accessible, and explainable diagnosis of arsenicosis\nfrom mobile-acquired images. By enabling reliable image-based screening, it can\nserve as a practical diagnostic aid in rural and resource-limited communities,\nwhere access to dermatologists is scarce, thereby supporting early detection\nand timely intervention."}

We analyze the accuracy of an\nEBC star tracking system utilizing the Earth's motion as the ground truth for\ncomparison. The Earth rotates in a regular way with very small irregularities\nwhich are measured to the level of milli-arcseconds. By keeping an event camera\nstatic and pointing it through a ground-based telescope at the night sky, we\ncreate a system where the only camera motion in the celestial reference frame\nis that induced by the Earth's rotation. The resulting event stream is\nprocessed to generate estimates of orientation which we compare to the\nInternational Earth Rotation and Reference System (IERS) measured orientation\nof the Earth. The event camera system is able to achieve a root mean squared\nacross error of 18.47 arcseconds and an about error of 78.84 arcseconds.\nCombined with the other benefits of event cameras over framing sensors (reduced\ncomputation due to sparser data streams, higher dynamic range, lower energy\nconsumption, faster update rates), this level of accuracy suggests the utility\nof event cameras for low-cost and low-latency star tracking.

State-of-the-art methods\ntypically rely on a coarse-to-fine mechanism where a single correspondent\nhypothesis is produced per source location at each scale. In challenging cases\n-- such as at depth discontinuities or when the target image is a strong\nzoom-in of the source image -- the correspondents of neighboring source\nlocations are often widely spread and predicting a single correspondent\nhypothesis per source location at each scale may lead to erroneous matches. In\nthis paper, we investigate the idea of predicting multiple correspondent\nhypotheses per source location at each scale instead. We consider a beam search\nstrategy to propagat multiple hypotheses at each scale and propose integrating\nthese multiple hypotheses into cross-attention layers, resulting in a novel\ndense matching architecture called BEAMER. BEAMER learns to preserve and\npropagate multiple hypotheses across scales, making it significantly more\nrobust than state-of-the-art methods, especially at depth discontinuities or\nwhen the target image is a strong zoom-in of the source image."}

It primarily due to fundamental limitations in\nexisting approaches: CLIP-based RMs suffer from architectural and input\nmodality constraints, while prevalent Bradley-Terry losses are fundamentally\nmisaligned with the next-token prediction mechanism of Vision-Language Models\n(VLMs), hindering effective scaling. More critically, the RLHF optimization\nprocess is plagued by Reward Hacking issue, where models exploit flaws in the\nreward signal without improving true quality. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce RewardDance, a scalable reward modeling framework that overcomes\nthese barriers through a novel generative reward paradigm. By reformulating the\nreward score as the model's probability of predicting a \"yes\" token, indicating\nthat the generated image outperforms a reference image according to specific\ncriteria, RewardDance intrinsically aligns reward objectives with VLM\narchitectures. This alignment unlocks scaling across two dimensions: (1) Model\nScaling: Systematic scaling of RMs up to 26 billion parameters; (2) Context\nScaling: Integration of task-specific instructions, reference examples, and\nchain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nRewardDance significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods in text-to-image,\ntext-to-video, and image-to-video generation. Crucially, we resolve the\npersistent challenge of \"reward hacking\": Our large-scale RMs exhibit and\nmaintain high reward variance during RL fine-tuning, proving their resistance\nto hacking and ability to produce diverse, high-quality outputs. It greatly\nrelieves the mode collapse problem that plagues smaller models."}
