To address this, we intent to improve\nthe multi-programming-lingual (MultiPL) performance of the base LLMs while\nretaining the most popular ones using restricted computational resources. We\nconsider MultiPL to be a special case of multiple natural languages and propose\na MultiPL extension of LLMs utilizing a hybrid mixture of experts (MoE), called\nMultiPL-MoE. Specifically, MultiPL-MoE combines two paired MoEs to optimize\nexpert selection at both the token and segment levels. The token-level MoE is a\nstandard upcycling MoE structure with a shared expert and a novel gate weight\nnormalization approach that aids in the final fusion with the segment-level\nMoE. The segment-level MoE incorporates two innovative designs to better\ncapture the syntactic structure and contextual patterns of programming\nlanguages: First, using a sliding window to partition the input token sequence\ninto multiple segments; Then, adopting an expert-choice routing strategy that\nallows experts to select the top-k segments.

This\nin-depth review presents a structured exploration of the state-of-the-art in\nLVLMs, systematically organized through a three-step research review process.\nFirst, we discuss the functioning of vision language models (VLMs) for object\ndetection, describing how these models harness natural language processing\n(NLP) and computer vision (CV) techniques to revolutionize object detection and\nlocalization. We then explain the architectural innovations, training\nparadigms, and output flexibility of recent LVLMs for object detection,\nhighlighting how they achieve advanced contextual understanding for object\ndetection. The review thoroughly examines the approaches used in integration of\nvisual and textual information, demonstrating the progress made in object\ndetection using VLMs that facilitate more sophisticated object detection and\nlocalization strategies. This review presents comprehensive visualizations\ndemonstrating LVLMs' effectiveness in diverse scenarios including localization\nand segmentation, and then compares their real-time performance, adaptability,\nand complexity to traditional deep learning systems. Based on the review, its\nis expected that LVLMs will soon meet or surpass the performance of\nconventional methods in object detection.

This question is especially timely as new humor types\ncontinuously emerge in online and social media contexts (e.g., memes,\nanti-humor, AI fails). If Large Language Models (LLMs) are to keep up with this\nevolving landscape, they must be able to generalize across humor types by\ncapturing deeper, transferable mechanisms. To investigate this, we conduct a\nseries of transfer learning experiments across four datasets, representing\ndifferent humor tasks. We train LLMs under varied diversity settings (1-3\ndatasets in training, testing on a novel task).

To tackle these problems, this paper introduces ReST-RL, a\nunified LLM RL paradigm that significantly improves LLM's code reasoning\nability by combining an improved GRPO algorithm with a meticulously designed\ntest time decoding method assisted by a value model (VM). As the first stage of\npolicy reinforcement, ReST-GRPO adopts an optimized ReST algorithm to filter\nand assemble high-value training data, increasing the reward variance of GRPO\nsampling, thus improving the effectiveness and efficiency of training. After\nthe basic reasoning ability of LLM policy has been improved, we further propose\na test time decoding optimization method called VM-MCTS.

Several habitat\nclassification schemes are in use, typically based on analysis of satellite\nimagery with validation by field ecologists.

In collaboration with Natural England,\na public sector organisation responsible for nature conservation in England,\nthis study develops a classification system that applies deep learning to\nground-level habitat photographs, categorising each image into one of 18\nclasses defined by the 'Living England' framework. Images were pre-processed\nusing resizing, normalisation, and augmentation; re-sampling was used to\nbalance classes in the training data and enhance model robustness. We developed\nand fine-tuned a DeepLabV3-ResNet101 classifier to assign a habitat class label\nto each photograph. Using five-fold cross-validation, the model demonstrated\nstrong overall performance across 18 habitat classes, with accuracy and\nF1-scores varying between classes. Across all folds, the model achieved a mean\nF1-score of 0.61, with visually distinct habitats such as Bare Soil, Silt and\nPeat (BSSP) and Bare Sand (BS) reaching values above 0.90, and mixed or\nambiguous classes scoring lower.

Existing methods typically\norganize these intermediate features as 2D bird's-eye-view (BEV)\nrepresentations, which discard critical fine-grained 3D structural cues\nessential for accurate object recognition and localization. To this end, we\nfirst introduce point-level tokens as intermediate representations for\ncollaborative perception. However, point-cloud data are inherently unordered,\nmassive, and position-sensitive, making it challenging to produce compact and\naligned point-level token sequences that preserve detailed structural\ninformation. Therefore, we present CoPLOT, a novel Collaborative perception\nframework that utilizes Point-Level Optimized Tokens. It incorporates a\npoint-native processing pipeline, including token reordering, sequence\nmodeling, and multi-agent spatial alignment. A semantic-aware token reordering\nmodule generates adaptive 1D reorderings by leveraging scene-level and\ntoken-level semantic information. A frequency-enhanced state space model\ncaptures long-range sequence dependencies across both spatial and spectral\ndomains, improving the differentiation between foreground tokens and background\nclutter.

As a result, VLMs receive sparse visual signals and often\nlearn to prioritize language-based reasoning over visual perception. To\nmitigate this, some existing methods add visual supervision using human\nannotations or distilled labels from external large models.

First, it affords us a lens through which to examine\nambiguity and pragmatics in LLMs, since exploiting a loophole requires\nidentifying ambiguity and performing sophisticated pragmatic reasoning. Second,\nloopholes pose an interesting and novel alignment problem where the model is\npresented with conflicting goals and can exploit ambiguities to its own\nadvantage. To address these questions, we design scenarios where LLMs are given\na goal and an ambiguous user instruction in conflict with the goal, with\nscenarios covering scalar implicature, structural ambiguities, and power\ndynamics. We then measure different models' abilities to exploit loopholes to\nsatisfy their given goals as opposed to the goals of the user. We find that\nboth closed-source and stronger open-source models can identify ambiguities and\nexploit their resulting loopholes, presenting a potential AI safety risk. Our\nanalysis indicates that models which exploit loopholes explicitly identify and\nreason about both ambiguity and conflicting goals."}

TrajFusionNet comprises two branches:\na Sequence Attention Module (SAM) and a Visual Attention Module (VAM). The SAM\nbranch learns from a sequential representation of the observed and predicted\npedestrian trajectory and vehicle speed. Complementarily, the VAM branch\nenables learning from a visual representation of the predicted pedestrian\ntrajectory by overlaying predicted pedestrian bounding boxes onto scene images.\nBy utilizing a small number of lightweight modalities, TrajFusionNet achieves\nthe lowest total inference time (including model runtime and data\npreprocessing) among current state-of-the-art approaches. In terms of\nperformance, it achieves state-of-the-art results across the three most\ncommonly used datasets for pedestrian crossing intention prediction."}

However, their inference remains slower than that of\nautoregressive models, primarily due to the cost of bidirectional attention and\nthe large number of refinement steps required for high quality outputs. In this\nwork, we highlight and leverage an overlooked property of DLMs early answer\nconvergence: in many cases, the correct answer can be internally identified by\nhalf steps before the final decoding step, both under semi-autoregressive and\nrandom remasking schedules. For example, on GSM8K and MMLU, up to 97% and 99%\nof instances, respectively, can be decoded correctly using only half of the\nrefinement steps. Building on this observation, we introduce Prophet, a\ntraining-free fast decoding paradigm that enables early commit decoding.\nSpecifically, Prophet dynamically decides whether to continue refinement or to\ngo \"all-in\" (i.e., decode all remaining tokens in one step), using the\nconfidence gap between the top-2 prediction candidates as the criterion. It\nintegrates seamlessly into existing DLM implementations, incurs negligible\noverhead, and requires no additional training. Empirical evaluations of\nLLaDA-8B and Dream-7B across multiple tasks show that Prophet reduces the\nnumber of decoding steps by up to 3.4x while preserving high generation\nquality. These results recast DLM decoding as a problem of when to stop\nsampling, and demonstrate that early decode convergence provides a simple yet\npowerful mechanism for accelerating DLM inference, complementary to existing\nspeedup techniques.

Towards this goal,\nwe establish a new benchmark for ITTA, integrating single image TTA methods for\nVLMs with active labeling techniques that query an oracle for samples\npotentially representing unseen classes during test time. We propose a\nsegmentation assisted active labeling module, termed SegAssist, which is\ntraining free and repurposes the segmentation capabilities of VLMs to refine\nactive sample selection, prioritizing samples likely to belong to unseen\nclasses. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the\npotential of SegAssist to enhance the performance of VLMs in real world\nscenarios, where continuous adaptation to emerging data is essential.\nProject-page:https://manogna-s.github.io/segassist/"}

We introduce OpenM3D, a novel open-vocabulary multi-view\nindoor 3D object detector trained without human annotations. In particular,\nOpenM3D is a single-stage detector adapting the 2D-induced voxel features from\nthe ImGeoNet model. To support OV, it is jointly trained with a class-agnostic\n3D localization loss requiring high-quality 3D pseudo boxes and a\nvoxel-semantic alignment loss requiring diverse pre-trained CLIP features. We\nfollow the training setting of OV-3DET where posed RGB-D images are given but\nno human annotations of 3D boxes or classes are available. We propose a 3D\nPseudo Box Generation method using a graph embedding technique that combines 2D\nsegments into coherent 3D structures. Our pseudo-boxes achieve higher precision\nand recall than other methods, including the method proposed in OV-3DET. We\nfurther sample diverse CLIP features from 2D segments associated with each\ncoherent 3D structure to align with the corresponding voxel feature. The key to\ntraining a highly accurate single-stage detector requires both losses to be\nlearned toward high-quality targets. At inference, OpenM3D, a highly efficient\ndetector, requires only multi-view images for input and demonstrates superior\naccuracy and speed (0.3 sec. per scene) on ScanNet200 and ARKitScenes indoor\nbenchmarks compared to existing methods. We outperform a strong two-stage\nmethod that leverages our class-agnostic detector with a ViT CLIP-based OV\nclassifier and a baseline incorporating multi-view depth estimator on both\naccuracy and speed."}

Most existing approaches embed multi-modal data into a\njoint feature space to maximize the similarity of paired images. However, these\nmethods typically assume perfect alignment of image pairs during training,\nwhich rarely holds true in real-world scenarios. In practice, factors such as\nurban canyon effects, electromagnetic interference, and adverse weather\nfrequently induce GPS drift, resulting in systematic alignment shifts where\nonly partial correspondences exist between pairs. Despite its prevalence, this\nsource of noisy correspondence has received limited attention in current\nresearch. In this paper, we formally introduce and address the Noisy\nCorrespondence on Cross-View Geo-Localization (NC-CVGL) problem, aiming to\nbridge the gap between idealized benchmarks and practical applications. To this\nend, we propose PAUL (Partition and Augmentation by Uncertainty Learning), a\nnovel framework that partitions and augments training data based on estimated\ndata uncertainty through uncertainty-aware co-augmentation and evidential\nco-training. Specifically, PAUL selectively augments regions with high\ncorrespondence confidence and utilizes uncertainty estimation to refine feature\nlearning, effectively suppressing noise from misaligned pairs. Distinct from\ntraditional filtering or label correction, PAUL leverages both data uncertainty\nand loss discrepancy for targeted partitioning and augmentation, thus providing\nrobust supervision for noisy samples. Comprehensive experiments validate the\neffectiveness of individual components in PAUL,which consistently achieves\nsuperior performance over other competitive noisy-correspondence-driven methods\nin various noise ratios."}
