This scene-adaptive LVQ (SALVQ) strikes a\nbalance between the R-D efficiency of vector quantization and the low\ncomplexity of USQ. SALVQ can be seamlessly integrated into existing 3DGS\ncompression architectures, enhancing their R-D performance with minimal\nmodifications and computational overhead. Moreover, by scaling the lattice\nbasis vectors, SALVQ can dynamically adjust lattice density, enabling a single\nmodel to accommodate multiple bit rate targets. This flexibility eliminates the\nneed to train separate models for different compression levels, significantly\nreducing training time and memory consumption."}

Recent weakly supervised\nmethods improve registration by incorporating anatomical priors such as\nsegmentation masks or landmarks, either as inputs or in the loss function.\nHowever, such weak labels are often not readily available, limiting their\npractical use. Motivated by the strong representation learning ability of\nvisual foundation models, this paper introduces SAMIR, an efficient medical\nimage registration framework that utilizes the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to\nenhance feature extraction. SAM is pretrained on large-scale natural image\ndatasets and can learn robust, general-purpose visual representations. Rather\nthan using raw input images, we design a task-specific adaptation pipeline\nusing SAM's image encoder to extract structure-aware feature embeddings,\nenabling more accurate modeling of anatomical consistency and deformation\npatterns. We further design a lightweight 3D head to refine features within the\nembedding space, adapting to local deformations in medical images.\nAdditionally, we introduce a Hierarchical Feature Consistency Loss to guide\ncoarse-to-fine feature matching and improve anatomical alignment.

Moreover, existing methods primarily focus on\nhard negative samples during model updates, with the goal of refining\ndistinctions between positive and negative pairs, often neglecting incorrectly\nmatched positive pairs. To alleviate these issues, we propose FMFA, a\ncross-modal Full-Mode Fine-grained Alignment framework, which enhances global\nmatching through explicit fine-grained alignment and existing implicit\nrelational reasoning -- hence the term ``full-mode\" -- without requiring\nadditional supervision. Specifically, we design an Adaptive Similarity\nDistribution Matching (A-SDM) module to rectify unmatched positive sample\npairs. A-SDM adaptively pulls the unmatched positive pairs closer in the joint\nembedding space, thereby achieving more precise global alignment. Additionally,\nwe introduce an Explicit Fine-grained Alignment (EFA) module, which makes up\nfor the lack of verification capability of implicit relational reasoning. EFA\nstrengthens explicit cross-modal fine-grained interactions by sparsifying the\nsimilarity matrix and employs a hard coding method for local alignment. Our\nproposed method is evaluated on three public datasets, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance among all global matching methods. Our code is\navailable at https://github.com/yinhao1102/FMFA."}

Finally, 76 teams from the renowned academic and\nindustrial institutions have registered and 40+ valid submissions (out of\n1200+) have been included in our ranking lists. Our datasets, code sets (40+\nbaselines and 15+ participants' methods), and rankings are publicly available\non the MARS2 workshop website and our GitHub organization page\nhttps://github.com/mars2workshop/, where our updates and announcements of\nupcoming events will be continuously provided."}

Recent studies have shown that abstract\nimages-constructed by primitive shapes-can indeed convey visual semantic\ninformation to deep learning models. However, representations obtained from\nsuch images often fall short compared to those derived from traditional raster\nimages. In this paper, we study the reasons behind this performance gap and\ninvestigate how much high-level semantic content can be captured at different\nabstraction levels. To this end, we introduce the Hierarchical Abstraction\nImage Dataset (HAID), a novel data collection that comprises abstract images\ngenerated from normal raster images at multiple levels of abstraction. We then\ntrain and evaluate conventional vision systems on HAID across various tasks\nincluding classification, segmentation, and object detection, providing a\ncomprehensive study between rasterised and abstract image representations. We\nalso discuss if the abstract image can be considered as a potentially effective\nformat for conveying visual semantic information and contributing to vision\ntasks."}

Recent studies have prioritized efficiency or accuracy\nenhancements, yet the issue of domain shift has been overlooked, leading to\nsubstantial performance degradation upon transfer. We identify major domain\ngaps in real-world cross-domain scenarios and initiate the first effort to\naddress the Domain Adaptation (DA) challenge in multi-view 3D object detection\nfor BEV perception. Given the complexity of BEV perception approaches with\ntheir multiple components, domain shift accumulation across multi-geometric\nspaces (e.g., 2D, 3D Voxel, BEV) poses a significant challenge for BEV domain\nadaptation. In this paper, we introduce an innovative geometric-aware\nteacher-student framework, BEVUDA++, to diminish this issue, comprising a\nReliable Depth Teacher (RDT) and a Geometric Consistent Student (GCS) model.\nSpecifically, RDT effectively blends target LiDAR with dependable depth\npredictions to generate depth-aware information based on uncertainty\nestimation, enhancing the extraction of Voxel and BEV features that are\nessential for understanding the target domain. To collaboratively reduce the\ndomain shift, GCS maps features from multiple spaces into a unified geometric\nembedding space, thereby narrowing the gap in data distribution between the two\ndomains. Additionally, we introduce a novel Uncertainty-guided Exponential\nMoving Average (UEMA) to further reduce error accumulation due to domain shifts\ninformed by previously obtained uncertainty guidance. To demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our proposed method, we execute comprehensive experiments in\nfour cross-domain scenarios, securing state-of-the-art performance in BEV 3D\nobject detection tasks, e.g., 12.9\\% NDS and 9.5\\% mAP enhancement on Day-Night\nadaptation."}

Understanding Pruning Behaviors in STEP at High Resolutions", "comment": null, "summary": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve state-of-the-art performance in semantic\nsegmentation but are hindered by high computational and memory costs. To\naddress this, we propose STEP (SuperToken and Early-Pruning), a hybrid\ntoken-reduction framework that combines dynamic patch merging and token pruning\nto enhance efficiency without significantly compromising accuracy. At the core\nof STEP is dCTS, a lightweight CNN-based policy network that enables flexible\nmerging into superpatches. Encoder blocks integrate also early-exits to remove\nhigh-confident supertokens, lowering computational load. We evaluate our method\non high-resolution semantic segmentation benchmarks, including images up to\n1024 x 1024, and show that when dCTS is applied alone, the token count can be\nreduced by a factor of 2.5 compared to the standard 16 x 16 pixel patching\nscheme. This yields a 2.6x reduction in computational cost and a 3.4x increase\nin throughput when using ViT-Large as the backbone. Applying the full STEP\nframework further improves efficiency, reaching up to a 4x reduction in\ncomputational complexity and a 1.7x gain in inference speed, with a maximum\naccuracy drop of no more than 2.0%. With the proposed STEP configurations, up\nto 40% of tokens can be confidently predicted and halted before reaching the\nfinal encoder layer."}

However, current video large language models (VLLMs) and\nbenchmarks mostly rely on low-frame-rate sampling, such as uniform sampling or\nkeyframe selection, discarding dense temporal information. This compromise\navoids the high cost of tokenizing every frame, which otherwise leads to\nredundant computation and linear token growth as video length increases. While\nthis trade-off works for slowly changing content, it fails for tasks like\nlecture comprehension, where information appears in nearly every frame and\nrequires precise temporal alignment. To address this gap, we introduce Dense\nVideo Understanding (DVU), which enables high-FPS video comprehension by\nreducing both tokenization time and token overhead. Existing benchmarks are\nalso limited, as their QA pairs focus on coarse content changes. We therefore\npropose DIVE (Dense Information Video Evaluation), the first benchmark designed\nfor dense temporal reasoning. To make DVU practical, we present Gated Residual\nTokenization (GRT), a two-stage framework: (1) Motion-Compensated Inter-Gated\nTokenization uses pixel-level motion estimation to skip static regions during\ntokenization, achieving sub-linear growth in token count and compute. (2)\nSemantic-Scene Intra-Tokenization Merging fuses tokens across static regions\nwithin a scene, further reducing redundancy while preserving dynamic semantics.\nExperiments on DIVE show that GRT outperforms larger VLLM baselines and scales\npositively with FPS. These results highlight the importance of dense temporal\ninformation and demonstrate that GRT enables efficient, scalable high-FPS video\nunderstanding."}

Existing benchmarks often test short-clip recognition or\nuse template-based questions, leaving a critical gap in evaluating fine-grained\nreasoning over long-form narrative content. To address these gaps, we introduce\n$\\mathsf{Cin\\acute{e}aste}$, a comprehensive benchmark for long-form movie\nunderstanding. Our dataset comprises 3,119 multiple-choice question-answer\npairs derived from 1,805 scenes across 200 diverse movies, spanning five novel\nfine-grained contextual reasoning categories. We use GPT-4o to generate\ndiverse, context-rich questions by integrating visual descriptions, captions,\nscene titles, and summaries, which require deep narrative understanding. To\nensure high-quality evaluation, our pipeline incorporates a two-stage filtering\nprocess: Context-Independence filtering ensures questions require video\ncontext, while Contextual Veracity filtering validates factual consistency\nagainst the movie content, mitigating hallucinations. Experiments show that\nexisting MLLMs struggle on $\\mathsf{Cin\\acute{e}aste}$; our analysis reveals\nthat long-range temporal reasoning is a primary bottleneck, with the top\nopen-source model achieving only 63.15\\% accuracy.

We introduce\nGenExam, the first benchmark for multidisciplinary text-to-image exams,\nfeaturing 1,000 samples across 10 subjects with exam-style prompts organized\nunder a four-level taxonomy.
