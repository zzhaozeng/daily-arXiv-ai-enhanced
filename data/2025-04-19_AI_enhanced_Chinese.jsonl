This\ndrag operation has been incorporated into numerous methods to facilitate the\nediting of 2D images and 3D meshes in design. However, few studies have\nexplored drag-driven editing for the widely-used 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)\nrepresentation, as deforming 3DGS while preserving shape coherence and visual\ncontinuity remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce ARAP-GS, a\ndrag-driven 3DGS editing framework based on As-Rigid-As-Possible (ARAP)\ndeformation. Unlike previous 3DGS editing methods, we are the first to apply\nARAP deformation directly to 3D Gaussians, enabling flexible, drag-driven\ngeometric transformations. To preserve scene appearance after deformation, we\nincorporate an advanced diffusion prior for image super-resolution within our\niterative optimization process.

Existing\n3D domain generalization methods employ point-based backbones to extract point\ncloud features. Yet, by analyzing point utilization of point-based methods and\nobserving the geometry of point clouds from different domains, we have found\nthat a large number of point features are discarded by point-based methods\nthrough the max-pooling operation.

However, they either struggle to capture pose-dependent\nappearance details with a single MLP, or rely on a computationally intensive\nneural network to reconstruct high-fidelity appearance but with rendering\nperformance degraded to non-real-time. We propose a novel Gaussian human avatar\nrepresentation that can reconstruct high-fidelity pose-dependence appearance\nwith details and meanwhile can be rendered in real time. Our Gaussian avatar is\nempowered by spatially distributed MLPs which are explicitly located on\ndifferent positions on human body. The parameters stored in each Gaussian are\nobtained by interpolating from the outputs of its nearby MLPs based on their\ndistances. To avoid undesired smooth Gaussian property changing during\ninterpolation, for each Gaussian we define a set of Gaussian offset basis, and\na linear combination of basis represents the Gaussian property offsets relative\nto the neutral properties. Then we propose to let the MLPs output a set of\ncoefficients corresponding to the basis. In this way, although Gaussian\ncoefficients are derived from interpolation and change smoothly, the Gaussian\noffset basis is learned freely without constraints. The smoothly varying\ncoefficients combined with freely learned basis can still produce distinctly\ndifferent Gaussian property offsets, allowing the ability to learn\nhigh-frequency spatial signals. We further use control points to constrain the\nGaussians distributed on a surface layer rather than allowing them to be\nirregularly distributed inside the body, to help the human avatar generalize\nbetter when animated under novel poses.

However, it remains unclear whether LLMs have\nbecome more creative over time, and how consistent their creative output is. In\nthis study, we evaluated 14 widely used LLMs -- including GPT-4, Claude, Llama,\nGrok, Mistral, and DeepSeek -- across two validated creativity assessments: the\nDivergent Association Task (DAT) and the Alternative Uses Task (AUT). Contrary\nto expectations, we found no evidence of increased creative performance over\nthe past 18-24 months, with GPT-4 performing worse than in previous studies.\nFor the more widely used AUT, all models performed on average better than the\naverage human, with GPT-4o and o3-mini performing best. However, only 0.28% of\nLLM-generated responses reached the top 10% of human creativity benchmarks.\nBeyond inter-model differences, we document substantial intra-model\nvariability: the same LLM, given the same prompt, can produce outputs ranging\nfrom below-average to original. This variability has important implications for\nboth creativity research and practical applications. Ignoring such variability\nrisks misjudging the creative potential of LLMs, either inflating or\nunderestimating their capabilities. The choice of prompts affected LLMs\ndifferently.

The spatial primitive\nprediction module establishes predictive relationships for scene primitives and\nenables most primitives to be encoded as compact residuals, substantially\nreducing the spatial redundancy. We further devise a temporal primitive\nprediction module to handle dynamic scenes, which exploits primitive\ncorrelations across timestamps to effectively reduce temporal redundancy.\nMoreover, we devise a rate-constrained optimization module that jointly\nminimizes reconstruction error and rate consumption. This module effectively\neliminates parameter redundancy within primitives and enhances the overall\ncompactness of scene representations.

To\naddress this question, we conduct extensive experiments by varying the LLMs,\nretrievers, and retrieval sources.

This work advances our\nunderstanding of how officially sanctioned discourse encodes social structure\nthrough language while highlighting the importance of non-Western perspectives\nin computational social science.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e2d\u56fd\u5b98\u65b9\u5a92\u4f53\uff081950-2019\uff09\u4e2d\u793e\u4f1a\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u4e0e\u897f\u65b9\u6a21\u5f0f\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6027\u522b\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9636\u5c42\u65b9\u9762\u53d8\u5316\u5267\u70c8\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u9769\u547d\u6027\u793e\u4f1a\u53d8\u9769\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5b98\u65b9\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u5f81\u53cd\u6620\u793e\u4f1a\u7fa4\u4f53\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u975e\u897f\u65b9\u8bed\u5883\u4e0b\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u793e\u4f1a\u7ed3\u6784\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5386\u65f6\u8bcd\u5d4c\u5165\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u56fd\u5b98\u65b9\u5a92\u4f53\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u4e2d\u56fd\u793e\u4f1a\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e\u897f\u65b9\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u6027\u522b\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9636\u5c42\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u968f\u5386\u53f2\u53d8\u9769\u5267\u70c8\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u79cd\u65cf\u3001\u5e74\u9f84\u548c\u4f53\u578b\u7b49\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u5219\u76f8\u5bf9\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b98\u65b9\u8bdd\u8bed\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u7f16\u7801\u793e\u4f1a\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u975e\u897f\u65b9\u89c6\u89d2\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

While foundation models like Segment\nAnything Model (SAM) show strong segmentation capabilities, SAM is limited in\nthe task of building change detection due to domain gap issues. Existing\nadapter-based fine-tuning approaches face challenges with imbalanced building\ndistribution, resulting in poor detection of subtle changes and inaccurate edge\nextraction. Additionally, bi-temporal misalignment in change detection,\ntypically addressed by optical flow, remains vulnerable to background noises.\nThis affects the detection of building changes and compromises both detection\naccuracy and edge recognition. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new\nSAM-Based Network with Distribution-Aware Fourier Adaptation and\nEdge-Constrained Warping (FAEWNet) for building change detection. FAEWNet\nutilizes the SAM encoder to extract rich visual features from remote sensing\nimages. To guide SAM in focusing on specific ground objects in remote sensing\nscenes, we propose a Distribution-Aware Fourier Aggregated Adapter to aggregate\ntask-oriented changed information. This adapter not only effectively addresses\nthe domain gap issue, but also pays attention to the distribution of changed\nbuildings. Furthermore, to mitigate noise interference and misalignment in\nheight offset estimation, we design a novel flow module that refines building\nedge extraction and enhances the perception of changed buildings.

This separation overlooks the\npotential benefits that planning can gain from learning out-of-distribution\ndata encountered in motion tasks. However, unifying these tasks poses\nsignificant challenges, such as constructing shared contextual representations\nand handling the unobservability of other vehicles' states. To address these\nchallenges, we propose TTOG, a novel two-stage trajectory generation framework.\nIn the first stage, a diverse set of trajectory candidates is generated, while\nthe second stage focuses on refining these candidates through vehicle state\ninformation. To mitigate the issue of unavailable surrounding vehicle states,\nTTOG employs a self-vehicle data-trained state estimator, subsequently extended\nto other vehicles.

Commonly cited benefits include accessibility, emotional\nsupport, and perceived therapeutic value. However, concerns around privacy,\ngeneric responses, and the lack of professional oversight remain prominent. It\nis important to note that the user feedback does not indicate which therapeutic\nframework, if any, the LLM-generated output aligns with.

Moreover, multi-token\nprediction is introduced to support real-time streaming TTS synthesis.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our GOAT-TTS achieves performance\ncomparable to state-of-the-art TTS models while validating the efficacy of\nsynthesized dialect speech data.", "AI": {"tldr": "GOAT-TTS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u67b6\u6784\u6587\u672c\u8f6c\u8bed\u97f3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u58f0\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u635f\u5931\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u5bf9\u9f50\u6570\u636e\u548c\u9057\u5fd8\u6587\u672c\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u5728TTS\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u58f0\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u635f\u5931\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u5bf9\u9f50\u6570\u636e\u548c\u9057\u5fd8\u6587\u672c\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u5206\u652f\u6355\u83b7\u8fde\u7eed\u58f0\u5b66\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u8bed\u97f3\u751f\u6210\u5206\u652f\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u9884\u6d4b\u8bed\u97f3\u6807\u8bb0\u3002", "result": "GOAT-TTS\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdbTTS\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u8a00\u8bed\u97f3\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "GOAT-TTS\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u5728TTS\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

The approach significantly improves\nmodel performance on downstream tasks such as 3D object detection, BEV\nsegmentation, 3D object tracking, and occupancy prediction, and shows steady\nperformance increase as the training data volume scales up, demonstrating the\npotential of continually benefit 3D perception models for autonomous driving.\nWe will release the source code to inspire further investigations in the\ncommunity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec33D\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u63d0\u793a\u9002\u914d\u5668\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7NLP\u548c2D\u89c6\u89c9\u9886\u57df\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a763D\u611f\u77e5\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e603D\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u63d0\u793a\u9002\u914d\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u57283D\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001BEV\u5206\u5272\u30013D\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u5360\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u7a33\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a763D\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5f00\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

While CLIP demonstrates\nremarkable zero-shot performance on downstream tasks, the multi-modal feature\nspaces still suffer from a modality gap, which is a gap between image and text\nfeature clusters and limits downstream task performance. Although existing\nworks attempt to address the modality gap by modifying pre-training or\nfine-tuning, they struggle with heavy training costs with large datasets or\ndegradations of zero-shot performance. This paper presents CLIP-Refine, a\npost-pre-training method for CLIP models at a phase between pre-training and\nfine-tuning. CLIP-Refine aims to align the feature space with 1 epoch training\non small image-text datasets without zero-shot performance degradations. To\nthis end, we introduce two techniques: random feature alignment (RaFA) and\nhybrid contrastive-distillation (HyCD).

MaskMark has two variants: MaskMark-D, which supports global\nwatermark embedding, watermark localization, and local watermark extraction for\napplications such as tamper detection, and MaskMark-ED, which focuses on local\nwatermark embedding and extraction with enhanced robustness in small regions,\nenabling localized image protection. Built upon the classical Encoder-\nDistortion-Decoder training paradigm, MaskMark-D introduces a simple masking\nmechanism during the decoding stage to support both global and local watermark\nextraction. A mask is applied to the watermarked image before extraction,\nallowing the decoder to focus on selected regions and learn local extraction. A\nlocalization module is also integrated into the decoder to identify watermark\nregions during inference, reducing interference from irrelevant content and\nimproving accuracy. MaskMark-ED extends this design by incorporating the mask\ninto the encoding stage as well, guiding the encoder to embed the watermark in\ndesignated local regions for enhanced robustness. Comprehensive experiments\nshow that MaskMark achieves state-of-the-art performance in global watermark\nextraction, local watermark extraction, watermark localization, and\nmulti-watermark embedding. It outperforms all existing baselines, including the\nrecent leading model WAM for local watermarking, while preserving high visual\nquality of the watermarked images. MaskMark is also flexible, by adjusting the\ndistortion layer, it can adapt to different robustness requirements with just a\nfew steps of fine-tuning.

While\nconcept erasure methods offer a promising solution, existing finetuning-based\napproaches suffer from notable limitations. Anchor-free methods risk disrupting\nsampling trajectories, leading to visual artifacts, while anchor-based methods\nrely on the heuristic selection of anchor concepts. To overcome these\nshortcomings, we introduce a finetuning framework, dubbed ANT, which\nAutomatically guides deNoising Trajectories to avoid unwanted concepts.

This\ninspires a trajectory-aware objective that preserves the integrity of the\nearly-stage score function field, which steers samples toward the natural image\nmanifold, without relying on heuristic anchor concept selection. For\nsingle-concept erasure, we propose an augmentation-enhanced weight saliency map\nto precisely identify the critical parameters that most significantly\ncontribute to the unwanted concept, enabling more thorough and efficient\nerasure. For multi-concept erasure, our objective function offers a versatile\nplug-and-play solution that significantly boosts performance.

While most work focuses on pretraining data's effect on\ndownstream task behavior, we investigate its relationship to LM\nrepresentations. Previous work has discovered that, in language models, some\nconcepts are encoded `linearly' in the representations, but what factors cause\nthese representations to form? We study the connection between pretraining data\nfrequency and models' linear representations of factual relations. We find\nevidence that the formation of linear representations is strongly connected to\npretraining term frequencies; specifically for subject-relation-object fact\ntriplets, both subject-object co-occurrence frequency and in-context learning\naccuracy for the relation are highly correlated with linear representations.\nThis is the case across all phases of pretraining. In OLMo-7B and GPT-J, we\ndiscover that a linear representation consistently (but not exclusively) forms\nwhen the subjects and objects within a relation co-occur at least 1k and 2k\ntimes, respectively, regardless of when these occurrences happen during\npretraining. Finally, we train a regression model on measurements of linear\nrepresentation quality in fully-trained LMs that can predict how often a term\nwas seen in pretraining. Our model achieves low error even on inputs from a\ndifferent model with a different pretraining dataset, providing a new method\nfor estimating properties of the otherwise-unknown training data of closed-data\nmodels.

These methods\noften encounter a transparency-depth dilemma, where the pursuit of\nphotorealistic rendering through standard $\\alpha$-blending undermines\ngeometric precision, resulting in considerable depth estimation errors for\ntransparent materials. To address this issue, we introduce Transparent Surface\nGaussian Splatting (TSGS), a new framework that separates geometry learning\nfrom appearance refinement. In the geometry learning stage, TSGS focuses on\ngeometry by using specular-suppressed inputs to accurately represent surfaces.\nIn the second stage, TSGS improves visual fidelity through anisotropic specular\nmodeling, crucially maintaining the established opacity to ensure geometric\naccuracy. To enhance depth inference, TSGS employs a first-surface depth\nextraction method. This technique uses a sliding window over $\\alpha$-blending\nweights to pinpoint the most likely surface location and calculates a robust\nweighted average depth. To evaluate the transparent surface reconstruction task\nunder realistic conditions, we collect a TransLab dataset that includes complex\ntransparent laboratory glassware. Extensive experiments on TransLab show that\nTSGS achieves accurate geometric reconstruction and realistic rendering of\ntransparent objects simultaneously within the efficient 3DGS framework.\nSpecifically, TSGS significantly surpasses current leading methods, achieving a\n37.3% reduction in chamfer distance and an 8.0% improvement in F1 score\ncompared to the top baseline.

Previous GAN inversion-based methods\nusually utilize well-trained GAN models as effective priors to generate the\nrealistic regions for missing holes. Despite excellence, they ignore a hard\nconstraint that the unmasked regions in the input and the output should be the\nsame, resulting in a gap between GAN inversion and image inpainting and thus\ndegrading the performance. Besides, existing GAN inversion approaches often\nconsider a single modality of the input image, neglecting other auxiliary cues\nin images for improvements. Addressing these problems, we propose a novel GAN\ninversion approach, dubbed MMInvertFill, for image inpainting. MMInvertFill\ncontains primarily a multimodal guided encoder with a pre-modulation and a GAN\ngenerator with F&W+ latent space. Specifically, the multimodal encoder aims to\nenhance the multi-scale structures with additional semantic segmentation edge\ntexture modalities through a gated mask-aware attention module. Afterwards, a\npre-modulation is presented to encode these structures into style vectors. To\nmitigate issues of conspicuous color discrepancy and semantic inconsistency, we\nintroduce the F&W+ latent space to bridge the gap between GAN inversion and\nimage inpainting.

To further improve its efficiency, we\npropose sampling strategies for both the camera views and loss function and,\nconsequently, the normal equation, significantly reducing the computational\ncomplexity. In addition, we increase the convergence rate of the second-order\napproximation by introducing an effective heuristic to determine the learning\nrate that avoids the expensive computation cost of line search methods. As a\nresult, our method achieves a $3\\times$ speedup over standard LM and\noutperforms Adam by $~6\\times$ when the Gaussian count is low while remaining\ncompetitive for moderate counts.

Given that object information in\nimages plays a far more crucial role in downstream tasks than background\ninformation, some studies have proposed semantically structuring the bitstream\nto selectively transmit and reconstruct only the information required by these\ntasks. However, such methods structure the bitstream after encoding, meaning\nthat the coding process still relies on the entire image, even though much of\nthe encoded information will not be transmitted. This leads to redundant\ncomputations. Traditional image compression methods require a two-dimensional\nimage as input, and even if the unimportant regions of the image are set to\nzero by applying a semantic mask, these regions still participate in subsequent\ncomputations as part of the image. To address such limitations, we propose an\nimage compression method based on a position-indexed self-attention mechanism\nthat encodes and decodes only the visible parts of the masked image.

Recently, transformer and\nstate space model (SSM) have shown promising capacities in point cloud\nlearning. However, limited research has been conducted on medical point clouds,\nwhich have great potential in disease diagnosis and treatment. This paper\npresents an SSM-based hierarchical feature learning framework for medical point\ncloud understanding. Specifically, we down-sample input into multiple levels\nthrough the farthest point sampling. At each level, we perform a series of\nk-nearest neighbor (KNN) queries to aggregate multi-scale structural\ninformation. To assist SSM in processing point clouds, we introduce\ncoordinate-order and inside-out scanning strategies for efficient serialization\nof irregular points. Point features are calculated progressively from short\nneighbor sequences and long point sequences through vanilla and group Point SSM\nblocks, to capture both local patterns and long-range dependencies. To evaluate\nthe proposed method, we build a large-scale medical point cloud dataset named\nMedPointS for anatomy classification, completion, and segmentation.

Current BVSR methods often fail to restore sharp details at high\nresolutions, resulting in noticeable artifacts and jitter due to insufficient\nmotion information for deconvolution and the lack of high-frequency details in\nLR frames. To address these challenges, we introduce event signals into BVSR\nand propose a novel event-enhanced network, Ev-DeblurVSR. To effectively fuse\ninformation from frames and events for feature deblurring, we introduce a\nreciprocal feature deblurring module that leverages motion information from\nintra-frame events to deblur frame features while reciprocally using global\nscene context from the frames to enhance event features. Furthermore, to\nenhance temporal consistency, we propose a hybrid deformable alignment module\nthat fully exploits the complementary motion information from inter-frame\nevents and optical flow to improve motion estimation in the deformable\nalignment process. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Ev-DeblurVSR\nestablishes a new state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world\ndatasets.

As such, amateur\nusers can easily imitate professional-level paintings by collecting an artist's\nwork and fine-tuning the model, leading to concerns about artworks' copyright\ninfringement. To tackle these issues, previous studies either add visually\nimperceptible perturbation to the artwork to change its underlying styles\n(perturbation-based methods) or embed post-training detectable watermarks in\nthe artwork (watermark-based methods). However, when the artwork or the model\nhas been published online, i.e., modification to the original artwork or model\nretraining is not feasible, these strategies might not be viable.\n  To this end, we propose a novel method for data-use auditing in the\ntext-to-image generation model. The general idea of ArtistAuditor is to\nidentify if a suspicious model has been finetuned using the artworks of\nspecific artists by analyzing the features related to the style. Concretely,\nArtistAuditor employs a style extractor to obtain the multi-granularity style\nrepresentations and treats artworks as samplings of an artist's style. Then,\nArtistAuditor queries a trained discriminator to gain the auditing decisions.\nThe experimental results on six combinations of models and datasets show that\nArtistAuditor can achieve high AUC values (> 0.937).

For the critique generation\npart, we built a system that combines Noel Carroll's evaluative framework with\na broad selection of art criticism theories. The model was prompted to first\nwrite a full-length critique and then shorter, more coherent versions using a\nstep-by-step prompting process. These AI-generated critiques were then compared\nwith those written by human experts in a Turing test-style evaluation. In many\ncases, human subjects had difficulty telling which was which, and the results\nsuggest that LLMs can produce critiques that are not only plausible in style\nbut also rich in interpretation, as long as they are carefully guided. In the\nsecond part, we introduced new simple ToM tasks based on situations involving\ninterpretation, emotion, and moral tension, which can appear in the context of\nart. These go beyond standard false-belief tests and allow for more complex,\nsocially embedded forms of reasoning. We tested 41 recent LLMs and found that\ntheir performance varied across tasks and models. In particular, tasks that\ninvolved affective or ambiguous situations tended to reveal clearer\ndifferences. Taken together, these results help clarify how LLMs respond to\ncomplex interpretative challenges, revealing both their cognitive limitations\nand potential. While our findings do not directly contradict the so-called\nGenerative AI Paradox--the idea that LLMs can produce expert-like output\nwithout genuine understanding--they suggest that, depending on how LLMs are\ninstructed, such as through carefully designed prompts, these models may begin\nto show behaviors that resemble understanding more closely than we might\nassume.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u827a\u672f\u8bc4\u8bba\u548c\u5fc3\u667a\u7406\u8bba\uff08ToM\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u63d0\u793a\uff0cLLMs\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u8bc4\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u590d\u6742\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u4e00\u5b9a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22LLMs\u5728\u827a\u672f\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u8bc4\u8bba\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5fc3\u667a\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u8ba4\u77e5\u6f5c\u529b\u4e0e\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u827a\u672f\u6279\u8bc4\u7406\u8bba\u6784\u5efa\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u8bc4\u8bba\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u56fe\u7075\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u7684ToM\u4efb\u52a1\u6d4b\u8bd541\u79cdLLMs\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bc4\u8bba\u5728\u98ce\u683c\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0a\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\uff1bToM\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u56e0\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u800c\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u80fd\u6a21\u62df\u7406\u89e3\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u80fd\u529b\u4ecd\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, such a\nretrieval-centric approach is myopic and inherently limited, as successful\nrecall alone does not indicate a model's capacity to reason over extended\ncontexts. Moreover, these benchmarks are susceptible to data leakage,\nshort-circuiting, and risk making the evaluation a priori identifiable. To\naddress these limitations, we introduce MLRBench, a new synthetic benchmark for\nmultilingual long-context reasoning. Unlike existing benchmarks, MLRBench goes\nbeyond surface-level retrieval by including tasks that assess multi-hop\ninference, aggregation, and epistemic reasoning. Spanning seven languages,\nMLRBench is designed to be parallel, resistant to leakage, and scalable to\narbitrary context lengths. Our extensive experiments with an open-weight large\nlanguage model (LLM) reveal a pronounced gap between high- and low-resource\nlanguages, particularly for tasks requiring the model to aggregate multiple\nfacts or predict the absence of information. We also find that, in multilingual\nsettings, LLMs effectively utilize less than 30% of their claimed context\nlength.

Ensuring interpretability is crucial, especially for\nreal-world applications requiring transparency and accountability.

To address these challenges,\nwe propose Pose Concept Bottleneck for Explainable Action Recognition (PCBEAR),\na novel concept bottleneck framework that introduces human pose sequences as\nmotion-aware, structured concepts for video action recognition. Unlike methods\nbased on pixel-level features or static textual descriptions, PCBEAR leverages\nhuman skeleton poses, which focus solely on body movements, providing robust\nand interpretable explanations of motion dynamics. We define two types of\npose-based concepts: static pose concepts for spatial configurations at\nindividual frames, and dynamic pose concepts for motion patterns across\nmultiple frames. To construct these concepts, PCBEAR applies clustering to\nvideo pose sequences, allowing for automatic discovery of meaningful concepts\nwithout manual annotation. We validate PCBEAR on KTH, Penn-Action, and HAA500,\nshowing that it achieves high classification performance while offering\ninterpretable, motion-driven explanations.

Our\nbenchmark yields several notable insights: 1) Open-source models significantly\nunderperform relative to proprietary, closed-source models, with the\nperformance gap widening as instruction complexity increases; 2) Increased\ninstructional complexity primarily impairs the models' ability to retain key\nelements from the input images and to preserve the overall aesthetic quality;\n3) Decomposing a complex instruction into a sequence of atomic steps, executed\nin a step-by-step manner, substantially degrades performance across multiple\nmetrics; 4) A straightforward Best-of-N selection strategy improves results for\nboth direct editing and the step-by-step sequential approach; and 5) We observe\na ``curse of synthetic data'': when synthetic data is involved in model\ntraining, the edited images from such models tend to appear increasingly\nsynthetic as the complexity of the editing instructions rises -- a phenomenon\nthat intriguingly also manifests in the latest GPT-4o outputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "$\texttt{Complex-Edit}$\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7GPT-4o\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4f4e\u4e8e\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u590d\u6742\u6307\u4ee4\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u4fdd\u7559\u5173\u952e\u5143\u7d20\u548c\u7f8e\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6307\u4ee4\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528GPT-4o\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u201cChain-of-Edit\u201d\u6d41\u7a0b\u6574\u5408\u539f\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1VLM\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4f4e\u4e8e\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u590d\u6742\u6307\u4ee4\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u4fdd\u7559\u5173\u952e\u5143\u7d20\u548c\u7f8e\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u5206\u6b65\u6267\u884c\u590d\u6742\u6307\u4ee4\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\uff1bBest-of-N\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7ed3\u679c\uff1b\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7f16\u8f91\u7ed3\u679c\u5448\u73b0\u5408\u6210\u5316\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "$\texttt{Complex-Edit}$\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u6307\u4ee4\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

While recent advances in 3D Gaussian\nSplatting (3DGS) have enabled fast and high-quality scene reconstruction,\nresearch has also explored incorporating open-vocabulary understanding into\n3DGS. However, most existing methods require iterative optimization over\nper-view 2D semantic feature maps, which not only results in inefficiencies but\nalso leads to inconsistent 3D semantics across views. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce a training-free framework that constructs a\nsuperpoint graph directly from Gaussian primitives. The superpoint graph\npartitions the scene into spatially compact and semantically coherent regions,\nforming view-consistent 3D entities and providing a structured foundation for\nopen-vocabulary understanding. Based on the graph structure, we design an\nefficient reprojection strategy that lifts 2D semantic features onto the\nsuperpoints, avoiding costly multi-view iterative training.

We demonstrate the effectiveness\nof MADAM-RAG using both closed and open-source models on AmbigDocs -- which\nrequires presenting all valid answers for ambiguous queries -- improving over\nstrong RAG baselines by up to 11.40% and on FaithEval -- which requires\nsuppressing misinformation -- where we improve by up to 15.80% (absolute) with\nLlama3.3-70B-Instruct. Furthermore, we find that RAMDocs poses a challenge for\nexisting RAG baselines (Llama3.3-70B-Instruct only obtains 32.60 exact match\nscore). While MADAM-RAG begins to address these conflicting factors, our\nanalysis indicates that a substantial gap remains especially when increasing\nthe level of imbalance in supporting evidence and misinformation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5MADAM-RAG\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u5904\u7406\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165RAMDocs\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6a21\u62df\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u7cca\u67e5\u8be2\u3001\u51b2\u7a81\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u65f6\u901a\u5e38\u5b64\u7acb\u89e3\u51b3\u5355\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7efc\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRAMDocs\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6a21\u62df\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1MADAM-RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u6574\u5408\u7b54\u6848\u5e76\u8fc7\u6ee4\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "MADAM-RAG\u5728AmbigDocs\u548cFaithEval\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u534711.40%\u548c15.80%\uff0c\u4f46RAMDocs\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MADAM-RAG\u521d\u6b65\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6e90\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u65f6\u4ecd\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002"}}

Project Page: https://reverse-vlm.github.io", "summary": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at visual understanding but often suffer\nfrom visual hallucinations, where they generate descriptions of nonexistent\nobjects, actions, or concepts, posing significant risks in safety-critical\napplications. Existing hallucination mitigation methods typically follow one of\ntwo paradigms: generation adjustment, which modifies decoding behavior to align\ntext with visual inputs, and post-hoc verification, where external models\nassess and correct outputs. While effective, generation adjustment methods\noften rely on heuristics and lack correction mechanisms, while post-hoc\nverification is complicated, typically requiring multiple models and tending to\nreject outputs rather than refine them. In this work, we introduce REVERSE, a\nunified framework that integrates hallucination-aware training with on-the-fly\nself-verification. By leveraging a new hallucination-verification dataset\ncontaining over 1.3M semi-synthetic samples, along with a novel inference-time\nretrospective resampling technique, our approach enables VLMs to both detect\nhallucinations during generation and dynamically revise those hallucinations.\nOur evaluations show that REVERSE achieves state-of-the-art hallucination\nreduction, outperforming the best existing methods by up to 12% on CHAIR-MSCOCO\nand 28% on HaloQuest.

Although single-pattern structured\nlight enables single-shot shape reconstruction, the reflectance is challenging\nto recover due to the lack of angular sampling of incident light and the\nentanglement of the projected pattern and the surface color texture. We design\na spatially multiplexed pattern of polarization that can be robustly and\nuniquely decoded for shape reconstruction by quantizing the AoLP values. At the\nsame time, our spatial-multiplexing enables single-shot ellipsometry of linear\npolarization by projecting differently polarized light within a local region,\nwhich separates the specular and diffuse reflections for BRDF estimation. We\nachieve this spatial polarization multiplexing with a constrained de Bruijn\nsequence.

We show that both LLMs with search capabilities and SOTA web agents\nstruggle with these tasks, with a recall of 3% and 31%, respectively, despite\nhigher performance on question-answering tasks.\n  To address this challenge, we propose BardeenAgent, a novel framework that\nenables web agents to convert their execution into repeatable programs, and\nreplay them at scale across pages with similar structure. BardeenAgent is also\nthe first LLM agent to take advantage of the regular structure of HTML. In\nparticular BardeenAgent constructs a generalizable CSS selector to capture all\nrelevant items on the page, then fits the operations to extract the data.\n  On the WebLists benchmark, BardeenAgent achieves 66% recall overall, more\nthan doubling the performance of SOTA web agents, and reducing cost per output\nrow by 3x.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86WebLists\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548cBardeenAgent\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7f51\u7edc\u4ee3\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u4ea4\u6613\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u800c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBardeenAgent\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4ee3\u7406\u6267\u884c\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528HTML\u7684\u89c4\u5f8b\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u53d6\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "BardeenAgent\u5728WebLists\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523066%\u53ec\u56de\u7387\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "BardeenAgent\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u53d6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

The system employs two modally distinct, descriptively\ncomplete languages: a categorical language of beings for processing user inputs\nand an existential language of Being for internal analysis.

Unlike contemporary systems limited\nto categorical analysis, this approach leverages Heidegger's phenomenological\nexistential analysis to uncover deeper ontological patterns in query\nprocessing, aiding in resolving logical traps in complex interactions, such as\nmetaphor usage in IT contexts. The path to full realization involves\nformalizing the language of Being by a research team based on Heidegger's\nFundamental Ontology; given the existing completeness of the language of\nbeings, this reduces the system's computability to completeness, paving the way\nfor a universal query analysis tool.

We\nuse FreshStack to build five datasets on fast-growing, recent, and niche topics\nto ensure the tasks are sufficiently challenging. On FreshStack, existing\nretrieval models, when applied out-of-the-box, significantly underperform\noracle approaches on all five topics, denoting plenty of headroom to improve IR\nquality. In addition, we identify cases where rerankers do not clearly improve\nfirst-stage retrieval accuracy (two out of five topics).

We introduce sleep-time compute, which allows models to\n\"think\" offline about contexts before queries are presented: by anticipating\nwhat queries users might ask and pre-computing useful quantities, we can\nsignificantly reduce the compute requirements at test-time. To demonstrate the\nefficacy of our method, we create modified versions of two reasoning tasks -\nStateful GSM-Symbolic and Stateful AIME. We find that sleep-time compute can\nreduce the amount of test-time compute needed to achieve the same accuracy by ~\n5x on Stateful GSM-Symbolic and Stateful AIME and that by scaling sleep-time\ncompute we can further increase accuracy by up to 13% on Stateful GSM-Symbolic\nand 18% on Stateful AIME.

While traditional CMR methods match text and image via\nembedding-based similarity calculations, recent advancements in pre-trained\ngenerative models have established generative retrieval as a promising\nalternative. This paradigm assigns each target a unique identifier and\nleverages a generative model to directly predict identifiers corresponding to\ninput queries without explicit indexing. Despite its great potential, current\ngenerative CMR approaches still face semantic information insufficiency in both\nidentifier construction and generation processes. To address these limitations,\nwe propose a novel unified Semantic-enhanced generative Cross-mOdal REtrieval\nframework (SemCORE), designed to unleash the semantic understanding\ncapabilities in generative cross-modal retrieval task.

While prior research combining visual and tactile\n(visuotactile) information has shown promise, these approaches often struggle\nwith generalization due to the limited availability of visuotactile data. In\nthis paper, we introduce ViTa-Zero, a zero-shot visuotactile pose estimation\nframework. Our key innovation lies in leveraging a visual model as its backbone\nand performing feasibility checking and test-time optimization based on\nphysical constraints derived from tactile and proprioceptive observations.\nSpecifically, we model the gripper-object interaction as a spring-mass system,\nwhere tactile sensors induce attractive forces, and proprioception generates\nrepulsive forces. We validate our framework through experiments on a real-world\nrobot setup, demonstrating its effectiveness across representative visual\nbackbones and manipulation scenarios, including grasping, object picking, and\nbimanual handover. Compared to the visual models, our approach overcomes some\ndrastic failure modes while tracking the in-hand object pose. In our\nexperiments, our approach shows an average increase of 55% in AUC of ADD-S and\n60% in ADD, along with an 80% lower position error compared to FoundationPose.", "AI": {"tldr": "ViTa-Zero \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u89c6\u89c9\u89e6\u89c9\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7269\u4f536D\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u89e6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u800c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0cViTa-Zero \u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u5e72\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89e6\u89c9\u548c\u672c\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u5f39\u7c27-\u8d28\u91cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cViTa-Zero \u5728 ADD-S AUC \u548c ADD \u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86 55% \u548c 60%\uff0c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86 80%\u3002", "conclusion": "ViTa-Zero \u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u64cd\u4f5c\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}
