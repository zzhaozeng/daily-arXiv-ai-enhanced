Our method represents\nscenes as assemblies of convex 3D primitives, and the same scene can be\nrepresented by different numbers of primitives, allowing an editor to move\neither whole structures or small details. Once the scene geometry has been\nedited, the image is generated by a flow-based method which is conditioned on\ndepth and a texture hint. Our texture hint takes into account the modified 3D\nprimitives, exceeding texture-consistency provided by existing key-value\ncaching techniques. These texture hints (a) allow accurate object and camera\nmoves and (b) largely preserve the identity of objects depicted. Quantitative\nand qualitative experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior\nworks in visual fidelity, editability, and compositional generalization."}

However, existing MIL methods often\nfail to explicitly capture pathological heterogeneity within WSIs, both\nglobally -- through long-tailed morphological distributions, and locally\nthrough -- tile-level prediction uncertainty. Optimal transport (OT) provides a\nprincipled way of modeling such heterogeneity by incorporating marginal\ndistribution constraints. Building on this insight, we propose OTSurv, a novel\nMIL framework from an optimal transport perspective. Specifically, OTSurv\nformulates survival predictions as a heterogeneity-aware OT problem with two\nconstraints: (1) global long-tail constraint that models prior morphological\ndistributions to avert both mode collapse and excessive uniformity by\nregulating transport mass allocation, and (2) local uncertainty-aware\nconstraint that prioritizes high-confidence patches while suppressing noise by\nprogressively raising the total transport mass. We then recast the initial OT\nproblem, augmented by these constraints, into an unbalanced OT formulation that\ncan be solved with an efficient, hardware-friendly matrix scaling algorithm.\nEmpirically, OTSurv sets new state-of-the-art results across six popular\nbenchmarks, achieving an absolute 3.6% improvement in average C-index. In\naddition, OTSurv achieves statistical significance in log-rank tests and offers\nhigh interpretability, making it a powerful tool for survival prediction in\ndigital pathology.

Unlike previous storytelling methods that primarily focus on\ncharacter consistency and basic motion, FairyGen explicitly disentangles\ncharacter modeling from stylized background generation and incorporates\ncinematic shot design to support expressive and coherent storytelling. Given a\nsingle character sketch, we first employ an MLLM to generate a structured\nstoryboard with shot-level descriptions that specify environment settings,\ncharacter actions, and camera perspectives. To ensure visual consistency, we\nintroduce a style propagation adapter that captures the character's visual\nstyle and applies it to the background, faithfully retaining the character's\nfull visual identity while synthesizing style-consistent scenes. A shot design\nmodule further enhances visual diversity and cinematic quality through frame\ncropping and multi-view synthesis based on the storyboard. To animate the\nstory, we reconstruct a 3D proxy of the character to derive physically\nplausible motion sequences, which are then used to fine-tune an MMDiT-based\nimage-to-video diffusion model. We further propose a two-stage motion\ncustomization adapter: the first stage learns appearance features from\ntemporally unordered frames, disentangling identity from motion; the second\nstage models temporal dynamics using a timestep-shift strategy with frozen\nidentity weights. Once trained, FairyGen directly renders diverse and coherent\nvideo scenes aligned with the storyboard.

There is also a growing expectation for them\nto display human-like personalities during interactions. To meet this\nexpectation, numerous studies have proposed methods for modelling LLM\npersonalities through psychometric evaluations. However, most existing models\nface two major limitations: they rely on the Big Five (OCEAN) framework, which\nonly provides coarse personality dimensions, and they lack mechanisms for\ncontrolling trait intensity. In this paper, we address this gap by extending\nthe Machine Personality Inventory (MPI), which originally used the Big Five\nmodel, to incorporate the 16 Personality Factor (16PF) model, allowing\nexpressive control over sixteen distinct traits. We also developed a structured\nframework known as Specific Attribute Control (SAC) for evaluating and\ndynamically inducing trait intensity in LLMs. Our method introduces\nadjective-based semantic anchoring to guide trait intensity expression and\nleverages behavioural questions across five intensity factors:\n\\textit{Frequency}, \\textit{Depth}, \\textit{Threshold}, \\textit{Effort}, and\n\\textit{Willingness}. Through experimentation, we find that modelling intensity\nas a continuous spectrum yields substantially more consistent and controllable\npersonality expression compared to binary trait toggling. Moreover, we observe\nthat changes in target trait intensity systematically influence closely related\ntraits in psychologically coherent directions, suggesting that LLMs internalize\nmulti-dimensional personality structures rather than treating traits in\nisolation. Our work opens new pathways for controlled and nuanced human-machine\ninteractions in domains such as healthcare, education, and interviewing\nprocesses, bringing us one step closer to truly human-like social machines."}

In this\nwork, we address this issue by proposing a two-pass face aging framework, named\nCradle2Cane, based on few-step text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. The first\npass focuses on solving age accuracy by introducing an adaptive noise injection\n(AdaNI) mechanism. This mechanism is guided by including prompt descriptions of\nage and gender for the given person as the textual condition. Also, by\nadjusting the noise level, we can control the strength of aging while allowing\nmore flexibility in transforming the face. However, identity preservation is\nweakly ensured here to facilitate stronger age transformations. In the second\npass, we enhance identity preservation while maintaining age-specific features\nby conditioning the model on two identity-aware embeddings (IDEmb): SVR-ArcFace\nand Rotate-CLIP. This pass allows for denoising the transformed image from the\nfirst pass, ensuring stronger identity preservation without compromising the\naging accuracy.

However, existing methods struggle\nwith achieving a realistic and seamless transformation across the entire\nlifespan, especially when handling large age gaps or extreme head poses. The\ncore challenge lies in balancing age accuracy and identity preservation--what\nwe refer to as the Age-ID trade-off. Most prior methods either prioritize age\ntransformation at the expense of identity consistency or vice versa. In this\nwork, we address this issue by proposing a two-pass face aging framework, named\nCradle2Cane, based on few-step text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. The first\npass focuses on solving age accuracy by introducing an adaptive noise injection\n(AdaNI) mechanism.

Also, by\nadjusting the noise level, we can control the strength of aging while allowing\nmore flexibility in transforming the face. However, identity preservation is\nweakly ensured here to facilitate stronger age transformations. In the second\npass, we enhance identity preservation while maintaining age-specific features\nby conditioning the model on two identity-aware embeddings (IDEmb): SVR-ArcFace\nand Rotate-CLIP. This pass allows for denoising the transformed image from the\nfirst pass, ensuring stronger identity preservation without compromising the\naging accuracy.

In this paper, we address this gap by extending\nthe Machine Personality Inventory (MPI), which originally used the Big Five\nmodel, to incorporate the 16 Personality Factor (16PF) model, allowing\nexpressive control over sixteen distinct traits. We also developed a structured\nframework known as Specific Attribute Control (SAC) for evaluating and\ndynamically inducing trait intensity in LLMs. Our method introduces\nadjective-based semantic anchoring to guide trait intensity expression and\nleverages behavioural questions across five intensity factors:\n\\textit{Frequency}, \\textit{Depth}, \\textit{Threshold}, \\textit{Effort}, and\n\\textit{Willingness}.

To preserve the\ngeneralization abilities of the pretrained CLIP model, our approach\nincorporates prototype-guided visual feature alignment, ensuring that the\nprompted visual features from the frozen image encoder align closely with\nclass-specific prototypes. Additionally, we propose a cross-modal global-local\nalignment module that focuses on expression-relevant facial features, further\nimproving the alignment between textual and visual features.

These shifts can obscure malicious intent or mimic normal dialogue,\nmaking accurate classification challenging. While Large Language Models (LLMs)\nshow strong performance in natural language tasks, they often struggle with\ncontextual ambiguity and hallucinations in risk-sensitive scenarios. To address\nthese challenges, we present a Domain Knowledge (DK)-Enhanced LLM framework\nthat integrates pretrained LLMs with structured, task-specific insights to\nperform fraud and concept drift detection. The proposed architecture consists\nof three main components: (1) a DK-LLM module to detect fake or deceptive\nconversations; (2) a drift detection unit (OCDD) to determine whether a\nsemantic shift has occurred; and (3) a second DK-LLM module to classify the\ndrift as either benign or fraudulent. We first validate the value of domain\nknowledge using a fake review dataset and then apply our full framework to\nSEConvo, a multiturn dialogue dataset that includes various types of fraud and\nspam attacks.

Yet, a score fails to\ndescribe the video's complex quality dimensions, restricting its applicability.\nBenefiting from the linguistic output, adapting video large multimodal models\n(LMMs) to VQA via instruction tuning has the potential to address this issue.\nThe core of the approach lies in the video quality-centric instruction data.\nPrevious explorations mainly focus on the image domain, and their data\ngeneration processes heavily rely on human quality annotations and proprietary\nsystems, limiting data scalability and effectiveness. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the Score-based Instruction Generation (SIG) pipeline.\nSpecifically, SIG first scores multiple quality dimensions of an unlabeled\nvideo and maps scores to text-defined levels. It then explicitly incorporates a\nhierarchical Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to model the correlation between specific\ndimensions and overall quality, mimicking the human visual system's reasoning\nprocess. The automated pipeline eliminates the reliance on expert-written\nquality descriptions and proprietary systems, ensuring data scalability and\ngeneration efficiency. To this end, the resulting Score2Instruct (S2I) dataset\ncontains over 320K diverse instruction-response pairs, laying the basis for\ninstruction tuning.

To support this hypothesis,\nmethodologically, we delve into the autoregression mechanism of\ntransformer-based LLMs, revealing that it is not inherently causal.\nEmpirically, we introduce a new causal Q&A benchmark called CausalProbe-2024,\nwhose corpora are fresh and nearly unseen for the studied LLMs. The LLMs\nexhibit a significant performance drop on CausalProbe-2024 compared to earlier\nbenchmarks, indicating the fact that they primarily engage in level-1 causal\nreasoning. To bridge the gap towards level-2 causal reasoning, we draw\ninspiration from the fact that human reasoning is usually facilitated by\ngeneral knowledge and intended goals. We propose G^2-Reasoner, a method that\nincorporates general knowledge and goal-oriented prompts into LLMs' causal\nreasoning processes. Experiments demonstrate that G^2-Reasoner significantly\nenhances LLMs' causal reasoning capability, particularly in fresh and\ncounterfactual contexts. This work sheds light on a new path for LLMs to\nadvance towards genuine causal reasoning, going beyond level-1 and making\nstrides towards level-2."}

Developing deep learning-based stereo matching models that\ndeliver high accuracy while operating in real-time continues to be a major\nchallenge in computer vision. In the domain of cost-volume-based stereo\nmatching, accurate disparity estimation depends heavily on large-scale cost\nvolumes. However, such large volumes store substantial redundant information\nand also require computationally intensive aggregation units for processing and\nregression, making real-time performance unattainable.

Our approach\nmitigates the domain gap by leveraging global spatial topology, characterized\nby low-level, high-frequency 3D structures, and by modeling the topological\nrelations of local geometric features through a novel self-supervised learning\ntask. Additionally, we propose an advanced self-training strategy that combines\ncross-domain contrastive learning with self-training, effectively reducing the\nimpact of noisy pseudo-labels and enhancing the robustness of the adaptation\nprocess. Experimental results on three public Sim2Real benchmarks validate the\neffectiveness of our TAM framework, showing consistent improvements over\nstate-of-the-art methods across all evaluated tasks.

This\nwork proposes three methods called dynamic, static, and hybrid configuration\nfor TMC-based traffic signals. A vision-based tracking system is developed to\nestimate the TMC of six intersections in Las Vegas using traffic cameras. The\nintersection design, route (e.g. vehicle movement directions), and signal\nconfiguration files with compatible formats are synthesized and imported into\nSimulation of Urban MObility for signal evaluation with realistic data. The\ninitial experimental results based on estimated waiting times indicate that the\ncycle time of 90 and 120 seconds works best for all intersections. In addition,\nfour intersections show better performance for dynamic signal timing\nconfiguration, and the other two with lower performance have a lower ratio of\ntotal vehicle count to total lanes of the intersection leg. Since daily traffic\nflow often exhibits a bimodal pattern, we propose a hybrid signal method that\nswitches between dynamic and static methods, adapting to peak and off-peak\ntraffic conditions for improved flow management. So, a built-in traffic\ngenerator module creates vehicle routes for 4 hours, including peak hours, and\na signal design module produces signal schedule cycles according to static,\ndynamic, and hybrid methods. Vehicle count distributions are weighted\ndifferently for each zone (i.e., West, North, East, South) to generate diverse\ntraffic patterns. The extended experimental results for 6 intersections with 4\nhours of simulation time imply that zone-based traffic pattern distributions\naffect signal design selection. Although the static method works great for\nevenly zone-based traffic distribution, the hybrid method works well for highly\nweighted traffic at intersection pairs of the West-East and North-South zones."}

Meanwhile, recent advancements in video generation\nmodels have demonstrated remarkable success in achieving temporally consistent\nvideos. In this paper, we introduce VideoTex, a novel framework for seamless\ntexture synthesis that leverages video generation models to address both\nspatial and temporal inconsistencies in 3D textures. Our approach incorporates\ngeometry-aware conditions, enabling precise utilization of 3D mesh structures.\nAdditionally, we propose a structure-wise UV diffusion strategy, which enhances\nthe generation of occluded areas by preserving semantic information, resulting\nin smoother and more coherent textures. VideoTex not only achieves smoother\ntransitions across UV boundaries but also ensures high-quality, temporally\nstable textures across video frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nVideoTex outperforms existing methods in texture fidelity, seam blending, and\nstability, paving the way for dynamic real-time applications that demand both\nvisual quality and temporal coherence."}

Unlike previous storytelling methods that primarily focus on\ncharacter consistency and basic motion, FairyGen explicitly disentangles\ncharacter modeling from stylized background generation and incorporates\ncinematic shot design to support expressive and coherent storytelling. Given a\nsingle character sketch, we first employ an MLLM to generate a structured\nstoryboard with shot-level descriptions that specify environment settings,\ncharacter actions, and camera perspectives. To ensure visual consistency, we\nintroduce a style propagation adapter that captures the character's visual\nstyle and applies it to the background, faithfully retaining the character's\nfull visual identity while synthesizing style-consistent scenes. A shot design\nmodule further enhances visual diversity and cinematic quality through frame\ncropping and multi-view synthesis based on the storyboard. To animate the\nstory, we reconstruct a 3D proxy of the character to derive physically\nplausible motion sequences, which are then used to fine-tune an MMDiT-based\nimage-to-video diffusion model. We further propose a two-stage motion\ncustomization adapter: the first stage learns appearance features from\ntemporally unordered frames, disentangling identity from motion; the second\nstage models temporal dynamics using a timestep-shift strategy with frozen\nidentity weights. Once trained, FairyGen directly renders diverse and coherent\nvideo scenes aligned with the storyboard. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat our system produces animations that are stylistically faithful,\nnarratively structured natural motion, highlighting its potential for\npersonalized and engaging story animation.

Humans form spatial mental models, internal\nrepresentations of unseen space, to reason about layout, perspective, and\nmotion. Our new MindCube benchmark with 21,154 questions across 3,268 images\nexposes this critical gap, where existing VLMs exhibit near-random performance.\nUsing MindCube, we systematically evaluate how well VLMs build robust spatial\nmental models through representing positions (cognitive mapping), orientations\n(perspective-taking), and dynamics (mental simulation for \"what-if\" movements).\nWe then explore three approaches to help VLMs approximate spatial mental\nmodels, including unseen intermediate views, natural language reasoning chains,\nand cognitive maps. The significant improvement comes from a synergistic\napproach, \"map-then-reason\", that jointly trains the model to first generate a\ncognitive map and then reason upon it. By training models to reason over these\ninternal maps, we boosted accuracy from 37.8% to 60.8% (+23.0%). Adding\nreinforcement learning pushed performance even further to 70.7% (+32.9%). Our\nkey insight is that such scaffolding of spatial mental models, actively\nconstructing and utilizing internal structured spatial representations with\nflexible reasoning processes, significantly improves understanding of\nunobservable space."}
