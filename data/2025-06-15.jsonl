This solution offers\nefficient and adaptable video editing without altering the model architecture.\nTo better steer this process, we incorporate additional references, such as\nalternate viewpoints or representative scene states, which serve as visual\nanchors for how content should unfold. We address the control challenge using a\nmask-driven LoRA tuning strategy that adapts a pre-trained image-to-video model\nto the editing context.

In this work, we argue using Kolmogorov complexity that as\nan expression's complexity grows, the likelihood of any interpreting agent\n(human or LLM-powered AI) recovering the single intended meaning vanishes. This\ncomputational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms\npossess meaning in and of themselves is flawed.

MSSD enhances robustness under the RMFM task through a\nweight-sharing self-distillation approach applied across low-level features,\nattention maps, and high-level representations. Additionally, a Word-level\nSelf-aligned Attention Module (WSAM) reduces computational complexity, while a\nMultimodal Composite Transformer (MCT) facilitates efficient multimodal fusion.\nTo tackle OOD challenges, MACI employs a tailored causal graph to mitigate\nlabel and language biases using a Multimodal Causal Module (MCM) and\nfine-grained counterfactual texts. Notably, MACI can independently enhance OOD\ngeneralization with minimal additional parameters. Furthermore, we also\nintroduce the new repartitioned MER OOD datasets. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that CIDer achieves robust performance in both RMFM and OOD\nscenarios, with fewer parameters and faster training compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods. The implementation of this work is publicly\naccessible at https://github.com/gw-zhong/CIDer."}

Current\nresearch on HSI adversarial examples remains limited and faces challenges in\nfully utilizing the structural and feature information of images. To address\nthese issues, this paper proposes a novel method to enhance the transferability\nof the adversarial examples for HSI classification models.

Second, a feature distancing loss targeting\nintermediate layers is designed, which measures the distance between the\namplified features of the original examples and the features of the adversarial\nexamples as the primary loss, while the output layer prediction serves as the\nauxiliary loss. This guides the perturbation to disrupt the features of the\ntrue class in adversarial examples, effectively enhancing transferability.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that the adversarial examples generated by\nthe proposed method achieve effective transferability to black-box models on\ntwo public HSI datasets.

In this work, we take a step toward addressing this\ngap by introducing a systematic, automatic method to evaluate autoformalization\ntasks. The proposed method is based on an epistemically and formally grounded\nensemble (EFG) of LLM judges, defined on criteria encompassing logical\npreservation (LP), mathematical consistency (MC), formal validity (FV), and\nformal quality (FQ), resulting in a transparent assessment that accounts for\ndifferent contributing factors. We validate the proposed framework to serve as\na proxy for autoformalization assessment within the domain of formal\nmathematics. Overall, our experiments demonstrate that the EFG ensemble of LLM\njudges is a suitable emerging proxy for evaluation, more strongly correlating\nwith human assessments than a coarse-grained model, especially when assessing\nformal qualities. These findings suggest that LLM-as-judges, especially when\nguided by a well-defined set of atomic properties, could offer a scalable,\ninterpretable, and reliable support for evaluating formal mathematical\nreasoning."}

Our approach not only\nmitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but\nalso enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through\ncompositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale\nDiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1,\ndemonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and\nstyle-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of\nattention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable\nspecialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of\neffective perturbation strategies."}

However,\nexisting methods typically fall into a conventional paradigm, where generative\nmodels first complete missing areas in 2D, followed by 3D recovery techniques\nto reconstruct the scene, which often results in overly smooth surfaces and\ndistorted geometry, as generative models struggle to infer 3D structure solely\nfrom RGB data. In this paper, we propose SceneCompleter, a novel framework that\nachieves 3D-consistent generative novel view synthesis through dense 3D scene\ncompletion. SceneCompleter achieves both visual coherence and 3D-consistent\ngenerative scene completion through two key components: (1) a\ngeometry-appearance dual-stream diffusion model that jointly synthesizes novel\nviews in RGBD space; (2) a scene embedder that encodes a more holistic scene\nunderstanding from the reference image.

In recent decades, DEM has found widespread applications in fields\nsuch as data visualization, geometry processing, and medical imaging.\nTraditional approaches to DEM primarily rely on iterative numerical solvers for\ndiffusion equations or optimization-based methods that minimize handcrafted\nenergy functionals. However, these conventional techniques often face several\nchallenges: they may suffer from limited accuracy, produce overlapping\nartifacts in extreme cases, and require substantial algorithmic redesign when\nextended from 2D to 3D, due to the derivative-dependent nature of their energy\nformulations. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based\ndensity-equalizing mapping framework (LDEM) using deep neural networks.\nSpecifically, we introduce a loss function that enforces density uniformity and\ngeometric regularity, and utilize a hierarchical approach to predict the\ntransformations at both the coarse and dense levels. Our method demonstrates\nsuperior density-equalizing and bijectivity properties compared to prior\nmethods for a wide range of simple and complex density distributions, and can\nbe easily applied to surface remeshing with different effects.

Specifically, we achieve\nreal-time estimation of RG'G and RBS under two relaxed assumptions: i) the\nmatrices change negligibly in a short time window; ii) the human movements/IMU\nreadings are diverse in such a time window. Intuitively, the first assumption\nreduces the number of candidate matrices, and the second assumption provides\ndiverse constraints, which greatly reduces the solution space and allows for\naccurate estimation of RG'G and RBS from a short history of IMU readings in\nreal time. To achieve this, we created synthetic datasets of paired RG'G, RBS\nmatrices and IMU readings, and learned their mappings using a Transformer-based\nmodel. We also designed a calibration trigger based on the diversity of IMU\nreadings to ensure that assumption ii) is met before applying our method. To\nour knowledge, we are the first to achieve implicit IMU calibration (i.e.,\nseamlessly putting IMUs into use without the need for an explicit calibration\nprocess), as well as the first to enable long-term and accurate motion capture\nusing sparse IMUs.
