Among other factors, spray boom\ninstability is one of the major contributors to application errors. Spray\nbooms' width of 38m, combined with 30 kph driving speeds, varying terrain, and\nmachine dynamics when maneuvering complex field boundaries, make controls of\nthese booms very complex. However, there is no quantitative knowledge on the\nextent of boom movement to systematically develop a solution that might include\nboom designs and responsive boom control systems. Therefore, this study was\nconducted to develop an automated computer vision system to quantify the boom\nmovement of various agricultural sprayers. A computer vision system was\ndeveloped to track a target on the edge of the sprayer boom in real time. YOLO\nV7, V8, and V11 neural network models were trained to track the boom's\nmovements in field operations to quantify effective displacement in the\nvertical and transverse directions. An inclinometer sensor was mounted on the\nboom to capture boom angles and validate the neural network model output. The\nresults showed that the model could detect the target with more than 90 percent\naccuracy, and distance estimates of the target on the boom were within 0.026 m\nof the inclinometer sensor data. This system can quantify the boom movement on\nthe current sprayer and potentially on any other sprayer with minor\nmodifications. The data can be used to make design improvements to make sprayer\nbooms more stable and achieve greater application accuracy."}

In real-world crowd scenes, the vast majority of spatial regions\n(often over 95%) contain no people, leading to heavily imbalanced count\ndistributions. Ignoring this imbalance can bias models toward overestimating\ndense regions and underperforming in sparse areas. Furthermore, most loss\nfunctions used in density estimation are majorly based on MSE and implicitly\nassume Gaussian distributions, which are ill-suited for modeling discrete,\nnon-negative count data. In this paper, we propose EBC-ZIP, a crowd counting\nframework that models the spatial distribution of counts using a Zero-Inflated\nPoisson (ZIP) regression formulation. Our approach replaces the traditional\nregression loss with the negative log-likelihood of the ZIP distribution,\nenabling better handling of zero-heavy distributions while preserving count\naccuracy. Built upon the recently proposed Enhanced Block Classification (EBC)\nframework, EBC-ZIP inherits EBC's advantages in preserving the discreteness of\ntargets and ensuring training stability, while further improving performance\nthrough a more principled probabilistic loss.

In this paper, we propose a more general probabilistic\nmodel of reading behavior, based on a marked spatio-temporal point process,\nthat captures not only how long fixations last, but also where they land in\nspace and when they take place in time. The saccades are modeled using a Hawkes\nprocess, which captures how each fixation excites the probability of a new\nfixation occurring near it in time and space. The duration time of fixation\nevents is modeled as a function of fixation-specific predictors convolved\nacross time, thus capturing spillover effects. Empirically, our Hawkes process\nmodel exhibits a better fit to human saccades than baselines. With respect to\nfixation durations, we observe that incorporating contextual surprisal as a\npredictor results in only a marginal improvement in the model's predictive\naccuracy. This finding suggests that surprisal theory struggles to explain\nfine-grained eye movements."}

While recent\nsurgical foundation models pretrained on large-scale vision-language data offer\npromising transferability, their zero-shot performance remains constrained by\ndomain shifts, limiting their utility in unseen surgical environments. To\naddress this, we introduce Surgical Phase Anywhere (SPA), a lightweight\nframework for versatile surgical workflow understanding that adapts foundation\nmodels to institutional settings with minimal annotation. SPA leverages\nfew-shot spatial adaptation to align multi-modal embeddings with\ninstitution-specific surgical scenes and phases. It also ensures temporal\nconsistency through diffusion modeling, which encodes task-graph priors derived\nfrom institutional procedure protocols. Finally, SPA employs dynamic test-time\nadaptation, exploiting the mutual agreement between multi-modal phase\nprediction streams to adapt the model to a given test video in a\nself-supervised manner, enhancing the reliability under test-time distribution\nshifts. SPA is a lightweight adaptation framework, allowing hospitals to\nrapidly customize phase recognition models by defining phases in natural\nlanguage text, annotating a few images with the phase labels, and providing a\ntask graph defining phase transitions. The experimental results show that the\nSPA framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in few-shot surgical phase\nrecognition across multiple institutions and procedures, even outperforming\nfull-shot models with 32-shot labeled data.

These image\nprompts are used to guide an edit-aware flow in the latent space of a\npre-trained multi-view diffusion model, allowing the edit to be coherently\npropagated across views. Our method operates in a feed-forward manner, without\noptimization, and preserves the identity of the original object, in both\nstructure and appearance. We demonstrate its effectiveness across a range of\nobject categories and editing scenarios, achieving high fidelity to the source\nwhile requiring no manual masks."}

Murthy", "Rosie Zhao", "Jennifer Hu", "Sham Kakade", "Markus Wulfmeier", "Peng Qian", "Tomer Ullman"], "title": "Inside you are many wolves: Using cognitive models to interpret value trade-offs in LLMs", "comment": "11 pages, 3 figures", "summary": "Navigating everyday social situations often requires juggling conflicting\ngoals, such as conveying a harsh truth, maintaining trust, all while still\nbeing mindful of another person's feelings. These value trade-offs are an\nintegral part of human decision-making and language use, however, current tools\nfor interpreting such dynamic and multi-faceted notions of values in LLMs are\nlimited. In cognitive science, so-called \"cognitive models\" provide formal\naccounts of these trade-offs in humans, by modeling the weighting of a\nspeaker's competing utility functions in choosing an action or utterance. In\nthis work, we use a leading cognitive model of polite speech to interpret the\nextent to which LLMs represent human-like trade-offs. We apply this lens to\nsystematically evaluate value trade-offs in two encompassing model settings:\ndegrees of reasoning \"effort\" in frontier black-box models, and RL\npost-training dynamics of open-source models. Our results highlight patterns of\nhigher informational utility than social utility in reasoning models, and in\nopen-source models shown to be stronger in mathematical reasoning. Our findings\nfrom LLMs' training dynamics suggest large shifts in utility values early on in\ntraining with persistent effects of the choice of base model and pretraining\ndata, compared to feedback dataset or alignment method. We show that our method\nis responsive to diverse aspects of the rapidly evolving LLM landscape, with\ninsights for forming hypotheses about other high-level behaviors, shaping\ntraining regimes for reasoning models, and better controlling trade-offs\nbetween values during model training."}
