Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), exemplified by the recent Search-R1, offers fast convergence and a value-free formulation that makes it appealing for this setting, yet consistently suffers from training collapse. We identify Lazy Likelihood Displacement (LLD), a systematic reduction or stagnation in the likelihood of both correct and incorrect responses, as the core mechanism driving this failure. LLD emerges early and triggers a self-reinforcing LLD Death Spiral, where declining likelihood leads to low-confidence responses, inflating gradients, and ultimately causing collapse. We empirically characterize this process across models on a Search-R1-style, search-integrated question answering task, revealing a consistent three-phase trajectory: early stagnation, steady decay, and accelerated collapse. To address this, we propose a lightweight likelihood-preserving regularization LLDS for GRPO that activates only when a trajectory's likelihood decreases, and regularizes only the tokens responsible. This fine-grained structure mitigates LLD with minimal interference to optimization. Across seven open-domain and multi-hop QA benchmarks, our method stabilizes training, prevents gradient explosion, and yields substantial performance improvements, including +37.8% gains on Qwen2.5-3B and +32.0% gains on Qwen2.5-7B. Our results establish LLD as a fundamental bottleneck in GRPO-based TIRL and provide a practical path toward stable, scalable training of tool-integrated LLM.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6210\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2dGRPO\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5LLDS\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "GRPO\u5728\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6210\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u548c\u65e0\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u9650\u5236\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51faLazy Likelihood Displacement (LLD)\u662f\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u3001\u53ea\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0b\u964d\u8f68\u8ff9\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5LLDS\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u57df\u548c\u591a\u8df3QA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u68af\u5ea6\u7206\u70b8\uff0c\u5728Qwen2.5-3B\u548cQwen2.5-7B\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86+37.8%\u548c+32.0%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "LLD\u662fGRPO-based TIRL\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684LLDS\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6210LLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002"}}

The dataset used is the QADI corpus, which consists of 540,000 sentences across 18 Arabic dialects. Preprocessing challenges include handling inconsistent orthographic variations and non-standard spellings typical of the Libyan dialect. The chi-square analysis revealed that certain features, such as email mentions and emotion indicators, were not significantly associated with dialect classification and were thus excluded from further analysis. Two main experiments were conducted: (1) evaluating the significance of meta-features extracted from the corpus using the chi-square test and (2) assessing classifier performance using different word and character n-gram representations. The classification experiments showed that Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) achieved the highest accuracy of 85.89% and an F1-score of 0.85741 when using a (1,2) word n-gram and (1,5) character n-gram representation. In contrast, Logistic Regression and Linear SVM exhibited slightly lower performance, with maximum accuracies of 84.41% and 84.73%, respectively. Additional evaluation metrics, including log loss, Cohen kappa, and Matthew correlation coefficient, further supported the effectiveness of MNB in this task. The results indicate that carefully selected n-gram representations and classification models play a crucial role in improving the accuracy of Libyan dialect identification.

A lightweight agent supervises retrieval, refinement, or combination of results across both paths when confidence is low. This design maintains header hierarchies, time labels, and units, ensuring that returned values are faithful to the original cells and straightforward to verify. Evaluated on multi-header corporate balance sheets, a heavily merged World Bank workbook, and diverse public datasets, SQuARE consistently surpasses single-strategy baselines and ChatGPT-4o on both retrieval precision and end-to-end answer accuracy while keeping latency predictable.

While complete methods like backtracking guarantee a solution, their exponential time complexity makes them impractical for large-scale instances thus, stochastic approaches, such as Las Vegas algorithm, are preferred. While it offers faster approximate solutions, it suffers from significant performance variance due to random placement of queens on the board. This research introduces a hybrid algorithm built on top of the standard Las Vegas framework through iterative pruning, dynamically eliminating invalid placements during the random assignment phase, thus this method effectively reduces the search space. The analysis results that traditional backtracking scales poorly with increasing N. In contrast, the proposed technique consistently generates valid solutions more rapidly, establishing it as a superior alternative to use where a single, timely solution is preferred over completeness.

The framework proceeds in three stages: embedding-guided subset partition, LLM-driven topic summarization, and LLM-based topic assignment. This design enables direct incorporation of domain knowledge and user preferences, fully leveraging the contextual adaptability of LLMs. Experiments on three public benchmarks and two new domain-specific datasets demonstrate that ClusterFusion not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard tasks but also delivers substantial gains in specialized domains.

Clinical guidelines highlight several 'red flag' features, such as thunderclap onset, meningismus, papilledema, focal neurologic deficits, signs of temporal arteritis, systemic illness, and the 'worst headache of their life' presentation. Despite these guidelines, determining which patients require urgent evaluation remains challenging in primary care settings. Clinicians often work with limited time, incomplete information, and diverse symptom presentations, which can lead to under-recognition and inappropriate care. We present a large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent clinical decision support system built on an orchestrator-specialist architecture, designed to perform explicit and interpretable secondary headache diagnosis from free-text clinical vignettes. The multi-agent system decomposes diagnosis into seven domain-specialized agents, each producing a structured and evidence-grounded rationale, while a central orchestrator performs task decomposition and coordinates agent routing. We evaluated the multi-agent system using 90 expert-validated secondary headache cases and compared its performance with a single-LLM baseline across two prompting strategies: question-based prompting (QPrompt) and clinical practice guideline-based prompting (GPrompt). We tested five open-source LLMs (Qwen-30B, GPT-OSS-20B, Qwen-14B, Qwen-8B, and Llama-3.1-8B), and found that the orchestrated multi-agent system with GPrompt consistently achieved the highest F1 scores, with larger gains in smaller models. These findings demonstrate that structured multi-agent reasoning improves accuracy beyond prompt engineering alone and offers a transparent, clinically aligned approach for explainable decision support in secondary headache diagnosis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u8bca\u65ad\u7ee7\u53d1\u6027\u5934\u75db\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ee7\u53d1\u6027\u5934\u75db\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u4e1a\u62a4\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u5728\u521d\u7ea7\u4fdd\u5065\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5e38\u5e38\u9762\u4e34\u8bca\u65ad\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u6709\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e orchestrator-specialist \u67b6\u6784\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c06\u8bca\u65ad\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e03\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u9886\u57df\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u5fc3 orchestrator \u8fdb\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u572890\u4f8b\u7ecf\u4e13\u5bb6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u7ee7\u53d1\u6027\u5934\u75db\u75c5\u4f8b\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u5357\u7684\u63d0\u793a\uff08GPrompt\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\uff0c\u59cb\u7ec8\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u9ad8\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u900f\u660e\u4e14\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Our results show up to 42% improvement in safety-related metrics for harmful query detection, alongside interesting trade-offs against erroneous refusals, thereby exposing architecture-dependent calibration biases.

Although embedding vector spaces are widely used to represent semantic closeness and are promising for analyzing text difficulty, the abundance of embedding methods creates a challenge in selecting the most suitable method. This study proposes the Educational Cone Model, which is a geometric framework based on the assumption that easier texts are less diverse (focusing on fundamental concepts), whereas harder texts are more diverse. This assumption leads to a cone-shaped distribution in the embedding space regardless of the embedding method used. The model frames the evaluation of embeddings as an optimization problem with the aim of detecting structured difficulty-based patterns. By designing specific loss functions, efficient closed-form solutions are derived that avoid costly computation. Empirical tests on real-world datasets validated the model's effectiveness and speed in identifying the embedding spaces that are best aligned with difficulty-annotated educational texts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6559\u80b2\u9525\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u6790\u6587\u672c\u96be\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u667a\u80fd\u6559\u80b2\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u5e26\u6709\u660e\u786e\u96be\u5ea6\u8bc4\u7ea7\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u800c\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u9525\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u7b80\u5355\u6587\u672c\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u591a\u6837\u6027\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u800c\u56f0\u96be\u6587\u672c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f62\u6210\u9525\u5f62\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5c06\u5d4c\u5165\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u96be\u5ea6\u6807\u6ce8\u6559\u80b2\u6587\u672c\u6700\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6559\u80b2\u9525\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5408\u9002\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u5206\u6790\u6587\u672c\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u667a\u80fd\u6559\u80b2\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Yet their training paradigms remain dominated by affirmation-based inference, akin to \\textit{modus ponens}, where accepted premises yield predicted consequents. While effective for generative fluency, this one-directional approach leaves models vulnerable to logical fallacies, adversarial manipulation, and failures in causal reasoning. This paper makes two contributions. First, it demonstrates how existing LLMs from major platforms exhibit systematic weaknesses when reasoning in scientific domains with negation, counterexamples, or faulty premises \\footnote{Code to recreate these experiments are at https://github.com/hannahdavidsoncollege-maker/ScientificReasoningForEnvironment-MedicineWithLLMs. Second, it introduces a dual-reasoning training framework that integrates affirmative generation with structured counterfactual denial. Grounded in formal logic, cognitive science, and adversarial training, this training paradigm formalizes a computational analogue of ``denying the antecedent'' as a mechanism for disconfirmation and robustness.

Here we introduce a geometric framework in which all psychometric batteries for AI agents are treated as points in a structured moduli space, and agent performance is described by capability functionals over this space. First, we define an Autonomous AI (AAI) Scale, a Kardashev-style hierarchy of autonomy grounded in measurable performance on batteries spanning families of tasks (for example reasoning, planning, tool use and long-horizon control). Second, we construct a moduli space of batteries, identifying equivalence classes of benchmarks that are indistinguishable at the level of agent orderings and capability inferences. This geometry yields determinacy results: dense families of batteries suffice to certify performance on entire regions of task space. Third, we introduce a general Generator-Verifier-Updater (GVU) operator that subsumes reinforcement learning, self-play, debate and verifier-based fine-tuning as special cases, and we define a self-improvement coefficient $\u03ba$ as the Lie derivative of a capability functional along the induced flow. A variance inequality on the combined noise of generation and verification provides sufficient conditions for $\u03ba> 0$.

This difficulty has spurred the development of knowledge editing, which seeks to accurately and efficiently modify a model's internal (parametric) knowledge without retraining it from scratch. However, existing methods suffer from two limitations. First, they depend on structured triplets that are misaligned with the free-text nature of LLM pretraining and fail to capture the nuanced relationships among facts. Second, they typically support one-time knowledge updates, with relatively limited research on the problem of sequential or lifelong editing. To address these gaps, we propose a new task, Lifelong Free-text Knowledge Editing (LF-Edit), which enables models to incorporate updates expressed in natural language and supports continual editing over time. Despite its promise, LF-Edit faces the dual challenge of integrating new knowledge while mitigating the forgetting of prior information. To foster research on this new task, we construct a large-scale benchmark, Multi-Rank Lifelong Free-text Editing Benchmark (MRLF-Bench), containing 16,835 free-text edit requests. We further design a cognitively inspired multi-rank evaluation framework encompassing four levels: memorization, understanding, constrained comprehension, and reasoning. To tackle the challenges inherent in LF-Edit, we introduce a novel approach named EvoEdit that enhances knowledge injection through Latent Perturbation Augmentation and preserves prior information via Knowledge-driven Parameter Fusion.

Context compression aims to alleviate this computational bottleneck while retaining critical semantic information. However, existing approaches often fall short: explicit methods may compromise local detail, whereas implicit methods can suffer from positional biases, information degradation, or an inability to capture long-range semantic dependencies. We propose AdmTree, a novel framework for adaptive, hierarchical context compression with a central focus on preserving high semantic fidelity while maintaining efficiency. AdmTree dynamically segments input based on information density, utilizing gist tokens to summarize variable-length segments as the leaves of a semantic binary tree. This structure, together with a lightweight aggregation mechanism and a frozen backbone LLM (thereby minimizing new trainable parameters), enables efficient hierarchical abstraction of the context. By preserving fine-grained details alongside global semantic coherence, mitigating positional bias, and dynamically adapting to content, AdmTree robustly retains the semantic information of long contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAdmTree\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3LLMs\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65f6\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65f6\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u6301\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "AdmTree\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u5272\u8f93\u5165\u3001\u5229\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001\u4f7f\u7528gist tokens\u603b\u7ed3\u4e0d\u540c\u957f\u5ea6\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u805a\u5408\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u51bb\u7ed3\u4e3b\u5e72LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u5c42\u6b21\u62bd\u8c61\u3002", "result": "AdmTree\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u5168\u5c40\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e86\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "conclusion": "AdmTree\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5c42\u6b21\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

In traditional RL settings, agents learn optimal policies through interactions with an environment guided by reward signals. However, when these signals are sparse, delayed, or poorly aligned with the intended task objectives, agents often struggle to learn effectively. Dense reward functions, which provide informative feedback at every step or state transition, offer a potential solution by shaping agent behavior and accelerating learning. Despite their benefits, poorly crafted reward functions can lead to unintended behaviors, reward hacking, or inefficient exploration. This problem is particularly acute in complex or high-dimensional environments where handcrafted rewards are difficult to specify and validate. To address this, recent research has explored a variety of approaches, including inverse reinforcement learning, reward modeling from human preferences, and self-supervised learning of intrinsic rewards. While these methods offer promising directions, they often involve trade-offs between generality, scalability, and alignment with human intent.

However, this accuracy-oriented learning paradigm often suffers from entropy collapse, which reduces policy exploration and limits reasoning capabilities. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient reinforcement learning framework that leverages entropy signals at both the semantic and token levels to improve reasoning. From the data perspective, we introduce semantic entropy-guided curriculum learning, organizing training data from low to high semantic entropy to guide progressive optimization from easier to more challenging tasks. For the algorithmic design, we adopt non-uniform token treatment by imposing KL regularization on low-entropy tokens that critically impact policy exploration and applying stronger constraints on high-covariance portions within these tokens. By jointly optimizing data organization and algorithmic design, our method effectively mitigates entropy collapse and enhances LLM reasoning. Experimental results across 6 benchmarks with 3 different parameter-scale base models demonstrate that our method outperforms other entropy-based approaches in improving reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u8bcd\u5143\u71b5\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u71b5\u5d29\u6e83\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5f0f\u5bb9\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u71b5\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u7b56\u7565\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u89d2\u5ea6\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u71b5\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6309\u8bed\u4e49\u71b5\u4ece\u4f4e\u5230\u9ad8\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u4ece\u6613\u5230\u96be\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u5728\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0a\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u975e\u5747\u5300\u8bcd\u5143\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5bf9\u4f4e\u71b5\u8bcd\u5143\u65bd\u52a0KL\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bcd\u5143\u5185\u7684\u9ad8\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u90e8\u5206\u65bd\u52a0\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u57286\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c3\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u71b5\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

The use of masculine personal nouns to refer to mixed-gender groups or unspecified individuals has been widely debated in academia and the public, with con-flicting perspectives on its gender-neutrality. While psycholinguistic studies suggest that GM is more readily associated with male referents, corpus-based analyses of its actual use remain scarce. We investigate GM in a large corpus of press texts, focusing on lexeme-specific differences across dif-ferent types of personal nouns. We conducted manual annotations of the whole inflectional para-digm of 21 personal nouns, resulting in 6,195 annotated tokens. Our findings reveal considerable differences between lexical items, especially between passive role nouns and prestige-related per-sonal nouns. On a grammatical level, we find that GM occurs predominantly in the plural and in indefinite noun phrases. Furthermore, our data shows that GM is not primarily used to denote entire classes of people, as has been previously claimed. By providing an empirical insight into the use of GM in authentic written language, we contribute to a more nuanced understanding of its forms and manifestations.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising solution for automating data governance by translating user intent into executable transformation code. However, existing benchmarks for automated data science often emphasize snippet-level coding or high-level analytics, failing to capture the unique challenge of data governance: ensuring the correctness and quality of the data itself. To bridge this gap, we introduce GovBench, a benchmark featuring 150 diverse tasks grounded in real-world scenarios, built on data from actual cases. GovBench employs a novel \"reversed-objective\" methodology to synthesize realistic noise and utilizes rigorous metrics to assess end-to-end pipeline reliability. Our analysis on GovBench reveals that current models struggle with complex, multi-step workflows and lack robust error-correction mechanisms. Consequently, we propose DataGovAgent, a framework utilizing a Planner-Executor-Evaluator architecture that integrates constraint-based planning, retrieval-augmented generation, and sandboxed feedback-driven debugging.

Existing test-time adaptation methods often require tuning model parameters, which is not only computationally expensive but also risks degrading the model's pre-existing abilities.To address this, we introduce a lightweight component, Test-Time Steering Vectors (TTSV), which is prepended to the input while keeping the LLM's parameters entirely frozen. By optimizing the TTSV on test data to minimize the model's output entropy, we steer the model towards an internal state of higher confidence, activating its inherent abilities most relevant to the current task. TTSV is both lightweight and highly efficient to optimize, making it a true plug-and-play enhancement.

This paper presents a comprehensive investigation and multiple practical solutions for the repetition problem encountered in real-world batch code interpretation tasks.\n  We identify three distinct repetition patterns: (1) business rule generation repetition, (2) method call relationship analysis repetition, and (3) PlantUML diagram syntax generation repetition. Through rigorous theoretical analysis based on Markov models, we establish that the root cause lies in greedy decoding's inability to escape repetitive loops, exacerbated by self-reinforcement effects.\n  Our comprehensive experimental evaluation demonstrates three viable solutions: (1) Beam Search decoding with early_stopping=True serves as a universal post-hoc mechanism that effectively resolves all three repetition patterns; (2) presence_penalty hyperparameter provides an effective solution specifically for BadCase 1; and (3) Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) fine-tuning offers a universal model-level solution for all three BadCases.\n  The primary value of this work lies in combining first-hand production experience with extensive experimental validation.

Prior efforts sought to tune the knowledge layers of LLMs, proving effective for making selective edits. However, a significant gap exists between their performance in controlled, teacher-forcing evaluations and their real-world effectiveness in lifelong learning scenarios, which greatly limits their practical applicability. This work's empirical analysis reveals two recurring issues associated with this gap: (1) Most traditional methods lead the edited model to overfit to the new fact, thereby degrading pre-trained capabilities; (2) There is a critical absence of a knowledge consolidation stage, leaving new facts insufficiently integrated into LLMs' inference-time behavior under autoregressive generation, thereby leading to a mismatch between parametric knowledge and actual generation behavior. To this end, we propose Edit-then-Consolidate, a novel knowledge editing paradigm that aims to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge editing methods and their real-world applicability. Specifically, (1) our framework mitigates overfitting via Targeted Proximal Supervised Fine-Tuning (TPSFT) that localizes the edit via a trust-region objective to limit policy drift; (2) Then, a consolidation stage using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) aligns the edited knowledge with CoT-based inference policy by optimizing trajectory-level behavior under comprehensive reward signals.

The demand for both automated approaches and deep integration of human insight makes this a challenging problem. We address this gap by proposing an approach to synthesise a FM task-specific evaluator program that provides automation and a custom UI for capturing feedback. The core novelty of our approach lies in: (1) a task-agnostic meta-model that captures properties of any FM task, (2) an interaction protocol for efficient use of human feedback, and (3) an eval synthesiser that selects or generates an appropriate set of evals. We implement our approach in \\toolname and demonstrate the concept on two diverse FM tasks: chart data extraction and document question answering.

Yet, systematic evaluation of these models, especially for languages beyond English, remains limited. \"Challenging the Abilities of LAnguage Models in ITAlian\" (CALAMITA) is a large-scale collaborative benchmarking initiative for Italian, coordinated under the Italian Association for Computational Linguistics. Unlike existing efforts that focus on leaderboards, CALAMITA foregrounds methodology: it federates more than 80 contributors from academia, industry, and the public sector to design, document, and evaluate a diverse collection of tasks, covering linguistic competence, commonsense reasoning, factual consistency, fairness, summarization, translation, and code generation. Through this process, we not only assembled a benchmark of over 20 tasks and almost 100 subtasks, but also established a centralized evaluation pipeline that supports heterogeneous datasets and metrics. We report results for four open-weight LLMs, highlighting systematic strengths and weaknesses across abilities, as well as challenges in task-specific evaluation. Beyond quantitative results, CALAMITA exposes methodological lessons: the necessity of fine-grained, task-representative metrics, the importance of harmonized pipelines, and the benefits and limitations of broad community engagement. CALAMITA is conceived as a rolling benchmark, enabling continuous integration of new tasks and models. This makes it both a resource -- the most comprehensive and diverse benchmark for Italian to date -- and a framework for sustainable, community-driven evaluation.

We address the challenge of segmenting mixed-authorship text, that is identifying transition points in text where authorship shifts from human to AI or vice-versa, a problem with critical implications for authenticity, trust, and human oversight. We introduce a novel framework, called Info-Mask for mixed authorship detection that integrates stylometric cues, perplexity-driven signals, and structured boundary modeling to accurately segment collaborative human-AI content. To evaluate the robustness of our system against adversarial perturbations, we construct and release an adversarial benchmark dataset Mixed-text Adversarial setting for Segmentation (MAS), designed to probe the limits of existing detectors. Beyond segmentation accuracy, we introduce Human-Interpretable Attribution (HIA overlays that highlight how stylometric features inform boundary predictions, and we conduct a small-scale human study assessing their usefulness. Across multiple architectures, Info-Mask significantly improves span-level robustness under adversarial conditions, establishing new baselines while revealing remaining challenges.

We tackle this challenge under a realistic, low-resource constraint: adapting instruct LLMs using only unlabeled target language data. We introduce Source-Shielded Updates (SSU), a selective parameter update strategy that proactively preserves source knowledge. Using a small set of source data and a parameter importance scoring method, SSU identifies parameters critical to maintaining source abilities. It then applies a column-wise freezing strategy to protect these parameters before adaptation. Experiments across five typologically diverse languages and 7B and 13B models demonstrate that SSU successfully mitigates catastrophic forgetting. It reduces performance degradation on monolingual source tasks to just 3.4% (7B) and 2.8% (13B) on average, a stark contrast to the 20.3% and 22.3% from full fine-tuning.

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer strong semantic priors and cross-modal generalization, while world models (WMs) provide actionable latent dynamics for prediction and control. Their combination holds promise for open-ended embodied intelligence, yet introduces two key challenges: (1) establishing a tight coupling between the semantic intent from MLLMs and the dynamic state representations within the WM's latent space, and (2) achieving task-aware adaptability that supports multi-task learning and cross-environment generalization. To address these limitations, we propose BiTAgent, a task-aware dynamic joint framework that enables bidirectional coupling between MLLMs and WMs. BiTAgent establishes two complementary pathways: a forward path that injects MLLM representations into the WM's latent space for semantically guided imagination, and a backward path where WM-generated feedback refines the MLLM's semantic space via dense text-conditioned rewards. This bidirectional interaction is realized through three synergistic components: Task-Aware Dynamic Joint Learning, Task-Aware Behavior Learning, and MLLM-WM Joint Optimization, which together harmonize semantic reasoning and dynamic prediction. Extensive experiments across multi-task and cross-environment settings demonstrate superior stability and generalization over state-of-the-art baselines, marking a step toward open-ended embodied learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aBiTAgent\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u8026\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u548c\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff08WMs\uff09\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u8de8\u73af\u5883\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3MLLMs\u4e0eWMs\u7ed3\u5408\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5373\u5efa\u7acb\u8bed\u4e49\u610f\u56fe\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7d27\u5bc6\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b9e\u73b0\u652f\u6301\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8de8\u73af\u5883\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86BiTAgent\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8054\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0MLLMs\u548cWMs\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1a\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u52a8\u6001\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u884c\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u548cMLLM-WM\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u8de8\u73af\u5883\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0cBiTAgent\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "BiTAgent\u4e3a\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u7684\u5177\u8eab\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u8026\u5408\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u534f\u8c03\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u3002"}}

Mahoney", "Kurt Keutzer", "Amir Gholami"], "title": "Arbitrage: Efficient Reasoning via Advantage-Aware Speculation", "comment": "22 pages", "summary": "Modern Large Language Models achieve impressive reasoning capabilities with long Chain of Thoughts, but they incur substantial computational cost during inference, and this motivates techniques to improve the performance-cost ratio. Among these techniques, Speculative Decoding accelerates inference by employing a fast but inaccurate draft model to autoregressively propose tokens, which are then verified in parallel by a more capable target model. However, due to unnecessary rejections caused by token mismatches in semantically equivalent steps, traditional token-level Speculative Decoding struggles in reasoning tasks. Although recent works have shifted to step-level semantic verification, which improve efficiency by accepting or rejecting entire reasoning steps, existing step-level methods still regenerate many rejected steps with little improvement, wasting valuable target compute. To address this challenge, we propose Arbitrage, a novel step-level speculative generation framework that routes generation dynamically based on the relative advantage between draft and target models. Instead of applying a fixed acceptance threshold, Arbitrage uses a lightweight router trained to predict when the target model is likely to produce a meaningfully better step. This routing approximates an ideal Arbitrage Oracle that always chooses the higher-quality step, achieving near-optimal efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. Across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, Arbitrage consistently surpasses prior step-level Speculative Decoding baselines, reducing inference latency by up to $\\sim2\\times$ at matched accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u9010\u6b65\u7ea7\u6295\u673a\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6Arbitrage\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6295\u673a\u89e3\u7801\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u4ef7\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "Arbitrage\u6846\u67b6\u5f15\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8def\u7531\u5668\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u8349\u7a3f\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f18\u52bf\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u751f\u6210\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u56fa\u5b9a\u63a5\u53d7\u9608\u503c\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cArbitrage\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u7684\u9010\u6b65\u7ea7\u6295\u673a\u89e3\u7801\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u7ea62\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "Arbitrage\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u6548\u7387-\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

A number of recent studies have demonstrated convincing reconstruction of intelligible speech from surface electrocorticographic (ECoG) or intracortical recordings by predicting a series of phonemes or words and using downstream language models to obtain meaningful sentences. A current challenge is to reconstruct speech in a streaming mode by directly regressing cortical signals into acoustic speech. While this has been achieved recently using intracortical data, further work is needed to obtain comparable results with surface ECoG recordings. In particular, optimizing neural decoders becomes critical in this case. Here we present an offline speech decoding pipeline based on an encoder-decoder deep neural architecture, integrating Vision Transformers and contrastive learning to enhance the direct regression of speech from ECoG signals. The approach is evaluated on two datasets, one obtained with clinical subdural electrodes in an epileptic patient, and another obtained with the fully implantable WIMAGINE epidural system in a participant of a motor BCI trial.

However, these methods rely on a costly gradient orthogonalization step. Even efficient iterative approximations such as Newton-Schulz remain expensive, typically requiring dozens of matrix multiplications to converge. We introduce a preconditioning procedure that accelerates Newton-Schulz convergence and reduces its computational cost. We evaluate its impact and show that the overhead of our preconditioning can be made negligible. Furthermore, the faster convergence it enables allows us to remove one iteration out of the usual five without degrading approximation quality. Our publicly available implementation achieves up to a 2.8x speedup in the Newton-Schulz approximation. We also show that this has a direct impact on end-to-end training runtime with 5-10% improvement in realistic training scenarios across two efficiency-focused tasks. On challenging language or vision tasks, we validate that our method maintains equal or superior model performance while improving runtime. Crucially, these improvements require no hyperparameter tuning and can be adopted as a simple drop-in replacement.

Through detailed analysis of its design, its novel prediction-anchored learning method, and its profitable performance in a 64,267-hand trial, this paper makes the case that the solved myth is a distraction from the real, far more interesting challenge: creating AI that can master the art of human imperfection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u6251\u514bAI\u4ee5\u4e0d\u53ef\u88ab\u5265\u524a\u7684\u5b8c\u7f8e\u73a9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u5ff5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPatrick\u7684AI\uff0c\u5b83\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5265\u524a\u5bf9\u624b\u7684\u7406\u5ff5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u95e8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u65b0\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u951a\u5b9a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u624b\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u548c\u975e\u7406\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u572864,267\u624b\u724c\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u76c8\u5229\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6251\u514bAI\u7814\u7a76\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u521b\u5efa\u4e0d\u53ef\u88ab\u5265\u524a\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5373\u8ffd\u6c42\u673a\u5668\u5b8c\u7f8e\u73a9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u73a9\u5bb6\u7684\u975e\u7406\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5373\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5265\u524a\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u624b\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u5dee\u6765\u8d62\u5f97\u6bd4\u8d5b\u3002", "method": "Patrick\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u95e8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u653b\u51fb\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u624b\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u951a\u5b9a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5bf9\u624b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "result": "\u572864,267\u624b\u724c\u7684\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cPatrick\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u76c8\u5229\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5265\u524a\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5b9e\u6218\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8ffd\u6c42\u4e0d\u53ef\u88ab\u5265\u524a\u7684\u201c\u5b8c\u7f8e\u201d\u7b56\u7565\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8bef\u5bfc\uff0c\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u6311\u6218\u5728\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u638c\u63e1\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u827a\u672f\u7684AI\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u6251\u514bAI\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Information extraction from clinical records is a crucial task in digital healthcare. Although traditional NLP techniques have been used for this in the past, they often fall short due to the complexity, variability of clinical language, and high inner semantics in the free clinical text. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a powerful tool for better understanding and generating human-like text, making them highly effective in this area. In this paper, we explore the ability of open-source multilingual LLMs to understand EHRs (Electronic Health Records) in Italian and help extract information from them in real-time.

Existing prompting strategies rely on static correlations rather than generative interpretations of dynamic behavior, lacking critical global and instance-specific context. To address this, we propose STELLA (Semantic-Temporal Alignment with Language Abstractions), a framework that systematically mines and injects structured supplementary and complementary information. STELLA employs a dynamic semantic abstraction mechanism that decouples input series into trend, seasonality, and residual components. It then translates intrinsic behavioral features of these components into Hierarchical Semantic Anchors: a Corpus-level Semantic Prior (CSP) for global context and a Fine-grained Behavioral Prompt (FBP) for instance-level patterns. Using these anchors as prefix-prompts, STELLA guides the LLM to model intrinsic dynamics. Experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that STELLA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in long- and short-term forecasting, showing superior generalization in zero-shot and few-shot settings.

Although relevant to areas such as cryptography, crystallography, and medical imaging, the problem remains unresolved: beyond a few special dimensions, neither optimal packings nor tight upper bounds are known. Even a major breakthrough in dimension $n=8$, later recognised with a Fields Medal, underscores its difficulty. A leading technique for upper bounds, the three-point method, reduces the problem to solving large, high-precision semidefinite programs (SDPs). Because each candidate SDP may take days to evaluate, standard data-intensive AI approaches are infeasible. We address this challenge by formulating SDP construction as a sequential decision process, the SDP game, in which a policy assembles SDP formulations from a set of admissible components. Using a sample-efficient model-based framework that combines Bayesian optimisation with Monte Carlo Tree Search, we obtain new state-of-the-art upper bounds in dimensions $4-16$, showing that model-based search can advance computational progress in longstanding geometric problems. Together, these results demonstrate that sample-efficient, model-based search can make tangible progress on mathematically rigid, evaluation limited problems, pointing towards a complementary direction for AI-assisted discovery beyond large-scale LLM-driven exploration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u534a\u5b9a\u89c4\u5212\uff08SDP\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u987a\u5e8f\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u4e3an\u7ef4\u7403\u5806\u79ef\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u4e0a\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7403\u5806\u79ef\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u5bc6\u7801\u5b66\u3001\u6676\u4f53\u5b66\u548c\u533b\u5b66\u6210\u50cf\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4ecd\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4e09\u70b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u6807\u51c6AI\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u800c\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5c06SDP\u6784\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u89c6\u4e3a\u987a\u5e8f\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08SDP\u6e38\u620f\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u5408\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\u96c6\u5408\u4e2d\u7ec4\u88c5SDP\u516c\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea64\u523016\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u51e0\u4f55\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u4e25\u683c\u4e14\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u5b9e\u8d28\u6027\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u8f85\u52a9\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u3002"}}

However, current evaluation frameworks may inadequately assess their effectiveness as research collaborators. This rapid review examines benchmarking practices for AI systems in preclinical biomedical research. Three major databases and two preprint servers were searched from January 1, 2018 to October 31, 2025, identifying 14 benchmarks that assess AI capabilities in literature understanding, experimental design, and hypothesis generation. The results revealed that all current benchmarks assess isolated component capabilities, including data analysis quality, hypothesis validity, and experimental protocol design. However, authentic research collaboration requires integrated workflows spanning multiple sessions, with contextual memory, adaptive dialogue, and constraint propagation. This gap implies that systems excelling on component benchmarks may fail as practical research co-pilots. A process-oriented evaluation framework is proposed that addresses four critical dimensions absent from current benchmarks: dialogue quality, workflow orchestration, session continuity, and researcher experience. These dimensions are essential for evaluating AI systems as research co-pilots rather than as isolated task executors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u9762\u5411\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u591a\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5408\u4f5c\u8005\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5feb\u901f\u7efc\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u68c0\u7d22\u4e862018\u5e741\u67081\u65e5\u81f32025\u5e7410\u670831\u65e5\u95f4\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u9884\u5370\u672c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u4e8614\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u4ec5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b64\u7acb\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u96c6\u6210\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5bf9\u8bdd\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u4f20\u64ad\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7f16\u6392\u3001\u4f1a\u8bdd\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u7ecf\u9a8c\u56db\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5408\u4f5c\u8005\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f15\u5165\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f25\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u4fddAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u7814\u7a76\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u534f\u4f5c\u3002"}}

As agent use proliferates, dynamic multi-agent systems have naturally emerged. Recent work has investigated the theoretical and empirical properties of low-dimensional representations of agents based on query responses at a single time point. This paper introduces the Temporal Data Kernel Perspective Space (TDKPS), which jointly embeds agents across time, and proposes several novel hypothesis tests for detecting behavioral change at the agent- and group-level in black-box multi-agent systems. We characterize the empirical properties of our proposed tests, including their sensitivity to key hyperparameters, in simulations motivated by a multi-agent system of evolving digital personas. Finally, we demonstrate via natural experiment that our proposed tests detect changes that correlate sensitively, specifically, and significantly with a real exogenous event.
