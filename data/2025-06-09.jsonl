First, we propose to improve dynamic segmentation in 3D\nby fusing motion segmentation predictions from a 2D-based model into layered\nradiance fields (Layered Motion Fusion).

To train the\nmodel with ICECoT and integrate expert knowledge, we design an automated\nannotation pipeline that produces high-quality training data. Furthermore, we\ndevelop a comprehensive evaluation scheme to assess emotional support efficacy\nand conduct extensive experiments to validate our framework.

In this paper, we analyze these challenges and\ntheir underlying causes. To address them, we propose a novel regularization\nframework called VoxelSplat. This framework leverages recent developments in 3D\nGaussian Splatting to enhance model performance in two key ways: (i) Enhanced\nSemantics Supervision through 2D Projection: During training, our method\ndecodes sparse semantic 3D Gaussians from 3D representations and projects them\nonto the 2D camera view. This provides additional supervision signals in the\ncamera-visible space, allowing 2D labels to improve the learning of 3D\nsemantics. (ii) Scene Flow Learning: Our framework uses the predicted scene\nflow to model the motion of Gaussians, and is thus able to learn the scene flow\nof moving objects in a self-supervised manner using the labels of adjacent\nframes. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into various existing occupancy\nmodels, enhancing performance without increasing inference time.

Later, it was\npointed out that this measure was not an appropriate metric for a valid reason\nand this is why Rosin - through mathematical analysis - introduced a measure\ncalled merit. However, this measure involves optimal scheme of polygonal\napproximation and so it is time-consuming to compute it to assess the goodness\nof an approximation. This led many researchers to use weighted figure of merit\nas a substitute for Rosin's measure to compare among sub-optimal schemes. An\nattempt is made in this communication to investigate whether the two measures -\nweighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure - are related so that one can be\nused instead of the other and towards this end theoretical analysis,\nexperimental investigation and statistical analysis are carried out.

Secondly, we propose a\nconsistency model training strategy for Audio-Image-to-Video to ensure\nreal-time performance, enabling a fast few-step generation. Model quantization\nand pipeline parallelism are further employed to accelerate the inference\nspeed. To mitigate the stability loss incurred by the diffusion process and\nmodel quantization, we introduce a new inference strategy tailored for\nlong-duration video generation. These methods ensure real-time performance and\nlow latency while maintaining high-fidelity output. Thirdly, we incorporate\nclass labels as a conditional input to seamlessly switch between speaking,\nlistening, and idle states. Lastly, we design a novel mechanism for\nfine-grained facial expression control to exploit our model's inherent\ncapacity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves\nlow-latency, fluid, and authentic two-way communication. On an NVIDIA RTX\n4090D, our model achieves a maximum of 78 FPS at a resolution of 384x384 and 45\nFPS at a resolution of 512x512, with an initial video generation latency of 140\nms and 215 ms, respectively."}

Second, they narrowly focus on\nmathematical problem-solving, neglecting the broader spectrum of reasoning\nskills -- including abstract, physical, planning, spatial, and temporal\ncapabilities -- required for robust multimodal intelligence. Third, many\nbenchmarks quickly saturate, offering limited headroom for diagnosing failure\nmodes or measuring continued progress. We introduce MORSE-500 (Multimodal\nReasoning Stress-test Environment), a video benchmark composed of 500 fully\nscripted clips with embedded questions spanning six complementary reasoning\ncategories. Each instance is programmatically generated using deterministic\nPython scripts (via Manim, Matplotlib, MoviePy), generative video models, and\ncurated real footage. This script-driven design allows fine-grained control\nover visual complexity, distractor density, and temporal dynamics -- enabling\ndifficulty to be scaled systematically as models improve. Unlike static\nbenchmarks that become obsolete once saturated, MORSE-500 is built to evolve:\nits controllable generation pipeline supports the creation of arbitrarily\nchallenging new instances, making it ideally suited for stress-testing\nnext-generation models.

CLaMR jointly encodes all modalities with a unified multimodal\nbackbone for improved contextualization and is trained to enhance dynamic\nmodality selection via two key innovations. First, given the lack of training\ndata for multimodal retrieval, we introduce MultiVENT 2.0++, a large-scale\nsynthetic training dataset built on MultiVENT 2.0 (event-centric videos in\nvarious languages paired with queries) with modality-targeted queries. Next, we\npropose a modality-aware loss that jointly trains according to a standard\ncontrastive objective alongside an objective for learning correct modality\nusage.

To mitigate these constraints,\nwe propose SurGSplat, a novel paradigm designed to progressively refine 3D\nGaussian Splatting (3DGS) through the integration of geometric constraints. By\nenabling the detailed reconstruction of vascular structures and other critical\nfeatures, SurGSplat provides surgeons with enhanced visual clarity,\nfacilitating precise intraoperative decision-making. Experimental evaluations\ndemonstrate that SurGSplat achieves superior performance in both novel view\nsynthesis (NVS) and pose estimation accuracy, establishing it as a\nhigh-fidelity and efficient solution for surgical scene reconstruction.

To\naddress this, we propose a novel test-time optimization method that accounts\nfor the impact of such noise to produce more reliable confidence estimates.\nThis score defines a monotonic subset-selection function, where population\naccuracy consistently increases as samples with lower scores are removed, and\nit demonstrates superior performance in standard risk-based metrics such as\nAUSE and AURC.

We\nintroduce DermaCon-IN, a prospectively curated dermatology dataset comprising\nover 5,450 clinical images from approximately 3,000 patients across outpatient\nclinics in South India.

Traditional wound care is\nresource-intensive, requiring frequent in-person visits that strain both\npatients and healthcare professionals (HCPs). Therefore, we present\nWoundAIssist, a patient-centered, AI-driven mobile application designed to\nsupport telemedical wound care. WoundAIssist enables patients to regularly\ndocument wounds at home via photographs and questionnaires, while physicians\nremain actively engaged in the care process through remote monitoring and video\nconsultations.

Developed through an iterative, user-centered process involving\nboth patients and domain experts, WoundAIssist prioritizes an user-friendly\ndesign, particularly for elderly patients. A conclusive usability study with\npatients and dermatologists reported excellent usability, good app quality, and\nfavorable perceptions of the AI-driven wound recognition.

In deep learning, a significant\nchallenge in the backpropagation training process is the design of advanced\noptimisers to improve the convergence speed and stability of the gradient\ndescent learning rule. In particular, in multi-task deep learning ($MTDL$) the\nmultitude of tasks may generate potentially conflicting gradients that would\nhinder the concurrent convergence of the diverse loss functions. This challenge\narises when the gradients of the task objectives have either different\nmagnitudes or opposite directions, causing one or a few to dominate or to\ninterfere with each other, thus degrading the training process. Gradient\nsurgery methods address the problem explicitly dealing with conflicting\ngradients by adjusting the overall gradient trajectory. This work introduces a\nnovel gradient surgery method, the Similarity-Aware Momentum Gradient Surgery\n(SAM-GS), which provides an effective and scalable approach based on a gradient\nmagnitude similarity measure to guide the optimisation process. The SAM-GS\nsurgery adopts gradient equalisation and modulation of the first-order\nmomentum.

A key reason is the lack of a large and uniform dataset for\nteaching robots manipulation skills. Current robot datasets often record robot\naction in different action spaces within a simple scene. This hinders the robot\nto learn a unified and robust action representation for different robots within\ndiverse scenes. Observing how humans understand a manipulation task, we find\nthat understanding how the objects should move in the 3D space is a critical\nclue for guiding actions. This clue is embodiment-agnostic and suitable for\nboth humans and different robots. Motivated by this, we aim to learn a 3D flow\nworld model from both human and robot manipulation data. This model predicts\nthe future movement of the interacting objects in 3D space, guiding action\nplanning for manipulation. Specifically, we synthesize a large-scale 3D optical\nflow dataset, named ManiFlow-110k, through a moving object auto-detect\npipeline. A video diffusion-based world model then learns manipulation physics\nfrom these data, generating 3D optical flow trajectories conditioned on\nlanguage instructions. With the generated 3D object optical flow, we propose a\nflow-guided rendering mechanism, which renders the predicted final state and\nleverages GPT-4o to assess whether the predicted flow aligns with the task\ndescription. This equips the robot with a closed-loop planning ability.\nFinally, we consider the predicted 3D optical flow as constraints for an\noptimization policy to determine a chunk of robot actions for manipulation.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate strong generalization across diverse robotic\nmanipulation tasks and reliable cross-embodiment adaptation without\nhardware-specific training."}

In contrast to conventional reasoning benchmarks\nconsisting of tasks with clear instructions, puzzlehunts require models to\ndiscover the underlying problem structure from multimodal evidence and\niterative reasoning, mirroring real-world domains such as scientific discovery,\nexploratory data analysis, or investigative problem-solving. Despite recent\nprogress in foundation models, their performance on such open-ended settings\nremains largely untested. In this paper, we introduce PuzzleWorld, a\nlarge-scale benchmark of 667 puzzlehunt-style problems designed to assess\nstep-by-step, open-ended, and creative multimodal reasoning. Each puzzle is\nannotated with the final solution, detailed reasoning traces, and cognitive\nskill labels, enabling holistic benchmarking and fine-grained diagnostic\nanalysis. Most state-of-the-art models achieve only 1-2% final answer accuracy,\nwith the best model solving only 14% of puzzles and reaching 40% stepwise\naccuracy. To demonstrate the value of our reasoning annotations, we show that\nfine-tuning a small model on reasoning traces improves stepwise reasoning from\n4% to 11%, while training on final answers alone degrades performance to near\nzero. Our error analysis reveals that current models exhibit myopic reasoning,\nare bottlenecked by the limitations of language-based inference, and lack\nsketching capabilities crucial for visual and spatial reasoning.

In this work, we propose the \\emph{Spectral Pairwise Embedding\nComparison (SPEC)} framework to compare embeddings and identify their\ndifferences in clustering a reference dataset. Our approach examines the kernel\nmatrices derived from two embeddings and leverages the eigendecomposition of\nthe difference kernel matrix to detect sample clusters that are captured\ndifferently by the two embeddings. We present a scalable implementation of this\nkernel-based approach, with computational complexity that grows linearly with\nthe sample size. Furthermore, we introduce an optimization problem using this\nframework to align two embeddings, ensuring that clusters identified in one\nembedding are also captured in the other model. We provide numerical results\ndemonstrating the SPEC's application to compare and align embeddings on\nlarge-scale datasets such as ImageNet and MS-COCO.
