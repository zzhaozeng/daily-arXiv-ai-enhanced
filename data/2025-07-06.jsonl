In this paper, we propose an efficient approximation for image-based\nlighting of glints, enabling fully dynamic material properties and environment\nmaps. Our novel approach is grounded in real-time glint rendering under area\nlight illumination and employs standard environment map filtering techniques.\nCrucially, our environment map filtering process is sufficiently fast to be\nexecuted on a per-frame basis. Our method assumes that the environment map is\npartitioned into few homogeneous regions of constant radiance. By filtering the\ncorresponding indicator functions with the normal distribution function, we\nobtain the probabilities for individual microfacets to reflect light from each\nregion. During shading, these probabilities are utilized to hierarchically\nsample a multinomial distribution, facilitated by our novel dual-gated Gaussian\napproximation of binomial distributions. We validate that our real-time\napproximation is close to ground-truth renderings for a range of material\nproperties and lighting conditions, and demonstrate robust and stable\nperformance, with little overhead over rendering glints from a single\ndirectional light.

While tremendous successes have been achieved for static\nfaces, animatable avatars from monocular videos still fall in the uncanny\nvalley. The de facto standard, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), represents a face\nthrough a collection of 3D Gaussian primitives. 3DGS excels at rendering static\nfaces, but the state-of-the-art still struggles with nonlinear deformations,\ncomplex lighting effects, and fine details.

Our insights\nlead to a novel extension of 3D Gaussians to high-dimensional multivariate\nGaussians, dubbed 'HyperGaussians'. The higher dimensionality increases\nexpressivity through conditioning on a learnable local embedding.

Within the social sciences, psychology, public health, and\nmedicine, audit studies, in which fictitious ``testers'' (e.g., resumes,\nemails, patient actors) are sent to subjects (e.g., job openings, businesses,\ndoctors) in randomized control trials, provide high quality data that support\nrigorous estimates of discrimination. In this paper, we investigate how data\nfrom audit studies can be used to improve our ability to both train and\nevaluate automated hiring algorithms. We find that such data reveals cases\nwhere the common fairness intervention method of equalizing base rates across\nclasses appears to achieve parity using traditional measures, but in fact has\nroughly 10% disparity when measured appropriately. We additionally introduce\ninterventions based on individual treatment effect estimation methods that\nfurther reduce algorithmic discrimination using this data."}

In the proposed BiDA, a triple-branch\ntransformer architecture (the source branch, target branch, and coupled branch)\nwith semantic tokenizer is designed as the backbone. Specifically, the source\nbranch and target branch independently learn the adaptive space of source and\ntarget domains, a Coupled Multi-head Cross-attention (CMCA) mechanism is\ndeveloped in coupled branch for feature interaction and inter-domain\ncorrelation mining. Furthermore, a bi-directional distillation loss is designed\nto guide adaptive space learning using inter-domain correlation.

This framework first\nautomatically disentangles the text prompt using a large language model (LLM)\nand then learns domain-invariant visual representation guided by the\ndisentangled text feature. However, relying solely on language to guide visual\nfeature disentanglement has limitations, as visual features can sometimes be\ntoo complex or nuanced to be fully captured by descriptive text.

To ensure data\nquality, we have conducted in-depth considerations from multiple perspectives.\nFirst, to address the unique challenges of underwater environments, we selected\nvideos that represent typical underwater challenges including light variations,\nwater turbidity, and diverse viewing angles to construct the dataset. Second,\nto ensure data diversity, the dataset covers a wide range of frame rates,\nresolutions, 419 classes of marine animals, and various static plants and\nterrains. Next, for task diversity, we adopted a structured design where\nobservation targets are categorized into two major classes: biological and\nenvironmental. Each category includes content observation and change/action\nobservation, totaling 20 distinct task types. Finally, we designed several\nchallenging evaluation metrics to enable quantitative comparison and analysis\nof different methods. Experiments on two representative VidLMs demonstrate that\nfine-tuning VidLMs on UVLM significantly improves underwater world\nunderstanding while also showing potential for slight improvements on existing\nin-air VidLM benchmarks, such as VideoMME and Perception text.

This paper investigates a practical Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation\n(F$^{2}$TTA) task, where a source model is adapted to such free-form domain\nfragments, with shifts occurring between fragments unpredictably. In this\nsetting, these shifts could distort the adaptation process. To address this\nproblem, we propose a novel Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT)\nframework.

Traditional detectors represent temporal information merely by\nstacking spatial frequency spectra across frames, resulting in the failure to\ndetect temporal artifacts in the pixel plane. Our approach performs a 1D\nFourier transform on the time axis for each pixel, extracting features highly\nsensitive to temporal inconsistencies, especially in areas prone to unnatural\nmovements. To precisely locate regions containing the temporal artifacts, we\nintroduce an attention proposal module trained in an end-to-end manner.\nAdditionally, our joint transformer module effectively integrates pixel-wise\ntemporal frequency features with spatio-temporal context features, expanding\nthe range of detectable forgery artifacts.

However, challenges remain in effectively integrating dynamic motion\nsignals and flexible spatial constraints. Existing T2V methods typically rely\non text prompts, which inherently lack precise control over the spatial layout\nof generated content. In contrast, I2V methods are limited by their dependence\non real images, which restricts the editability of the synthesized content.\nAlthough some methods incorporate ControlNet to introduce image-based\nconditioning, they often lack explicit motion control and require\ncomputationally expensive training. To address these limitations, we propose\nAnyI2V, a training-free framework that animates any conditional images with\nuser-defined motion trajectories.

However, without\nusing large-scale datasets for retraining, these models are difficult to adapt\nto specialized vision tasks, e.g., chart understanding. This problem is caused\nby a mismatch between pre-training and downstream datasets: pre-training\ndatasets primarily concentrate on scenes and objects but contain limited\ninformation about specialized, non-object images, such as charts and tables. In\nthis paper, we share an interesting finding that training an MLLM with\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning data can facilitate model adaptation in\nspecialized vision tasks, especially under data-limited regimes. However, we\nidentify a critical issue within CoT data distilled from pre-trained MLLMs,\ni.e., the data often contains multiple factual errors in the reasoning steps.\nTo address the problem, we propose Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT), a simple\nbootstrapping-based approach that aims to inject grounding information (i.e.,\nbounding boxes) into CoT data, essentially making the reasoning steps more\nfaithful to input images. We evaluate our approach on five specialized vision\ntasks, which cover a variety of visual formats including charts, tables,\nreceipts, and reports.

It reflects\nshared physical constraints, conserved morphological structures, and purposeful\ndynamics that cut across species and settings.
