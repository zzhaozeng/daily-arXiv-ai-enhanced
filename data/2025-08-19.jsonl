By integrating a transport-guided\nmatching mechanism with a geometric volume minimization objective (GAVE), MOVER\nencourages consistent alignment across all modalities in a modality-agnostic\nmanner. Experiments on text-video-audio retrieval tasks demonstrate that MOVER\nsignificantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in both zero-shot and\nfinetuned settings. Additional analysis shows improved generalization to unseen\nmodality combinations and stronger structural consistency in the learned\nembedding space."}

Although considerable\neffort has been dedicated to aligning LLMs with human moral values, existing\nbenchmarks and evaluations remain largely superficial, typically measuring\nalignment based on final ethical verdicts rather than explicit moral reasoning.\nIn response, this paper aims to advance the investigation of LLMs' moral\ncapabilities by examining their capacity to function as Artificial Moral\nAssistants (AMAs), systems envisioned in the philosophical literature to\nsupport human moral deliberation. We assert that qualifying as an AMA requires\nmore than what state-of-the-art alignment techniques aim to achieve: not only\nmust AMAs be able to discern ethically problematic situations, they should also\nbe able to actively reason about them, navigating between conflicting values\noutside of those embedded in the alignment phase. Building on existing\nphilosophical literature, we begin by designing a new formal framework of the\nspecific kind of behaviour an AMA should exhibit, individuating key qualities\nsuch as deductive and abductive moral reasoning. Drawing on this theoretical\nframework, we develop a benchmark to test these qualities and evaluate popular\nopen LLMs against it. Our results reveal considerable variability across models\nand highlight persistent shortcomings, particularly regarding abductive moral\nreasoning.

To tackle the challenge of poor reasoning in Small Language Models\n(SLMs), existing methods typically leverage LLMs to generate massive amounts of\ndata for cramming training. In psychology, they are akin to System 1 thinking,\nwhich resolves reasoning problems rapidly based on experience and intuition.\nHowever, human learning also requires System 2 thinking, where knowledge is\nfirst acquired and then reinforced through practice. Inspired by such two\ndistinct modes of thinking, we propose a novel method based on the multi-LoRA\nInteraction for mathematical reasoning Distillation (LoRID). First, we input\nthe question and reasoning of each sample into an LLM to create\nknowledge-enhanced datasets. Subsequently, we train a LoRA block on the student\nmodel as an Intuitive Reasoner (IR), which directly generates Chain-of-Thoughts\nfor problem-solving. Then, to imitate System 2 thinking, we train the Knowledge\nGenerator (KG) and Deep Reasoner (DR), respectively. The former outputs only\nknowledge after receiving problems, while the latter uses that knowledge to\nperform reasoning. Finally, to address the randomness in the generation of IR\nand DR, we evaluate whether their outputs are consistent, and the inference\nprocess needs to be iterated if not.

Furthermore, we propose OpenMoCap, a novel motion-solving\nmodel designed specifically for robust motion capture in environments with\nsignificant occlusions. Leveraging a marker-joint chain inference mechanism,\nOpenMoCap enables simultaneous optimization and construction of deep\nconstraints between markers and joints. Extensive comparative experiments\ndemonstrate that OpenMoCap consistently outperforms competing methods across\ndiverse scenarios, while the CMU-Occlu dataset opens the door for future\nstudies in robust motion solving. The proposed OpenMoCap is integrated into the\nMoSen MoCap system for practical deployment. The code is released at:\nhttps://github.com/qianchen214/OpenMoCap."}

However, adoption in clinical\nsettings is hindered by low-quality data and biases that may lead AI systems to\nlearn unintended features. To address these challenges, we developed RAIS-DR, a\nResponsible AI System for DR screening that incorporates ethical principles\nacross the AI lifecycle. RAIS-DR integrates efficient convolutional models for\npreprocessing, quality assessment, and three specialized DR classification\nmodels. We evaluated RAIS-DR against the FDA-approved EyeArt system on a local\ndataset of 1,046 patients, unseen by both systems. RAIS-DR demonstrated\nsignificant improvements, with F1 scores increasing by 5-12%, accuracy by\n6-19%, and specificity by 10-20%. Additionally, fairness metrics such as\nDisparate Impact and Equal Opportunity Difference indicated equitable\nperformance across demographic subgroups, underscoring RAIS-DR's potential to\nreduce healthcare disparities. These results highlight RAIS-DR as a robust and\nethically aligned solution for DR screening in clinical settings. The code,\nweights of RAIS-DR are available at\nhttps://gitlab.com/inteligencia-gubernamental-jalisco/jalisco-retinopathy with\nRAIL."}

We design a\ncoarse-to-fine group-guided motion optimization strategy for occlusion-robust\ncrowd reconstruction in large scenes. To address temporal instability and\nsevere occlusions, we further incorporate a VAE (Variational Autoencoder)-based\nhuman motion prior along with a segment-level group-guided optimization. The\ncore of our strategy leverages collective crowd behavior to address long-term\ndynamic occlusions. By jointly optimizing the motion sequences of individuals\nwith similar motion segments and combining this with the proposed Asynchronous\nMotion Consistency (AMC) loss, we enable high-quality unoccluded motion\nsegments to guide the motion recovery of occluded ones, ensuring robust and\nplausible motion recovery even in the presence of temporal desynchronization\nand rhythmic inconsistencies.

The analysis is based on a proposed metric, termed\nCo-Adaptation Score (CA), which quantifies the entanglement among Gaussians,\ni.e., co-adaptation, by computing the pixel-wise variance across multiple\nrenderings of the same viewpoint, with different random subsets of Gaussians.\nThe analysis reveals that the degree of co-adaptation is naturally alleviated\nas the number of training views increases.

There has been a\nsubstantial body of research developing models for determining if a social\nmedia post is abusive or not; however, this research has primarily focused on\nexploiting social media posts individually, overlooking additional context that\ncan be derived from surrounding posts. In this study, we look at conversational\nexchanges, where a user replies to an earlier post by another user (the parent\ntweet). We ask: does leveraging context from the parent tweet help determine if\na reply post is abusive or not, and what are the features that contribute the\nmost? We study a range of content-based and account-based features derived from\nthe context, and compare this to the more widely studied approach of only\nlooking at the features from the reply tweet. For a more generalizable study,\nwe test four different classification models on a dataset made of\nconversational exchanges (parent-reply tweet pairs) with replies labeled as\nabusive or not. Our experiments show that incorporating contextual features\nleads to substantial improvements compared to the use of features derived from\nthe reply tweet only, confirming the importance of leveraging context. We\nobserve that, among the features under study, it is especially the\ncontent-based features (what is being posted) that contribute to the\nclassification performance rather than account-based features (who is posting\nit). While using content-based features, it is best to combine a range of\ndifferent features to ensure improved performance over being more selective and\nusing fewer features.

Furthermore, for the first time in this field, we analyse the\ndistributions of the object categories in the existing MMVOT datasets,\nrevealing their pronounced long-tail nature and a noticeable lack of animal\ncategories when compared with RGB datasets."}

We hence present a\nnew dataset of facial motion sequences featuring nuanced performances and\nsemantic annotation. The data is easily collected using commodity equipment and\nLLM-generated natural language instructions, in the popular ARKit blendshape\nformat. This provides riggable motion, rich with expressive performances and\nlabels. We accordingly train two baseline models, and evaluate their\nperformance for future benchmarking. Using our Express4D dataset, the trained\nmodels can learn meaningful text-to-expression motion generation and capture\nthe many-to-many mapping of the two modalities. The dataset, code, and video\nexamples are available on our webpage: https://jaron1990.github.io/Express4D/"}

While MLLMs excel at visual perception\nand reasoning in third-person and egocentric videos, they are prone to\nhallucinations, generating coherent yet inaccurate responses. We present\nEgoIllusion, a first benchmark to evaluate MLLM hallucinations in egocentric\nvideos. EgoIllusion comprises 1,400 videos paired with 8,000 human-annotated\nopen and closed-ended questions designed to trigger hallucinations in both\nvisual and auditory cues in egocentric videos. Evaluations across ten MLLMs\nreveal significant challenges, including powerful models like GPT-4o and\nGemini, achieving only 59% accuracy. EgoIllusion lays the foundation in\ndeveloping robust benchmarks to evaluate the effectiveness of MLLMs and spurs\nthe development of better egocentric MLLMs with reduced hallucination rates.\nOur benchmark will be open-sourced for reproducibility."}

Caching, a widely adopted optimization method in\nDiT models, leverages the redundancy in the diffusion process to skip\ncomputations in different granularities (e.g., step, cfg, block). Nevertheless,\nexisting caching methods are limited to single-granularity strategies,\nstruggling to balance generation quality and inference speed in a flexible\nmanner. In this work, we propose MixCache, a training-free caching-based\nframework for efficient video DiT inference. It first distinguishes the\ninterference and boundary between different caching strategies, and then\nintroduces a context-aware cache triggering strategy to determine when caching\nshould be enabled, along with an adaptive hybrid cache decision strategy for\ndynamically selecting the optimal caching granularity. Extensive experiments on\ndiverse models demonstrate that, MixCache can significantly accelerate video\ngeneration (e.g., 1.94$\\times$ speedup on Wan 14B, 1.97$\\times$ speedup on\nHunyuanVideo) while delivering both superior generation quality and inference\nefficiency compared to baseline methods."}

Although large language\nmodels (LLMs) have improved text-based ERG, challenges remain in handling\nmultimodal emotional content and maintaining identity consistency. Thus, we\npropose E3RG, an Explicit Emotion-driven Empathetic Response Generation System\nbased on multimodal LLMs which decomposes MERG task into three parts:\nmultimodal empathy understanding, empathy memory retrieval, and multimodal\nresponse generation. By integrating advanced expressive speech and video\ngenerative models, E3RG delivers natural, emotionally rich, and\nidentity-consistent responses without extra training. Experiments validate the\nsuperiority of our system on both zero-shot and few-shot settings, securing\nTop-1 position in the Avatar-based Multimodal Empathy Challenge on ACM MM 25.\nOur code is available at https://github.com/RH-Lin/E3RG."}
