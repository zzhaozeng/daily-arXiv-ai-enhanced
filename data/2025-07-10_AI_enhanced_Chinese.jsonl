Medical evacuation planning involves designing\na robust network of medical platforms and facilities capable of moving and\ntreating large numbers of casualties. Until now, there has not been a medium to\nsimulate these networks in a classroom setting and evaluate both offline\nplanning and online decision-making performance. This work describes the\nMedical Evacuation Wargaming Initiative (MEWI), a three-dimensional multiplayer\nsimulation developed in Unity that replicates battlefield constraints and\nuncertainties. MEWI accurately models patient interactions at casualty\ncollection points, ambulance exchange points, medical treatment facilities, and\nevacuation platforms. Two operational scenarios are introduced: an amphibious\nisland assault in the Pacific and a Eurasian conflict across a sprawling road\nand river network. These scenarios pit students against the clock to save as\nmany casualties as possible while adhering to doctrinal lessons learned during\ndidactic training. We visualize performance data collected from two iterations\nof the MEWI Pacific scenario executed in the United States Army's Medical\nEvacuation Doctrine Course. We consider post-wargame Likert survey data from\nstudent participants and external observer notes to identify key planning\ndecision points, document medical evacuation lessons learned, and quantify\ngeneral utility. Results indicate that MEWI participation substantially\nimproves uptake of medical evacuation lessons learned and co-operative\ndecision-making.

We answer an\nopen problem in the literature by proving that q-dialectical systems are\nstrictly more powerful than p-dialectical systems, which are themselves known\nto be strictly stronger than (d-)dialectical systems. This result highlights\nthe complementary roles of counterexample and contradiction in automated belief\nrevision, and thus also in the reasoning processes of mathematicians and\nresearch communities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86q-\u8fa9\u8bc1\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4p-\u8fa9\u8bc1\u7cfb\u7edf\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u53c8\u6bd4d-\u8fa9\u8bc1\u7cfb\u7edf\u66f4\u5f3a\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u53cd\u4f8b\u548c\u77db\u76fe\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4fee\u6b63\u4e2d\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8fa9\u8bc1\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u5efa\u6a21\u4ee3\u7406\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u65b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u6765\u8ffd\u6c42\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7edf\u4e00\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u5ff5\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u533a\u5206\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u8fa9\u8bc1\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\uff08d-, p-, q-\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u6bd4\u8f83\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "q-\u8fa9\u8bc1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e25\u683c\u5f3a\u4e8ep-\u8fa9\u8bc1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u800cp-\u8fa9\u8bc1\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c8\u4e25\u683c\u5f3a\u4e8ed-\u8fa9\u8bc1\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cd\u4f8b\u548c\u77db\u76fe\u5728\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4fee\u6b63\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u4e92\u8865\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u6570\u5b66\u5bb6\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u793e\u533a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Deep\nlearning-based methods for Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) have achieved\ngood performance. However, these methods often overlook considering human\nperception and lack sufficient constraints within the solution space.\nConsequently, the enhanced images often suffer from diminished perceptual\nquality or poor content restoration.To address these issues, we propose a UIE\nmethod with a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) perception loss\nmodule and curriculum contrastive regularization. Above all, to develop a\nperception model for underwater images that more aligns with human visual\nperception, the visual semantic feature extraction capability of the CLIP model\nis leveraged to learn an appropriate prompt pair to map and evaluate the\nquality of underwater images.

Existing interpretability methods\nlike Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) produce latent concepts individually for each\nmodel, resulting in incompatible concept spaces and limiting cross-model\ninterpretability. To address this, we introduce SPARC (Sparse Autoencoders for\nAligned Representation of Concepts), a new framework that learns a single,\nunified latent space shared across diverse architectures and modalities (e.g.,\nvision models like DINO, and multimodal models like CLIP). SPARC's alignment is\nenforced through two key innovations: (1) a Global TopK sparsity mechanism,\nensuring all input streams activate identical latent dimensions for a given\nconcept; and (2) a Cross-Reconstruction Loss, which explicitly encourages\nsemantic consistency between models. On Open Images, SPARC dramatically\nimproves concept alignment, achieving a Jaccard similarity of 0.80, more than\ntripling the alignment compared to previous methods. SPARC creates a shared\nsparse latent space where individual dimensions often correspond to similar\nhigh-level concepts across models and modalities, enabling direct comparison of\nhow different architectures represent identical concepts without requiring\nmanual alignment or model-specific analysis. As a consequence of this aligned\nrepresentation, SPARC also enables practical applications such as text-guided\nspatial localization in vision-only models and cross-model/cross-modal\nretrieval.

Previous research shows that using\ntest-time learning to encode context directly into model parameters can\neffectively enable reasoning over noisy information.

In this work, we propose\nPERK (Parameter Efficient Reasoning over Knowledge), a scalable approach for\nlearning to encode long input contexts using gradient updates to a lightweight\nmodel adapter at test time. Specifically, PERK employs two nested optimization\nloops in a meta-training phase. The inner loop rapidly encodes contexts into a\nlow-rank adapter (LoRA) that serves as a parameter-efficient memory module for\nthe base model. Concurrently, the outer loop learns to use the updated adapter\nto accurately recall and reason over relevant information from the encoded long\ncontext. Our evaluations on several long-context reasoning tasks show that PERK\nsignificantly outperforms the standard prompt-based long-context baseline,\nachieving average absolute performance gains of up to 90% for smaller models\n(GPT-2) and up to 27% for our largest evaluated model, Qwen-2.5-0.5B.

Essentially, this 2D-3D\ncorrespondence maps a transformed 3D object model to 2D pixels, reflecting the\npose information of the target in camera coordinate system. Meanwhile, the\nintegrated visible mask map can effectively guide our model to disregard\ncluttered background information.

Although most past research has\nfocused on turning sign language into text, doing the reverse, turning spoken\nEnglish into sign language animations, has been largely overlooked. That's\nbecause it involves multiple steps, such as understanding speech, translating\nit into sign-friendly grammar, and generating natural human motion. In this\nwork, we introduce a complete pipeline that converts English speech into\nsmooth, realistic 3D sign language animations. Our system starts with Whisper\nto translate spoken English into text. Then, we use a MarianMT machine\ntranslation model to translate that text into American Sign Language (ASL)\ngloss, a simplified version of sign language that captures meaning without\ngrammar. This model performs well, reaching BLEU scores of 0.7714 and 0.8923.\nTo make the gloss translation more accurate, we also use word embeddings such\nas Word2Vec and FastText to understand word meanings. Finally, we animate the\ntranslated gloss using a 3D keypoint-based motion system trained on\nSign3D-WLASL, a dataset we created by extracting body, hand, and face key\npoints from real ASL videos in the WLASL dataset. To support the gloss\ntranslation stage, we also built a new dataset called BookGlossCorpus-CG, which\nturns everyday English sentences from the BookCorpus dataset into ASL gloss\nusing grammar rules. Our system stitches everything together by smoothly\ninterpolating between signs to create natural, continuous animations. Unlike\nprevious works like How2Sign and Phoenix-2014T that focus on recognition or use\nonly one type of data, our pipeline brings together audio, text, and motion in\na single framework that goes all the way from spoken English to lifelike 3D\nsign language animation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c06\u82f1\u8bed\u8bed\u97f3\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6d41\u7545\u3001\u903c\u771f\u76843D\u624b\u8bed\u52a8\u753b\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u4ece\u53e3\u8bed\u5230\u624b\u8bed\u52a8\u753b\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e2e\u52a9\u804b\u4eba\u548c\u542c\u529b\u969c\u788d\u8005\u66f4\u8f7b\u677e\u5730\u4ea4\u6d41\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8fc7\u53bb\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u624b\u8bed\u8f6c\u6587\u672c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u53e3\u8bed\u8f6c\u624b\u8bed\u52a8\u753b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Whisper\u5c06\u8bed\u97f3\u8f6c\u6587\u672c\uff0cMarianMT\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e3aASL gloss\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Word2Vec\u548cFastText\u4f18\u5316\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u901a\u8fc73D\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u8fd0\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u753b\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0cBLEU\u5206\u6570\u8fbe\u52300.7714\u548c0.8923\uff0c\u5e76\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6BookGlossCorpus-CG\u548cSign3D-WLASL\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ece\u53e3\u8bed\u52303D\u624b\u8bed\u52a8\u753b\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u97f3\u9891\u3001\u6587\u672c\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ee5\u5f80\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u6216\u5355\u4e00\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Alternatively, the\nmodern trajectory prediction framework refines the successive predictions by a\nfixed-anchor selection strategy, which is difficult to adapt in different\nfuture environments. It is acknowledged that human drivers dynamically adjust\ninitial driving decisions based on further assumptions about the intentions of\nsurrounding vehicles. Motivated by human driving behaviors, this paper proposes\nILNet, a multi-agent trajectory prediction method with Inverse Learning (IL)\nattention and Dynamic Anchor Selection (DAS) module. IL Attention employs an\ninverse learning paradigm to model interactions at neighboring moments,\nintroducing proposed intentions to dynamically encode the spatio-temporal\ncoordination of interactions, thereby enhancing the model's ability to capture\ncomplex interaction patterns. Then, the learnable DAS module is proposed to\nextract multiple trajectory change keypoints as anchors in parallel with almost\nno increase in parameters. Experimental results show that the ILNet achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION and Argoverse motion\nforecasting datasets. Particularly, in challenged interaction scenarios, ILNet\nachieves higher accuracy and more multimodal distributions of trajectories over\nfewer parameters.

While several studies have shown that models encode uncertainty\nin their hidden states, it is underexplored how this affects the way they\nprocess such hidden states. In this work, we demonstrate that the dynamics of\noutput token probabilities across layers for certain and uncertain outputs are\nlargely aligned, revealing that uncertainty does not seem to affect inference\ndynamics. Specifically, we use the Tuned Lens, a variant of the Logit Lens, to\nanalyze the layer-wise probability trajectories of final prediction tokens\nacross 11 datasets and 5 models. Using incorrect predictions as those with\nhigher epistemic uncertainty, our results show aligned trajectories for certain\nand uncertain predictions that both observe abrupt increases in confidence at\nsimilar layers.

Most existing methods use equally\npenalized objectives, which ignore the per-point ambiguities and less\ndiscriminated features stemming from transition regions. However, as highly\nambiguous points may be indistinguishable even for humans, their manually\nannotated labels are less reliable, and hard constraints over these points\nwould lead to sub-optimal models. To address this, we first design\nAMContrast3D, a method comprising contrastive learning into an ambiguity\nestimation framework, tailored to adaptive objectives for individual points\nbased on ambiguity levels. As a result, our method promotes model training,\nwhich ensures the correctness of low-ambiguity points while allowing mistakes\nfor high-ambiguity points. As ambiguities are formulated based on position\ndiscrepancies across labels, optimization during inference is constrained by\nthe assumption that all unlabeled points are uniformly unambiguous, lacking\nambiguity awareness. Inspired by the insight of joint training, we further\npropose AMContrast3D++ integrating with two branches trained in parallel, where\na novel ambiguity prediction module concurrently learns point ambiguities from\ngenerated embeddings. To this end, we design a masked refinement mechanism that\nleverages predicted ambiguities to enable the ambiguous embeddings to be more\nreliable, thereby boosting segmentation performance and enhancing robustness.\nExperimental results on 3D indoor scene datasets, S3DIS and ScanNet,\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Preprint version", "summary": "Diffusion models have shown remarkable promise for image restoration by\nleveraging powerful priors. Prominent methods typically frame the restoration\nproblem within a Bayesian inference framework, which iteratively combines a\ndenoising step with a likelihood guidance step. However, the interactions\nbetween these two components in the generation process remain underexplored. In\nthis paper, we analyze the underlying gradient dynamics of these components and\nidentify significant instabilities. Specifically, we demonstrate conflicts\nbetween the prior and likelihood gradient directions, alongside temporal\nfluctuations in the likelihood gradient itself. We show that these\ninstabilities disrupt the generative process and compromise restoration\nperformance. To address these issues, we propose Stabilized Progressive\nGradient Diffusion (SPGD), a novel gradient management technique. SPGD\nintegrates two synergistic components: (1) a progressive likelihood warm-up\nstrategy to mitigate gradient conflicts; and (2) adaptive directional momentum\n(ADM) smoothing to reduce fluctuations in the likelihood gradient. Extensive\nexperiments across diverse restoration tasks demonstrate that SPGD\nsignificantly enhances generation stability, leading to state-of-the-art\nperformance in quantitative metrics and visually superior results.

This field represents language and instance features using\ndistilled CLIP features and masks extracted via the Segment Anything Model\n(SAM).

However, existing standard RGB (sRGB) color\nspace-based LLIE methods often produce color bias and brightness artifacts due\nto the inherent high color sensitivity. While Hue, Saturation, and Value (HSV)\ncolor space can decouple brightness and color, it introduces significant red\nand black noise artifacts. To address this problem, we propose a new color\nspace for LLIE, namely Horizontal/Vertical-Intensity (HVI), defined by the HV\ncolor map and learnable intensity. The HV color map enforces small distances\nfor the red coordinates to remove red noise artifacts, while the learnable\nintensity compresses the low-light regions to remove black noise artifacts.\nAdditionally, we introduce the Color and Intensity Decoupling Network+\n(HVI-CIDNet+), built upon the HVI color space, to restore damaged content and\nmitigate color distortion in extremely dark regions. Specifically, HVI-CIDNet+\nleverages abundant contextual and degraded knowledge extracted from low-light\nimages using pre-trained vision-language models, integrated via a novel\nPrior-guided Attention Block (PAB). Within the PAB, latent semantic priors can\npromote content restoration, while degraded representations guide precise color\ncorrection, both particularly in extremely dark regions through the\nmeticulously designed cross-attention fusion mechanism.

Furthermore, existing calligraphic datasets are extremely scarce,\nand most provide only character-level annotations without additional attribute\ninformation. This limitation has significantly hindered the in-depth study of\nChinese calligraphy. To fill this gap, we present a novel Multi-Attribute\nChinese Calligraphy Character Dataset (MCCD). The dataset encompasses 7,765\ncategories with a total of 329,715 isolated image samples of Chinese\ncalligraphy characters, and three additional subsets were extracted based on\nthe attribute labeling of the three types of script styles (10 types),\ndynasties (15 periods) and calligraphers (142 individuals). The rich\nmulti-attribute annotations render MCCD well-suited diverse research tasks,\nincluding calligraphic character recognition, writer identification, and\nevolutionary studies of Chinese characters. We establish benchmark performance\nthrough single-task and multi-task recognition experiments across MCCD and all\nof its subsets. The experimental results demonstrate that the complexity of the\nstroke structure of the calligraphic characters, and the interplay between\ntheir different attributes, leading to a substantial increase in the difficulty\nof accurate recognition.

However, autonomous driving is a data-driven task. Complete\npanoramic data acquisition requires complex sampling systems and annotation\npipelines, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Although existing\nstreet view generation models have demonstrated strong data regeneration\ncapabilities, they can only learn from the fixed data distribution of existing\ndatasets and cannot achieve high-quality, controllable panoramic generation. In\nthis paper, we propose the first panoramic generation method Percep360 for\nautonomous driving. Percep360 enables coherent generation of panoramic data\nwith control signals based on the stitched panoramic data. Percep360 focuses on\ntwo key aspects: coherence and controllability. Specifically, to overcome the\ninherent information loss caused by the pinhole sampling process, we propose\nthe Local Scenes Diffusion Method (LSDM). LSDM reformulates the panorama\ngeneration as a spatially continuous diffusion process, bridging the gaps\nbetween different data distributions. Additionally, to achieve the controllable\ngeneration of panoramic images, we propose a Probabilistic Prompting Method\n(PPM). PPM dynamically selects the most relevant control cues, enabling\ncontrollable panoramic image generation.

Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification and captioning\nhave become crucial tasks in computer-aided pathology. However, microscopic WSI\nface challenges such as redundant patches and unknown patch positions due to\nsubjective pathologist captures. Moreover, generating automatic pathology\ncaptions remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we introduce\na novel GNN-ViTCap framework for classification and caption generation from\nhistopathological microscopic images. First, a visual feature extractor\ngenerates patch embeddings. Redundant patches are then removed by dynamically\nclustering these embeddings using deep embedded clustering and selecting\nrepresentative patches via a scalar dot attention mechanism. We build a graph\nby connecting each node to its nearest neighbors in the similarity matrix and\napply a graph neural network to capture both local and global context. The\naggregated image embeddings are projected into the language model's input space\nthrough a linear layer and combined with caption tokens to fine-tune a large\nlanguage model.

However, in cross-modal\nsettings, conventional distillation methods encounter significant challenges\ndue to data and statistical heterogeneities, failing to leverage the\ncomplementary prior knowledge embedded in cross-modal teacher models. This\npaper empirically reveals two critical issues in existing approaches:\ndistillation path selection and knowledge drift. To address these limitations,\nwe propose MST-Distill, a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework\nfeaturing a mixture of specialized teachers. Our approach employs a diverse\nensemble of teacher models across both cross-modal and multimodal\nconfigurations, integrated with an instance-level routing network that\nfacilitates adaptive and dynamic distillation. This architecture effectively\ntranscends the constraints of traditional methods that rely on monotonous and\nstatic teacher models. Additionally, we introduce a plug-in masking module,\nindependently trained to suppress modality-specific discrepancies and\nreconstruct teacher representations, thereby mitigating knowledge drift and\nenhancing transfer effectiveness. Extensive experiments across five diverse\nmultimodal datasets, spanning visual, audio, and text, demonstrate that our\nmethod significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art knowledge\ndistillation methods in cross-modal distillation tasks.

Unlike traditional methods that rely on handcrafted thresholds\nor rigid, ruler-specific pipelines, RulerNet directly localizes centimeter\nmarks using a distortion-invariant annotation and training strategy, enabling\nstrong generalization across diverse ruler types and imaging conditions while\nmitigating data scarcity. We also present a scalable synthetic-data pipeline\nthat combines graphics-based ruler generation with ControlNet to add\nphotorealistic context, greatly increasing training diversity and improving\nperformance. To further enhance robustness and efficiency, we propose DeepGP, a\nlightweight feed-forward network that regresses geometric-progression\nparameters from noisy marks and eliminates iterative optimization, enabling\nreal-time scale estimation on mobile or edge devices.

However, a key limitation is the\nuse of CLIP as the visual encoder; while it can capture coarse global\ninformation, it often can miss fine-grained details that are relevant to the\ninput query. To address these shortcomings, this work studies whether\npre-trained text-to-image diffusion models can serve as instruction-aware\nvisual encoders. Through an analysis of their internal representations, we find\ndiffusion features are both rich in semantics and can encode strong image-text\nalignment. Moreover, we find that we can leverage text conditioning to focus\nthe model on regions relevant to the input question. We then investigate how to\nalign these features with large language models and uncover a leakage\nphenomenon, where the LLM can inadvertently recover information from the\noriginal diffusion prompt. We analyze the causes of this leakage and propose a\nmitigation strategy. Based on these insights, we explore a simple fusion\nstrategy that utilizes both CLIP and conditional diffusion features. We\nevaluate our approach on both general VQA and specialized MLLM benchmarks,\ndemonstrating the promise of diffusion models for visual understanding,\nparticularly in vision-centric tasks that require spatial and compositional\nreasoning.
