Mitra"], "title": "B-repLer: Semantic B-rep Latent Editor using Large Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Multimodal large language models (mLLMs), trained in a mixed modal setting as\na universal model, have been shown to compete with or even outperform many\nspecialized algorithms for imaging and graphics tasks. As demonstrated across\nmany applications, mLLMs' ability to jointly process image and text data makes\nthem suitable for zero-shot applications or efficient fine-tuning towards\nspecialized tasks. However, they have had limited success in 3D analysis and\nediting tasks. This is due to both the lack of suitable (annotated) 3D data as\nwell as the idiosyncrasies of 3D representations. In this paper, we investigate\nwhether mLLMs can be adapted to support high-level editing of Boundary\nRepresentation (B-rep) CAD objects. B-reps remain the industry-standard for\nprecisely encoding engineering objects, but are challenging as the\nrepresentation is fragile (i.e. can easily lead to invalid CAD objects) and no\npublicly available data source exists with semantically-annotated B-reps or CAD\nconstruction history.

The Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire (AIHQ)\nis commonly used to measure hostile attribution bias, and includes open-ended\nquestions where participants describe the perceived intentions behind a\nnegative social situation and how they would respond. While these questions\nprovide insights into the contents of hostile attributions, they require\ntime-intensive scoring by human raters. In this study, we assessed whether\nlarge language models can automate the scoring of AIHQ open-ended responses. We\nused a previously collected dataset in which individuals with traumatic brain\ninjury (TBI) and healthy controls (HC) completed the AIHQ and had their\nopen-ended responses rated by trained human raters. We used half of these\nresponses to fine-tune the two models on human-generated ratings, and tested\nthe fine-tuned models on the remaining half of AIHQ responses. Results showed\nthat model-generated ratings aligned with human ratings for both attributions\nof hostility and aggression responses, with fine-tuned models showing higher\nalignment. This alignment was consistent across ambiguous, intentional, and\naccidental scenario types, and replicated previous findings on group\ndifferences in attributions of hostility and aggression responses between TBI\nand HC groups.

However, their\nperformance degrades significantly in niche, safety-critical domains such as\nindustrial spill detection, where hazardous events are rare, sensitive, and\ndifficult to annotate. This scarcity -- driven by privacy concerns, data\nsensitivity, and the infrequency of real incidents -- renders conventional\nfine-tuning of detectors infeasible for most industrial settings.\n  We address this challenge by introducing a scalable framework centered on a\nhigh-quality synthetic data generation pipeline. We demonstrate that this\nsynthetic corpus enables effective Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of\nVLMs and substantially boosts the performance of state-of-the-art object\ndetectors such as YOLO and DETR. Notably, in the absence of synthetic data\n(SynSpill dataset), VLMs still generalize better to unseen spill scenarios than\nthese detectors. When SynSpill is used, both VLMs and detectors achieve marked\nimprovements, with their performance becoming comparable.\n  Our results underscore that high-fidelity synthetic data is a powerful means\nto bridge the domain gap in safety-critical applications. The combination of\nsynthetic generation and lightweight adaptation offers a cost-effective,\nscalable pathway for deploying vision systems in industrial environments where\nreal data is scarce/impractical to obtain.\n  Project Page: https://synspill.vercel.app", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u6cc4\u6f0f\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b49\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u6570\u636e\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u7f55\u89c1\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u6cc4\u6f0f\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b49\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff08PEFT\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347VLMs\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff08\u5982YOLO\u548cDETR\uff09\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff08SynSpill\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86VLMs\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u6cc4\u6f0f\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6709\u6548\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9002\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

By\nconnecting sequential policy optimization with constrained threshold\nscheduling, our approach enables more flexible and effective learning in\nheterogeneous-agent settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods\nsignificantly boost the performance of HATRPO, achieving faster convergence and\nhigher final rewards across diverse MARL benchmarks. Specifically, HATRPO-W and\nHATRPO-G achieve comparable improvements in final performance, each exceeding\n22.5%.

Within the overall framework, the model jointly optimizes contrastive\nloss, structural consistency loss, and semantic preservation loss. A\nmulti-objective supervision mechanism is adopted to improve the semantic\nconsistency and controllability of the generated content. Systematic\nexperiments are conducted on the COCO-2014 dataset.

To address this, knowledge graph-based RAG methods have evolved\ntowards hierarchical structures, organizing knowledge into multi-level\nsummaries. However, these approaches still suffer from two critical,\nunaddressed challenges: high-level conceptual summaries exist as disconnected\n``semantic islands'', lacking the explicit relations needed for cross-community\nreasoning; and the retrieval process itself remains structurally unaware, often\ndegenerating into an inefficient flat search that fails to exploit the graph's\nrich topology. To overcome these limitations, we introduce LeanRAG, a framework\nthat features a deeply collaborative design combining knowledge aggregation and\nretrieval strategies. LeanRAG first employs a novel semantic aggregation\nalgorithm that forms entity clusters and constructs new explicit relations\namong aggregation-level summaries, creating a fully navigable semantic network.\nThen, a bottom-up, structure-guided retrieval strategy anchors queries to the\nmost relevant fine-grained entities and then systematically traverses the\ngraph's semantic pathways to gather concise yet contextually comprehensive\nevidence sets. The LeanRAG can mitigate the substantial overhead associated\nwith path retrieval on graphs and minimizes redundant information retrieval.\nExtensive experiments on four challenging QA benchmarks with different domains\ndemonstrate that LeanRAG significantly outperforming existing methods in\nresponse quality while reducing 46\\% retrieval redundancy.

In figure skating, accurately recognizing\nthe type and timing of jumps a skater performs is essential for objective\nperformance evaluation. However, this task typically requires expert-level\nknowledge due to the fine-grained and complex nature of jump procedures. While\nrecent approaches have attempted to automate this task using Temporal Action\nSegmentation (TAS), there are two major limitations to TAS for figure skating:\nthe annotated data is insufficient, and existing methods do not account for the\ninherent three-dimensional aspects and procedural structure of jump actions. In\nthis work, we propose a new TAS framework for figure skating jumps that\nexplicitly incorporates both the three-dimensional nature and the semantic\nprocedure of jump movements. First, we propose a novel View-Invariant, Figure\nSkating-Specific pose representation learning approach (VIFSS) that combines\ncontrastive learning as pre-training and action classification as fine-tuning.\nFor view-invariant contrastive pre-training, we construct FS-Jump3D, the first\npublicly available 3D pose dataset specialized for figure skating jumps.\nSecond, we introduce a fine-grained annotation scheme that marks the ``entry\n(preparation)'' and ``landing'' phases, enabling TAS models to learn the\nprocedural structure of jumps.

However,\nreal-world EHR data present significant challenges due to the presence of\nrarely observed medical entities and incomplete records that may not fully\ncapture the clinical ground truth. While data-driven models trained on\nlongitudinal Electronic Health Records often achieve strong empirical\nperformance, they struggle to generalize under missing or novel conditions,\nlargely due to their reliance on observed co-occurrence patterns. To address\nthese issues, we propose Hierarchical Ontology and Network Refinement for\nRobust Medication Recommendation (HiRef), a unified framework that combines two\ncomplementary structures: (i) the hierarchical semantics encoded in curated\nmedical ontologies, and (ii) refined co-occurrence patterns derived from\nreal-world EHRs. We embed ontology entities in hyperbolic space, which\nnaturally captures tree-like relationships and enables knowledge transfer\nthrough shared ancestors, thereby improving generalizability to unseen codes.\nTo further improve robustness, we introduce a prior-guided sparse\nregularization scheme that refines the EHR co-occurrence graph by suppressing\nspurious edges while preserving clinically meaningful associations. Our model\nachieves strong performance on EHR benchmarks (MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) and\nmaintains high accuracy under simulated unseen-code settings.

MLLM Orchestration leverages the inherent reasoning capabilities of\nlarge language models to coordinate specialized models through explicit\nworkflows, enabling natural multimodal interactions while maintaining\nmodularity, improving interpretability, and significantly enhancing\ncomputational efficiency. Our orchestration framework is built upon three key\ninnovations: (1) a central controller LLM that analyzes user inputs and\ndynamically routes tasks to appropriate specialized models through carefully\ndesigned agents; (2) a parallel Text-to-Speech architecture that enables true\nfull-duplex interaction with seamless interruption handling and natural\nconversational flow; and (3) a cross-modal memory integration system that\nmaintains coherent context across modalities through intelligent information\nsynthesis and retrieval, selectively avoiding unnecessary modality calls in\ncertain scenarios to improve response speed. Extensive evaluations demonstrate\nthat MLLM Orchestration achieves comprehensive multimodal capabilities without\nadditional training, performance improvements of up to 7.8% over traditional\njointly-trained approaches on standard benchmarks, reduced latency by 10.3%,\nand significantly enhanced interpretability through explicit orchestration\nprocesses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u6392\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u534f\u8c03\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MLLMs\u96be\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u6574\u5408\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09\u5927\u521b\u65b0\uff1a\u4e2d\u592e\u63a7\u5236\u5668LLM\u3001\u5e76\u884cTTS\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u96c6\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u8def\u7531\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u53477.8%\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e10.3%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MLLM Orchestration\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

However, the image matching accuracy is usually degraded by the\nnonlinear radiation and geometric deformation differences caused by different\nspectral responses. To address these problems, we proposed a phase consistency\nweighted least absolute deviation (PCWLAD) sub-pixel template matching method\nto improve the matching accuracy of multimodal optical images. This method\nconsists of two main steps: coarse matching with the structural similarity\nindex measure (SSIM) and fine matching with WLAD. In the coarse matching step,\nPCs are calculated without a noise filter to preserve the original structural\ndetails, and template matching is performed using the SSIM. In the fine\nmatching step, we applied the radiometric and geometric transformation models\nbetween two multimodal PC templates based on the coarse matching. Furthermore,\nmutual structure filtering is adopted in the model to mitigate the impact of\nnoise within the corresponding templates on the structural consistency, and the\nWLAD criterion is used to estimate the sub-pixel offset. To evaluate the\nperformance of PCWLAD, we created three types of image datasets: visible to\ninfrared Landsat images, visible to near-infrared close-range images, and\nvisible to infrared uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) images.

A key obstacle lies in the complexity\nand variability of natural language: essentially equivalent problems often\nappear in diverse surface forms, often obscured by redundant or distracting\ndetails. This imposes a dual burden on SLMs: they must first extract the core\nproblem from complex linguistic input, and then perform reasoning based on that\nunderstanding. The resulting vast and noisy problem space hinders optimization,\nparticularly for models with limited capacity. To address this, we propose a\nnew framework that decouples understanding from reasoning by mapping natural\nlanguage problems into a canonical problem space-a semantically simplified yet\nexpressive domain.

Within this framework, we introduce\nDURIT (Decoupled Understanding from Reasoning via Iterative Training), a\nthree-step algorithm that iteratively: (1) mapping natural language problems\nvia reinforcement learning, (2) aligns reasoning trajectories through\nself-distillation, and (3) trains reasoning policies in the problem space.

Conventional\nfederated tuning approaches on LLM fail to address this need: they optimize\nprimarily for answer correctness while neglecting rationale quality, leaving\nCoT capabilities dependent on models' innate pre-training abilities. Moreover,\nexisting methods for improving rationales typically rely on privacy-violating\nknowledge distillation from centralized models. Additionally, the communication\noverhead in traditional federated fine-tuning on LLMs remains substantial. We\naddresses this gap by proposing FedCoT, a novel framework specifically designed\nto enhance reasoning in federated settings. FedCoT leverages a lightweight\nchain-of-thought enhancement mechanism: local models generate multiple\nreasoning paths, and a compact discriminator dynamically selects the most\npromising one. This approach improves reasoning accuracy and robustness while\nproviding valuable interpretability, which is particularly critical for medical\napplications. To manage client heterogeneity efficiently, we adopt an improved\naggregation approach building upon advanced LoRA module stacking, incorporating\nclient classifier-awareness to achieve noise-free aggregation across diverse\nclients. Comprehensive experiments on medical reasoning tasks demonstrate that\nFedCoT significantly boosts client-side reasoning performance under stringent\nresource budgets while fully preserving data privacy.", "AI": {"tldr": "FedCoT\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5982\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u9762\u4e34\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u5c24\u5176\u9700\u8981\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "method": "FedCoT\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u672c\u5730\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6761\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u7531\u7d27\u51d1\u5224\u522b\u5668\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u91c7\u7528\u6539\u8fdb\u7684LoRA\u6a21\u5757\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFedCoT\u5728\u533b\u7597\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b8c\u5168\u4fdd\u62a4\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u3002", "conclusion": "FedCoT\u4e3a\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u7597\u7b49\u9ad8\u8981\u6c42\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

RTTC operates in a distributed server-client\narchitecture, retrieving relevant samples from a remote knowledge base and\napplying RAG or lightweight fine-tuning on client devices only when necessary.\nTo further mitigate redundant computation, we propose Query-State Caching,\nwhich enables the efficient reuse of historical query states at both retrieval\nand adaptation levels.

At its\nheart, an F-Former progressively aligns the dialogue context with\nknowledge-graph entities through a three-stage curriculum, thus resolving\nfine-grained semantic mismatches. The fused representation is then injected\ninto the frozen language model via two minimal yet adaptive prefix prompts: a\nconversation prefix that steers response generation toward user intent and a\nrecommendation prefix that biases item ranking toward knowledge-consistent\ncandidates.

Experiments on the PrefEval benchmark, including implicit\npreference-following tasks, show that PREF achieves higher accuracy, better\ncalibration, and closer alignment with human judgments than strong baselines.\nBy enabling scalable, interpretable, and user-aligned evaluation, PREF lays the\ngroundwork for more reliable assessment and development of personalised\nlanguage generation systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "PREF\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u53c2\u8003\u65e0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u6b65\u6d41\u7a0b\uff08\u8986\u76d6\u3001\u504f\u597d\u3001\u8bc4\u5206\uff09\u8054\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u6587\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9ec4\u91d1\u53c2\u8003\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u7528\u6237\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u9700\u6c42\uff0cPREF\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "PREF\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u6b65\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a1) \u751f\u6210\u901a\u7528\u51c6\u5219\uff1b2) \u7ed3\u5408\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u751f\u6210\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\uff1b3) \u4f7f\u7528LLM\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "result": "PREF\u5728PrefEval\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "PREF\u4e3a\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While prior research has primarily focused on identifying\nwhether content is authentic, much less is known about how such content\ninfluences human perception and behavior. In domains like trading or the stock\nmarket, predicting how people react (e.g., whether a news post will go viral),\ncan be more critical than verifying its factual accuracy. To address this, we\ntake a human-centered approach and introduce the MhAIM Dataset, which contains\n154,552 online posts (111,153 of them AI-generated), enabling large-scale\nanalysis of how people respond to AI-generated content. Our human study reveals\nthat people are better at identifying AI content when posts include both text\nand visuals, particularly when inconsistencies exist between the two. We\npropose three new metrics: trustworthiness, impact, and openness, to quantify\nhow users judge and engage with online content. We present T-Lens, an LLM-based\nagent system designed to answer user queries by incorporating predicted human\nresponses to multimodal information. At its core is HR-MCP (Human Response\nModel Context Protocol), built on the standardized Model Context Protocol\n(MCP), enabling seamless integration with any LLM.

Unlike\nprevious approaches that rely on fixed slope anchors, SC-Lane adaptively\ndetermines the fusion of slope-specific height features, improving robustness\nto diverse road geometries. To achieve this, we propose a Slope-Aware Adaptive\nFeature module that dynamically predicts the appropriate weights from image\ncues for integrating multi-slope representations into a unified heightmap.\nAdditionally, a Height Consistency Module enforces temporal coherence, ensuring\nstable and accurate height estimation across consecutive frames, which is\ncrucial for real-world driving scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of\nSC-Lane, we employ three standardized metrics-Mean Absolute Error(MAE), Root\nMean Squared Error (RMSE), and threshold-based accuracy-which, although common\nin surface and depth estimation, have been underutilized for road height\nassessment. Using the LiDAR-derived heightmap dataset introduced in prior work\n[20], we benchmark our method under these metrics, thereby establishing a\nrigorous standard for future comparisons. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane\nbenchmark demonstrate that SC-Lane significantly improves both height\nestimation and 3D lane detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance with\nan F-score of 64.3%, outperforming existing methods by a notable margin.

In this work, we introduce\nContrastive Residual Injection and Semantic Prompting (CRISP), an earlier\nattempt tailored to address the instance-wise, category-wise, and task-wise\nconfusion in continual video instance segmentation. For instance-wise learning,\nwe model instance tracking and construct instance correlation loss, which\nemphasizes the correlation with the prior query space while strengthening the\nspecificity of the current task query. For category-wise learning, we build an\nadaptive residual semantic prompt (ARSP) learning framework, which constructs a\nlearnable semantic residual prompt pool generated by category text and uses an\nadjustive query-prompt matching mechanism to build a mapping relationship\nbetween the query of the current task and the semantic residual prompt.\nMeanwhile, a semantic consistency loss based on the contrastive learning is\nintroduced to maintain semantic coherence between object queries and residual\nprompts during incremental training.

Most of the\nexisting online VSR methods solely employ one neighboring previous frame to\nachieve temporal alignment, which limits long-range temporal modeling of\nvideos. Recently, state space models (SSMs) have been proposed with linear\ncomputational complexity and a global receptive field, which significantly\nimprove computational efficiency and performance. In this context, this paper\npresents a novel online VSR method based on Trajectory-aware Shifted SSMs\n(TS-Mamba), leveraging both long-term trajectory modeling and low-complexity\nMamba to achieve efficient spatio-temporal information aggregation.\nSpecifically, TS-Mamba first constructs the trajectories within a video to\nselect the most similar tokens from the previous frames. Then, a\nTrajectory-aware Shifted Mamba Aggregation (TSMA) module consisting of proposed\nshifted SSMs blocks is employed to aggregate the selected tokens. The shifted\nSSMs blocks are designed based on Hilbert scannings and corresponding shift\noperations to compensate for scanning losses and strengthen the spatial\ncontinuity of Mamba. Additionally, we propose a trajectory-aware loss function\nto supervise the trajectory generation, ensuring the accuracy of token\nselection when training our model.

This paper introduces Semantic Divergence\nMetrics (SDM), a novel lightweight framework for detecting Faithfulness\nHallucinations -- events of severe deviations of LLMs responses from input\ncontexts. We focus on a specific implementation of these LLM errors,\n{confabulations, defined as responses that are arbitrary and semantically\nmisaligned with the user's query. Existing methods like Semantic Entropy test\nfor arbitrariness by measuring the diversity of answers to a single, fixed\nprompt. Our SDM framework improves upon this by being more prompt-aware: we\ntest for a deeper form of arbitrariness by measuring response consistency not\nonly across multiple answers but also across multiple, semantically-equivalent\nparaphrases of the original prompt. Methodologically, our approach uses joint\nclustering on sentence embeddings to create a shared topic space for prompts\nand answers. A heatmap of topic co-occurances between prompts and responses can\nbe viewed as a quantified two-dimensional visualization of the user-machine\ndialogue.

We further demonstrate that LLMs have substantial\npotential to improve and standardize the assessment of CHR patients via their\naccuracy in assessing the BPRS in foreign languages (median concordance: 0.88,\nICC: 0.70), and integrating longitudinal information in a one-shot or few-shot\nlearning approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4ece\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bbf\u8c08\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u795e\u5206\u88c2\u75c7\u9ad8\u5371\u60a3\u8005\u7684BPRS\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2dBPRS\u8bc4\u5206\u9700\u8981\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bbf\u8c08\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u3002LLM\u53ef\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u5206\u6790409\u540d\u9ad8\u5371\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bbf\u8c08\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u9884\u6d4bBPRS\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u3001\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u7eb5\u5411\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "LLM\u9884\u6d4b\u7684BPRS\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u8bc4\u4f30\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff08\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u4e00\u81f4\u60270.84\uff0cICC 0.73\uff09\uff0c\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff08\u4e00\u81f4\u60270.88\uff0cICC 0.70\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u5728\u7cbe\u795e\u5206\u88c2\u75c7\u9ad8\u5371\u60a3\u8005\u75c7\u72b6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

As they\nevolve into more sophisticated versions, it is essential to assess whether they\nreproduce biases, such as discrimination and racialization, while maintaining\nhegemonic discourses. Current bias detection approaches rely mostly on\nquantitative, automated methods, which often overlook the nuanced ways in which\nbiases emerge in natural language. This study proposes a qualitative,\ndiscursive framework to complement such methods. Through manual analysis of\nLLM-generated short stories featuring Black and white women, we investigate\ngender and racial biases. We contend that qualitative methods such as the one\nproposed here are fundamental to help both developers and users identify the\nprecise ways in which biases manifest in LLM outputs, thus enabling better\nconditions to mitigate them. Results show that Black women are portrayed as\ntied to ancestry and resistance, while white women appear in self-discovery\nprocesses. These patterns reflect how language models replicate crystalized\ndiscursive representations, reinforcing essentialization and a sense of social\nimmobility. When prompted to correct biases, models offered superficial\nrevisions that maintained problematic meanings, revealing limitations in\nfostering inclusive narratives.

To address this problem, we propose\na segmentationdriven bolt defect editing method (SBDE) to augment the dataset.\nFirst, a bolt attribute segmentation model (Bolt-SAM) is proposed, which\nenhances the segmentation of complex bolt attributes through the CLAHE-FFT\nAdapter (CFA) and Multipart- Aware Mask Decoder (MAMD), generating high-quality\nmasks for subsequent editing tasks. Second, a mask optimization module (MOD) is\ndesigned and integrated with the image inpainting model (LaMa) to construct the\nbolt defect attribute editing model (MOD-LaMa), which converts normal bolts\ninto defective ones through attribute editing. Finally, an editing recovery\naugmentation (ERA) strategy is proposed to recover and put the edited defect\nbolts back into the original inspection scenes and expand the defect detection\ndataset.

In this paper, we aim to develop a new method that predicts\nhuman dance motion from both egocentric video and music.

Despite notable\nadvances in relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and commonsense reasoning,\nexisting surveys often address these directions in isolation, lacking a unified\nanalysis and comparison across reasoning types, methodologies, and evaluation\nprotocols. This survey aims to address this gap by categorizing visual\nreasoning into five major types (relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and\ncommonsense) and systematically examining their implementation through\narchitectures such as graph-based models, memory networks, attention\nmechanisms, and neuro-symbolic systems.

However, current methods frequently produce videos\nwith motion blur and lip jitter, primarily due to their reliance on implicit\nmodeling of audio-facial motion correlations--an approach lacking explicit\narticulatory priors (i.e., anatomical guidance for speech-related facial\nmovements). To overcome this limitation, we propose HM-Talker, a novel\nframework for generating high-fidelity, temporally coherent talking heads.\nHM-Talker leverages a hybrid motion representation combining both implicit and\nexplicit motion cues. Explicit cues use Action Units (AUs), anatomically\ndefined facial muscle movements, alongside implicit features to minimize\nphoneme-viseme misalignment. Specifically, our Cross-Modal Disentanglement\nModule (CMDM) extracts complementary implicit/explicit motion features while\npredicting AUs directly from audio input aligned to visual cues. To mitigate\nidentity-dependent biases in explicit features and enhance cross-subject\ngeneralization, we introduce the Hybrid Motion Modeling Module (HMMM).

Given the LLM's diminished reasoning\nover extended context and high computational cost, retrieval-based approaches\nremain a pivotal role in practice. However, traditional RAG methods can fall\nshort due to their stateless, single-step retrieval process, which often\noverlooks the dynamic nature of capturing interconnected relations within\nlong-range context. In this work, we propose ComoRAG, holding the principle\nthat narrative reasoning is not a one-shot process, but a dynamic, evolving\ninterplay between new evidence acquisition and past knowledge consolidation,\nanalogous to human cognition when reasoning with memory-related signals in the\nbrain. Specifically, when encountering a reasoning impasse, ComoRAG undergoes\niterative reasoning cycles while interacting with a dynamic memory workspace.\nIn each cycle, it generates probing queries to devise new exploratory paths,\nthen integrates the retrieved evidence of new aspects into a global memory\npool, thereby supporting the emergence of a coherent context for the query\nresolution. Across four challenging long-context narrative benchmarks (200K+\ntokens), ComoRAG outperforms strong RAG baselines with consistent relative\ngains up to 11% compared to the strongest baseline. Further analysis reveals\nthat ComoRAG is particularly advantageous for complex queries requiring global\ncomprehension, offering a principled, cognitively motivated paradigm for\nretrieval-based long context comprehension towards stateful reasoning.

In this paper, we conduct the first\nsystematic investigation of text dominance across diverse data modalities,\nincluding images, videos, audio, time-series, and graphs.

Our comprehensive analysis\nreveals that text dominance is both significant and pervasive across all tested\nmodalities. Our in-depth analysis identifies three underlying causes: attention\ndilution from severe token redundancy in non-textual modalities, the influence\nof fusion architecture design, and task formulations that implicitly favor\ntextual inputs. Furthermore, we propose a simple token compression method that\neffectively rebalances model attention. Applying this method to LLaVA-7B, for\ninstance, drastically reduces its MDI from 10.23 to a well-balanced value of\n0.86.

Black-box attacks, notable for their high attack success\nrate without model knowledge, are especially concerning, with their\ntransferability extensively studied to reduce computational costs compared to\nquery-based attacks. Previous transferability-based black-box attacks typically\nadopt mean Average Precision (mAP) as the evaluation metric and design training\nloss accordingly. However, due to the presence of multiple detected bounding\nboxes and the relatively lenient Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds, the\nattack effectiveness of these approaches is often overestimated, resulting in\nreduced success rates in practical attacking scenarios. Furthermore, patches\ntrained on low-resolution data often fail to maintain effectiveness on\nhigh-resolution images, limiting their transferability to autonomous driving\ndatasets. To fill this gap, we propose P$^3$A, a Powerful and Practical Patch\nAttack framework for 2D object detection in autonomous driving, specifically\noptimized for high-resolution datasets. First, we introduce a novel metric,\nPractical Attack Success Rate (PASR), to more accurately quantify attack\neffectiveness with greater relevance for pedestrian safety. Second, we present\na tailored Localization-Confidence Suppression Loss (LCSL) to improve attack\ntransferability under PASR. Finally, to maintain the transferability for\nhigh-resolution datasets, we further incorporate the Probabilistic\nScale-Preserving Padding (PSPP) into the patch attack pipeline as a data\npreprocessing step.

This is the submitted version prior to peer\n  review. The final Version of Record will appear in the MICCAI 2025\n  proceedings (Springer LNCS)", "summary": "Metal artifacts, caused by high-density metallic implants in computed\ntomography (CT) imaging, severely degrade image quality, complicating diagnosis\nand treatment planning. While existing deep learning algorithms have achieved\nnotable success in Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR), they often struggle to\nsuppress artifacts while preserving structural details. To address this\nchallenge, we propose FIND-Net (Fourier-Integrated Network with Dictionary\nKernels), a novel MAR framework that integrates frequency and spatial domain\nprocessing to achieve superior artifact suppression and structural\npreservation. FIND-Net incorporates Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) layers and\ntrainable Gaussian filtering, treating MAR as a hybrid task operating in both\nspatial and frequency domains. This approach enhances global contextual\nunderstanding and frequency selectivity, effectively reducing artifacts while\nmaintaining anatomical structures. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that\nFIND-Net achieves statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art\nMAR methods, with a 3.07% MAE reduction, 0.18% SSIM increase, and 0.90% PSNR\nimprovement, confirming robustness across varying artifact complexities.\nFurthermore, evaluations on real-world clinical CT scans confirm FIND-Net's\nability to minimize modifications to clean anatomical regions while effectively\nsuppressing metal-induced distortions. These findings highlight FIND-Net's\npotential for advancing MAR performance, offering superior structural\npreservation and improved clinical applicability.

However, existing prompt tuning methods rely on\nsparse category labels or disparate LLM-generated descriptions, which fragment\nknowledge representation and hinder transferability. To address this\nlimitation, we introduce Semantic Prompt Tuning (SemPT), a novel framework that\ntackles the generalization challenge by leveraging shared attribute-level\nknowledge across categories. Specifically, SemPT adopts a two-step prompting\nstrategy to guide LLM in extracting shared visual attributes and generating\nattribute-level descriptions, capturing transferable semantic cues beyond\nlabels while ensuring coherent structure. Then, visually guided weighting is\napplied to the embeddings of attribute-level descriptions to reduce noise from\nirrelevant attributes and enhance the text embeddings. Additionally, image\nembeddings are jointly aligned with both label and attribute-enhanced text\nembeddings, balancing discrimination for seen categories and transferability to\nunseen ones. Considering the availability of category exposure, our inference\ndynamically selects between standard label embeddings for seen categories and\nattribute-enhanced embeddings for unseen ones to ensure effective adaptation.\nExtensive experiments on 15 benchmark datasets demonstrate that SemPT achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across various settings, including base-to-novel\ngeneralization, cross-dataset transfer, cross-domain transfer, and few-shot\nlearning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSemPT\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u5c5e\u6027\u7ea7\u77e5\u8bc6\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u89c9\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u672a\u89c1\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7a00\u758f\u7c7b\u522b\u6807\u7b7e\u6216\u5206\u6563\u7684LLM\u751f\u6210\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u788e\u7247\u5316\u5e76\u963b\u788d\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u6b65\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u53d6\u5171\u4eab\u89c6\u89c9\u5c5e\u6027\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u5c5e\u6027\u7ea7\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u5f15\u5bfc\u6743\u91cd\u51cf\u5c11\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5e76\u8054\u5408\u5bf9\u9f50\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u572815\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSemPT\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "SemPT\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u5c5e\u6027\u7ea7\u77e5\u8bc6\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u5df2\u77e5\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u533a\u5206\u6027\u548c\u672a\u89c1\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

The constructed dataset must not contain identities overlapping with any\nexisting public face datasets. To handle this challenge, we begin with a\nthorough cleaning of the baseline HSFace dataset, identifying and removing\nmislabeled or inconsistent identities through a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\nstrategy combining face embedding clustering and GPT-4o-assisted verification.\nWe retain the largest consistent identity cluster and apply data augmentation\nup to a fixed number of images per identity. To further diversify the dataset,\nwe generate synthetic identities using Stable Diffusion with prompt\nengineering. As diffusion models are computationally intensive, we generate\nonly one reference image per identity and efficiently expand it using Vec2Face,\nwhich rapidly produces 49 identity-consistent variants. This hybrid approach\nfuses GAN-based and diffusion-based samples, enabling efficient construction of\na diverse and high-quality dataset. To address the high visual similarity among\nsynthetic identities, we adopt a curriculum learning strategy by placing them\nearly in the training schedule, allowing the model to progress from easier to\nharder samples. Our final dataset contains 50 images per identity, and all\nnewly generated identities are checked with mainstream face datasets to ensure\nno identity leakage. Our method achieves \\textbf{1st place} in the competition,\nand experimental results show that our dataset improves model performance\nacross 10K, 20K, and 100K identity scales.

While autoregressive generative\nmodels are trained only on index values, the prior encoded in the codebook,\nwhich contains rich token similarity information, is not exploited. Recent\nstudies have attempted to incorporate this prior by performing naive k-means\nclustering on the tokens, helping to facilitate the training of generative\nmodels with a reduced codebook. However, we reveal that k-means clustering\nperforms poorly in the codebook feature space due to inherent issues, including\ntoken space disparity and centroid distance inaccuracy. In this work, we\npropose the Discriminative Codebook Prior Extractor (DCPE) as an alternative to\nk-means clustering for more effectively mining and utilizing the token\nsimilarity information embedded in the codebook. DCPE replaces the commonly\nused centroid-based distance, which is found to be unsuitable and inaccurate\nfor the token feature space, with a more reasonable instance-based distance.\nUsing an agglomerative merging technique, it further addresses the token space\ndisparity issue by avoiding splitting high-density regions and aggregating\nlow-density ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCPE is plug-and-play\nand integrates seamlessly with existing codebook prior-based paradigms.

However, existing benchmarks and studies are mainly limited to\ncommon daily activities such as cooking and cleaning.

To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce \\textbf{EgoCross}, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the\ncross-domain generalization of MLLMs in EgocentricQA. EgoCross covers four\ndiverse and challenging domains, including surgery, industry, extreme sports,\nand animal perspective, representing realistic and high-impact application\nscenarios. It comprises approximately 1,000 QA pairs across 798 video clips,\nspanning four key QA tasks: prediction, recognition, localization, and\ncounting. Each QA pair provides both OpenQA and CloseQA formats to support\nfine-grained evaluation. Extensive experiments show that most existing MLLMs,\nwhether general-purpose or egocentric-specialized, struggle to generalize to\ndomains beyond daily life, highlighting the limitations of current models.\nFurthermore, we conduct several pilot studies, \\eg, fine-tuning and\nreinforcement learning, to explore potential improvements.

Existing benchmarks for video authenticity detection typically\nsuffer from limited realism, insufficient scale, and inadequate complexity,\nfailing to effectively evaluate modern vision-language models against\nsophisticated forgeries. To address this critical gap, we introduce AEGIS, a\nnovel large-scale benchmark explicitly targeting the detection of\nhyper-realistic and semantically nuanced AI-generated videos. AEGIS comprises\nover 10,000 rigorously curated real and synthetic videos generated by diverse,\nstate-of-the-art generative models, including Stable Video Diffusion,\nCogVideoX-5B, KLing, and Sora, encompassing open-source and proprietary\narchitectures. In particular, AEGIS features specially constructed challenging\nsubsets enhanced with robustness evaluation. Furthermore, we provide multimodal\nannotations spanning Semantic-Authenticity Descriptions, Motion Features, and\nLow-level Visual Features, facilitating authenticity detection and supporting\ndownstream tasks such as multimodal fusion and forgery localization.

While both step distillation and sparse attention mechanisms have\nshown promise as independent acceleration strategies, effectively combining\nthese approaches presents critical challenges -- training-free integration\nyields suboptimal results, while separately training sparse attention after\nstep distillation requires prohibitively expensive high-quality video data. To\novercome these limitations, we propose BLADE, an innovative data-free joint\ntraining framework that introduces: (1) an Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention\n(ASA) mechanism for dynamically generating content-aware sparsity masks to\nfocus computation on salient spatiotemporal features, and (2) a sparsity-aware\nstep distillation paradigm built upon Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM)\nthat directly incorporates sparsity into the distillation process rather than\ntreating it as a separate compression step, with fast convergence. We validate\nBLADE on text-to-video models like CogVideoX-5B and Wan2.1-1.3B. Our framework\ndemonstrates remarkable efficiency gains across different scales. On\nWan2.1-1.3B, BLADE achieves a 14.10x end-to-end inference acceleration over a\n50-step baseline.

This situation highlights the urgency of developing deepfake\ndetection technology with strong generalization to cope with fast iterative\nforgery techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a Forgery Guided\nLearning (FGL) strategy designed to enable detection networks to continuously\nadapt to unknown forgery techniques. Specifically, the FGL strategy captures\nthe differential information between known and unknown forgery techniques,\nallowing the model to dynamically adjust its learning process in real time. To\nfurther improve the ability to perceive forgery traces, we design a Dual\nPerception Network (DPNet) that captures both differences and relationships\namong forgery traces. In the frequency stream, the network dynamically\nperceives and extracts discriminative features across various forgery\ntechniques, establishing essential detection cues. These features are then\nintegrated with spatial features and projected into the embedding space. In\naddition, graph convolution is employed to perceive relationships across the\nentire feature space, facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of\nforgery trace correlations.

In contrast, model-driven methods offer\ntraining-free, theoretically grounded, and data-efficient alternatives, though\nthey often face scalability and optimization challenges when applied to large\n3D datasets. In this work, we introduce DARC (Diffeomorphic Atlas Registration\nvia Coordinate descent), a novel model-driven groupwise registration framework\nfor atlas construction. DARC supports a broad range of image dissimilarity\nmetrics and efficiently handles arbitrary numbers of 3D images without\nincurring GPU memory issues. Through a coordinate descent strategy and a\ncentrality-enforcing activation function, DARC produces unbiased, diffeomorphic\natlases with high anatomical fidelity. Beyond atlas construction, we\ndemonstrate two key applications: (1) One-shot segmentation, where labels\nannotated only on the atlas are propagated to subjects via inverse\ndeformations, outperforming state-of-the-art few-shot methods; and (2) shape\nsynthesis, where new anatomical variants are generated by warping the atlas\nmesh using synthesized diffeomorphic deformation fields.

Additionally, it uses a cartoon adaptation\nmethod with the spatial low-rank adapter to tailor a modern video foundation\nmodel to the cartoon domain while keeping its temporal prior intact. Requiring\nas few as a single sketch and a colored reference frame, ToonComposer excels\nwith sparse inputs, while also supporting multiple sketches at any temporal\nlocation for more precise motion control. This dual capability reduces manual\nworkload and improves flexibility, empowering artists in real-world scenarios.\nTo evaluate our model, we further created PKBench, a benchmark featuring\nhuman-drawn sketches that simulate real-world use cases. Our evaluation\ndemonstrates that ToonComposer outperforms existing methods in visual quality,\nmotion consistency, and production efficiency, offering a superior and more\nflexible solution for AI-assisted cartoon production.", "AI": {"tldr": "ToonComposer\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u4e2d\u95f4\u5e27\u751f\u6210\u548c\u4e0a\u8272\u7edf\u4e00\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u540e\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u52a8\u753b\u5236\u4f5c\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u624b\u52a8\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709AI\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u5404\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u79bb\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u7d2f\u79ef\u548c\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u8349\u56fe\u6ce8\u5165\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5361\u901a\u9002\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u4ee3\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u751f\u4ea7\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ToonComposer\u4e3aAI\u8f85\u52a9\u52a8\u753b\u5236\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u4e14\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, the scarcity of annotated data presents a\nsignificant challenge, which has driven the adoption of self-supervised\nlearning (SSL) methods such as masked image modeling (MIM) to leverage\nlarge-scale unlabeled data for learning transferable representations.\nUnfortunately, conventional MIM often fails to capture vascular anatomy because\nof the severe class imbalance between vessel and background pixels, leading to\nweak vascular representations. To address this, we introduce Vascular\nanatomy-aware Masked Image Modeling (VasoMIM), a novel MIM framework tailored\nfor X-ray angiograms that explicitly integrates anatomical knowledge into the\npre-training process. Specifically, it comprises two complementary components:\nanatomy-guided masking strategy and anatomical consistency loss. The former\npreferentially masks vessel-containing patches to focus the model on\nreconstructing vessel-relevant regions. The latter enforces consistency in\nvascular semantics between the original and reconstructed images, thereby\nimproving the discriminability of vascular representations.

Existing\nstate-of-the-art methods for multi-view reconstruction either depend on\nexpensive global optimization or rely on simplistic memory mechanisms that\nscale poorly with sequence length. In contrast, STream3R introduces an\nstreaming framework that processes image sequences efficiently using causal\nattention, inspired by advances in modern language modeling. By learning\ngeometric priors from large-scale 3D datasets, STream3R generalizes well to\ndiverse and challenging scenarios, including dynamic scenes where traditional\nmethods often fail.
