This study provides a comprehensive performance analysis of Data Oriented Design (DOD) versus the traditional Object-Oriented Design (OOD), focusing on cache utilization and efficiency in multi-threaded environments. We developed and compared four distinct versions of the A* search algorithm: single-threaded OOD (ST-OOD), single-threaded DOD (ST-DOD), multi-threaded OOD (MT-OOD), and multi-threaded DOD (MT-DOD). The evaluation was based on metrics including execution time, memory usage, and CPU cache misses. In multi-threaded tests, the DOD implementation demonstrated considerable performance gains, with faster execution times and a lower number of raw system calls and cache misses. While OOD occasionally showed marginal advantages in memory usage or percentage-based cache miss rates, DOD's efficiency in data-intensive operations was more evident. Furthermore, our findings reveal that for a fine-grained task like the A* algorithm, the overhead associated with thread management led to single-threaded versions significantly outperforming their multi-threaded counterparts in both paradigms. We conclude that even when performance differences appear subtle in simple algorithms, the consistent advantages of DOD in critical metrics highlight its foundational architectural superiority, suggesting it is a more effective approach for maximizing hardware efficiency in complex, large-scale AI and parallel computing tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u591a\u6838CPU\u4e0e\u5185\u5b58\u4e4b\u95f4\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u5bfc\u5411\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08DOD\uff09\u4e0e\u9762\u5411\u5bf9\u8c61\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08OOD\uff09\u5728\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0b\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u786c\u4ef6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u591a\u6838CPU\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4f18\u5316\u7f13\u5b58\u5229\u7528\u7387\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u7248\u672c\u7684A*\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a\u5355\u7ebf\u7a0bOOD\uff08ST-OOD\uff09\u3001\u5355\u7ebf\u7a0bDOD\uff08ST-DOD\uff09\u3001\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0bOOD\uff08MT-OOD\uff09\u548c\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0bDOD\uff08MT-DOD\uff09\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u5305\u62ec\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u548cCPU\u7f13\u5b58\u672a\u547d\u4e2d\u6b21\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cDOD\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u8f83\u5c11\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u7cfb\u7edf\u8c03\u7528\u548c\u7f13\u5b58\u672a\u547d\u4e2d\u3002\u5355\u7ebf\u7a0b\u7248\u672c\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u7ba1\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0b\u7248\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u53ef\u80fd\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u5fae\u5c0f\uff0c\u4f46DOD\u5728\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u52bf\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u5176\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660eDOD\u5728\u590d\u6742\u3001\u5927\u89c4\u6a21AI\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u66f4\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

This costs both memory and throughput bottleneck limiting their efficient deployment. Towards reducing KV cache size during inference, we first investigate the effectiveness of existing KV cache eviction methods for CoT reasoning. Interestingly, we find that due to unstable token-wise scoring and the reduced effective KV budget caused by padding tokens, state-of-the-art (SoTA) eviction methods fail to maintain accuracy in the multi-batch setting. Additionally, these methods often generate longer sequences than the original model, as semantic-unaware token-wise eviction leads to repeated revalidation during reasoning. To address these issues, we present \\textbf{SkipKV}, a \\textbf{\\textit{training-free}} KV compression method for selective \\textit{eviction} and \\textit{generation} operating at a coarse-grained sentence-level sequence removal for efficient CoT reasoning. In specific, it introduces a \\textit{sentence-scoring metric} to identify and remove highly similar sentences while maintaining semantic coherence. To suppress redundant generation, SkipKV dynamically adjusts a steering vector to update the hidden activation states during inference enforcing the LRM to generate concise response. Extensive evaluations on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of SkipKV in maintaining up to $\\mathbf{26.7}\\%$ improved accuracy compared to the alternatives, at a similar compression budget.

While AI-powered prediction applications offer a promising solution, they require a responsive and scalable back-end architecture to serve a large user base effectively. This paper details the development and evaluation of a scalable back-end system designed for a mobile diabetes prediction application. The primary objective was to maintain a failure rate below 5% and an average latency of under 1000 ms. The architecture leverages horizontal scaling, database sharding, and asynchronous communication via a message queue. Performance evaluation showed that 83% of the system's features (20 out of 24) met the specified performance targets. Key functionalities such as user profile management, activity tracking, and read-intensive prediction operations successfully achieved the desired performance. The system demonstrated the ability to handle up to 10,000 concurrent users without issues, validating its scalability.

Prior approaches typically rely on end-to-end training tied to a specific language or dataset, which limits their generality.

SEA leverages two pretrained models: the first to segment a video frame sequence into individual signs and the second to embed the video clip of each sign into a shared latent space with text. Alignment is subsequently performed with a lightweight dynamic programming procedure that runs efficiently on CPUs within a minute, even for hour-long episodes. SEA is flexible and can adapt to a wide range of scenarios, utilizing resources from small lexicons to large continuous corpora. Experiments on four sign language datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art alignment performance, highlighting the potential of SEA to generate high-quality parallel data for advancing sign language processing.

However, existing approaches encounter critical challenges, including imbalanced disease distributions and a lack of interpretability, resulting in biased or unreliable predictions. To address these issues, we propose the Knowledge graph-enhanced, Prototype-aware, and Interpretable (KPI) framework. KPI systematically integrates structured and trusted medical knowledge into a unified disease knowledge graph, constructs clinically meaningful disease prototypes, and employs contrastive learning to enhance predictive accuracy, which is particularly important for long-tailed diseases. Additionally, KPI utilizes large language models (LLMs) to generate patient-specific, medically relevant explanations, thereby improving interpretability and reliability. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that KPI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in predictive accuracy and provides clinically valid explanations that closely align with patient narratives, highlighting its practical value for patient-centered healthcare delivery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6KPI\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u533b\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u3001\u75be\u75c5\u539f\u578b\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u75be\u75c5\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u75be\u75c5\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u75be\u75c5\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u6709\u504f\u6216\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "method": "KPI\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u533b\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u6784\u5efa\u75be\u75c5\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u75be\u75c5\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u533b\u5b66\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cKPI\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0e\u60a3\u8005\u53d9\u8ff0\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "KPI\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5728\u60a3\u8005\u4e2d\u5fc3\u533b\u7597\u4e2d\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Previous works usually find such suffixes with gradient search or rule-based methods, but these are brittle and often tied to a single task or model. In this paper, a reinforcement learning framework is used where the suffix is treated as a policy and trained with Proximal Policy Optimization against a frozen model as a reward oracle. Rewards are shaped using calibrated cross-entropy, removing label bias and aggregating across surface forms to improve transferability. The proposed method is evaluated on five diverse NLP benchmark datasets, covering sentiment, natural language inference, paraphrase, and commonsense reasoning, using three distinct language models: Qwen2-1.5B Instruct, TinyLlama-1.1B Chat, and Phi-1.5.

Despite this widespread adoption, the principles that determine their performance remain underexplored, leaving practitioners to rely on heuristics rather than principled design choices. We address this gap by deriving quantitative scaling principles for agent systems. We evaluate this across four diverse benchmarks: Finance-Agent, BrowseComp-Plus, PlanCraft, and Workbench. Using five canonical architectures (Single, Independent, Centralized, Decentralized, Hybrid) instantiated across three LLM families, we perform a controlled evaluation spanning 180 configurations with standardized tools and token budgets. We derive a predictive model using empirical coordination metrics, including efficiency, overhead, error amplification, and redundancy, that achieves cross-validated R^2=0.513. We identify three dominant effects: (1) a tool-coordination trade-off: under fixed computational budgets, tool-heavy tasks suffer disproportionately from multi-agent overhead. (2) a capability saturation: coordination yields diminishing or negative returns (beta=-0.408, p<0.001) once single-agent baselines exceed ~45%. (3) topology-dependent error amplification: independent agents amplify errors 17.2x through unchecked propagation, while centralized coordination contains this to 4.4x. Centralized coordination improves performance by 80.9% on parallelizable tasks like financial reasoning, while decentralized coordination excels on dynamic web navigation (+9.2% vs. +0.2%). Yet for sequential reasoning tasks, all multi-agent variants degraded performance by 39-70%. The framework predicts the optimal coordination strategy for 87% of held-out configurations, providing a predictive principle of agentic scaling based on measurable task properties.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6269\u5c55\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5df2\u6210\u4e3aAI\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u4e3b\u6d41\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u5f80\u5f80\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u800c\u975e\u539f\u5219\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08Finance-Agent, BrowseComp-Plus, PlanCraft, Workbench\uff09\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e94\u79cd\u5178\u578b\u67b6\u6784\uff08Single, Independent, Centralized, Decentralized, Hybrid\uff09\u548c\u4e09\u4e2aLLM\u5bb6\u65cf\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86180\u79cd\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6548\u7387\u3001\u5f00\u9500\u3001\u8bef\u5dee\u653e\u5927\u548c\u5197\u4f59\u7b49\u5b9e\u8bc1\u534f\u8c03\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "1. \u5de5\u5177-\u534f\u8c03\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u56fa\u5b9a\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\uff0c\u5de5\u5177\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u66f4\u6613\u53d7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f00\u9500\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b2. \u80fd\u529b\u9971\u548c\uff1a\u5f53\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u57fa\u7ebf\u8d85\u8fc7\u7ea645%\u65f6\uff0c\u534f\u8c03\u6536\u76ca\u9012\u51cf\u6216\u53d8\u4e3a\u8d1f\u503c\uff1b3. \u62d3\u6251\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u653e\u5927\uff1a\u72ec\u7acb\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bef\u5dee\u653e\u592717.2\u500d\uff0c\u800c\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u534f\u8c03\u9650\u5236\u4e3a4.4\u500d\u3002\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u534f\u8c03\u5728\u5e76\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd80.9%\uff0c\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u534f\u8c03\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u7f51\u9875\u5bfc\u822a\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b87%\u7684\u7559\u51fa\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u534f\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u6027\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6269\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u539f\u5219\u3002"}}

Yet, research in this area has been limited in relation to a manifested problem in these models: gender bias. With this research, we aim to move away from simply measuring bias to exploring its origins. Working with gender-ambiguous natural source data, this study examines which context, in the form of input tokens in the source sentence, influences (or triggers) the translation model choice of a certain gender inflection in the target language. To analyse this, we use contrastive explanations and compute saliency attribution. We first address the challenge of a lacking scoring threshold and specifically examine different attribution levels of source words on the model gender decisions in the translation. We compare salient source words with human perceptions of gender and demonstrate a noticeable overlap between human perceptions and model attribution. Additionally, we provide a linguistic analysis of salient words.

Accepted to the ACL ARR July", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are post-trained through reinforcement learning (RL) to evolve into Reasoning Language Models (RLMs), where the hallmark of this advanced reasoning is ``aha'' moments when they start to perform strategies, such as self-reflection and deep thinking, within chain of thoughts (CoTs). Motivated by this, this paper proposes a novel reinforced strategy injection mechanism (rSIM), that enables any LLM to become an RLM by employing a small planner to guide the LLM's CoT through the adaptive injection of reasoning strategies. To achieve this, the planner (leader agent) is jointly trained with an LLM (follower agent) using multi-agent RL (MARL), based on a leader-follower framework and straightforward rule-based rewards. Experimental results show that rSIM enables Qwen2.5-0.5B to become an RLM and significantly outperform Qwen2.5-14B. Moreover, the planner is generalizable: it only needs to be trained once and can be applied as a plug-in to substantially improve the reasoning capabilities of existing LLMs. In addition, the planner supports continual learning across various tasks, allowing its planning abilities to gradually improve and generalize to a wider range of problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u6ce8\u5165\u673a\u5236\uff08rSIM\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u578b\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6ce8\u5165\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5c06\u5176\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08RLM\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u5316\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u2018\u987f\u609f\u2019\u65f6\u523b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd9\u542f\u53d1\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u4efb\u4f55\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u90fd\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u5165\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u6210\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51farSIM\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9886\u5bfc\u8005-\u8ffd\u968f\u8005\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u578b\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff08\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\uff09\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u8ffd\u968f\u8005\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u3002", "result": "rSIM\u4f7fQwen2.5-0.5B\u6210\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eQwen2.5-14B\u3002\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53ea\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u6b21\u5373\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63d2\u4ef6\u63d0\u5347\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "conclusion": "rSIM\u673a\u5236\u901a\u8fc7\u5c0f\u578b\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u6ce8\u5165\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

(English translation assisted by GPT)", "summary": "Recent incidents in certain online games and communities, where anonymity is guaranteed, show that unchecked inappropriate remarks frequently escalate into verbal abuse and even criminal behavior, raising significant social concerns. Consequently, there is a growing need for research on techniques that can detect inappropriate utterances within conversational texts to help build a safer communication environment. Although large-scale language models trained on Korean corpora and chain-of-thought reasoning have recently gained attention, research applying these approaches to inappropriate utterance detection remains limited. In this study, we propose a soft inductive bias approach that explicitly defines reasoning perspectives to guide the inference process, thereby promoting rational decision-making and preventing errors that may arise during reasoning. We fine-tune a Korean large language model using the proposed method and conduct both quantitative performance comparisons and qualitative evaluations across different training strategies. Experimental results show that the Kanana-1.5 model achieves an average accuracy of 87.0046, improving by approximately 3.89 percent over standard supervised learning. These findings indicate that the proposed method goes beyond simple knowledge imitation by large language models and enables more precise and consistent judgments through constrained reasoning perspectives, demonstrating its effectiveness for inappropriate utterance detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8f6f\u6027\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u660e\u786e\u63a8\u7406\u89c6\u89d2\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u97e9\u8bed\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u5f53\u8a00\u8bba\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u533f\u540d\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4e0d\u5f53\u8a00\u8bba\u9891\u53d1\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u68c0\u6d4b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5f53\u8a00\u8bba\u7684\u6280\u672f\u4ee5\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u4ea4\u6d41\u73af\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8f6f\u6027\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u63a8\u7406\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u97e9\u8bed\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u91cf\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "Kanana-1.5\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523087.0046\uff0c\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7ea63.89%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u63a8\u7406\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u4f7f\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e0d\u5f53\u8a00\u8bba\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Traditional CBR determination relies on laboratory penetration tests. Despite their accuracy, these tests are often time-consuming, costly, and can be impractical, particularly for large-scale or diverse soil profiles. Recent progress in artificial intelligence, especially machine learning (ML), has enabled data-driven approaches for modeling complex soil behavior with greater speed and precision. This study introduces a comprehensive ML framework for CBR prediction using a dataset of 382 soil samples collected from various geoclimatic regions in T\u00fcrkiye. The dataset includes physicochemical soil properties relevant to bearing capacity, allowing multidimensional feature representation in a supervised learning context. Twelve ML algorithms were tested, including decision tree, random forest, extra trees, gradient boosting, xgboost, k-nearest neighbors, support vector regression, multi-layer perceptron, adaboost, bagging, voting, and stacking regressors. Each model was trained, validated, and evaluated to assess its generalization and robustness. Among them, the random forest regressor performed the best, achieving strong R2 scores of 0.95 (training), 0.76 (validation), and 0.83 (test). These outcomes highlight the model's powerful nonlinear mapping ability, making it a promising tool for predictive geotechnical tasks.

Traditional methods for determining optimum moisture content (OMC) and maximum dry density (MDD) involve labor-intensive laboratory experiments, and empirical regression models have limited applicability and accuracy across diverse soil types. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques have emerged as alternatives for predicting these compaction parameters. However, ML models often struggle with prediction accuracy and generalizability, particularly with heterogeneous datasets representing various soil types. This study proposes an automated machine learning (AutoML) approach to predict OMC and MDD. AutoML automates algorithm selection and hyperparameter optimization, potentially improving accuracy and scalability. Through extensive experimentation, the study found that the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm provided the best performance, achieving R-squared values of 80.4% for MDD and 89.1% for OMC on a separate dataset. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoML in predicting compaction parameters across different soil types.

In light of this, the goal of this tutorial is to provide an introductory overview of the most important sub-areas of a patient- and resource-oriented HealthcareNLP, with three layers of hierarchy: data/resource layer: annotation guidelines, ethical approvals, governance, synthetic data; NLP-Eval layer: NLP tasks such as NER, RE, sentiment analysis, and linking/coding with categorised methods, leading to explainable HealthAI; patients layer: Patient Public Involvement and Engagement (PPIE), health literacy, translation, simplification, and summarisation (also NLP tasks), and shared decision-making support. A hands-on session will be included in the tutorial for the audience to use HealthcareNLP applications. The target audience includes NLP practitioners in the healthcare application domain, NLP researchers who are interested in domain applications, healthcare researchers, and students from NLP fields. The type of tutorial is \"Introductory to CL/NLP topics (HealthcareNLP)\" and the audience does not need prior knowledge to attend this.

The dataset comprises 3,200 essays from HABE, each annotated by expert evaluators with criterion specific scores covering correctness, richness, coherence, cohesion, and task alignment enriched with detailed feedback and error examples. We fine-tune open-source models, including RoBERTa-EusCrawl and Latxa 8B/70B, for both scoring and explanation generation. Our experiments show that encoder models remain highly reliable for AES, while supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of Latxa significantly enhances performance, surpassing state-of-the-art (SoTA) closed-source systems such as GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet 4.5 in scoring consistency and feedback quality. We also propose a novel evaluation methodology for assessing feedback generation, combining automatic consistency metrics with expert-based validation of extracted learner errors. Results demonstrate that the fine-tuned Latxa model produces criterion-aligned, pedagogically meaningful feedback and identifies a wider range of error types than proprietary models.

Machine learning models used in these applications often rely on features extracted from biosignals due to their effectiveness, lower data dimensionality, and wide compatibility across various model architectures. However, existing feature extraction methods often lack task-specific contextual knowledge, struggle to identify optimal feature extraction settings in high-dimensional feature space, and are prone to code generation and automation errors. In this paper, we propose DeepFeature, the first LLM-empowered, context-aware feature generation framework for wearable biosignals. DeepFeature introduces a multi-source feature generation mechanism that integrates expert knowledge with task settings. It also employs an iterative feature refinement process that uses feature assessment-based feedback for feature re-selection. Additionally, DeepFeature utilizes a robust multi-layer filtering and verification approach for robust feature-to-code translation to ensure that the extraction functions run without crashing. Experimental evaluation results show that DeepFeature achieves an average AUROC improvement of 4.21-9.67% across eight diverse tasks compared to baseline methods.

Preference-optimization is now a well-researched topic, but previous work has mostly addressed models for English and Chinese. Lower-resource languages lack both datasets written by native speakers and language models capable of generating fluent synthetic data. Thus, in this work, we focus on developing a fluent preference-aligned language model without any instruction-tuning data in the target language.

We introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework that systematically assesses the trade-off between alignment quality and fairness when using different aggregation strategies for human preferences. In our federated setting, each group locally evaluates rollouts and produces reward signals, and the server aggregates these group-level rewards without accessing any raw data. Specifically, we evaluate standard reward aggregation techniques (min, max, and average) and introduce a novel adaptive scheme that dynamically adjusts preference weights based on a group's historical alignment performance. Our experiments on question-answering (Q/A) tasks using a PPO-based RLHF pipeline demonstrate that our adaptive approach consistently achieves superior fairness while maintaining competitive alignment scores.

To study the process of skill acquisition under fully controlled conditions, we bypass human subjects. Instead, we directly interface a generalist reinforcement learning agent with a spinning cylinder in a tabletop circulating water channel to maximize or minimize drag. This setup has several desirable properties. First, it is a physical system, with the rich interactions and complex dynamics that only the physical world has: the flow is highly chaotic and extremely difficult, if not impossible, to model or simulate accurately. Second, the objective -- drag minimization or maximization -- is easy to state and can be captured directly in the reward, yet good strategies are not obvious beforehand. Third, decades-old experimental studies provide recipes for simple, high-performance open-loop policies. Finally, the setup is inexpensive and far easier to reproduce than human studies. In our experiments we find that high-dimensional flow feedback lets the agent discover high-performance drag-control strategies with only minutes of real-world interaction. When we later replay the same action sequences without any feedback, we obtain almost identical performance. This shows that feedback, and in particular flow feedback, is not needed to execute the learned policy. Surprisingly, without flow feedback during training the agent fails to discover any well-performing policy in drag maximization, but still succeeds in drag minimization, albeit more slowly and less reliably. Our studies show that learning a high-performance skill can require richer information than executing it, and learning conditions can be kind or wicked depending solely on the goal, not on dynamics or policy complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Using depth-wise analyses, we demonstrate that growth via gradual middle stacking yields more effective utilization of model depth, alters the residual stream structure, and facilitates the formation of permutable computational blocks.

Existing hallucination detection methods for RAG often rely either on large-scale detector training, which requires substantial annotated data, or on querying external LLM judges, which leads to high inference costs. Although some approaches attempt to leverage internal representations of LLMs for hallucination detection, their accuracy remains limited. Motivated by recent advances in mechanistic interpretability, we employ sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to disentangle internal activations, successfully identifying features that are specifically triggered during RAG hallucinations. Building on a systematic pipeline of information-based feature selection and additive feature modeling, we introduce RAGLens, a lightweight hallucination detector that accurately flags unfaithful RAG outputs using LLM internal representations. RAGLens not only achieves superior detection performance compared to existing methods, but also provides interpretable rationales for its decisions, enabling effective post-hoc mitigation of unfaithful RAG.

Unlike traditional single model prompting, agentic workflows integrate multiple specialized agents with different Large Language Models(LLMs), tool-augmented capabilities, orchestration logic, and external system interactions to form dynamic pipelines capable of autonomous decision-making and action. As adoption accelerates across industry and research, organizations face a central challenge: how to design, engineer, and operate production-grade agentic AI workflows that are reliable, observable, maintainable, and aligned with safety and governance requirements. This paper provides a practical, end-to-end guide for designing, developing, and deploying production-quality agentic AI systems. We introduce a structured engineering lifecycle encompassing workflow decomposition, multi-agent design patterns, Model Context Protocol(MCP), and tool integration, deterministic orchestration, Responsible-AI considerations, and environment-aware deployment strategies. We then present nine core best practices for engineering production-grade agentic AI workflows, including tool-first design over MCP, pure-function invocation, single-tool and single-responsibility agents, externalized prompt management, Responsible-AI-aligned model-consortium design, clean separation between workflow logic and MCP servers, containerized deployment for scalable operations, and adherence to the Keep it Simple, Stupid (KISS) principle to maintain simplicity and robustness. To demonstrate these principles in practice, we present a comprehensive case study: a multimodal news-analysis and media-generation workflow. By combining architectural guidance, operational patterns, and practical implementation insights, this paper offers a foundational reference to build robust, extensible, and production-ready agentic AI workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u4e8e\u5982\u4f55\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u751f\u4ea7\u7ea7Agentic AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5de5\u7a0b\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u548c\u4e5d\u9879\u6838\u5fc3\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002", "motivation": "Agentic AI\u5728\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u6267\u884c\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u4efb\u52a1\u65b9\u9762\u6807\u5fd7\u7740\u91cd\u5927\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u9762\u4e34\u5982\u4f55\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u3001\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u4e14\u7b26\u5408\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u7ea7Agentic AI\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5de5\u7a0b\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5206\u89e3\u3001\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u534f\u8bae\uff08MCP\uff09\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6210\u3001\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7f16\u6392\u3001\u8d23\u4efbAI\u8003\u8651\u4ee5\u53ca\u73af\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u90e8\u7f72\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e5d\u9879\u6838\u5fc3\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b0\u95fb\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5a92\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u539f\u5219\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u67b6\u6784\u6307\u5bfc\u3001\u64cd\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5b9e\u65bd\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u751f\u4ea7\u5c31\u7eea\u7684Agentic AI\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

Existing discovery methods depend on unreliable user descriptions or biased popularity metrics, hindering usability. We present CARLoS, a large-scale framework for characterizing LoRAs without requiring additional metadata. Analyzing over 650 LoRAs, we employ them in image generation over a variety of prompts and seeds, as a credible way to assess their behavior. Using CLIP embeddings and their difference to a base-model generation, we concisely define a three-part representation: Directions, defining semantic shift; Strength, quantifying the significance of the effect; and Consistency, quantifying how stable the effect is. Using these representations, we develop an efficient retrieval framework that semantically matches textual queries to relevant LoRAs while filtering overly strong or unstable ones, outperforming textual baselines in automated and human evaluations. While retrieval is our primary focus, the same representation also supports analyses linking Strength and Consistency to legal notions of substantiality and volition, key considerations in copyright, positioning CARLoS as a practical system with broader relevance for LoRA analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "CARLoS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u68c0\u7d22LoRAs\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790650\u591a\u4e2aLoRAs\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u5143\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u8868\u5f81LoRAs\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684LoRAs\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7528\u6237\u63cf\u8ff0\u6216\u6709\u504f\u7684\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8868\u5f81\u548c\u68c0\u7d22LoRAs\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u79cd\u5b50\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30LoRAs\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528CLIP\u5d4c\u5165\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u90e8\u5206\u8868\u793a\uff1a\u65b9\u5411\uff08Directions\uff09\u3001\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff08Strength\uff09\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08Consistency\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6839\u636e\u6587\u672c\u67e5\u8be2\u8bed\u4e49\u5339\u914d\u76f8\u5173\u7684LoRAs\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "CARLoS\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u7684LoRAs\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5206\u6790\u652f\u6301\u4e0e\u7248\u6743\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684LoRAs\u5206\u6790\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Preprint", "summary": "We introduce two new benchmarks REST and REST+(Render-Equivalence Stress Tests) to enable systematic evaluation of cross-modal inconsistency in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). MLLMs are trained to represent vision and language in the same embedding space, yet they cannot perform the same tasks in both modalities. Our benchmarks contain samples with the same semantic information in three modalities (image, text, mixed) and we show that state-of-the-art MLLMs cannot consistently reason over these different modalities. We evaluate 15 MLLMs and find that the degree of modality inconsistency varies substantially, even when accounting for problems with text recognition (OCR). Neither rendering text as image nor rendering an image as text solves the inconsistency. Even if OCR is correct, we find that visual characteristics (text colour and resolution, but not font) and the number of vision tokens have an impact on model performance. Finally, we find that our consistency score correlates with the modality gap between text and images, highlighting a mechanistic interpretation of cross-modal inconsistent MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5REST\u548cREST+\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "MLLMs\u88ab\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e3a\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u4e2d\u4e0d\u80fd\u6267\u884c\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\uff08\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u6587\u672c\u3001\u6df7\u5408\uff09\u6837\u672c\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8615\u4e2aMLLMs\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u4e0a\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u6587\u672c\u989c\u8272\u548c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff09\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5206\u6570\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u8ddd\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86MLLMs\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u91ca\u3002"}}
