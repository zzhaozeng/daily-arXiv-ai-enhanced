We then\nstress-test deliberative alignment as a case study for anti-scheming. Across 26\nOOD evaluations (180+ environments), deliberative alignment reduces covert\naction rates (OpenAI o3: 13%->0.4%) but does not fully eliminate them.

In this paper, we investigated the adaptation via fine-tuning\nprocess of a non-domain-specific abstractive summarisation encoder-decoder\nmodel family, and gave insights to practitioners on how to avoid over- and\nunderfitting. We used PEGASUS and PEGASUS-X, on a medium-sized radiological\nreports public dataset. For each model, we comprehensively evaluated two\ndifferent checkpoints with varying sizes of the same training data. We\nmonitored the models' performances with lexical and semantic metrics during the\ntraining history on the fixed-size validation set. PEGASUS exhibited different\nphases, which can be related to epoch-wise double-descent, or\npeak-drop-recovery behaviour. For PEGASUS-X, we found that using a larger\ncheckpoint led to a performance detriment. This work highlights the challenges\nand risks of fine-tuning models with high expressivity when dealing with scarce\ntraining data, and lays the groundwork for future investigations into more\nrobust fine-tuning strategies for summarisation models in specialised domains."}

Two pre-training objectives dominate\nthe landscape of SSL techniques: Contrastive Learning and Masked Image\nModeling. Features (or tokens) extracted from the final transformer attention\nblock -- specifically, the keys, queries, and values -- as well as features\nobtained after the final block's feed-forward layer, have become a common\nfoundation for addressing downstream tasks. However, in many existing\napproaches, these pre-trained ViT features are further processed through\nadditional transformation layers, often involving lightweight heads or combined\nwith distillation, to achieve superior task performance. Although such methods\ncan improve task outcomes, to the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive\nanalysis of the intrinsic representation capabilities of unaltered ViT features\nhas yet to be conducted. This study aims to bridge this gap by systematically\nevaluating the use of these unmodified features across image classification and\nsegmentation tasks, in both standard and few-shot contexts. The classification\nand segmentation rules that we use are either hyperplane based (as in logistic\nregression) or cosine-similarity based, both of which rely on the presence of\ninterpretable directions in the ViT's latent space. Based on the previous rules\nand without the use of additional feature transformations, we conduct an\nanalysis across token types, tasks, and pre-trained ViT models. This study\nprovides insights into the optimal choice for token type and decision rule\nbased on the task, context, and the pre-training objective, while reporting\ndetailed findings on two widely-used datasets."}

However, existing pruning-based approaches\noften fall short in accurately identifying and removing the specific parameters\nresponsible for inducing backdoor behaviors. Despite the dominance of\nfine-tuning-based defenses in recent literature, largely due to their superior\nperformance, pruning remains a compelling alternative, offering greater\ninterpretability and improved robustness in low-data regimes. In this paper, we\npropose a novel pruning approach featuring a learned \\emph{selection} mechanism\nto identify parameters critical to both main and backdoor tasks, along with an\n\\emph{invertible} pruning mask designed to simultaneously achieve two\ncomplementary goals: eliminating the backdoor task while preserving it through\nthe inverse mask. We formulate this as a bi-level optimization problem that\njointly learns selection variables, a sparse invertible mask, and\nsample-specific backdoor perturbations derived from clean data. The inner\nproblem synthesizes candidate triggers using the inverse mask, while the outer\nproblem refines the mask to suppress backdoor behavior without impairing\nclean-task accuracy.

To address these limitations, we\npropose GS-Scale, a fast and memory-efficient training system for 3D Gaussian\nSplatting. GS-Scale stores all Gaussians in host memory, transferring only a\nsubset to the GPU on demand for each forward and backward pass. While this\ndramatically reduces GPU memory usage, it requires frustum culling and\noptimizer updates to be executed on the CPU, introducing slowdowns due to CPU's\nlimited compute and memory bandwidth. To mitigate this, GS-Scale employs three\nsystem-level optimizations: (1) selective offloading of geometric parameters\nfor fast frustum culling, (2) parameter forwarding to pipeline CPU optimizer\nupdates with GPU computation, and (3) deferred optimizer update to minimize\nunnecessary memory accesses for Gaussians with zero gradients.

Through exhaustive experimental analysis, this\npaper aims to provide a clear ``recipe'' for constructing high-performance\nMRMs. We systematically investigate every crucial component in the MRM\ndevelopment pipeline, including \\textit{reward modeling paradigms} (e.g.,\nNaive-RM, Critic-based RM, and Generative RM), \\textit{reward head\narchitecture}, \\textit{training strategies}, \\textit{data curation} (covering\nover ten multimodal and text-only preference datasets), \\textit{backbone model}\nand \\textit{model scale}, and \\textit{ensemble methods}.\n  Based on these experimental insights, we introduce \\textbf{BaseReward}, a\npowerful and efficient baseline for multimodal reward modeling. BaseReward\nadopts a simple yet effective architecture, built upon a {Qwen2.5-VL} backbone,\nfeaturing an optimized two-layer reward head, and is trained on a carefully\ncurated mixture of high-quality multimodal and text-only preference data. Our\nresults show that BaseReward establishes a new SOTA on major benchmarks such as\nMM-RLHF-Reward Bench, VL-Reward Bench, and Multimodal Reward Bench,\noutperforming previous models. Furthermore, to validate its practical utility\nbeyond static benchmarks, we integrate BaseReward into a real-world\nreinforcement learning pipeline, successfully enhancing an MLLM's performance\nacross various perception, reasoning, and conversational tasks. This work not\nonly delivers a top-tier MRM but, more importantly, provides the community with\na clear, empirically-backed guide for developing robust reward models for the\nnext generation of MLLMs."}

This time-of-flight data encodes\nrich scene information and thus enables recovery of simple scenes from sparse\nmeasurements. We investigate the feasibility of using a distributed set of few\nmeasurements (e.g., as few as 15 pixels) to recover the geometry of simple\nparametric scenes with a strong prior, such as estimating the 6D pose of a\nknown object. To achieve this, we design a method that utilizes both\nfeed-forward prediction to infer scene parameters, and differentiable rendering\nwithin an analysis-by-synthesis framework to refine the scene parameter\nestimate. We develop hardware prototypes and demonstrate that our method\neffectively recovers object pose given an untextured 3D model in both\nsimulations and controlled real-world captures, and show promising initial\nresults for other parametric scenes.

Our key observation in this work is that T2I models\nfrequently struggle to capture nuanced and often implicit attributes inherent\nin action depiction, leading to generating images that lack key contextual\ndetails. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce AcT2I, a benchmark\ndesigned to evaluate the performance of T2I models in generating images from\naction-centric prompts. We experimentally validate that leading T2I models do\nnot fare well on AcT2I. We further hypothesize that this shortcoming arises\nfrom the incomplete representation of the inherent attributes and contextual\ndependencies in the training corpora of existing T2I models. We build upon this\nby developing a training-free, knowledge distillation technique utilizing Large\nLanguage Models to address this limitation. Specifically, we enhance prompts by\nincorporating dense information across three dimensions, observing that\ninjecting prompts with temporal details significantly improves image generation\naccuracy, with our best model achieving an increase of 72%. Our findings\nhighlight the limitations of current T2I methods in generating images that\nrequire complex reasoning and demonstrate that integrating linguistic knowledge\nin a systematic way can notably advance the generation of nuanced and\ncontextually accurate images."}

However, we\nobserve that MLLMs exhibit a pronounced form of visual sycophantic behavior.\nWhile similar behavior has also been noted in text-based large language models\n(LLMs), it becomes significantly more prominent when MLLMs process image\ninputs. We refer to this phenomenon as the \"sycophantic modality gap.\" To\nbetter understand this issue, we further analyze the factors that contribute to\nthe exacerbation of this gap. To mitigate the visual sycophantic behavior, we\nfirst experiment with naive supervised fine-tuning to help the MLLM resist\nmisleading instructions from the user. However, we find that this approach also\nmakes the MLLM overly resistant to corrective instructions (i.e., stubborn even\nif it is wrong). To alleviate this trade-off, we propose Sycophantic Reflective\nTuning (SRT), which enables the MLLM to engage in reflective reasoning,\nallowing it to determine whether a user's instruction is misleading or\ncorrective before drawing a conclusion. After applying SRT, we observe a\nsignificant reduction in sycophantic behavior toward misleading instructions,\nwithout resulting in excessive stubbornness when receiving corrective\ninstructions."}

In this work, we propose a unified\nmodality-relax segmentation network (UniMRSeg) through hierarchical\nself-supervised compensation (HSSC). Our approach hierarchically bridges\nrepresentation gaps between complete and incomplete modalities across input,\nfeature and output levels. % First, we adopt modality reconstruction with the\nhybrid shuffled-masking augmentation, encouraging the model to learn the\nintrinsic modality characteristics and generate meaningful representations for\nmissing modalities through cross-modal fusion. % Next, modality-invariant\ncontrastive learning implicitly compensates the feature space distance among\nincomplete-complete modality pairs. Furthermore, the proposed lightweight\nreverse attention adapter explicitly compensates for the weak perceptual\nsemantics in the frozen encoder. Last, UniMRSeg is fine-tuned under the hybrid\nconsistency constraint to ensure stable prediction under all modality\ncombinations without large performance fluctuations. Without bells and\nwhistles, UniMRSeg significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under\ndiverse missing modality scenarios on MRI-based brain tumor segmentation, RGB-D\nsemantic segmentation, RGB-D/T salient object segmentation.
