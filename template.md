5. Go to Variables. Variables are shown as plain text and are used for non-sensitive data
6. Create the following repository variables:
   1. `CATEGORIES`: separate the categories with ",", such as "cs.CL, cs.CV"
   2. `LANGUAGE`: such as "Chinese" or "English"
   3. `MODEL_NAME`: such as "deepseek-chat"
   4. `EMAIL`: your email for push to github
